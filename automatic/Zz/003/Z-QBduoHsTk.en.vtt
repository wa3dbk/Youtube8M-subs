00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.230 
here then the back button of course
would<00:02:19.270> go<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.780> your<00:02:20.080> other<00:02:20.590> jack<00:02:21.130> because<00:02:22.120> you

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
would go to your other jack because you

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.360 
would go to your other jack because you
have<00:02:22.330> two<00:02:22.600> ities<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.200> then<00:02:24.070> you<00:02:24.190> would<00:02:24.340> put

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
have two ities and then you would put

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.820 
have two ities and then you would put
that<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:25.180> your<00:02:25.360> pin<00:02:25.870> 1<00:02:27.690> now<00:02:28.690> right<00:02:29.170> here<00:02:29.620> you

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
that to your pin 1 now right here you

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.500 
that to your pin 1 now right here you
can<00:02:30.130> see<00:02:30.490> a<00:02:30.790> little<00:02:31.090> solder<00:02:31.450> joint<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:33.510> it's

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
can see a little solder joint and it's

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.490 
can see a little solder joint and it's
labeled<00:02:34.780> here<00:02:35.170> ground<00:02:35.760> you're<00:02:36.760> gonna<00:02:36.970> solder

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
labeled here ground you're gonna solder

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.130 
labeled here ground you're gonna solder
both<00:02:38.500> ground<00:02:39.340> wires<00:02:39.700> right<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:40.600> terminal

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
both ground wires right to this terminal

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.300 
both ground wires right to this terminal
and<00:02:42.720> then<00:02:43.720> you're<00:02:43.870> going<00:02:44.020> to<00:02:44.110> solder<00:02:44.410> one<00:02:45.160> of

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
and then you're going to solder one of

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.670 
and then you're going to solder one of
the<00:02:45.400> ground<00:02:45.640> wires<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.209> pin<00:02:46.450> two<00:02:46.780> on<00:02:47.110> the
