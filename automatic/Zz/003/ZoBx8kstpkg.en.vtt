00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
I guess just can be showing you how to

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.310 
I guess just can be showing you how to
create<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.259> tentacle<00:00:07.740> effect<00:00:08.010> in<00:00:08.160> cinema<00:00:08.519> 4d

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
create a tentacle effect in cinema 4d

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.240 
create a tentacle effect in cinema 4d
first<00:00:10.320> off<00:00:10.500> you<00:00:10.650> have<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.830> download<00:00:11.010> the

first off you have to download the

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.089 
first off you have to download the
plug-in<00:00:11.460> Carolla<00:00:11.969> one<00:00:12.679> I'll<00:00:13.679> leave<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.009> down

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
plug-in Carolla one I'll leave it down

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.430 
plug-in Carolla one I'll leave it down
on<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.280> link<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.639> description<00:00:15.320> so<00:00:16.320> what

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
on the link in the description so what

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.140 
on the link in the description so what
you<00:00:16.560> want<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.740> do<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.279> go<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.580> your<00:00:17.670> spline

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
you want to do is you go to your spline

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.950 
you want to do is you go to your spline
create<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> circle<00:00:20.390> make<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.539> radius<00:00:22.400> 15

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
create a circle make the radius 15

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.259 
create a circle make the radius 15
centimeters<00:00:27.170> and<00:00:28.490> then<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.730> want<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.029> give<00:00:30.179> it

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
centimeters and then you want to give it

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.319 
centimeters and then you want to give it
a<00:00:30.330> plugins<00:00:31.289> chrome<00:00:34.250> do<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.850> then<00:00:36.180> you

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
a plugins chrome do that and then you

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.389 
a plugins chrome do that and then you
want<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:39.020> go<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.079> mesh<00:00:41.239> now<00:00:42.440> spline<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:44.250> you

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
want to go to mesh now spline and you

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.979 
want to go to mesh now spline and you
want<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.670> go<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> kill<00:00:45.210> small<00:00:45.539> you're<00:00:45.899> either

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
want to go to kill small you're either

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.979 
want to go to kill small you're either
all<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.680> way<00:00:46.829> up<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:49.550> basically<00:00:50.550> that

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
all the way up and basically that

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.100 
all the way up and basically that
shortens<00:00:51.989> your<00:00:52.199> supplied<00:00:53.239> we<00:00:54.239> want<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.629> go<00:00:54.780> to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
shortens your supplied we want to go to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.299 
shortens your supplied we want to go to
mesh<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:56.780> it<00:00:57.780> says<00:00:58.020> probe<00:00:58.320> last<00:00:58.590> one<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.160> can

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
mesh and it says probe last one you can

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.779 
mesh and it says probe last one you can
click<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.699> you<00:01:00.059> can<00:01:00.090> click<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.570> your<00:01:00.690> circle

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
click that you can click on your circle

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:08.000 
click that you can click on your circle
as<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.539> makes<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:06.380> kind<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.470> cool

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
as you can see it makes the kind of cool

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.590 
as you can see it makes the kind of cool
tentacle<00:01:08.490> effect<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:10.880> here<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.210> resize

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
tentacle effect and here you can resize

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.060 
tentacle effect and here you can resize
this<00:01:14.330> account<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.810> want<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:19.070> when

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
this account that you want and the when

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.859 
this account that you want and the when
you<00:01:20.159> resize<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.850> diameter<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> circle

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
you resize it the diameter of the circle

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.719 
you resize it the diameter of the circle
doesn't<00:01:22.320> change<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.340> go<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
doesn't change so you have to go in and

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.990 
doesn't change so you have to go in and
then<00:01:23.880> we'll<00:01:24.060> do<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:25.369> but<00:01:27.950> yeah<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.790> just

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
then we'll do that but yeah this is just

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.940 
then we'll do that but yeah this is just
a<00:01:30.150> really<00:01:30.420> cool<00:01:30.630> effect<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.470> and

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:41.230 

it<00:01:34.950> looks<00:01:35.280> really<00:01:35.790> nice<00:01:36.150> there's<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.140> stuff

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.010 

and<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:44.700> change<00:01:44.909> how<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.180> tentacle<00:01:45.689> itself

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
and to change how the tentacle itself

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.240 
and to change how the tentacle itself
looks<00:01:46.520> we'll<00:01:47.520> go<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> Chrome<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.439> spline<00:01:49.439> and

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
looks we'll go to Chrome on spline and

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.370 
looks we'll go to Chrome on spline and
you<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.060> change<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.479> seat<00:01:51.720> until<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.140> find

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
you can change the seat until you find

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.340 
you can change the seat until you find
something<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.799> like

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.959

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
with some of the small ones

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:14.309 
with some of the small ones
something<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.619> that'll<00:02:04.890> be<00:02:04.979> good
