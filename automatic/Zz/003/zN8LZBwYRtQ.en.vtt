00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.610
 m 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.540
 hello to all so today we're going 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.310
 see how to make up for a weak point 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.660
 so here we go see what it is 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.670
 definition of a real such point because 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.230
 often people train very poorly 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.570
 as we saw together in various 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.130
 videos sound anything and say I 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.990
 do not understand I do not take arms I 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.610
 do not take pecs I'll come back 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.810
 the whole body which is a weak point and 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.940
 we will start from the premise that the whole 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.350
 world is training well that everyone 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.510
 is not beginner it's obviously 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.890
 when we start it's normal to 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.059
 progress little by little and we do not know 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.770
 not yet what are his real points 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.570
 weak we can have muscles 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.550
 who are short at the base who are not 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.780
 not planned to develop well in 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.399
 theory and then who are going anyway 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.559
 benefited from the training and well 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.100
 develop so how to catch a 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.600
 weakness 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.239
 we will take into account that you 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.200
 are not beginners and who you know 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.520
 you're training does not matter to you 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.810
 what is to say you do the right ones 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.390
 exercises for the right muscles in 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.580
 function of your morphology of what 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.110
 you wish decided to work and 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.840
 so that's the good there are six recalls 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.520
 little new passage that I speak 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.320
 in my island book rudy knows sir 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.509
 takes tom muscle number one for those 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.610
 that it interests with the notion of the r6 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.500
 magic so weak points 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.570
 the real problem is the muscle that 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.850
 despite our efforts despite the good choice of 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.619
 yesterday 6 despite a progression is not 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.079
 does not degrade other countries 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.630
 muscles that develops following 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.210
 our progression on the bars that this 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.280
 either job in rehearsal so the real ones 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.329
 problems does not react and in fact he has 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.780
 struggling to contract 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.430
 it is difficult to get priority 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.649
 so for that so that the low weight 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.149
 at an agency no longer come a point 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.250
 weak he'll have to teach him how to 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.469
 to contract and for that there is 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.899
 several techniques that most of the 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:02.680
 time I do not recommend it as 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.369
 example the super 7 that will allow 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.930
 we will take a very simple example 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.880
 to catch a weak point let's imagine 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.850
 I have the points as weak points and 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.200
 the dorsals say the width of the back and I 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.050
 take everything in thickness I can not 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.620
 take some doubs etc 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.330
 I stay great and 3 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.940
 so in this case what I advise 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.220
 most of the time it is to chain the 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.200
 partial pullover with dumbbells this is at 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.730
 to say I'll find myself on the part 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.319
 low pullover movement by helping 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.940
 the brave press that tense for 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.950
 try to stay in the part that 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.569
 work the most the backbones and do not 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.010
 go back up with them and chain everything together 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.900
 immediately with tractions in the hen 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.390
 high hold wide staying well 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.310
 right and limiting the amplitude 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.079
 up to the level of the nose or mouth so 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.629
 really located at maximum 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:49.170
 dorsal so we see that this example of 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:52.920
 super 7 post fatigue is after 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.989
 also tired that I'm not going to go 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.599
 allow to solicit the dorsals well 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.769
 more effectively as if I had done 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.810
 directly the tractions with the hen to the 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.370
 taken wide in front who would have without 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.799
 doubt contributed once again to 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.079
 work the muscles of the thick 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.700
 so there by doing this little super 7 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.230
 I will keep the backbones under 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.970
 contraction much longer and 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.739
 in addition I would have thanks for exercises 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.209
 stretching that is the pullover I would have 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.409
 accentuated sensitize but dorsal for 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.599
 that they are recruited on the exercise of 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.660
 base then so that it can be 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.620
 Applicable on any muscles 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.500
 for the pecs by nice can do 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.290
 a few pulleys life standing at the 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.340
 high pulley then go on to develop 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.970
 decline or develop alter etc 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.620
 it's a weak point it can be 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.690
 clubs for 10-16 although there there 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.720
 has no concept of fatigue loan or that 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.010
 you do not want it to be a faty post but 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.340
 it works for all the muscles it can 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.840
 to be 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.549
 so we can do either on loan fatigue 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.019
 as we have seen in the post 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.069
 fatigue that would sooner 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.810
 push- ups at the two takes 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.730
 wide in front and then chain with the 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.310
 pullover so that would not change big 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.829
 thing since in any case the way the 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.379
 Dorsal be sensitized through 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.940
 of pullover after on hysterics 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.010
 so that's the first point the 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.340
 first approach to catch a point 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.650
 low 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.910
 the second approach that srx years so 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.760
 we talked about this super physics 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.290
 points for those interested it 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.840
 xandre series like this it will allow the 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.269
 muscles to stay longer under 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.440
 voltage and the case so read it 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.169
 take the example of the backbones I can 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.699
 do blood series to pull over 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.380
 partial so not going back at all 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.770
 in depth even 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.810
 103 again on stretching and 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.850
 make several selections a two 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.530
 three once or twice a week 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.300
 for a while to learn 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.920
 at my two jumps to shrink to 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.870
 intervene in the exercises for the 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.150
 back like that it can be done in the beginning 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.940
 session at the end of the session to you from 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.800
 see what is really your priority 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.510
 so the elections as I had 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.530
 spoken in superpole article on super 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.880
 physical for those interested 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.320
 me that's what I did for my 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.320
 shoulders at the time that was of a point 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.310
 weak I had done that for more than one 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.930
 year and a half 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.130
 and then well you see that 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.270
 now the shoulders made me some 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.190
 thing that develop rather 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.290
 easily now at home then 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.990
 that at the time bassam is not so 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.140
 it 's something very effective 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.980
 also and finally the last 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.170
 last measure that can be put in 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.970
 place these electrostimulation feclaz 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.960
 that directly by putting the 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.370
 electrodes in the right place 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.060
 whatever program you 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.580
 choose on the electro stimulator that 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.960
 will directly contracted the right muscles 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.610
 so there will be no worries like that you 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.460
 can do it every day at night 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.660
 in front of the TV and it's to learn to 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.610
 getting muscle contracts and so we see 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.290
 we have three axes three possibilities 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.570
 for unifying weak points then 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.090
 obviously if you do the three there 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.200
 are more likely to come with me 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.520
 a weak point the problem is that we 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.170
 never know if it will come or not 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.870
 but we can still normally 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:48.380
 improve a little things so notice 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.670
 Well, it's important to know that 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.230
 will not catch you in two three 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.700
 weeks in six weeks as the 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.800
 magazine tell us was taking 3 cm of 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.380
 brown of me bah it's not true we have 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.760
 do the same so let time do 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.290
 if you are really motivated to 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.030
 catch a weak point you go 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.460
 to be able to catch up with it more or less 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.830
 doing what I can not explain and 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.150
 so who will have no worries finally I 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.680
 finished because I forgot to talk about it 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.540
 that if you give a weak point you 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.330
 want to catch up with it so do not 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.980
 hesitate to review its entire program 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.160
 breakdown in the week for 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:21.050
 obviously but she is getting muscle 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.820
 at the expense of others for them 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.650
 can be recovered well that you can 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.110
 recover well in general and 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.810
 give the best of you on these 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.980
 catch-up sessions of weak points 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.300
 so that's it so I hope now you 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.069
 know what is a real weak point 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.090
 it was not him who made their own 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:37.199
 to do anything but this 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.060
 liquid and not because we are told 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:44.030
 what it takes and now you have 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.030
 tracks to correct this weak point
