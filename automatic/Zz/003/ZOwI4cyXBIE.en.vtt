stuff<00:02:33.580> drop<00:02:33.849> and<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.319> was<00:02:35.319> a<00:02:35.349> pretty

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
stuff drop and that was a pretty

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.290 
stuff drop and that was a pretty
significant<00:02:36.550> move<00:02:36.700> on<00:02:36.849> my<00:02:36.970> part

think that I switch have blading in

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.710 
think that I switch have blading in
there<00:02:38.620> just<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.580> save<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.910> spotter<00:02:40.150> later<00:02:40.420> and

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
there just to save the spotter later and

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.920 
there just to save the spotter later and
I<00:02:41.530> shadow<00:02:41.800> ball<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:43.090> Titanic<00:02:43.570> takes<00:02:43.810> it

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
I shadow ball and the Titanic takes it

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.660 
I shadow ball and the Titanic takes it
really<00:02:44.380> well<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:44.770> it<00:02:45.280> looks<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.550> be<00:02:45.640> a

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
really well and it looks to be a

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.390 
really well and it looks to be a
three-tail<00:02:46.270> barely<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.590> Gail<00:02:47.800> but<00:02:48.100> then<00:02:48.250> he

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
three-tail barely to it Gail but then he

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.220 
three-tail barely to it Gail but then he
had<00:02:48.490> leftovers<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.180> it's<00:02:49.450> a<00:02:49.510> three<00:02:49.720> kill<00:02:49.990> and

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
had leftovers and it's a three kill and

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.560 
had leftovers and it's a three kill and
his<00:02:50.770> shadow<00:02:51.010> ball<00:02:51.190> seems<00:02:51.520> like<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.730> Threepio<00:02:52.300> in

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570
