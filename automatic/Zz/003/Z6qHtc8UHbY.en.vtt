00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:09.139
 we are losing all of them 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:12.049
 kenji are ksar apple and I'm back 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.870
 with you with you the people me lake diano 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.960
 for this third episode of mine 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.090
 stories cross with bear ax and for 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.480
 start with the story that will begin 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.550
 more or less in medias res coast today 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.320
 I wanted to make a couple of clarifications here 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.470
 about the style with which I tell e 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.600
 at the end also of the last a need talk 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.510
 then as far as style is concerned 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.870
 I try to provide you with assumptions that 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.360
 I consider it indispensable, at least useful 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.910
 for a better understanding of 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:51.620
 story that I hopefully introduce 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.780
 to find the best compromises here 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.120
 among them the actual story e 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.980
 I hope not to dwell too much here 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.960
 next comments here I will try to 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:05.210
 limit a little less so this 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.490
 appearance of the bases from which the 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.780
 story and as regards instead the 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.960
 end of last story well I believe that 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.240
 if I'm here to tell it, it's only for the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.689
 the fact that we say I did n't take them from 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.090
 those four friends three French friends e 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.539
 so I thought it was pretty obvious 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.259
 here obviously I was wrong in the not 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:31.880
 tell you how it ended 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:35.709
 after having dwelt so much in the how 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.770
 say in the preface in the incipit si 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:41.479
 sorry i'm careless 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.889
 however, forgotten about this in the end yes 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.990
 has managed to escape here if you want 

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:47.810
 to know how it ended 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.829
 and so guys nothing banning the talk 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.409
 sancho to the bands 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.849
 let's start immediately with the first story here 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.570
 let's say this is a bit 

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:57.720
 symbolize 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.050
 is an emblem of the reckless nature of 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.300
 my father the moment he drives in 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.410
 moment in which he holds a steering wheel a 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.539
 guy where he can vent all of his 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.280
 adrenaline here yes we say my father 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.390
 he has always been a lover of vc taxes 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.680
 of speed both on skis and precisely 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.680
 aboard a car and when and 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.020
 when he is not so reckless for how much 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.620
 it's about speed in other ways 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.350
 and now I will explain this to you I will tell you 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.840
 this year you just have a little anecdote 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.880
 knowing an assumption is that I don't know 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.190
 how basic, though, maybe vi 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.330
 it will facilitate the understanding of this 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.340
 story here you must know precisely that 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.330
 living about 20 kilometers from mine 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.670
 school many times 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.980
 I ask my parents to my father 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.340
 mother to pick me up because how 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.470
 you know 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.110
 usually very tired in the morning 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.220
 school and then be at home 30 40 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.590
 50 minutes earlier 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.450
 it is not a sin that we can 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.340
 rest better during the afternoon 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.400
 doing other things too 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.560
 and that Saturday boys touched my father and 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.510
 now I will explain to you what there is to lead 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.519
 anyway funny because i don't 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.380
 I was really amused by 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.829
 this from this made from this 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.350
 anecdote that I'm telling you touch 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:23.600
 my father that Saturday and from the moment in 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.600
 which I and my other friends passed 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.320
 above the rails of the neighboring hans 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:32.250
 that is not of the nearby station of the 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:36.000
 near and tram near just mine 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.590
 school what happens happens that is 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.930
 successful guys we basically have 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.360
 so to say pierced no without for that 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.620
 say we really drilled and my father 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.700
 so very boldly so very much 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.940
 brave he said we could 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.970
 continue without having to buy here 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.870
 without the need to approach changing 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:03.630
 the wheel and so behave from his 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.430
 security in affirming this we have 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.740
 we also continued because we 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.240
 we were 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.790
 very tired we would not have wanted 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.600
 stop but we were unaware of here 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.830
 in fact what was going to happen 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.320
 we still had to overcome 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.110
 about 15 km 2 tunnels one 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.800
 freeway so imagine yourself like 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:26.590
 it would have been worrying to arrive for 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.870
 carry out this whole journey with one 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.270
 punctured wheel and our worries 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.270
 were founded 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.960
 there they had rigid foundations here 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:41.800
 balances in fact after having passed the 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.260
 second no the first to tell the truth the 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.440
 first tunnel this noise of the wheel 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:52.540
 it always became more and more annoying 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.790
 the more continuous we had below us 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.610
 a sound that went so well 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.400
 cyclical to remind us that we had one 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.970
 punctured wheel and this sound was made 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.730
 as I have said more and more intensely 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:11.350
 until precisely when leaving the 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:15.850
 second gallery suddenly put it like that 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:18.070
 vanished into thin air and and there I remember the 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.090
 face of a friend of mine here here after a 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:25.390
 passage because it lives very close to me 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.940
 the look is so lost in wondered 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.710
 probably how I did it at that 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.760
 what was happening now that 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.440
 what had happened to that wheel e 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.900
 these looks remained unanswered 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.640
 here our faces were astonished 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.850
 really and also I tried to give me one 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:49.830
 solution to give a solution to this 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:52.330
 that is, this dilemma here is that it haunted and 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.850
 they try to understand the situation 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:58.540
 here I turned around looking at myself 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:01.630
 out the window and just watching 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:04.450
 outside the window is a wheel 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.550
 or rather a tire that traveled 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:10.070
 no rim to 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.930
 towards the opposite lane boys like 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.480
 like in American movies to you 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.910
 imagine the terror of being able to see 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.040
 a motorcyclist advancing close to 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:22.670
 this oil in the opposite direction here 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:25.130
 advance maybe bump this this 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.690
 tires cavando accident even close 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.580
 at the gallery and at that time 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.890
 I really felt my heart 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.810
 stop for a moment you 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.930
 imagine this tire turning at 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.330
 gas or so or consists of my father who was a 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:42.650
 we also enjoyed some of it 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:46.060
 instead we were very scared and afraid 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:48.980
 of the memory above all the more we say 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:52.520
 quiet among my friends like it 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:54.380
 covered his face with his hands because it was 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.920
 were that probably frightened him 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:00.590
 his father is much quieter and not 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.430
 has ever had to deal with this type 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.400
 of things 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.230
