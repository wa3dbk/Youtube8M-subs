00:00:09.857 --> 00:00:12.237
Darkness...

00:00:12.502 --> 00:00:14.202
..is coming

00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:21.971
They know our strategies

00:00:24.636 --> 00:00:26.996
They've learned our weaknesses

00:00:30.475 --> 00:00:32.925
This is not war

00:00:35.213 --> 00:00:37.863
It's human's extinction

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.470
It's a new day people

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:14.849
Destiny calls

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:17.456
The world expects only one thing from us..

00:01:17.568 --> 00:01:18.568
..that we'll win

00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:29.548
We lost German

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:31.062
We lost French

00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:32.987
If we lose today

00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:35.503
...we won't get to fight another

00:02:06.823 --> 00:02:08.413
60 years ago

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:10.293
Earth was attacked

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:12.396
We won the war

00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:14.509
..but they destroyed our planet

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:32.013
Everyone's been evacuated

00:02:33.235 --> 00:02:35.095
Nothing human remains

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.739
It doesn't seem right.

00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:42.142
We won the war

00:02:42.142 --> 00:02:43.762
..but now we have to leave

00:03:31.668 --> 00:03:32.508
EARTH..

00:03:32.518 --> 00:03:33.898
..is my home

00:03:35.557 --> 00:03:37.367
It's time to come home
