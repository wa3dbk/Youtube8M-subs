00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
when you get close to here you can end

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.380 
when you get close to here you can end
up<00:05:28.740> scraping<00:05:29.130> the<00:05:29.430> other<00:05:29.580> wall<00:05:29.850> which<00:05:30.150> is<00:05:30.180> the

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
up scraping the other wall which is the

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.060 
up scraping the other wall which is the
drag<00:05:30.630> if<00:05:30.780> you've<00:05:30.960> already<00:05:31.080> painted<00:05:31.440> it<00:05:31.710> it's

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
drag if you've already painted it it's

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.520 
drag if you've already painted it it's
always<00:05:32.310> flip<00:05:32.550> it<00:05:32.670> around<00:05:32.760> so<00:05:33.330> that<00:05:33.360> the<00:05:33.690> kind

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
always flip it around so that the kind

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.190 
always flip it around so that the kind
of<00:05:34.650> blunt<00:05:35.070> end<00:05:35.310> of<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.730> instrument<00:05:36.510> is<00:05:36.690> facing

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
of blunt end of the instrument is facing
