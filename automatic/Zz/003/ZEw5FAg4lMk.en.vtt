 apraxia to operators specialized in the sector such as the ozi xd 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.159

 why 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.310
 he doesn't need it anymore or because they want for video 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.110
 make an investment that they have done among other things at this time logo 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.939
 extremely high for me there is a strong strong influx of public 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:11.849
 router 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.649
 for the sale 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:18.009
 we say that the policy that we have adopted an industrial policy the 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:19.969
 I mean everything 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.449
 that m 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:25.479
 we expected d tim 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.359
 work on a larger scale 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:33.019
 we have set up a website where there are quotations 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.819
 of gold and silver 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.709
 tits of the coins of the main moments of boxwood like the sea pounds 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.739
 I invite you to see this moment xd 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:42.989
 where it's seen 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.649
 in real time 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:49.359
 the price of gold I hear of coins with purchase prices and 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:50.879
 our sales 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.809
 I am very, very close 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:57.290
 because the concept because then expressed also in 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.709
 in our brand honest agrees 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.459
 it consists precisely in this 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.669
 to keep a pair of scissors 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:09.979
 at the purchase price and very tight selling price I mean that 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.650
 we buy hope 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.939
 at a price that is very close to the selling price 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:17.469
 this 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.469
 dvdmod involves 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:24.499
 an advantage for the customer that I hate because he had grown taller but 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:26.520
 especially an advantage for us 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.799
 why 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.329
 me our philosophy 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:37.469
 we considered that it is better to earn 100 euros 10 times than us 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:39.399
 miley has only once 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:43.439
 stories I interrupt just on this there are many shops of this type ne 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:44.960
 we saw see them 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.440
 still why 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.420
 it is more convenient to you as an electron because it is more convenient 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.919
 come from ready to rather than go 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.809
 the others there is also the question of the exact timing then there are two 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:03.519
 reasons 1 the fundamental reason anyone can check on our website eh. 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.519
 board www.borgo or .com 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:10.459
 123 cm we talk 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.869
 advertising prices 

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:19.469
 it's not that a trendy customer more than a customer takes less depending on how 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:23.779
 love with no the price is public anyone can verify it 

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:27.379
 second and this is aimed primarily at operators 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:32.150
 piedmont We have equipped ourselves, we are the only ones to have it 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.909
 in Milan at the company's headquarters 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:37.880
 we have equipped ourselves with an analysis laboratory 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.940
 and I hear the gold smelting robot laboratory 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.200
 within the 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.210
 six of ours are our workshops 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.270
 d therefore 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.310
 we are able in a very short time 2 3 hours at most to make the title 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.510
 of the egg and to immediately liquidate those who come to bring us the logo above all 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:58.340
 operators 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.729
 because when it comes to quantitative nuts 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.349
 it is very important to establish the exact content of ho in the 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:10.159
 m material that is not always the same in this way we can pay the maximum 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:12.300
 because we have the certainty 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.360
 what we are buying and we must not stay low to protect ourselves 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.930
 ebay and then we can do it immediately 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.150
 while the film 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.779
 normally it takes two or three days 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:25.999
 this for operators who have a capital 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:30.550
 invested very high images rather districts is essential 

00:05:30.549 --> 00:05:32.999
 that is 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:37.819
 sell and buy very quickly we are structured to tag 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:40.819
 me to satisfy this need of the other operators 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:43.080
 private individuals 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.900
 have the advantage of and have 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.039
 an identity price 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.039
 extremely cheap there is none 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.400
 inter 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.479
 is what I say can be verified on our site 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:58.629
 what a father we pay to us 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:59.749
 just because 

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:02.110
 we work on the mass 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.360
 on quantity 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.229
 better to earn 100 euros 10 times than a thousand and only once this is 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:09.719
 honest politics agrees 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:10.520
 Marco 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.640
 hahaha remembering the address so they also know they had to come here to Milan 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.980
 then to the address hours and in via san Gregorio 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.979
 corner of via vittoris pisani via san gregorio 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:24.979
 that makes corner run where we have the showcases 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.470
 it is a side street of the via vittoris pisani that the main avenue that connects the 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.770
 central station with piazza della repubblica is served by the 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.310
 subway from line 2 from line 3 for a lot of months 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.070
 extremely outside 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.360
 from the circle where 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.960
 the ecopass is needed there is a very large parking lot nearby 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.009
 this allows us to choose the location 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.660
 to serve both the milan and the province because there is the railway pass 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.199
 station who anyone comes from the province 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:06:59.330
 arrives here 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.680
 on foot, the station will go down 300 meters and will be with us 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:11.629
 laboratory because the offices are together as I said before or rather wines 

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:13.099
 I would ask you to come down 

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:16.419
 and to say that it is the to show you how the laboratory died 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:18.449
 maybe verified 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:22.029
 to see how metal melting takes place is one thing 

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:25.499
 a maintenon is not habitual to see in short 

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:28.529
 absolutely then let's go see how thank you 

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:31.669
