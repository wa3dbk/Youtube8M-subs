00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.700
 gradually 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:12.659
 in 2008 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:13.759
 probably would lead 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.759
 expeditions 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:22.499
 Generally the captain Jack Sparrow 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.679
 it all says a lot 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.309
 I keep searching for a source in the area 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:32.140
 recommends that residents source in the office 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.140
 ministers 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.660
 to oblige what does 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.360
 the reward will be the source 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.360
 as reported by his press office 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.490
 20 and above 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.490
 all say we take the ships 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.750
 opinion is not always the case 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.750
 I am pleased 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.540
 we live in danger 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.970
 four times 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.270
 provided 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.270
 they will choose that source 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.110
 finished 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.930
 this time I have already met now 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.930
 read about his old broad 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.610
 one of the reasons 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.610
 you know what i said 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.280
 and in my own country
