00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
simple as that really

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:06.890 
simple as that really
great<00:02:59.230> let's<00:02:59.890> do<00:03:00.159> it<00:03:00.280> again

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.020 

lovely<00:03:07.900> still<00:03:08.799> that's<00:03:09.219> all<00:03:09.400> very<00:03:09.549> well<00:03:09.700> for<00:03:09.849> a

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
lovely still that's all very well for a

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.420 
lovely still that's all very well for a
Cortina<00:03:10.540> but<00:03:11.079> what<00:03:11.230> about<00:03:11.500> using<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:12.010> cannon

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
Cortina but what about using the cannon

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.500 
Cortina but what about using the cannon
to<00:03:12.579> fly<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.819> 10-ton<00:03:13.750> fire<00:03:14.200> engine

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.819 

now<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.569> couldn't<00:03:18.900> do<00:03:19.109> it<00:03:19.170> with<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.290> cannon<00:03:19.680> I

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
now you couldn't do it with a cannon I

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.709 
now you couldn't do it with a cannon I
mean<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.129> think<00:03:20.189> in<00:03:20.489> fact<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:21.180> firing<00:03:21.480> is

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:21.719 
mean I think in fact the firing is

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:24.740 
mean I think in fact the firing is
actually<00:03:21.959> just<00:03:22.260> too<00:03:22.650> heavy<00:03:23.239> so<00:03:24.239> how<00:03:24.420> did<00:03:24.629> they

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
actually just too heavy so how did they

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.209 
actually just too heavy so how did they
do<00:03:24.900> that

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:25.219 
do that

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:28.429 
do that
well<00:03:26.219> David<00:03:26.849> his<00:03:27.060> team<00:03:27.359> took<00:03:27.629> to<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.930> workshop

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:28.439 
well David his team took to the workshop

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:30.170 
well David his team took to the workshop
and<00:03:28.709> gave<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.069> fire<00:03:29.370> engine<00:03:29.790> their<00:03:29.969> own

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
and gave the fire engine their own

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.780 
and gave the fire engine their own
special<00:03:30.870> treatment<00:03:31.379> first<00:03:32.099> of<00:03:32.219> all<00:03:32.310> we<00:03:32.459> remove

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
special treatment first of all we remove

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.069 
special treatment first of all we remove
we<00:03:33.030> fitted<00:03:33.599> this<00:03:33.750> unbreakable<00:03:34.260> screen<00:03:36.079> remove

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
we fitted this unbreakable screen remove

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.770 
we fitted this unbreakable screen remove
the<00:03:37.290> fuel<00:03:37.500> tank<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:38.069> fitted<00:03:38.370> a<00:03:38.459> small<00:03:38.780> one

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
the fuel tank and fitted a small one

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.229 
the fuel tank and fitted a small one
just<00:03:40.019> enough<00:03:40.260> for<00:03:40.379> a<00:03:40.439> job<00:03:40.700> we<00:03:41.700> then<00:03:41.879> built<00:03:42.120> a

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
just enough for a job we then built a

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.720 
just enough for a job we then built a
roll<00:03:42.389> cage<00:03:42.719> roll<00:03:43.680> out<00:03:44.129> of<00:03:44.340> this<00:03:44.459> which<00:03:44.700> is

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
roll cage roll out of this which is

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.780 
roll cage roll out of this which is
heavy-duty<00:03:45.269> box-section

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
heavy-duty box-section

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.020 
heavy-duty box-section
and<00:03:47.790> then<00:03:48.780> we<00:03:48.900> fit<00:03:49.049> a<00:03:49.139> rally<00:03:49.349> seat<00:03:49.769> with<00:03:50.730> the

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
and then we fit a rally seat with the

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.869 
and then we fit a rally seat with the
five-point<00:03:51.780> harness<00:03:52.250> two<00:03:53.250> people<00:03:53.549> stuntmen
