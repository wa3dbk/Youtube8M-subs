00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
going to turn out better it didn't seem

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.049 
going to turn out better it didn't seem
to<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.920> torque<00:00:38.250> roll<00:00:38.460> tendency<00:00:39.030> that

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
to have the torque roll tendency that

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.930 
to have the torque roll tendency that
the<00:00:39.390> Christina<00:00:40.079> had<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.610> wave

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
the Christina had and this is the wave

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.130 
the Christina had and this is the wave

Toys<00:00:46.530> R<00:00:46.680> Us<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.190> had<00:00:47.340> upgraded<00:00:48.530> so<00:00:49.530> yeah<00:00:49.710> I

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
Toys R Us that I had upgraded so yeah I

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.840 
Toys R Us that I had upgraded so yeah I
did<00:00:51.800> basically<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:53.719> guess<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.930> ESC<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:56.520> there

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
did basically I guess the ESC in there

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.689 
did basically I guess the ESC in there
there's<00:00:57.690> actually<00:00:58.140> little<00:00:58.350> rings<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.579> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
there's actually little rings that it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.510 
there's actually little rings that it
comes<00:00:59.910> with<00:01:00.500> that<00:01:01.500> are<00:01:01.620> actually<00:01:02.070> used<00:01:02.309> to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
comes with that are actually used to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.000 
comes with that are actually used to
seal<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.030> original<00:01:03.480> components<00:01:04.110> which<00:01:04.769> are

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
seal the original components which are

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.910 
seal the original components which are
all<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:06.439> inferior<00:01:08.240> 27<00:01:09.240> megahertz<00:01:09.920> radio

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
all in inferior 27 megahertz radio

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.520 
all in inferior 27 megahertz radio
systems<00:01:11.460> basically<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.540> more<00:01:12.720> modern<00:01:13.140> radio

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
systems basically have more modern radio

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.140 
systems basically have more modern radio
systems<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.299> much<00:01:15.299> more<00:01:15.509> powerful

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
systems and much more powerful

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.030 
systems and much more powerful
electronic<00:01:18.680> control<00:01:19.680> law<00:01:21.020> items<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.320> yeah

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
electronic control law items so yeah

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.660 
electronic control law items so yeah
basically<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.450> brushless<00:01:24.720> motor<00:01:25.430> servos<00:01:26.430> are

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
basically the brushless motor servos are

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.929 
basically the brushless motor servos are
much<00:01:26.939> better<00:01:27.150> quality<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:28.829> hobby-grade<00:01:29.220> than

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
much better quality in hobby-grade than

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.910 
much better quality in hobby-grade than
with<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.420> toy<00:01:30.659> grade<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.140> toy<00:01:31.350> grade<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
with the toy grade the toy grade is the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.060 
with the toy grade the toy grade is the
biggest<00:01:32.340> piece<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:32.970> crap<00:01:33.150> stuff<00:01:33.780> give<00:01:34.200> me<00:01:34.229> one

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
biggest piece of crap stuff give me one

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.190 
biggest piece of crap stuff give me one
moment<00:01:35.460> I'll<00:01:35.579> find<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:37.369> here<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:38.460> go<00:01:38.810> this<00:01:39.810> big

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
moment I'll find it here we go this big

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.069 
moment I'll find it here we go this big
huge<00:01:40.470> pointless<00:01:41.130> thing<00:01:41.400> was<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> servo<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.930> is

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
huge pointless thing was a servo this is

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.380 
huge pointless thing was a servo this is
ridiculously<00:01:44.040> huge<00:01:44.430> for<00:01:44.729> absolutely<00:01:45.210> no

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
ridiculously huge for absolutely no

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.810 
ridiculously huge for absolutely no
reason<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:46.409> don't<00:01:46.619> need<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.040> much<00:01:47.250> torque

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
reason you don't need that much torque

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.090 
reason you don't need that much torque
or<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.240> much<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.810> don't<00:01:49.409> think<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.860> thing

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
or that much I don't think this thing

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.539 
or that much I don't think this thing
had<00:01:50.250> much<00:01:50.460> torque<00:01:50.790> anyway<00:01:51.149> but<00:01:51.810> uh<00:01:52.130> we<00:01:53.130> got<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
had much torque anyway but uh we got the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.840 
had much torque anyway but uh we got the
receiver<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.600> control<00:01:54.960> panel<00:01:55.579> then<00:01:56.579> we<00:01:56.640> got<00:01:56.820> a

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
receiver and control panel then we got a

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.450 
receiver and control panel then we got a
brushed<00:01:57.329> motor<00:01:57.890> this<00:01:58.890> little<00:01:59.250> thing

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
brushed motor this little thing

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.370 
brushed motor this little thing
obviously<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.479> could<00:02:00.659> see<00:02:00.899> by<00:02:01.170> other

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
obviously you could see by other

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.389 
obviously you could see by other
people's<00:02:01.799> little<00:02:02.270> videos<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.299> they<00:02:03.570> do<00:02:03.630> just

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
people's little videos that they do just

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.730 
people's little videos that they do just
driving<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.520> stock<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.780> things<00:02:07.049> as<00:02:07.259> slow<00:02:07.590> as

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
driving it stock the things as slow as

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.440

than hobbyking I believe how our hobby
may<00:02:55.410> have<00:02:55.650> them<00:02:55.920> there's<00:02:56.160> these<00:02:56.310> other<00:02:56.489> hobby

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180

may have them there's these other hobby
stores<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.599> have<00:02:57.810> them<00:02:58.019> but<00:02:58.230> in<00:02:58.769> general<00:02:59.160> it

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
stores that have them but in general it

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.400 
stores that have them but in general it
seems<00:02:59.430> like<00:02:59.880> it<00:03:00.030> may<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.330> great<00:03:00.660> platform

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410
