00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.130
 down to the palette the palette I follow the 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.320
 goal taught a truth that that does not 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.750

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.700
 get the dollar and the silver of this 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.680
 kind of things this type of product is 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.900
 how they have missed 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.390
 I love it good so you have about 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.250
 relief says line channel is a coast 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:56.400
 golden you would have done it here is it 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.979
 metal is like 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.130
 it's just as metal as the holsters 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.030
 we lose more girls back here and the 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.060
 colors 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.319
 you open it there 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.340
 and it has a plastic that has these 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:14.590
 Spirometry drawings pigment that very 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.810
 to the short letter once all the 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.240
 forms have texture are the ones I tried 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.789
 what happens a little bit deleted good 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.849
 notice how pigment has happened what 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:27.219
 it was bad and touching a little look 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:29.830
 as they pigment the shadows comment that 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:32.080
 nor to the truth that I love the 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.629
 sun I have no palette like that 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.240
 so for me it 's a truth that I'm going 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:39.669
 to take care of me personally 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.699
 this kind of graphics with a lot of detail 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:45.580
 much question to me I like it a lot 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:47.529
 that to me is like a toy for my 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.349
 makeup with ugt for large women 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:52.930
 notice how well they invent you very well 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:55.120
 and finally what I have every one that comes 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.759
 in this pack agents what is the 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.580
 outside box this is a test for 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:02.620
 shadows has access through the kingdom of 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.779
 price of all the total purchase was at 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.499
 edge being the law and I think it cost me 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:08.710
 10 dollars 

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:11.110
 the shipping notice there they have it is is 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.570
 small is small room 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.030
 and the truth is that what he does is 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:19.060
 that the shadow lasts longer and when 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:21.520
 I apply it without eye for an eye with 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.200
 eye with the test like the color is 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.040
 much stronger than the other one that does not 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.890
 it is so the breeze and a cream comes out 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.360
 skin color here is the test for 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.760
 shadows or did not have any proof 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.370
 specific except for euros- nikkei 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.200
 It's the naked ballet that I liked a lot and 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.080
 the truth that this one seems to me 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.450
 much more basic are all 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.700
 things the truth that I am delighted 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:48.640
