00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
at right now is actually not the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.889 
at right now is actually not the
incinerator<00:00:30.320> it's<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.500> portal<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.279> nether

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
incinerator it's a portal to the nether

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.540 
incinerator it's a portal to the nether
this<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.140> where<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.500> go<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.739> get<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.280> nether

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
this is where you go to get the nether

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.000 
this is where you go to get the nether
blocks<00:00:36.000> I'm<00:00:36.329> actually<00:00:36.600> having<00:00:37.079> my<00:00:37.440> hand<00:00:37.739> right

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
this for a safety hazard just let me try

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:09.250 
this for a safety hazard just let me try
to<00:03:02.680> work<00:03:03.680> with<00:03:03.709> this<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.340> bit<00:03:04.549> I<00:03:07.930> don't<00:03:08.930> know<00:03:09.019> did

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
to work with this a bit I don't know did

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.580 
to work with this a bit I don't know did
it<00:03:09.349> work<00:03:09.560> yes<00:03:09.829> it<00:03:10.040> did<00:03:10.219> okay<00:03:10.810> well<00:03:11.810> this<00:03:12.290> is<00:03:12.560> a

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
it work yes it did okay well this is a

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.309 
it work yes it did okay well this is a
bit<00:03:12.709> of<00:03:12.889> a<00:03:13.069> safety<00:03:13.340> hazard<00:03:13.849> I'm<00:03:14.269> putting<00:03:15.019> up<00:03:15.170> a

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
bit of a safety hazard I'm putting up a

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.699 
bit of a safety hazard I'm putting up a
safety<00:03:15.829> precaution<00:03:16.430> as<00:03:16.969> you<00:03:17.510> can<00:03:17.689> see<00:03:17.959> now<00:03:18.200> I

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
safety precaution as you can see now I

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.849 
safety precaution as you can see now I
can't<00:03:19.310> go<00:03:19.609> into<00:03:19.879> the<00:03:20.180> fire<00:03:20.650> because<00:03:21.650> it's

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
can't go into the fire because it's

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:27.039 
can't go into the fire because it's
blocked<00:03:24.909> same<00:03:25.909> thing<00:03:26.209> with<00:03:26.359> my<00:03:26.599> other<00:03:26.750> one

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
blocked same thing with my other one

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.390 
blocked same thing with my other one
here<00:03:27.349> you<00:03:27.500> can<00:03:27.739> see<00:03:27.980> I<00:03:28.010> can't<00:03:28.489> go<00:03:28.790> into<00:03:28.819> it<00:03:30.400> now

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
here you can see I can't go into it now

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.539 
here you can see I can't go into it now
the<00:03:31.459> only<00:03:31.849> downside<00:03:32.659> is<00:03:33.010> you<00:03:34.010> need<00:03:34.189> to<00:03:34.370> make<00:03:34.489> a

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
the only downside is you need to make a

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.129 
the only downside is you need to make a
portal<00:03:35.120> to<00:03:35.329> go<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.689> nether<00:03:36.939> which<00:03:38.139> the

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
portal to go to the nether which the

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.050 
portal to go to the nether which the
portal<00:03:39.590> you<00:03:39.739> can<00:03:39.799> go<00:03:40.040> look<00:03:40.250> at<00:03:40.400> videos<00:03:40.819> on

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
portal you can go look at videos on

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.110 
portal you can go look at videos on
YouTube<00:03:41.480> it's<00:03:41.689> a<00:03:41.810> bit<00:03:41.989> more<00:03:42.200> complex<00:03:43.120> but

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
YouTube it's a bit more complex but

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.539 
YouTube it's a bit more complex but
going<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.719> the<00:03:44.900> nether<00:03:45.109> is<00:03:45.409> awesome<00:03:45.919> so<00:03:46.280> not

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
going to the nether is awesome so not

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.599 
going to the nether is awesome so not
only<00:03:46.579> can<00:03:47.349> you<00:03:48.349> go<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.829> nether<00:03:49.099> you<00:03:49.430> can

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
only can you go to the nether you can

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.699 
only can you go to the nether you can
also<00:03:49.790> use<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.599> nether<00:03:50.810> blocks<00:03:51.230> to<00:03:51.560> make

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
also use the nether blocks to make

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.979 
also use the nether blocks to make
lovely<00:03:52.040> fire<00:03:52.400> now<00:03:53.060> I'm<00:03:53.209> just<00:03:53.419> going<00:03:53.569> to<00:03:53.689> skip

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
could have a lab a fireplace I guess to

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.620 
could have a lab a fireplace I guess to
some<00:04:24.840> people<00:04:25.200> made<00:04:25.440> that<00:04:25.880> but<00:04:26.880> then<00:04:27.060> again<00:04:27.210> if

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
some people made that but then again if

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.020 
some people made that but then again if
you<00:04:27.750> want<00:04:27.990> it<00:04:28.170> to<00:04:28.500> make<00:04:28.680> it<00:04:28.740> really<00:04:29.310> realistic

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
you want it to make it really realistic

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.770 
you want it to make it really realistic
cuz<00:04:31.020> lab<00:04:31.290> is<00:04:31.500> not<00:04:31.710> really<00:04:32.070> realistic<00:04:32.660> so<00:04:33.660> if

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
cuz lab is not really realistic so if

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.750 
cuz lab is not really realistic so if
you<00:04:33.900> want<00:04:34.110> to<00:04:34.200> make<00:04:34.380> it<00:04:34.560> real<00:04:34.860> realistic<00:04:35.370> a
