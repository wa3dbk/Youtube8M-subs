00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.060 
mile of a show I think we'd better if it
was<00:05:02.260> a<00:05:02.320> sky<00:05:02.590> valley<00:05:03.340> oh<00:05:03.960> so<00:05:04.960> no<00:05:05.320> said<00:05:05.860> you<00:05:05.980> up

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
rubbish foot okay no I think it'd be

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.450

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.520 
better if the crosshairs like an actual
cross<00:05:12.970> I<00:05:13.300> just<00:05:13.480> hope<00:05:13.660> in<00:05:13.870> a<00:05:13.930> doctor<00:05:14.320> it's
