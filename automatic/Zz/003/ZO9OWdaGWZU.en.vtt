00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.250 
perspective that he is a Maine Coon now
the<00:02:21.320> Maine<00:02:21.560> Coon<00:02:21.860> cat<00:02:22.160> breed<00:02:22.550> has<00:02:22.990> has<00:02:23.990> some

the Maine Coon cat breed has has some

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.800 
the Maine Coon cat breed has has some
very<00:02:24.410> doglike<00:02:25.010> characteristics<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:26.690> when

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
very doglike characteristics and when

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.870

they say doglike that means more

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.740 
they say doglike that means more
