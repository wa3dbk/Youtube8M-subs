00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.310
 ugly greenhouse 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.260
 which somehow never used and what is still done 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
 because it goes up to 4 glass together but 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.250
 "This is a pancake" beginning 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.320
 OM 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.320

 Schmidt said you could do it yourself 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:21.309
 under my etc 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:24.779
 I know nothing the defense never Hönes put square league rivals 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:30.259

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.379
 SZ 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.379

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.059
 technically up 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:56.059
 together one year percent 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:00.049
 I actually had a lot more resources but it was like that 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.589
 The Kita Liebfrauen in the heights has dismantled they can also alarm 

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:08.179
 and then I thought off a March harbor import is so Michael Schwertner 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:10.219
 nothing has happened 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.919
 Senders cheerfully continued and I was right and have lost everything 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:14.969
 in the so-called 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:16.999
 200 albums 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:19.999

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:27.219

 says Wirz Botter shines through 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.739
 instead of going to his speech go off the bunk bed 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.620

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.549
 for OM 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.579
 It will also be interesting for products, but I think somehow 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.540
 I also have to show that it has closed yes I am in stone forever 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.359
 carved 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.359
 Cardboard furniture found everything I've built up something but broken 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:03.959
 that would have to show 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.779
 he was bleeding 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.789

 4 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.650
 even something on 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.270

 Stairs came if he later the tutorials and therefore has Jürgen League compete 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:05.990
 when you first start to build a staircase then 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.990
 So now you have to look up with Hagemann 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:12.519

 Schulz said 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.070
 looking down my world I think by the way pretty shitty if 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:32.090
 I normally saw the other stores have this and other little better
