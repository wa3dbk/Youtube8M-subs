00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.380
 the first inspiration from which I would like to start 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.170
 in the practical part and this 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.949
 there are some 

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:12.949
 words 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:15.619
 I apologize 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.079
 under bg 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.079
 some words that 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.079
 just for us keywords 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.730
 how to write a word that starts with s 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.839
 of the time I present with a series of s the first word I would like 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:34.040
 work and this 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.670
 the semplicity 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.240
 I would say the first virtue is the professional writer 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.130
 being able to reduce the misunderstanding michelle to reduce the 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.000
 misunderstanding to make people understand 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.120
 what you mean 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.670
 you want to say 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.930
 that is, how you interpret them leaving little room for interpretation 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.750
 another word on which I ask you questioned together 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.030
 and this is another word forbidden to synthesis 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.150
 what is the synthesis 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.760
 it is not brevity 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.130
 brevity and say or write a few words. 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.480
 the synthesis is to write a few words a letter 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.710
 dense 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.760
 of meaning 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.190
 and of value 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.780
 that is, I tell you. a toto and I make you want to learn more 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.990
 think when one tells a movie 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.160
 Harry you saw last night I didn't tell you your nick 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
 there are those who say watch a beautiful movie 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.950
 first there is the initials no 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.490
 then there are the credits then there is him who takes the porters handle 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.470
 I'm going to see it now 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.110
 and there are those that I can tell you all 5 words and make you want 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.840
 to go and see that night 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.570
 the summary is 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.170
 the ability to say a great deal in a few words 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.850
 to make you want to discover the quantity of beehives the meanings of 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.550
 values 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.300
 another s 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.300
 another keyword and the structure of the text 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.739
 and think how maybe this is 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.779
 I don't know if the water is one of the most important of the war lately 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.479
 have you ever noticed 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:17.839
 to this fact 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.289
 when you write on the card 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.289
 and those of you who are writing are talking about it even now 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.439
 eg 2 we use the fact vertical sheet of paper 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.019
 because here I am taught 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.169
 few are the ones I write for so 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:34.919
 there are some albums that we don't see but most of them are books 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.969
 notebooks are vertical 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:42.369
 pity that the computer is the computer scanner is horizontal so if you 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:45.399
 you are used to writing the introduction in your theme 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:50.259
 the progress and the conclusion and you put the message in the conclusion 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:51.429
 strong 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:54.289
 remember that reader does not see it 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:57.899
 this is why they advise in the eu be reversed to the classical structure 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:00.899
 of the argument now introduction, development and conclusion 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.449
 in the uepe it is necessary to start from the cont 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:08.069
 Most of the time starting from the conclusions starts from the message you want 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.409
 say epo 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.649
 from where you want to go 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:15.849
 and then if there is time and space to argue about the details 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:22.389
 think about how much the structure about women who are milk cujo 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.200
 the structure of a poinx message 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.200
 fluency perception 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:30.189
 there is another s 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.539
 that you can call the style 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:36.539
 and style is that thing that we never know how to define 

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:40.719
 but one that pleases you more than another unacoop 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:43.719
 a text written by asshole accords with the same things but 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.239
 it's more 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.799
 easily usable 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.799
 then they are trezze that I write all the following 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:55.749
 wedge - seduction 

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:59.339
 the sympathy 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:03.229
 extravagance 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:09.849
 skull with the - to remind us all of us 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.429
 the origin 

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:16.239
 the etymology of these words 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.699
 who is the seducer 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:24.139
 none that plays the magic pipe fool boobs jajaj su come serpent if 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.059
 durres means 

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:27.080
 lead to itself 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.849
 no carry the reader 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:34.909
 reduce the distance between me writing and him reading what the showcase does 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:35.990
 a store 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.689
 this must do 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:43.029
 in the window of the shoe store you don't put 2000 types of shoes you have 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.690
 anything 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.469
 put 5 6 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:50.729
 however, there is the velvety velvet, the small shadow cell that is placed in a 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.199
 and the lady who sees reader to the skipped golden shoe of the think to 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:59.570
 next episode. no. mails you do a lot of thoughts 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.419
 you ask questions is always asking you 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.330
 this is the purpose 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.280
 compeggio 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.620
 make you want to enter edit 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.740
 to look for if there is something else 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.479
 the sympathy 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.740
 but 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.160
 but now that she is a psychologist I could do the conference on the difference 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.160
 between sympathy and empathy 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.340
 for now, please feel the same as if they were synonyms 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.139
 some psychologists say it impacts her 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.580
 knowing how to know and recognize lost 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.659
 spirit of the other 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:39.409
 the need for information from the other the starting position was and did it 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:41.550
 know and recognize 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.050
 sympathy and more, that is, not only does he know how to share the state 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.509
 mood of the high for which 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.430
 a mother towards her child is not only empathetic 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.110
 she is nice if the child is happy the mother is happy if the child is sad 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.360
 mom is sad 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.999
 a psychiatrist 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:03.949
 I expect that if I go and get treatment, I expect it to be empathetic with me 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.270
 I hope you do not become nice because if I'm sick, this morning he too xd not 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.969
 I know which of the two helps the other 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:15.729
 as sympathy with the next patia includes sion 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:19.449
 There is a feeling of emotions and feelings together with 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:21.460
 your reader 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.659
 if you owe from bad news 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:25.629
 use a style 

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:26.759
 adequate 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:28.470
 that is, do not tell him not writable 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:34.810
 I am pleased to announce that he is not even able to attend the competition 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.189
 I am pleased to announce that he fired you 

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:41.259
 it is not only an inadequate style and also an entirely inadequate emotional tone 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:45.099
 penultimate extravagance what extravagance 

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:46.759

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.389

 the elephants of even those an institution of shit-field borders 

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:00.839
 you can't do strange things 

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:03.839
 just to do something different from others 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.659
 it means overpaying which means paying 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:10.259

 kiss even if I loved you just a tool now is a passage 

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:21.149
 conceptual 

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:27.609
 which invites extravagance ie invites you to try nice sized street styles 

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:29.949
 content 

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:35.020
 different from the usual rudy guede word today is still predominantly words 

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:39.110
 but you can put pictures on it, you can today hear the sounds you can 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.300
 put yourself in the movies 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.139
 you can interact with your help 

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:45.300
 companies on a page vr 

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.469

00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:54.300
 or not 

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.720
 that page with the link invites the reader ada 

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.160
 to interact 

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.720
 but who is this something different from the book the book interacts virtually 

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.939
 2b interacts 

00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:05.300
 really 

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.800
 if in the end you put a phone number an e-mail invite reader a
