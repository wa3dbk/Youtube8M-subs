00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
had mud and stuff on him and have it on

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.120 
had mud and stuff on him and have it on
just<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:53.580> freshly<00:01:54.229> off<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.470> boat<00:01:55.709> and<00:01:55.740> ready

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
just like freshly off the boat and ready

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.040 
just like freshly off the boat and ready
to<00:01:56.310> kill<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.759> basically<00:01:57.690> that's<00:01:57.840> my

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
to kill so basically that's my

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.020 
to kill so basically that's my
interpretation<00:01:58.349> of<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.190> whole<00:01:59.369> scene<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.000> I

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
interpretation of the whole scene so I

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.639 
interpretation of the whole scene so I
didn't<00:02:00.360> want<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.599> just<00:02:00.780> paint<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.140> model<00:02:01.319> I
