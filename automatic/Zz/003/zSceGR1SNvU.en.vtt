00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
a name of the game it definitely

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.400 
a name of the game it definitely
improved<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.700> production<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.420> our<00:00:39.629> mind<00:00:39.899> so

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
improved the production on our mind so

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.190 
improved the production on our mind so
you<00:00:41.250> can<00:00:41.399> do<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.760> much<00:00:41.940> more<00:00:42.149> work<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.809> with

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
you can do so much more work with with

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.110 
you can do so much more work with with
basically<00:00:43.710> one<00:00:43.829> Operator<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.789> that's<00:00:44.910> what

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
basically one Operator and that's what

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.619 
basically one Operator and that's what
makes<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.600> feasible<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.620> have<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.100> machine

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
makes it feasible to have the machine

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.900 
makes it feasible to have the machine
this<00:00:48.629> machine<00:00:48.840> isn't<00:00:49.530> just<00:00:49.770> about

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
this machine isn't just about

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.700 
this machine isn't just about
productivity<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.449> also<00:00:51.690> about<00:00:52.110> comfort

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
productivity it's also about comfort
