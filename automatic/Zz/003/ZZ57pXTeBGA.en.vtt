and<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:03.030> straps<00:02:03.509> are<00:02:03.869> very<00:02:04.320> easy<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.890> adjust

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
and the straps are very easy to adjust

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.859 
and the straps are very easy to adjust
if<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.469> lift<00:02:07.710> up<00:02:07.829> underneath<00:02:08.190> here<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:09.720> can

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
if you lift up underneath here you can

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.680 
if you lift up underneath here you can
see<00:02:10.080> there's<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.349> little<00:02:10.590> mechanism<00:02:10.979> for<00:02:11.400> that

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
see there's a little mechanism for that

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.480 
see there's a little mechanism for that
kind<00:02:12.530> of<00:02:12.560> hard<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.800> see<00:02:12.980> what<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.190> way<00:02:13.340> the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
kind of hard to see what the way the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.160 
kind of hard to see what the way the
camera<00:02:13.880> is<00:02:15.460> it<00:02:16.460> isn't<00:02:16.700> light<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.330> won't<00:02:17.600> lie<00:02:17.750> and

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
camera is it isn't light I won't lie and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.860 
camera is it isn't light I won't lie and
say<00:02:18.350> that<00:02:18.380> it's<00:02:18.740> super<00:02:19.160> light<00:02:19.370> it's<00:02:20.330> heavier

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
say that it's super light it's heavier

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.300 
say that it's super light it's heavier
than<00:02:20.900> maybe<00:02:21.290> some<00:02:21.410> of<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.680> car<00:02:21.860> seats<00:02:22.160> that

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
than maybe some of the car seats that

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.690 
than maybe some of the car seats that
you're<00:02:22.580> used<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.060> from<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.990> 90s<00:02:24.620> but<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.250> also

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
you're used to from the 90s but I also

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.160 
you're used to from the 90s but I also
believe<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.060> what<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:26.390> comes<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.930> little

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
believe that what that comes a little

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.720 
believe that what that comes a little
bit<00:02:27.350> of<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:28.010> sturdier<00:02:28.690> safety<00:02:29.690> feature<00:02:30.010> now<00:02:31.010> one

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
bit of a sturdier safety feature now one

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.260 
bit of a sturdier safety feature now one
thing<00:02:31.970> about<00:02:32.030> this<00:02:32.660> is<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:34.100> takes<00:02:34.460> a<00:02:34.910> little

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
thing about this is it takes a little

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.150 
thing about this is it takes a little
bit<00:02:35.390> more<00:02:35.450> than<00:02:35.780> just<00:02:35.960> a<00:02:36.110> regular<00:02:36.320> lift<00:02:36.860> up<00:02:37.010> on

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
bit more than just a regular lift up on

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.540 
bit more than just a regular lift up on
a<00:02:37.190> handle<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:38.840> get<00:02:39.560> all<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:39.860> car<00:02:40.100> seat<00:02:40.310> there's

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
a handle to get all the car seat there's

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.370 
a handle to get all the car seat there's
actually<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:43.120> little<00:02:44.120> mechanism<00:02:44.810> there<00:02:45.050> and

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
actually a little mechanism there and

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.230 
actually a little mechanism there and
there's<00:02:45.680> another<00:02:45.950> mechanism<00:02:46.640> so<00:02:47.120> it's

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
there's another mechanism so it's

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.360 
there's another mechanism so it's
actually<00:02:47.690> like<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:47.930> two-handed<00:02:48.740> thing<00:02:49.070> to<00:02:49.250> get

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
actually like a two-handed thing to get

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.350 
actually like a two-handed thing to get
it<00:02:49.460> out<00:02:49.550> of<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.670> car<00:02:49.850> seat

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
it out of the car seat

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.830 
it out of the car seat
which<00:02:50.870> isn't<00:02:51.050> bad<00:02:52.000> as<00:02:53.000> far<00:02:53.270> as<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.750> know

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
which isn't bad as far as you know

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.600 
which isn't bad as far as you know
really<00:02:54.620> making<00:02:54.800> sure<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.040> car<00:02:55.280> seat<00:02:55.490> is

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
really making sure the car seat is

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.310 
really making sure the car seat is
secure<00:02:55.970> but<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.570> can<00:02:56.810> be<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:56.960> little<00:02:57.170> difficult

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
secure but it can be a little difficult

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.950 
secure but it can be a little difficult
if<00:02:57.860> you're<00:02:57.980> dealing<00:02:58.370> with<00:02:58.400> you<00:02:58.880> know<00:02:59.000> my

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
if you're dealing with you know my

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.140 
if you're dealing with you know my
c-section<00:03:00.680> when<00:03:01.310> he<00:03:01.400> came<00:03:01.520> out<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.760> hospital

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
c-section when he came out the hospital

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.720 
c-section when he came out the hospital
is<00:03:02.210> kind<00:03:02.420> of<00:03:02.480> hard<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.690> get<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.230> car<00:03:03.380> seat<00:03:03.590> out

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
is kind of hard to get the car seat out

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.460 
is kind of hard to get the car seat out
by<00:03:04.730> myself<00:03:05.240> I<00:03:05.420> actually<00:03:05.600> needed<00:03:05.900> my<00:03:06.110> husband

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
by myself I actually needed my husband

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.350 
by myself I actually needed my husband
to<00:03:06.530> help<00:03:06.710> me<00:03:06.830> do<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.070> but<00:03:07.580> once<00:03:07.880> it's<00:03:08.120> in<00:03:08.270> it's

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
to help me do that but once it's in it's

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.140 
to help me do that but once it's in it's
really<00:03:09.140> an<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:09.950> I<00:03:10.280> wish<00:03:10.670> you<00:03:10.790> could<00:03:10.910> show<00:03:11.090> you

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
really an and I wish you could show you

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.570 
really an and I wish you could show you
how<00:03:11.390> buckles<00:03:11.780> into<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.110> car<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:12.890> there's

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
how buckles into the car and there's

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.490 
how buckles into the car and there's
actually<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:13.940> three<00:03:14.240> step<00:03:14.600> snap<00:03:15.020> and<00:03:15.320> lock

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
actually a three step snap and lock

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.560 
actually a three step snap and lock
mechanism<00:03:16.190> that<00:03:16.370> makes<00:03:16.580> sure<00:03:16.670> that<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:17.120> the

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
mechanism that makes sure that the the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.180 
mechanism that makes sure that the the
car<00:03:17.840> seat<00:03:18.110> belt<00:03:18.320> isn't<00:03:18.530> going<00:03:18.740> to<00:03:18.890> slide

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
car seat belt isn't going to slide

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.790 
car seat belt isn't going to slide
through<00:03:19.520> and<00:03:19.880> then<00:03:20.420> of<00:03:20.540> course<00:03:20.650> there's<00:03:21.650> also

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
through and then of course there's also

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.650 
through and then of course there's also
the<00:03:21.950> latch<00:03:22.250> system<00:03:22.640> if<00:03:23.030> you're<00:03:23.209> dealing<00:03:23.480> with

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
the latch system if you're dealing with

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.860 
the latch system if you're dealing with
a<00:03:23.750> car<00:03:23.990> that<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.860> allows<00:03:25.130> for<00:03:25.459> that<00:03:25.550> so<00:03:25.970> all<00:03:26.660> in

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
a car that it allows for that so all in

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.260 
a car that it allows for that so all in
all<00:03:26.959> it's<00:03:27.380> a<00:03:27.500> good-looking<00:03:28.160> car<00:03:28.340> seat<00:03:28.640> that

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
all it's a good-looking car seat that

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.770 
all it's a good-looking car seat that
works<00:03:29.630> for<00:03:29.900> babies<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.970> know<00:03:32.030> five<00:03:32.750> six

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
works for babies you know five six

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.280 
works for babies you know five six
pounds<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:33.740> up<00:03:34.510> while<00:03:35.510> they're<00:03:35.780> in<00:03:35.990> the

pounds and up while they're in the
rear-facing<00:03:36.709> position<00:03:37.250> which<00:03:38.000> is<00:03:38.240> gosh<00:03:39.050> I

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
rear-facing position which is gosh I

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.590 
rear-facing position which is gosh I
think<00:03:39.560> almost<00:03:39.860> two<00:03:40.160> years<00:03:40.340> of<00:03:40.489> age<00:03:40.640> now<00:03:40.940> I'm

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
think almost two years of age now I'm

think almost two years of age now I'm
depending<00:03:42.020> on<00:03:42.140> your<00:03:42.260> state<00:03:42.530> so<00:03:42.860> if<00:03:43.640> you're

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
depending on your state so if you're

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.390 
depending on your state so if you're
looking<00:03:43.910> for<00:03:44.270> something<00:03:44.480> really<00:03:44.860> secure<00:03:45.860> it

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
looking for something really secure it

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.930 
looking for something really secure it
cleans<00:03:46.700> up<00:03:46.850> pretty<00:03:47.090> easy<00:03:48.670> once<00:03:49.670> you<00:03:49.760> get<00:03:49.880> the

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
cleans up pretty easy once you get the

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.880 
cleans up pretty easy once you get the
hang<00:03:50.060> of<00:03:50.360> it<00:03:50.510> you<00:03:51.020> know<00:03:51.140> it's<00:03:51.320> it's<00:03:51.530> not<00:03:51.650> like

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
hang of it you know it's it's not like

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.710 
hang of it you know it's it's not like
the<00:03:52.100> old<00:03:52.220> car<00:03:52.489> seats<00:03:52.760> you're<00:03:52.910> used<00:03:53.150> to<00:03:53.330> maybe

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
the old car seats you're used to maybe

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.660 
the old car seats you're used to maybe
if<00:03:54.320> you<00:03:54.440> started<00:03:54.680> parenting<00:03:55.070> 15<00:03:55.400> years<00:03:55.580> ago
