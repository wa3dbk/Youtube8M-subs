 There we go now, just shot with the ground. 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.579
 So it's a lot of money sometimes you do not 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.299
 I could not even see all the money I 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.159
 has 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.390
 You're not going to be able to get everything but it's 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.459
 a lot of money 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.440
 I'll ask you not to leave quickly, just to 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.870
 show what happens i did not pause 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.579
 I have not done anything in life, I will leave. 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:42.480
 the car exploded right now if people 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:44.849
 come back quickly 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.510
 there are about 20 seconds and 30 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.120
 seconds 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.049
 comes to that signal is traffic light that can 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.190
 back can come back 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.470
 so I'm making this video because I 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.930
 I discovered this place here and a lot of people. 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.400
 I was not finding a place in the car 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.340
 gta 4 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.310
 In my case the xbox is that I use the xbox 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.989
 gta 4 he does not have that mother of 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.459
 money that gta san andreas provided 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.500
 for us to play two right 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.840
 so I 'm going to take another walk 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.660
 since the strong car has not yet appeared 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.709
 again but it's trustworthy place you 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.359
 You will always find c'mon voltage is 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.900
 easier for him to appear you pick up 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:29.609
 a sling car back there does not 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:32.040
 You need to steal a car there is now a 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:35.010
 something that not everyone always knows is 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.590
 when you use a morning in the gta it goes 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.709
 be recorded on the mobile of the logical gta 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.709
 huh 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:45.120
 remembering that John does not know how to drive him 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:04:01.530
 is a lousy pilot 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:04:03.780
 look there for u ta removed passing now 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.740
 by the same place and if you walk 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.250
 can also overturn that it also has 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.530
 I got some money there, let's turn around. 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.500
 to go and then go back to another 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:19.750
 more on the street full of cars can come back 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.220

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.560

 We'll always be putting more roll 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.270
 the car has arrived on the spot 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.320
 And then you do the same thing as this . 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.760

 It can also be a bazooka if you prefer. 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:50.470
 a bazooka on the lake will have the same 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.060
 amount of money you had before 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.500

 You can do this all the time. 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.950
 remembering that there are at most two thousand 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:09.070
 dollars and dollars in case you then 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.770
