 talk about this game and e 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.820
 starting over with some features 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.549
 beautiful palace- free technique 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.909
 development of some information 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.549
 then development if between is treated by 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:26.869
 I interactive publication by edius 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:30.680

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.320
 stealth shooter and it is set in 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.960
 mind of the real world is just single 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.350
 player and platform multiplayer 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.430
 windows xbox and playstation 3 as engine 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.500
 graphic use a beautiful Venetian glacial 2 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.920

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:53.990
 disks and keyboard input devices 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:57.859
 mouse si size or two shocks 3 game pad ee 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:01.579
 among the 18 and was hitman 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:03.560
 blood money well let's start a little 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.289
 talk about the plot of this 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.630
 agent and in this adventure the agent 47 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.100
 will have to face the contract on 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.650
 contract that dangerous to date 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:19.790
 entrusted the vertices will notice however 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:22.610
 let's say the plot of the game the engine 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.310
 here the game goes around taking us 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.010
 so they are real killers 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.910
 two different ways to deal with the 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.160
 same situation 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.490
 for example and for the policemen to be able 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.760
 choose you simply shoot all 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.850
 sneaking around them short, it gives you 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.150
 truly a 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.410
 in short, you can choose how you like it 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.330
 let your story go 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.630
 for example spinter 6 you can't do 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.580
 what shoots all 130 situation 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.720
 the mission ends , what makes me go 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.450
 man solutions can be done and is one 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.380
 of the most beautiful aspects of the series of 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.630
 hickman then and not to be discovered 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.170
 in this respect the bodies must be hidden 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.950
 very common thing of all stealth e 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.370
 I really play nice hiding places 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.930
 for example the cabinets that for example in 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.780
 splinter cell that now thousand fans pinto 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.060
 6 par with the nearest games I hold them 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.380
 hide and put them in the shade 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.020
 here you can just put them in 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.590
 in short, everywhere it is not there 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:31.610
 no one there is found to put in 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.040
 cabinets throw them down from a window there 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.360
 that's all so the players will have 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.840
 the possibility of placing the 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.630
 well elaborated traps then a little 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.220
 you can also put your mind to 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.890
 place some traps and then something 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.170
 which I note we noticed in my own 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.780
 friends and that agent 47 removed the 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.360
 then bar code behind the head 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.810
 see that you do a little case me 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.950
 I noticed then I don't know is the column 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:08.310
 historical sound hour of aspar kid that is 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.600
 was a big of the sadc hickman and 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.390
 also the compatriot since 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:17.310
 they are really beautiful though here and there 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.220
 limitations on the united states so far 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.580
 only the tail has been announced 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.350
 the south dakota and chicago and there are none 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.260
 there will be gods more Rome map 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:32.100
 indo test that will allow us to understand 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:36.480
 what the guards or ours will do 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.910
 goals in short, it is so much you can 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.860
 say they changed the voice of the people 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:45.960
 47 which was david right and contact 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.500
 of the people of the brown diana agency 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.840
 the neighbor will have a relationship with 47 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.840
 therefore also a somewhat amorous story 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.030
 and the main antagonist will be black 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.400
 dexter which is a sum work to play the 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.449
 kate cordì's voice now comes into 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:06.270
 english well i hope this this 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:09.300

 time to learn a little about knowing 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.389
 better who follows me that I decided to do that 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.060

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.560
