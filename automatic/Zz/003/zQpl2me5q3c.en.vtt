00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.309
 and what can we say it is 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.200
 if it's not a flying object, 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.570
 identified what is 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.560
 if we are not going to ask the commander 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.590
 jorge polanco who is here 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.300
 how many times did you see something similar to what 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.269
 last year 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.930
 good as what the 31 of the night was the 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:26.260
 only experience 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.060
 where for the first time in my life I could 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.180
 appreciate it in shape and size how much I know 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.530
 who fly 25 years ago it 's true that 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.850
 all the pilots or all the people 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.210
 who fly have had some experience 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.090
 of sighting of this type 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.930
 not exactly all but a great 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.430
 amount we have in each other and what 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.809
 is said in yours what 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:52.690
 they saw that it's good what happens is that 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:56.230
 I just think that about 5 o ago 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.070
 6 years to this part is like people 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.589
 he was encouraged to tell it because before there was 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.809
 practically a belotto especially like this 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.579
 they were afraid to talk a lot of people 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.700
 I know and for what reason 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:14.610
 I do not know, I think with Italy I think 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.590
 fundamentally because sometimes that 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.170
 that somehow he was trying to give 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.409
 testimony of what had touched live 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.530
 if I did not have support, it was like I was 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.289
 I was crazy if you saw him his 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.140
 Co-pilot saw it too we saw it four 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.380
 people in the boeing 727 cabin was 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.049
 the first officer the flight engineer 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.000
 and another pilot who was with us in that 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.220
 moment in the cockpit you how 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.220
 rate that was an atmospheric phenomenon 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.660
 this frees you this had size shape 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.220
 dimension was moving in space we 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.050
 accompanied in fact during the 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.660
 final phase approximation 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.730
 good then causes apparently in 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.960
 the airport a blackout a blackout and what 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.180
 remarkable of all this what 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.210
 generates a trajectory subsequent to 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:15.260
 escape from my aircraft where it moves 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:18.460
 low as physical rules that we do not 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.270
 we drive I do not know any aircraft 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.550
 nor any 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.770
 apparatus that man has designed with 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.480
 the technology that we know and 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.490
 in which we want to be well 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.960
 updated those that the size had 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.750
 commander 30 meters in diameter 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:38.130
 approximately it was the gully 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.200
 it was round plate with all its part what 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.290
 that could be appreciated was all in one 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.350
 dark color a gray or almost black no 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.830
 had any kind of window what 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.440
 if he still keeps hitting me very hard 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.750
 in the memory is the fact that all 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.000
 the upper part had as a 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.300
 concentration of energy with a light 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.040
 very strong orange and had something that 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.510
 it attracts a lot of attention that was a 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.130
 kind of cadence 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.340
 as if something that had life and 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.500
 breathing then that struck me 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.300
 very much very close to you it was 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.670
 close and I was accompanying 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.740
 voluntarily we were composing 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.340
 voluntarily good I do not force him 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:23.580
 in fact all this is generated in 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.400
 in about 89 minutes that 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.230
 lasts our initial approach and the 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.769
 contact at first from a 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.410
 light an intense light this until 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.480
 we started to question the 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.500
 tower the tower answers us that it does not have 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.450
 knowledge of another transit 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.010
 we begin to worry because 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.900
 we thought it was an aircraft we did not think 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.780
 at the first moment I could do 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.460
 something unknown had now reduced 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.500
 sensibly the speed because they can 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.270
 go much faster 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.970
 surely good there is something that just 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:59.090
 I heard one of the researchers who 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.280
 I was there talking about and that is true is 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.260
 moves in space in a way that 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.970
 is not conventional for others and as 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.850
 aviator that you think can be 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.930
 product of man is this kind of 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:14.150
 object and I disagree with some 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.250
 testimony that I hear here because 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.320
 I consider that there is no technology today 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.190
 on the earth capable of developing a 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.220
 device or an object that moves from that 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.920
 way because if not 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.530
 I would have to believe what some time 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.820
 someone told me son you are a chosen 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.949
 because I touch you directly 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.370
 so I always said that it touched me 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.410
 but I do not think I'm a chosen 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.180
 if I thought he was a chosen 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.010
 I would have to think then that as 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.250
 someone well said that a power 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.949
 developed a vehicle invested thousands of 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.199
 million dollars and he chose me on 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.270
 31 at night to show me the then 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.800
 I have to believe that I am a chosen 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.060
 In addition to you and the message quantity 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.419
 that we have received the majority of say 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.940
 I had this good experience now 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.949
 I do not usually know why you are from 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.139
 bs for the profession but when to a 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.540
 pilot says I saw him we believe him more than 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.639
 four lists of people must be by 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.710
 I understand, I understand, I understand 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.600
 number of flight hours of the 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.330
 experience that they have there is one thing that 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.530
 It's fundamental 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.360
 specifically what we got 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.890
 live on July 31 with the people of 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.500
 gendarmerie and with the people of the 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.260
 airport this is proven three 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.940
 different planes so we do not 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.050
 we can I can make that mistake but 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.800
 you can not go wrong 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.900
 you have to save that they were above me 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.580
 you can be wrong if you press me 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.110
 but I can not be wrong, I do not know 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:44.380
 you can mistake people the airport 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:47.510
 he never saw me again if he does not tell me 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.460
 if not on August 11 at one thirty 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.710
 in the early morning of colando de trelew da 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.050
 on a night flight to the Galician river 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.500
 the other one and it was similar and in a 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.540
 path well frontal 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.760
 step on the right of the aircraft or 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.220
 well we had to pour trelew a 30 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.900
 am 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:09.270
 the first officer was a bit upset 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.560
 experience I took it with heating not 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.110
 is that canchero let's go simply 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.540
 that I think from the moment that I 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.840
 I lived this open my head in another way 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.640
 that's how life changed, I do not know if it changes my 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.130
 life but I used to be like if 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.480
 there they were there but one thing is that 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:29.960
 is now thanks commander 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.960
 thanks for opening all
