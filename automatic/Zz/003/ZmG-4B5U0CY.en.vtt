00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.110 

now<00:03:01.650> it's<00:03:01.830> time<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.070> find<00:03:02.400> something<00:03:02.700> no<00:03:02.970> we're

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
now it's time to find something no we're

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.180 
now it's time to find something no we're
finding<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.020> outfit<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.470> probably<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.920> most

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
finding the outfit is probably the most

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.800 
finding the outfit is probably the most
difficult<00:03:05.490> thing<00:03:05.820> when<00:03:06.150> going<00:03:06.420> on<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.540> date

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
difficult thing when going on a date

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.210 
difficult thing when going on a date
with<00:03:06.960> Chris<00:03:07.110> just<00:03:07.500> because<00:03:07.770> I<00:03:07.800> want<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.130> look

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
with Chris just because I want to look

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.670 
with Chris just because I want to look
so<00:03:08.490> perfect<00:03:08.760> for<00:03:08.970> him<00:03:09.330> so<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:10.140> just<00:03:10.410> pretty<00:03:10.590> much

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
so perfect for him so I just pretty much

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.800 
so perfect for him so I just pretty much
look<00:03:11.040> through<00:03:11.250> all<00:03:11.430> my<00:03:11.460> dresses<00:03:11.850> my<00:03:12.420> shirts

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
look through all my dresses my shirts

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.840 
look through all my dresses my shirts
and<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.530> just<00:03:13.710> pretty<00:03:13.860> much<00:03:14.100> look<00:03:14.310> until<00:03:14.550> I<00:03:14.610> find

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
and I just pretty much look until I find

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:38.790 
and I just pretty much look until I find
the<00:03:14.940> right<00:03:15.030> thing

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.320 

so<00:03:39.800> I<00:03:39.830> usually<00:03:40.130> find<00:03:40.550> two<00:03:40.790> things<00:03:41.000> that<00:03:41.300> I

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
so I usually find two things that I

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.790 
so I usually find two things that I
think<00:03:41.630> would<00:03:41.750> work<00:03:41.810> so<00:03:42.200> I'm<00:03:42.260> just<00:03:42.350> going<00:03:42.709> to

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
think would work so I'm just going to

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.860 
think would work so I'm just going to
hang<00:03:43.069> that<00:03:43.100> on<00:03:43.430> a<00:03:43.520> little<00:03:44.030> knob<00:03:44.330> over<00:03:44.690> there

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
hang that on a little knob over there

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.570 
hang that on a little knob over there
