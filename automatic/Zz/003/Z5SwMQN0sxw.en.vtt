00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
the code that I've given you is all of

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.060 
the code that I've given you is all of
this<00:00:25.250> lots<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.670> lots<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.000> lots<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.420> code<00:00:28.070> like

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
this lots and lots and lots of code like

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.319 
this lots and lots and lots of code like
that<00:00:29.099> yeah<00:00:29.699> lots<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:31.439> lots<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.340> code<00:00:32.579> now<00:00:33.300> I

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
that yeah lots and lots of code now I

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.000 
that yeah lots and lots of code now I
didn't<00:00:33.719> actually<00:00:33.840> make<00:00:34.170> all<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.680> just<00:00:34.860> put

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
you this little bit of code so it's just

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.660 
you this little bit of code so it's just
setting<00:01:47.790> your<00:01:47.970> Z<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.600> Z<00:01:48.710> trinket<00:01:49.710> said<00:01:49.979> which

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
setting your Z so Z trinket said which

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.319 
setting your Z so Z trinket said which
is<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.850> script<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.570> gets<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.649> height<00:01:53.329> XY

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
is a script that gets the height XY

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.690 
is a script that gets the height XY
minus<00:01:54.960> 5<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.500> then<00:01:55.590> also<00:01:55.770> Zed<00:01:56.130> level<00:01:56.430> which<00:01:56.579> is

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
minus 5 and then also Zed level which is

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.020 
minus 5 and then also Zed level which is
your<00:01:56.820> camera<00:01:57.140> same<00:01:58.140> except<00:01:58.619> for<00:01:58.680> -5<00:01:59.579> plus

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
your camera same except for -5 plus

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.190 
your camera same except for -5 plus
minus<00:02:00.899> 15<00:02:01.320> that'll<00:02:01.950> make<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.219> little<00:02:02.310> higher

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
minus 15 that'll make it a little higher

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.109 
minus 15 that'll make it a little higher
go<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.409> have<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.649> do<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.799> copy<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.280> go<00:02:06.060> to

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
go so I have to do is copy that go to

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.770 
go so I have to do is copy that go to
player<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.920> stick<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.250> step

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
player and stick it in step

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.160 
player and stick it in step
there<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.560> go<00:02:10.710> oh<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:12.300> also<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.780> terrain

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
there you go oh and also in terrain

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.390 
there you go oh and also in terrain
you're<00:02:14.160> gonna<00:02:14.340> want<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.910> set<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.300> floor<00:02:16.400> to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
you're gonna want to set the floor to

walking around it not stuff there we go

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.220 
walking around it not stuff there we go
I'm<00:03:30.090> now<00:03:30.360> on<00:03:30.390> top<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.140> mountain<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:33.230> there's

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
I'm now on top of a mountain and there's

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.720 
I'm now on top of a mountain and there's
lots<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:34.560> other<00:03:34.799> mountains<00:03:35.280> below<00:03:35.519> that

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
lots of other mountains below that

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.910 
lots of other mountains below that
because<00:03:36.209> in<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.080> little<00:03:37.320> picture<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.709> I

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
because in the little picture that I

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.060 
because in the little picture that I
showed<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.220> if<00:03:38.810> it's<00:03:39.810> light<00:03:40.140> then<00:03:40.650> it's<00:03:40.829> high

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
showed you if it's light then it's high

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.090 
showed you if it's light then it's high
so<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:41.970> lighter<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.570> pixels<00:03:43.200> are<00:03:43.350> then<00:03:43.890> the

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
so the lighter the pixels are then the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.479 
so the lighter the pixels are then the
higher<00:03:44.340> it<00:03:44.730> draws<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.329> here<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.130> so<00:03:47.130> that<00:03:47.280> at

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
higher it draws it here and so that at

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.729 
higher it draws it here and so that at
the<00:03:47.519> darkest<00:03:47.940> point<00:03:48.090> it's<00:03:48.450> really<00:03:48.660> low<00:03:48.989> so<00:03:49.620> the

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
the darkest point it's really low so the

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.289 
the darkest point it's really low so the
picture<00:03:50.040> that<00:03:50.070> I<00:03:50.220> showed<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:50.700> was<00:03:51.269> a

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
picture that I showed you was a

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.350 
picture that I showed you was a
basically<00:03:51.870> a<00:03:51.900> little<00:03:52.110> ring<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:53.090> so<00:03:54.090> it

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
basically a little ring and so it

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.229 
basically a little ring and so it
created<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.810> whole<00:03:55.110> humungous<00:03:55.799> ring<00:03:56.239> now

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
created a whole humungous ring now

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.960 
created a whole humungous ring now
you'll<00:03:57.360> notice<00:03:57.570> that<00:03:58.049> when<00:03:59.040> my<00:03:59.310> camera<00:03:59.790> goes

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
you'll notice that when my camera goes

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.569 
you'll notice that when my camera goes
below<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.540> terrain<00:04:01.190> then<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.340> Train

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
below the terrain then the Train

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:03.289 
below the terrain then the Train
disappears

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
disappears

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.210 
disappears
