is switch your jumper on your board and

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.470 
is switch your jumper on your board and
you<00:00:43.100> can<00:00:43.219> make<00:00:43.430> it<00:00:43.460> either<00:00:43.670> normally<00:00:44.149> open<00:00:44.390> or

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
you can make it either normally open or

a couple common common things to know
about<00:00:49.820> this<00:00:50.180> board<00:00:50.649> right<00:00:51.649> here<00:00:51.859> is<00:00:51.920> your

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
about this board right here is your

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.669 
about this board right here is your

memory chip that contains the memory for
whatever<00:00:54.980> property<00:00:55.609> this<00:00:55.850> may<00:00:56.090> be<00:00:56.300> at<00:00:57.219> these

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
whatever property this may be at these

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.759 
whatever property this may be at these
chips<00:00:58.579> you<00:00:58.760> can<00:00:58.879> write<00:00:59.149> to<00:00:59.440> several<00:01:00.440> hundred

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
chips you can write to several hundred

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.799 
chips you can write to several hundred
thousand<00:01:01.280> times<00:01:01.519> but<00:01:01.879> sometimes<00:01:02.300> they<00:01:02.480> do<00:01:02.539> go

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
thousand times but sometimes they do go

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.280 
thousand times but sometimes they do go
bad<00:01:03.160> main<00:01:04.160> processor<00:01:04.820> chip<00:01:05.090> to<00:01:05.720> take<00:01:05.930> that<00:01:06.110> out

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
bad main processor chip to take that out

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.660 
bad main processor chip to take that out
simply<00:01:07.300> undo<00:01:08.300> this<00:01:08.510> lever<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:09.310> you<00:01:10.310> can<00:01:10.460> pull

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
simply undo this lever and you can pull

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.530 
simply undo this lever and you can pull
the<00:01:10.820> chip<00:01:11.030> out<00:01:12.880> another<00:01:13.880> good<00:01:14.150> thing<00:01:14.390> to<00:01:14.510> know

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
the chip out another good thing to know
