00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:17.119
 so I'm having another video 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.029
 class and how to create a pendrive 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:24.989
 taxable with kindle 7 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.829
 this time would be using the program the 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:29.759
 The point is that I'm simpler and more 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.820
 functional 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:36.510
 after I did some testing there was 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.960
 This the conclusion that I got him is 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.890
 very easy to find on the internet no 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.600
 needs to be installed and is very easy to 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.949
 use 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.300
 It's just you type here in research that 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:58.140
 will appear a multitude of sites that 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.809
 you can download it there it's free and 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.089
 It is very easy to download and has no 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.370
 no problem 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.159
 after you have downloaded 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:12.150
 This is going to be what he looks like. 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.979
 I was going to play it here in 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.430
 a folder 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.729
 right-click and select the 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.729
 extract here 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:30.159
 ready all the files have already been 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.159
 extracted 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:39.590
 remembering that before you start 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:42.770
 use the program you will have to have there 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.369
 on your drive already the disk with windows 7 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.079
 in formatted drive 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.659
 if you do not know how to format it is very 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:55.360
 easy to click with the right unit 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:58.549
 pen drive my car format fat32 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:03.399
 formatting will start and I will not go 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.399
 do because mine was already done 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.989
 so let's open the program 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.349
 Click here in this ine 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:26.610
 here is the program interface 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.610
 I'll stay here on this button 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:37.300
 in options and choose Portuguese 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:44.320
 I prefer Portuguese to apply 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:46.960
 ok here we will see in advanced mode and 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.000
 which has several options 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.730
 we will choose this transfer of 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.720
 Installation for Windows 7 list 2008 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:59.040
 How's that going to be the set? 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.040
 choose this option here 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.719
 and we stayed in running 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:12.040
 here we will have to indicate where the 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.040
 windows disk 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:24.320
 in my case it's in the letter h is it 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:27.130
 ok here we will have to indicate where it is 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.130
 the pen drive 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.850
 in my case it's in the letter that 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.780
 characterizes then 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:42.120
 Okay, and we're going to click this button now. 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:46.350
 Correia is in Portuguese from Portugal 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.140
 then it would start if it were Portuguese 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.740
 Brazilian plus one Portuguese Portuguese is 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.740
 die 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:04:02.130
 let's put in accepting the continuous 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:04.620
 ok and he already started copying there 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.190
 files as this is a little time consuming 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.030
 so I'll take a break here in the video 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:15.510
 and I'll be back the time he is 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:19.940
 completed here, so it was already copied 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.940
 100% we can already close 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.340
 Let's open our pen drive to 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.340
 see how it got 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.790
 here it is already with the symbol of the 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:42.940
 Windows 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:46.810
 Let's open it and give it two clicks here. 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.250
 opened the window for the installation of the 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.890
 Windows 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.580
 I will not want to install more if 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:57.010
 I just wanted to go on, so this is it 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.240
 I hope it has been helpful to 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.100

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.100
