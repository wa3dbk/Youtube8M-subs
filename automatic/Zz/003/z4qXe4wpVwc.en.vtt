IQ<00:00:09.389> level<00:00:09.980> well<00:00:10.980> started<00:00:11.849> off<00:00:12.000> there's

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
IQ level well started off there's

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.550 
IQ level well started off there's
another<00:00:13.340> double<00:00:14.340> nuclear<00:00:14.670> yep<00:00:14.910> by<00:00:15.660> IJ's<00:00:16.289> this

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
another double nuclear yep by IJ's this

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.130 
another double nuclear yep by IJ's this
time<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:17.490> could<00:00:17.640> be<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.789> second<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.480> think<00:00:18.960> he's

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
time this could be a second I think he's

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.269 
time this could be a second I think he's
definitely<00:00:19.590> been<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> channel<00:00:20.220> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
definitely been on the channel and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.950 
definitely been on the channel and
started<00:00:20.550> out<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.760> first<00:00:20.970> nuclear<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.600> weeks<00:00:21.810> do

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
started out the first nuclear I weeks do

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.420 
started out the first nuclear I weeks do
that<00:00:22.199> I'm<00:00:22.619> gonna<00:00:22.740> do<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.010> from<00:00:23.130> now<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.400> unless

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
that I'm gonna do it from now on unless

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.790 
that I'm gonna do it from now on unless
the<00:00:23.820> first<00:00:24.029> one<00:00:24.210> was<00:00:24.330> incredible<00:00:25.050> something

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
the first one was incredible something

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.070 
the first one was incredible something
special<00:00:26.119> anyways<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.269> second<00:00:27.630> nuclear<00:00:28.019> in

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
special anyways the second nuclear in

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.570 
special anyways the second nuclear in
this<00:00:28.199> game<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.560> what<00:00:28.740> special<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.369> three

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
this game is what special it's a three

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.700 
this game is what special it's a three
minute<00:00:29.609> nuclear<00:00:30.300> what<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:30.900> consider<00:00:31.380> a

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
minute nuclear what I consider a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.000 
minute nuclear what I consider a
definitely<00:00:32.340> perfect<00:00:32.730> pass<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.469> really<00:00:34.469> don't

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
definitely perfect pass I really don't

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.680 
definitely perfect pass I really don't
see<00:00:35.160> any<00:00:35.370> new<00:00:35.489> clears<00:00:35.790> quicker<00:00:36.300> than<00:00:36.480> that

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
see any new clears quicker than that

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.630 
see any new clears quicker than that
anything<00:00:37.649> longers<00:00:38.570> just<00:00:39.570> longer<00:00:40.520> what<00:00:41.520> we've

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
anything longers just longer what we've

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.430 
anything longers just longer what we've
been<00:00:41.760> out<00:00:42.210> what<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.510> want<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> go<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.410> a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
been out what I want to go for is a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.010 
been out what I want to go for is a
minute<00:00:43.920> nuclear<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.600> don't<00:00:45.600> think<00:00:45.660> that's<00:00:45.870> been

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
minute nuclear I don't think that's been

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.110 
minute nuclear I don't think that's been
done<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.440> think<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> longest<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.250> 69<00:00:47.700> seconds

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
done I think the longest is 69 seconds

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.049 
done I think the longest is 69 seconds
which<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.140> always<00:00:49.289> think<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.680> okay<00:00:50.520> that's<00:00:50.730> BK

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
which I always think of a okay that's BK

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.350 
which I always think of a okay that's BK
in<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> background<00:00:51.600> he<00:00:51.719> does<00:00:51.930> get<00:00:52.079> irritating

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
in the background he does get irritating

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.630 
in the background he does get irritating
I'm<00:00:54.360> trying<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.840> do<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:55.230> too<00:00:56.070> many<00:00:56.250> nuclear

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
I'm trying to do with too many nuclear

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.209 
I'm trying to do with too many nuclear
we<00:00:56.789> had<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> nuclear<00:00:57.539> with<00:00:57.660> attack<00:00:57.930> 45<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:59.039> was

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
we had a nuclear with attack 45 it was

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.930 
we had a nuclear with attack 45 it was
almost<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.699> double<00:01:00.260> BS<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> death<00:01:01.829> well<00:01:02.609> at

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
almost a double BS on the death well at

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.420 
almost a double BS on the death well at
least<00:01:03.059> that's<00:01:03.300> coming<00:01:03.780> from<00:01:03.809> him<00:01:04.220> it<00:01:05.220> was<00:01:05.400> a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
least that's coming from him it was a

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.240 
least that's coming from him it was a
pretty<00:01:05.640> BS<00:01:06.000> def<00:01:06.299> they'll<00:01:06.920> probably<00:01:07.920> think<00:01:08.130> he

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
pretty BS def they'll probably think he

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.130 
pretty BS def they'll probably think he
has<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> mater<00:01:08.640> everyone<00:01:09.150> who's<00:01:09.420> semi-auto

oh<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.689> close<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.110> double<00:01:19.409> nuclear<00:01:19.740> don't

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
oh so close to a double nuclear don't

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.230 
oh so close to a double nuclear don't
know<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.100> anyone's<00:01:20.430> gone<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.700> double<00:01:20.939> nuclear

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
know if anyone's gone to double nuclear

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.800 
know if anyone's gone to double nuclear
with<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.479> gun<00:01:21.659> yet<00:01:21.869> seen<00:01:22.830> cap<00:01:23.040> 40s<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.820> think

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
with that gun yet seen cap 40s I think

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.929 
with that gun yet seen cap 40s I think
be<00:01:24.930> 20<00:01:25.380> are<00:01:25.500> maybe<00:01:26.689> anyways<00:01:27.799> he's<00:01:28.939> that's

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
be 20 are maybe anyways he's that's

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.940 
be 20 are maybe anyways he's that's
where<00:01:30.119> guys<00:01:30.299> think<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.290> short<00:01:31.710> gameplay

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
where guys think this is short gameplay

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.640 
where guys think this is short gameplay
not<00:01:32.549> an<00:01:32.700> axe<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.119> not<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.360> short<00:01:33.659> running

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
not an axe it's not that short running

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.330 
not an axe it's not that short running
with<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.070> MSMC<00:01:36.500> hopefully<00:01:37.500> fast<00:01:37.710> max<00:01:38.009> you'd

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
with the MSMC hopefully fast max you'd

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.030 
with the MSMC hopefully fast max you'd
better<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.700> fast<00:01:38.939> 90<00:01:39.390> degree<00:01:39.780> yep<00:01:40.110> fast<00:01:40.740> mags

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
better have fast 90 degree yep fast mags

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.550 
better have fast 90 degree yep fast mags

to<00:01:45.000> upload<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.689> four-man<00:01:46.290> nuclear<00:01:46.740> i'm

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
to upload a four-man nuclear i'm

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.590 
to upload a four-man nuclear i'm
installing<00:01:47.610> out<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.180> i'm<00:01:48.329> gonna<00:01:48.420> go

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.630 
installing out on that i'm gonna go
tomorrow<00:01:48.899> for<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.380> double<00:01:49.680> nucular<00:01:50.009> not<00:01:50.460> me

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
tomorrow for a double nucular not me

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.090 
tomorrow for a double nucular not me
upload<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.659> one<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.110> then<00:01:52.229> put<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> four-man

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
upload that one and then put a four-man

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.910 
upload that one and then put a four-man
new<00:01:53.280> killer<00:01:53.720> it

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
new killer it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.190 
new killer it
I've<00:01:55.670> just<00:01:55.729> been<00:01:55.970> stalling<00:01:56.299> on<00:01:56.540> it<00:01:56.659> I<00:01:56.810> think<00:01:57.140> it

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
I've just been stalling on it I think it

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.859 
I've just been stalling on it I think it
was<00:01:57.229> a<00:01:57.380> for<00:01:57.650> first<00:01:58.369> full<00:01:58.880> team<00:01:59.150> nuclear<00:01:59.720> ever

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
was a for first full team nuclear ever

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.330 
was a for first full team nuclear ever

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
double nucular nuclear nuclear IJ's was

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.300 
double nucular nuclear nuclear IJ's was
in<00:02:07.250> that<00:02:07.539> better<00:02:08.539> to<00:02:08.720> get<00:02:08.810> him<00:02:08.929> famous<00:02:09.310> first

tomorrow<00:02:20.870> will<00:02:21.140> be<00:02:21.230> double<00:02:21.470> nuclear<00:02:21.830> four-man

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
tomorrow will be double nuclear four-man

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.360 
tomorrow will be double nuclear four-man
nucular<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.319> then<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.530> next<00:02:24.560> day<00:02:24.890> will<00:02:25.220> be

nucular and then the next day will be

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.660 
nucular and then the next day will be
the<00:02:25.930> pistol<00:02:26.930> nuclear<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.100> I'm<00:02:28.250> running<00:02:28.430> at<00:02:28.640> a

small next they spawn a recent spot if
you're<00:03:02.600> all<00:03:02.900> alone<00:03:03.109> in<00:03:03.410> multi<00:03:03.829> team<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.310> think

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
you're all alone in multi team I think

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.330 
you're all alone in multi team I think
any<00:03:05.630> game<00:03:05.870> mode<00:03:06.049> specifically<00:03:06.829> hard<00:03:07.100> point

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
any game mode specifically hard point

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.060 
any game mode specifically hard point
though<00:03:07.690> I'm<00:03:08.690> sure<00:03:08.959> it's<00:03:09.260> just<00:03:09.530> bound<00:03:09.950> to

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
though I'm sure it's just bound to

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.590 
though I'm sure it's just bound to
happen<00:03:10.220> where<00:03:10.519> teams<00:03:10.760> gonna<00:03:10.940> spawn<00:03:11.209> next<00:03:11.540> to
