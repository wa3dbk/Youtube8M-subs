part I wasn't able to figure out because

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.089 
part I wasn't able to figure out because
on<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.390> recording<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.349> has<00:02:33.380> this<00:02:33.680> you<00:02:33.950> don't

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
choir in the background and that really

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.820 
choir in the background and that really
messes<00:02:35.720> me<00:02:35.900> up<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.200> can't<00:02:36.410> hear<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.650> piano

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
twice and then be natural so though and

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.289 
twice and then be natural so though and
it<00:03:29.750> does<00:03:29.900> that<00:03:30.079> till<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.260> end<00:03:30.590> um<00:03:31.180> so<00:03:32.180> the

it does that till the end um so the

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:33.970

chords<00:03:32.600> like<00:03:32.780> I<00:03:32.930> said<00:03:33.140> I'm<00:03:33.260> not<00:03:33.410> sure<00:03:33.470> if<00:03:33.739> I<00:03:33.799> got

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
chords like I said I'm not sure if I got

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.590 
chords like I said I'm not sure if I got
them<00:03:34.160> right<00:03:34.370> but<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:34.880> think<00:03:35.180> they're<00:03:35.390> just

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
them right but I think they're just

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.160 
them right but I think they're just
doing

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.020 

and<00:03:39.590> I'm<00:03:39.740> not<00:03:39.830> even<00:03:39.890> sure<00:03:40.100> really<00:03:40.400> what<00:03:40.490> chords

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
and I'm not even sure really what chords

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.690 
and I'm not even sure really what chords
but<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:41.540> be<00:03:41.630> safe<00:03:41.810> you<00:03:41.840> can<00:03:42.140> just<00:03:42.290> do<00:03:42.470> C<00:03:43.430> sharp

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
but to be safe you can just do C sharp

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.420 
but to be safe you can just do C sharp
minor<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.150> then<00:03:44.420> e<00:03:44.690> major<00:03:45.190> that<00:03:46.190> almost

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430
