00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.240 
support so not only are we helping
ground<00:00:47.840> forces<00:00:48.140> see<00:00:48.500> what<00:00:48.710> they<00:00:48.830> need<00:00:48.890> to<00:00:49.070> see

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
ground forces see what they need to see

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.490 
ground forces see what they need to see
but<00:00:50.000> if<00:00:50.120> they're<00:00:50.300> in<00:00:50.330> trouble<00:00:50.450> we<00:00:51.320> have

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
but if they're in trouble we have

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.830 
but if they're in trouble we have
weapons<00:00:51.680> that<00:00:52.100> can<00:00:52.310> support<00:00:52.910> suppressing<00:00:53.720> the
