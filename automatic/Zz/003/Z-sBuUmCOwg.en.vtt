00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.260
 hi girls here I am again with a 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.469
 new tutorial and the tutorial of the day of 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.740
 Today is about this makeup in shades 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.920
 purple and gray like a plum tone and I 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.650
 really loved making this combination 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.670
 I hope you also love them 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.670
 so let's start 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.060
 good girls I always to apply 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.829
 before my shadow I applied a prize for 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.510
 my eyes 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.940
 remember that you also have to apply it 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.420
 in the lower eyelid if they are going to apply 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.420
 shadow 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.640
 I'm going to use this brush to apply 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.829
 my shadow I will be applying this 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.379
 shadow that is gray pulling 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.309
 silver flashes and I'm going to apply 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:04.309
 only on my mobile eyelid 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.309
 to 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.380
 the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.870
 then I will use this brush that 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.720
 it's like to blur just that it's a 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.450
 little bit smaller and I'm going to apply this 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.880
 orange color earth I like very much 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.120
 use it as you see is already a little 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.330
 spent and I apply it in my basin 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.330
 eye this is to go creating a gradient 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.630
 ah 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.360
 then he used another brush to 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.330
 blur and apply this shadow in color 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.330
 he came to mix both shadows 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.959
 I re-apply the silver color in the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.630
 eyelid mobile so that this does not go 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.390
 losing the intensity we blur with 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.500
 a brush to blur so that 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.500
 folds are disappearing 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.870
 then with a flat brush I will be 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.569
 applying me this shadow which is a color 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.060
 Purple also with silver sparkles or 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.909
 silver frost and I'm going to apply 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.340
 only in the center of my eyelid 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:41.720
 this is to give a little light 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.720
 to that area 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:50.099
 then with a fine synthetic brush 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.829
 little girl I'm going to apply this shadow on 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:56.010
 cream and I'll apply it in the corner 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:59.189
 of my tear to create a little light 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.709
 in that area later with a brush like that 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:04.739
 little girl I will apply this shadow 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.790
 beige I like it very much and applied it in 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.790
 the bone of my eyebrows 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:19.050
 with a black pencil I'm going to outline my 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.050
 water line lower and higher 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.640
 Then with liquid eyeliner I'll 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.470
 delineate my eyelid 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.510
 remember that I have a video about how 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.980
 I delineate my eyes and I will be 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.230
 leaving the link in the box 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.209
 information 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.249
 I'm going to curl my eyelashes and I'm going to 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.620
 apply these false eyelashes 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:44.879
 remember that as I always tell you this 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.879
 part is optional 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.770
 and after the 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.540
 glue I go back to delineate to go 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.540
 clogging glue lumps 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.549
 I'm going to apply this corrector to go 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.549
 cleaning this area of â€‹â€‹my face 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.340
 and I'm going to use this sponge that I 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.360
 I have already told you about it 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.360
 I love it very much 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.630
 also do not forget that you have to apply 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.989
 Eyelash mascara on the eyelashes 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.730
 inferior and superior than equal when 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.850
 apply false eyelashes have to 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.930
 Apply mask so that both tabs 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.930
 mix 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.310
 to 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.950

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.580
 then I will apply my favorite base 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:46.750
 all over my face and I'm going to blur it 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.750
