00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.799
 to renew its fleet and meet the 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.039
 criteria established by the company 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.150
 metropolitan urban transport 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.430
 manager of intercity transport 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.960
 metropolitan area of ​​the 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.110
 paraiba and north coast 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.610
 abc transports of taubaté presented 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.770
 the authorities to define and 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.960
 press 15 new cars 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.110
 evandro losacco operational director of 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.059
 mated that this incorporation is 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.070
 part of the measures necessary to 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.079
 adjustment to company procedures 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.760
 manager of intercity transport 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.520
 in the region 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.489
 the state owns the bus lines 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.280
 intermarriage that gives a permit 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:58.399
 for the cleaned operator to do so. 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:00.530
 avionics operation in case here abc 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.410
 so what we 're seeing here is a 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.130
 investment of the operating company in 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.290
 renew 100% of the fleet that meets this 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.630
 region here my mother gave taubaté 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.909
 tremembe and also with extension to 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.830
 hunt our lines that will be 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.750
 covered with the bus without being 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.700
 renewed zero kilometer 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.600
 the euro 5 which is a less fuel 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.920
 pollutant is not accessible with all 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.060
 eyes will have elevators to 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.270
 wheelchairs 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.930
 so be it is a fleet that will improve 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.390
 the quality of transport in the region 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.640
 leading to the elderly. 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.210
 some criterion as determined by the 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.820
 law 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.600
 this is a state law to state law 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.520
 of the gratuity of the elderly over 65 years 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.720
 then when they enter the system 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.420
 state that the intermunicipal only accepts 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.909
 been over 65 years and said that 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.840
 if new cars have all the 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.520
 sensitivity 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.409
 there is also the monitoring of 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.890
 security by internal cameras 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.720
 if not some buses turn this around 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.119
 this is a process that little by little the 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.129
 companies are putting it is not but in these 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.610
 here are still being delivered but not 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:16.040
 in the near future must have all 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.650
 monitoring we are doing is 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.870
 installing gps we have today 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.209
 there in São Bernardo is a center 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.580
 operating the entire fleet. 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.010
 intermunicipal the fifth version of the valley 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.530
 of paraiba with gps being installed 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.510
 and I believe the same month a little we 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.520
 We will be controlling the entire fleet. 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.870
 through a GPS system with a 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.780
 location 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.770
 this will give greater control of the 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:47.000
 of the departure bus itinerary is 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.890
 to avoid the excess of passengers and 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.989
 lack all maintenance of these cars 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.080
 then it would be the responsibility of the 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.330
 concessionaire abc exactly the same as the 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.340
 operator who maintains the dream 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.739
 is the owner of the vehicle 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.020
 the state only manages other providence 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.790
 already in progress refers to the 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.980
 installation of so-called purposes 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.930
 bus terminals, preferably 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.060
 near via dutra we are 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.069
 studying together with the mayor there 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.930
 Vitor go there we already have a 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.470
 claim that we call 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.110
 purposes that are mini terminals, do not 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.239
 will have a redevelopment of the environment 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.370
 so that there is a bus stop with a 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.470
 little right infrastructure 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.810
 both the engines with the users of the 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.250
 lines we are already studying here where 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.459
 probably did not see the first 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.769
 must be moreira caesar and already 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.290
 implement this purpose here in the region 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.440
 the fare for these buses is how it was 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.390
 considered the tariff remains the same 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.360
 is being charged today only with a 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.120
 fleet at our rate it is 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.940
 according to the mileage of the 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:57.349
 line is because one is a grid 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.239
 kilometer input varies from 2 75 up to 3 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.489
 and cute real depending on the line 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.010
 second hand to nair representing the 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.230
 permission to go down the company is 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.129
 promoting the renewal in 5% of its 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.720
 fleet a jump in quality of 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:15.020
 transport of the region 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.750
 then your known is the managing body 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.670
 very capable staff that is sure to 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.000
 contribute greatly to the quality of 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:26.150
 service you want to print in the region 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.560
 currently the service of winning 180 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.020
 thousand passengers per month 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.170
 comprising in the lines pinda taubaté 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.170
 by the old road pinda taubaté travel 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:39.050
 from santana tremembé caçapava tremembé 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.170
 taubaté there was santana garden and tremembé 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.180
 taubaté via bica da glory new cars 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.720
 meet current abnt standards 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.420
 Brazilian Association of Technical Standards 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.060
 as accessibility security is 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.790
 other detail highlighted on normal days 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.310
 or on rainy days the speed of 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:01.010
 automatically adjusted 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.680
 including preventing buses from departing 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.930
 in second gear and with doors open 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.610
 the mayor vitor ardito highlighted the 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.430
 importance of the presentation of the new 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.220

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.590
 with another brown bird 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.480
 permission to replace 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.920
 a large part of its fleet 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.600
 obeying the same criteria as mt and 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.390
 very important in our region more 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.000
 new eyes to sensitize a bus 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.130
 days saw another important then 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.710
 population will be well served 15 new 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:38.540
 today 31 the whip and 15 today will give a 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.970
 very special attention to everyone 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.090
 claiming 26 copy telescopes 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.490
 illegal state government that in the background 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.650
 do this job I think this is the 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.110
 our governor-general today I have 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.480
 our metropolitan region mind and this 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.190
 appreciated that he changed all this 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.530
 work so today is a day too 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.569
 important in the city 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.610
 we are 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:02.770
 the staff of são paulo return and 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:06.099
 Rolling down to bring those buses 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.409
 delivery to the population , taking legal opinion 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:10.360
 talked about the purposes of 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:13.149
 terminals that can be installed and 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.539
 prediction of the former and moreira caesar is 

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:18.309
 Truth we can 116 pre-project 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:19.869
 remembering year claimed that são paulo 

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:21.550
 there is a possibility that people 

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:23.469
 do there in moreira caesar 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.289
 the first terminal of moreira caesar 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:28.749
 we have to own a land and a 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:30.490
 We are going with this urban terminal is 

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:32.830
 important modification has already won 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.139
 enough because we have many incursions there 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.119
 is close to the other location that we 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:38.979
 we will expropriate and it will give the 

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:41.889
 conditions by the population 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:44.680
 of the district is a first 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:46.930
 moreira caesar km already have and we are 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.119
 thinking also about time beyond the amazon 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.619
 and also gets a bit off the route right 

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:52.629
 You have to get in. 

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:54.430
 if this company will enter into oran then 

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:57.550
 It will take passengers on the line. 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.110
 urban as our dealership 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.539
 then it gets a little difficult 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.499
 but today it is dark to Caesar what we 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:05.019
 let's do it 

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:07.629
 the mayor while the company bird 

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:09.610
 with it is already integrated into the mt or 

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:11.289
 is there any provision for substitution 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.339
 buses or for the inclusion of 

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:14.050
 new vehicles 

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:16.749
 We can even talk and vote as 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.430
 also asking you, I will not talk to you 

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:20.529
 he about this problem today is 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.939
 interesting yes we talk to 

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:24.159
 improving the test fleet has 

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:26.589
 awareness always new proportion 

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:28.360
 accessibility needs to enter the 

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:29.860
 bus that we have people who 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.240
 need this work 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.240
 Let's work up said
