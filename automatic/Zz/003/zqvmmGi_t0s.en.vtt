00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:18.450
 and so hello in this video I 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.170
 talk about how to install 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.090
 Main bearings on the crankshaft from 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.670
 Soviet motorcycles but basically they all 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.500
 the same that I have in what you eat well, except there 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.050
 Ural Dnieper hard motorcycle to this 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.010
 categories include 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.600
 This video I shoot in response to a question 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.610
 alexander who doesn't ask the question how 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:45.240
 to install bearings in 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:47.430
 engine java 634 the first to stick them 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.940
 on the cap of the calendar 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.070
 or first in the cards but I will not 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.739
 say how it is painted in books 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.140
 because many books were written by those who 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.600
 probably even with motorcycles close so 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.630
 then by saw driving past here with you 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.170
 I will say that impression as I did 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:10.800
 I always unfortunately have a little question 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.950
 late are you Alexander because it was 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.920
 We ate that 38 showed on visual 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.080
 example disassembled engine but to 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.210
 Sorry until the current found the engine tyzh 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:28.610
 planets tell you about bearings 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.020
 different will be put 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.750
 normal bearings will stand here 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.869
 initially roller bearings on this i 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:41.150
 I consider it nonsense and where it is installed 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:44.970
 Japanese good ball bearings 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.159
 medal means installation don't forget that u 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.710
 you crankshaft and connect two 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.479
 calender intermediate support which 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.229
 should be very tight in the crankcase 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.210
 engine 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.060
 because if it is false and 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.380
 air leak engine will work 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:07.220
 unstable in the end will break your crankcase 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:10.550
 well as for the final installation 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.450
 main bearings principle I'm in 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:18.170
 many books who write that should be tight 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.989
 then install the swamp card itself and what 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.140
 it is necessary in the crankcase I always installed a 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:28.550
 it always worked perfectly 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.130
 The card here can be made decent 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.850
 chamfer well, let's say the bearing is inserted 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.700
 from this side we will insert the bearing 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.769
 write to card instead of press first 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.590
 landing should be very tight 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:47.480
 that is a good press fit 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:49.940
 bearing ladies roughly speaking 8 beta 7 8 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.090
 sotok can I now do not remember how much 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.400
 landing exactly goes about each sign up 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.410
 should very well well here don't spot 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:03.230
 hammer desirable to press on to 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:05.810
 error came hard and then this 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.440
 bearing start and need to do 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.290
 too good lubrication, well this is for you 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.100
 will allow easy installation to 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:20.829
 lay paws glands in the bearing itself 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.700
 should be in size but i will say that 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.700
 landing stretch 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.769
 called that is it when not 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.470
 pressed from the hammer but also enemies 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:34.630
 fails and rather so small 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:40.299
 force bearing sits on weave 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:43.280
 in the end you will insert the bearing 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.139
 when will insert cannibals if you 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.079
 exactly combine the crankcase all as 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:50.329
 relies you should just really 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.609
 tight they site 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.990
 Bearings will become later when working 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.890
 us 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:04:00.730
 into place and will not allow walk not 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.290
 to the trunk not by the bearing itself 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.460
 move relatively anywhere 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:09.720
 because in the frame they stand tight 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:12.640
 as for landing if like some 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.030
 press in here bearing tight 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.200
 hammer here 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:22.390
 pressed it here is primary bar 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:26.320
 this is what threatens the bearings can get up 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:29.440
 on a distortion when pressing in or they all 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.830
 equal in any way will be a stretch with 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.940
 decent which can cause a crack in 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.160
 bearing and 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:41.260
 times breaking the nest planting well 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.250
 actually i think i'm on your 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.790
 the question is answered preferably them 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:51.130
 are pressed the crankcase itself should 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.740
 be very decent as i said then 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:58.360
 there is a quality bearing fit here 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:01.920
 should stretch and then landing the 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:05.200
 most you can calmly then collect 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.550
 the engine will work for a very long time 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:11.410
 there is yes as I said again 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.020
 we must take into account the rule that you have this 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.260
 Here is the central support, it should be very 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.820
 tightly enter the crankcase and by no means 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:23.470
 If I do not turn around, let me 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:26.080
 hang out in any way Well 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.970
 let's more questions will be glad to them 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.350
 answer if I can of course there 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.350
 pick up a visual something
