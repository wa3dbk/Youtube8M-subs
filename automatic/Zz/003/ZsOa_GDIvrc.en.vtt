00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
checkpoint the little marker is gonna be

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.689 
checkpoint the little marker is gonna be
at<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> very<00:00:28.830> bottom<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.400> hill<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.580> you

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
at the very bottom of the hill and you

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.919 
at the very bottom of the hill and you
might<00:00:29.849> think<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.269> that's<00:00:30.630> where<00:00:30.869> you

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
might think of that that's where you

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.280 
might think of that that's where you
have<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.199> go<00:00:31.410> yeah<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:33.480> move<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
have to go yeah to like move on the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.010 
have to go yeah to like move on the
level<00:00:34.590> but<00:00:35.190> that's<00:00:35.280> not<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.670> at<00:00:35.790> all

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
level but that's not it at all

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.470 
level but that's not it at all
what<00:00:37.320> you're<00:00:37.410> supposed<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.680> do<00:00:37.829> actually<00:00:38.250> is

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480

fighting<00:04:08.269> your<00:04:08.390> way<00:04:08.540> uphill<00:04:08.959> would<00:04:09.319> be<00:04:09.439> the

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
fighting your way uphill would be the

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.630 
fighting your way uphill would be the
really<00:04:10.099> hard<00:04:10.459> part<00:04:10.579> even<00:04:11.269> like<00:04:11.980> if<00:04:12.980> I<00:04:13.159> didn't

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
really hard part even like if I didn't

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.360 
really hard part even like if I didn't
edit<00:04:13.790> out<00:04:14.030> all<00:04:14.329> the<00:04:14.390> deaths<00:04:14.750> so<00:04:15.620> this<00:04:15.950> this

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
edit out all the deaths so this this

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.189 
edit out all the deaths so this this
whole<00:04:16.609> level<00:04:17.000> is<00:04:17.269> gonna<00:04:17.449> end<00:04:17.630> up<00:04:17.780> being<00:04:18.019> like

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
whole level is gonna end up being like

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.620 
whole level is gonna end up being like
twelve<00:04:18.680> fifteen<00:04:19.459> minutes<00:04:19.789> of<00:04:19.880> video<00:04:20.000> total

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
twelve fifteen minutes of video total

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.999 
twelve fifteen minutes of video total
mmm-hmm<00:04:21.229> probably<00:04:22.039> less<00:04:22.220> than<00:04:22.250> that<00:04:23.770> if<00:04:24.770> I

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:25.009 
mmm-hmm probably less than that if I

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.400 
mmm-hmm probably less than that if I
didn't<00:04:25.340> edit<00:04:25.460> anything<00:04:25.910> out<00:04:26.060> this<00:04:27.020> level
