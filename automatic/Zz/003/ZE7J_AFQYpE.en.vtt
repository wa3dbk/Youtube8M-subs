surprising<00:03:39.300> thing<00:03:39.720> for<00:03:39.900> me<00:03:39.990> was<00:03:40.170> how

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
surprising thing for me was how

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.740 
surprising thing for me was how
sensitive<00:03:40.980> this<00:03:41.400> stick<00:03:41.610> was<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:42.420> almost<00:03:42.660> just

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
sensitive this stick was you almost just

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.360 
sensitive this stick was you almost just
had<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.140> will<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.620> with<00:03:43.739> your<00:03:43.890> brain<00:03:44.069> or<00:03:44.340> the

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
had to will it with your brain or the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.860 
had to will it with your brain or the
one<00:03:44.580> staring<00:03:44.910> would<00:03:45.239> be<00:03:45.330> like<00:03:45.540> what<00:03:45.720> are<00:03:45.810> you

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
one staring would be like what are you

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.020 
one staring would be like what are you
doing<00:03:46.110> too<00:03:46.230> hard<00:03:46.440> is<00:03:46.800> a<00:03:46.830> boost<00:03:47.250> keep<00:03:47.819> the<00:03:47.910> dough

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
doing too hard is a boost keep the dough

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.610 
doing too hard is a boost keep the dough
stock<00:03:48.300> they'll<00:03:48.510> probably<00:03:48.690> go<00:03:48.870> portable<00:03:49.200> the

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
stock they'll probably go portable the

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.890 
stock they'll probably go portable the
force<00:03:49.980> of<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.250> g's<00:03:50.610> was<00:03:50.880> so<00:03:51.630> much<00:03:51.870> more

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
force of the g's was so much more

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.510 
force of the g's was so much more
intense<00:03:52.380> than<00:03:52.530> I<00:03:52.590> thought<00:03:52.860> it<00:03:52.920> would<00:03:53.069> be<00:03:53.280> the

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
intense than I thought it would be the

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.979 
intense than I thought it would be the
only<00:03:53.670> thing<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:53.910> could<00:03:53.970> think<00:03:54.090> was<00:03:54.300> like<00:03:54.630> my

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
only thing I could think was like my

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:05.940 
only thing I could think was like my
face<00:03:55.230> is<00:03:55.260> coming<00:03:55.860> off<00:03:56.040> this<00:03:56.430> is<00:03:56.580> like<00:03:56.850> watching

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.890 

I've<00:04:06.950> heard<00:04:07.489> of<00:04:07.610> fighter<00:04:08.300> pilots<00:04:08.510> going

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
I've heard of fighter pilots going

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.540 
I've heard of fighter pilots going
through<00:04:09.080> this<00:04:09.170> intensely<00:04:09.739> physical<00:04:10.129> training

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
through this intensely physical training

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.070 
through this intensely physical training
and<00:04:10.730> now<00:04:10.879> I<00:04:10.910> can<00:04:11.150> see<00:04:11.300> why<00:04:11.450> they<00:04:11.660> had<00:04:11.780> to<00:04:11.810> do

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
and now I can see why they had to do

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.949 
and now I can see why they had to do
that<00:04:12.970> when<00:04:13.970> you<00:04:14.120> are<00:04:14.390> flying<00:04:14.569> in<00:04:14.780> formation

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
that when you are flying in formation

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.229 
that when you are flying in formation
next<00:04:15.739> to<00:04:15.800> someone<00:04:15.950> you<00:04:16.100> have<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.250> kind<00:04:16.489> of<00:04:16.609> look

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
next to someone you have to kind of look

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.969 
next to someone you have to kind of look
and<00:04:17.510> just<00:04:17.690> reproduce<00:04:18.320> every<00:04:18.530> single<00:04:18.859> motion

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
and just reproduce every single motion

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:20.680 
and just reproduce every single motion
they<00:04:19.220> do<00:04:19.280> you<00:04:19.519> say<00:04:19.639> okay<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:20.180> your<00:04:20.269> left<00:04:20.359> left

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
they do you say okay to your left left

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.849 
they do you say okay to your left left
more<00:04:20.930> left<00:04:20.959> more<00:04:21.290> oh<00:04:21.380> there<00:04:21.530> he<00:04:21.620> is<00:04:21.650> shooting

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
more left more oh there he is shooting

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.770 
more left more oh there he is shooting
shooting<00:04:22.160> shoot<00:04:22.400> him<00:04:22.550> I<00:04:22.760> was<00:04:23.120> surprised<00:04:23.450> he
