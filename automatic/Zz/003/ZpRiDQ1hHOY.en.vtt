00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.749 
bolts removed we're going to firmly pull
out<00:02:02.390> on<00:02:02.689> this<00:02:03.020> headlight<00:02:03.439> assembly<00:02:03.950> there<00:02:04.610> are

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
out on this headlight assembly there are

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.330 
out on this headlight assembly there are
some<00:02:05.060> push<00:02:05.390> tabs<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:06.170> keep<00:02:06.619> it<00:02:06.799> connected<00:02:07.100> to

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
some push tabs that keep it connected to

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.600 
some push tabs that keep it connected to
the<00:02:07.549> truck<00:02:07.819> and<00:02:08.060> with<00:02:08.690> some<00:02:08.869> firm<00:02:09.080> pressure

going to need to do is push down on the
pin<00:02:23.799> pull<00:02:24.799> out<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.130> headlight<00:02:25.670> connector<00:02:26.049> and

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
pin pull out the headlight connector and

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.500 
pin pull out the headlight connector and
take<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.530> OEM<00:02:27.980> bolt<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.819> turn<00:02:29.360> it

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
take the OEM bolt and turn it

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.990 
take the OEM bolt and turn it
counterclockwise<00:02:30.489> that<00:02:31.489> will<00:02:31.670> release<00:02:31.970> the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
counterclockwise that will release the

counterclockwise that will release the
whole<00:02:32.450> bulb<00:02:32.980> pull<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.099> out<00:02:36.819> now<00:02:37.819> let's<00:02:38.060> open<00:02:38.209> up

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
whole bulb pull it out now let's open up

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.630 
whole bulb pull it out now let's open up
our<00:02:38.829> 150<00:02:39.829> of<00:02:39.890> these<00:02:40.099> kit<00:02:43.720> notice<00:02:44.720> there<00:02:45.410> are

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
our 150 of these kit notice there are

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.479 
our 150 of these kit notice there are
different<00:02:46.640> size<00:02:46.819> notches<00:02:47.450> around<00:02:47.660> this<00:02:48.140> bulb

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
different size notches around this bulb

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.280 
different size notches around this bulb
okay<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:50.090> will<00:02:50.180> only<00:02:50.360> fit<00:02:50.690> in<00:02:50.720> in<00:02:51.079> one

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
okay and it will only fit in in one

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.599 
okay and it will only fit in in one
direction<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.069> don't<00:02:52.190> have<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.400> worry
