00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:19.370 
okay so here we are now this is a

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.470 
okay so here we are now this is a
standard<00:00:20.300> for<00:00:21.050> channel<00:00:21.590> RC<00:00:21.920> plane<00:00:22.850> simulator

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
standard for channel RC plane simulator

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.320 
standard for channel RC plane simulator
remote<00:00:24.380> and<00:00:24.860> in<00:00:25.340> this<00:00:25.460> video<00:00:25.640> you're<00:00:26.000> going<00:00:26.240> to

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
remote and in this video you're going to

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.620 
remote and in this video you're going to
learn<00:00:26.390> how<00:00:26.720> to<00:00:26.840> take<00:00:27.380> off<00:00:27.680> and<00:00:27.890> land<00:00:28.570> okay<00:00:29.570> so

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
learn how to take off and land okay so

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.499 
learn how to take off and land okay so
first<00:00:30.500> thing<00:00:30.830> is<00:00:31.010> let's<00:00:31.760> have<00:00:32.090> a<00:00:32.119> look<00:00:32.329> at<00:00:32.360> the

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
first thing is let's have a look at the

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.750 
first thing is let's have a look at the
remote<00:00:32.809> then<00:00:33.050> shall<00:00:33.350> we<00:00:33.969> you<00:00:34.969> can<00:00:35.179> see<00:00:36.760> this

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
remote then shall we you can see this

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.169 
remote then shall we you can see this
one<00:00:38.059> here<00:00:38.629> is<00:00:38.839> our<00:00:39.320> throttle<00:00:41.559> this<00:00:42.559> one

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:43.179 
one here is our throttle this one

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:46.540 
one here is our throttle this one
adjusts<00:00:44.179> the<00:00:44.449> amount<00:00:45.050> of<00:00:45.230> throttle<00:00:45.769> your

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
adjusts the amount of throttle your

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.489 
adjusts the amount of throttle your
engine<00:00:47.149> oil<00:00:47.839> motor<00:00:48.109> is<00:00:48.620> getting<00:00:50.499> throttle

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:51.499 
engine oil motor is getting throttle

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:57.840 
engine oil motor is getting throttle
here<00:00:53.229> this<00:00:54.229> one<00:00:54.589> here<00:00:54.940> controls<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.719> elevator

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
here this one here controls the elevator

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.680 
here this one here controls the elevator
you<00:00:58.850> can<00:00:59.030> see<00:00:59.649> goes<00:01:00.649> up<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.280> down<00:01:01.449> that<00:01:02.449> one

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
you can see goes up and down that one

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.800 
you can see goes up and down that one
controls<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.530> planes<00:01:04.010> art<00:01:04.600> movements<00:01:05.600> in

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
controls the planes art movements in

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.940 
controls the planes art movements in
other<00:01:06.020> words<00:01:06.619> going<00:01:07.130> up<00:01:07.399> and<00:01:07.689> also<00:01:08.689> going<00:01:09.500> down

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
other words going up and also going down

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.600 
other words going up and also going down
as<00:01:10.909> you<00:01:11.570> will<00:01:11.719> see<00:01:11.750> in<00:01:11.990> a<00:01:12.140> moment<00:01:12.340> now<00:01:13.340> those

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
as you will see in a moment now those

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.700 
as you will see in a moment now those
are<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.909> only<00:01:14.149> two<00:01:14.540> things<00:01:14.780> that<00:01:15.079> you<00:01:15.350> need<00:01:15.500> to

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
are the only two things that you need to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.440 
are the only two things that you need to
know<00:01:15.770> when<00:01:16.759> taking<00:01:17.240> off<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:18.200> that<00:01:18.469> is

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
know when taking off and that is

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.029 
know when taking off and that is
throttle<00:01:20.450> throttle<00:01:21.009> up<00:01:22.009> when<00:01:22.759> taking<00:01:23.180> off<00:01:23.390> and

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
throttle throttle up when taking off and

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.580 
throttle throttle up when taking off and
then<00:01:25.039> throttling<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.299> then<00:01:26.899> using<00:01:27.469> the

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
then throttling and then using the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.440 
then throttling and then using the
elevator<00:01:27.799> to<00:01:28.640> go<00:01:29.299> back<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:30.740> take<00:01:31.009> off<00:01:31.270> that<00:01:32.270> is

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
elevator to go back to take off that is

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.719 
elevator to go back to take off that is
how<00:01:32.689> to<00:01:33.049> take<00:01:33.350> off<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.950> RC<00:01:34.430> plane<00:01:36.430> push<00:01:37.430> down

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
how to take off the RC plane push down

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.429 
how to take off the RC plane push down
on<00:01:38.030> this<00:01:38.329> one<00:01:39.219> push<00:01:40.219> up<00:01:40.549> on<00:01:40.820> this<00:01:41.240> one<00:01:41.509> that

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
on this one push up on this one that

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.969 
on this one push up on this one that
will<00:01:42.619> take<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.219> plane<00:01:43.490> off<00:01:44.560> now<00:01:45.560> let's<00:01:45.799> go

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
will take the plane off now let's go

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.849 
will take the plane off now let's go
back<00:01:46.159> to<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:46.429> simulator<00:01:46.909> I'm<00:01:47.509> going<00:01:48.140> silly<00:01:48.590> go

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:48.859 
back to the simulator I'm going silly go

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:51.600 
back to the simulator I'm going silly go
drop<00:01:49.820> it<00:01:50.000> up

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
drop it up

00:01:51.610 --> 00:02:01.530 
drop it up
and<00:01:52.610> then<00:01:53.060> simply<00:01:53.690> pull<00:01:53.990> back<00:01:56.320> there<00:01:57.320> we<00:01:57.440> go

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.760 

once<00:02:02.540> again<00:02:02.720> what<00:02:03.380> I<00:02:03.410> did<00:02:03.680> then<00:02:03.920> was<00:02:04.750> by<00:02:05.750> simply

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:16.120 

use<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:11.590> throttle<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:13.540> throttle<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:15.130> and

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
use the throttle I throttle that and

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.610 
use the throttle I throttle that and
then<00:02:16.760> using<00:02:16.970> your<00:02:17.270> other<00:02:17.390> hand<00:02:17.750> normally<00:02:18.200> you

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
then using your other hand normally you

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.760 
then using your other hand normally you
would<00:02:18.740> pull<00:02:19.010> back<00:02:19.250> on<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.760> radio<00:02:19.970> just<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:21.440> bit

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
would pull back on the radio just a bit

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.750 
would pull back on the radio just a bit
until<00:02:22.310> it<00:02:22.340> takes<00:02:22.640> off<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.560> then<00:02:24.610> you<00:02:25.610> can

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
until it takes off and then you can

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.740 
until it takes off and then you can
start<00:02:26.030> flying<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:29.150> once<00:02:29.390> again<00:02:29.540> on<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.650> runway

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
start flying so once again on the runway

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.420 
start flying so once again on the runway
throttle<00:02:32.750> up<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:33.440> full<00:02:34.420> pull<00:02:35.420> back<00:02:36.040> just<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.400> bit

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
throttle up to full pull back just a bit

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:53.820 
throttle up to full pull back just a bit
and<00:02:38.000> then<00:02:38.780> your<00:02:39.170> plane<00:02:40.210> will<00:02:41.210> take<00:02:41.480> off

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.950 

okay<00:02:54.520> so<00:02:54.580> I<00:02:54.790> hope<00:02:54.940> in<00:02:55.090> this<00:02:55.150> video<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.540> found
