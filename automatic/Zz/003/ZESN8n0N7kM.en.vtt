especially if you're doing some stuff

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.259 
especially if you're doing some stuff
with<00:00:12.630> navionics<00:00:13.440> right<00:00:14.009> now<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:15.059> know<00:00:15.150> these

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
with navionics right now you know these

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.050 
with navionics right now you know these
chips<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:16.379> can<00:00:16.590> update<00:00:17.130> them<00:00:17.460> for<00:00:17.789> up<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.029> a

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
chips you can update them for up to a

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.970 
chips you can update them for up to a
year<00:00:18.119> after<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:18.960> buy<00:00:19.140> them<00:00:19.410> right<00:00:19.680> now<00:00:19.800> I've

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
year after you buy them right now I've

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.099 
year after you buy them right now I've
got<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.279> platinum<00:00:20.640> Easton<00:00:21.090> but<00:00:21.720> it's<00:00:21.930> real

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
got the platinum Easton but it's real

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.439 
got the platinum Easton but it's real
simple<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.650> just<00:00:22.680> take<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> empty<00:00:23.789> card<00:00:24.150> and

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
simple you just take a empty card and

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.439 
simple you just take a empty card and
right<00:00:25.350> here<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.890> put<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.789> second<00:00:27.180> slot

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
right here and put it in the second slot

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.950 
right here and put it in the second slot
and<00:00:28.250> what<00:00:29.250> i<00:00:29.279> suggest<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.210> if<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.510> got<00:00:30.720> two

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
and what i suggest to is if you got two

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.170 
and what i suggest to is if you got two
units<00:00:31.410> make<00:00:31.590> sure<00:00:31.769> only<00:00:31.920> one<00:00:32.279> has<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.550> sonar<00:00:32.910> off

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
units make sure only one has a sonar off

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.330 
units make sure only one has a sonar off
this<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.960> real<00:00:34.140> easy<00:00:34.380> just<00:00:34.590> hit<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> power

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
this is real easy just hit the power

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.490 
this is real easy just hit the power
button<00:00:35.399> once<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.660> turn<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> sonar<00:00:37.320> off

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
button once you can turn the sonar off

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.119 
button once you can turn the sonar off
and<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.920> because<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.760> do<00:00:39.379> run<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.620> sonars

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
and on because if you do run to sonars

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.430 
and on because if you do run to sonars
they<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.090> interfere<00:00:42.540> with<00:00:42.780> each<00:00:42.809> other<00:00:43.170> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
they can interfere with each other and

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.380 
they can interfere with each other and
if<00:00:43.649> they<00:00:43.770> interfere<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.969> not<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.300> to

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
if they interfere it's not going to

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.569 
if they interfere it's not going to
record<00:00:45.719> properly<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.530> therefore<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:47.370> not

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
record properly and therefore it's not

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.580 
record properly and therefore it's not
going<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.820> allow<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.390> upload<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.230> properly

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
going to allow you to upload it properly

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.840 
going to allow you to upload it properly
into<00:00:50.039> navionics<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.690> improve<00:00:52.620> your<00:00:52.860> sonar<00:00:53.309> so

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
into navionics to improve your sonar so

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.700 
into navionics to improve your sonar so
as<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.210> see<00:00:54.480> there's<00:00:55.110> simply<00:00:55.350> just

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
as you can see there's simply just

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.250 
as you can see there's simply just
certain<00:00:56.370> areas<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.840> know<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.050> back

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
certain areas that you know in back

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.560 
certain areas that you know in back
waters<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.770> don't<00:00:58.949> allow<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.359> to<00:01:00.359> have

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
waters that don't allow you to have

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.429 
waters that don't allow you to have
additional<00:01:01.440> information<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.879> update

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
additional information so you can update

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.100 
additional information so you can update
the<00:01:04.439> sonar<00:01:04.769> yourself<00:01:05.280> through<00:01:06.270> navionics<00:01:06.930> so

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the sonar yourself through navionics so

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.050

idling around or using your trolling
motor<00:01:46.320> before<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.220> record<00:01:47.399> because<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.540> won't

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
motor before you record because it won't

motor before you record because it won't
pick<00:01:48.899> up<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.170> pings<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.619> therefore<00:01:50.070> your

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
pick up the pings and therefore your

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.179 
pick up the pings and therefore your

this screen this is just my mapping I

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.750 
this screen this is just my mapping I
got<00:02:16.140> two<00:02:16.320> screens<00:02:16.680> going<00:02:17.040> while<00:02:17.610> it's

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
got two screens going while it's

recording<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:18.480> can<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:19.590> can<00:02:19.740> bounce<00:02:19.860> around

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
recording you can you can bounce around

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.910 
recording you can you can bounce around
and<00:02:20.430> go<00:02:20.520> back<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.850> fishing<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.590> can

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
and go back to fishing and so you can

see<00:02:23.190> right<00:02:23.220> here<00:02:23.930> I've<00:02:24.930> got<00:02:25.170> sonar<00:02:25.560> settings

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
see right here I've got sonar settings

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.920 
see right here I've got sonar settings
and<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.640> can<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:27.030> do<00:02:27.150> your<00:02:27.270> regular<00:02:27.420> sonar

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
and you can just do your regular sonar

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.570 
and you can just do your regular sonar
and<00:02:28.140> just<00:02:28.590> fish<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:28.830> let<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.250> do<00:02:29.430> its<00:02:29.550> thing

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
and just fish and let it do its thing

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.240 
and just fish and let it do its thing
but<00:02:30.300> as<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.930> do<00:02:31.110> this<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.500> zigzag<00:02:31.770> back<00:02:32.190> and

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
but as you do this to zigzag back and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.400 
but as you do this to zigzag back and
forth<00:02:32.670> in<00:02:32.850> an<00:02:32.940> area<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.450> kind<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.870> map<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.290> out

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
forth in an area and kind of map it out

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.440 
forth in an area and kind of map it out
like<00:02:34.650> grid<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.010> out<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:35.880> way<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.090> gets<00:02:36.270> a

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
like grid it out so that way it gets a

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.310 
like grid it out so that way it gets a
real<00:02:36.690> good<00:02:36.960> accurate<00:02:37.650> p<00:02:38.250> versus<00:02:39.180> your<00:02:39.840> GPS

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
real good accurate p versus your GPS

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.350 
real good accurate p versus your GPS
location<00:02:40.950> then<00:02:41.430> what<00:02:41.610> you<00:02:41.730> do<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.090> just<00:02:42.120> go
