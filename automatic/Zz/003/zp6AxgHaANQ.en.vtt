00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.238
 "If you eat grapefruit, tell your doctor" 

00:00:07.238 --> 00:00:11.158
 If someone eats half a grapefruit three times a day, 

00:00:11.158 --> 00:00:12.677
 before each meal for several months 

00:00:12.677 --> 00:00:15.676
 can lose about 1 kilogram 

00:00:15.676 --> 00:00:20.556
 which is no more than if he ate three apples or pears a day. 

00:00:20.556 --> 00:00:22.477
 In this study, those who consumed grapefruit 

00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:24.556
 reduced weight 

00:00:24.556 --> 00:00:25.728
 but their waist circumference also diminished 

00:00:25.728 --> 00:00:27.917
 and the amount of body fat. 

00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:29.629
 However, if you repeat this experiment 

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:31.158
 and instead of grapefruit you give people 

00:00:31.158 --> 00:00:33.878
 half a glass of water before every meal 

00:00:33.878 --> 00:00:35.958
 you get the same results. 

00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.863
 It follows that the assumption regarding the ability of grapefruit 

00:00:38.863 --> 00:00:43.100
 burning fat is probably just a persistent myth. 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.115
 Here's the latest message that shows 

00:00:44.115 --> 00:00:47.197
 Grapefruit consumers have seen weight loss 

00:00:47.197 --> 00:00:48.761
 significant reduction in cholesterol 

00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:50.398
 and a significant drop in blood pressure. 

00:00:50.398 --> 00:00:53.989
 However, the conclusion of the study is that daily consumption of grapefruit 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.429
 does not significantly reduce body weight within 6 weeks 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:59.477
 cholesterol or blood pressure. As?! 

00:00:59.477 --> 00:01:01.828
 I had to take a closer look at it and find out 

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:06.819
 that grapefruit simply didn't go better than placebo. 

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:11.469
 Other studies have shown a marked reduction in cholesterol levels 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:14.657
 especially when eating red grapefruits compared to white, 

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:17.280
 even a slight decrease in triglyceride levels. 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.618
 This involved one grapefruit per day for 30 days 

00:01:19.618 --> 00:01:21.140
 but as you can see here 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.406
 it was a transition from life-threatening cholesterol levels 

00:01:23.406 --> 00:01:26.260
 to other life-threatening cholesterol levels. 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.044
 To prevent heart disease, 

00:01:30.044 --> 00:01:33.902
 it is necessary to lower total cholesterol to about 3.9 mmol / l. 

00:01:33.902 --> 00:01:35.501
 This is the average for those 

00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:39.108
 who eat only plant foods 

00:01:39.108 --> 00:01:42.070
 not just grapefruit. 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.990
 Although grapefruits themselves do not have a big impact, 

00:01:44.998 --> 00:01:47.270
 research suggests that people consume them rather 

00:01:47.278 --> 00:01:49.880
 than cholesterol-lowering drugs 

00:01:49.885 --> 00:01:51.990
 and most people with heart disease 

00:01:51.998 --> 00:01:54.360
 stops taking statin drugs within a few years 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.230
 due to side effects. 

00:01:57.234 --> 00:01:59.900
 While grapefruit itself has no side effects, 

00:01:59.908 --> 00:02:03.250
 combination of grapefruit and medicines 

00:02:03.254 --> 00:02:08.080
 it can make the side effects worse. 

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:10.360
 If you eat a lot of fruits and vegetables 

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:12.080
 you won't need many drugs 

00:02:12.085 --> 00:02:14.590
 but some phytochemicals contained in plants 

00:02:14.594 --> 00:02:18.190
 can affect the metabolism of drugs in the body 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.160
 and grapefruit is a typical example of a substance 

00:02:21.165 --> 00:02:24.120
 one of the pharmacologist's nightmares. 

00:02:24.126 --> 00:02:27.560
 Natural phytochemicals in grapefruit block enzymes 

00:02:27.556 --> 00:02:30.110
 that help break down more than half of the drugs 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.560
 which are normally prescribed 

00:02:31.565 --> 00:02:36.920
 and lower drug removal means increasing its levels in the body. 

00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:41.470
 This is useful only if you want to increase 

00:02:41.474 --> 00:02:42.990
 caffeine levels after morning coffee 

00:02:42.994 --> 00:02:45.530
 or if your doctor wants to spare you 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:49.070
 Thousands of Dollars By Going To Increase The Level Of Precious Drugs In The Body 

00:02:49.074 --> 00:02:51.520
 which are not eliminated at such a rate. 

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:56.670
 However, higher drug levels pose a higher risk of side effects. 

00:02:56.674 --> 00:03:00.960
 Women using contraception have a higher risk of developing blood clots, 

00:03:00.961 --> 00:03:04.910
 especially if they consume more grapefruit at the same time. 

00:03:04.914 --> 00:03:06.900
 Concomitant use of hormonal contraceptives with grapefruit 

00:03:06.902 --> 00:03:10.270
 increases the concentration of hormones in the blood by 137%. 

00:03:10.274 --> 00:03:14.110
 If enzymes are inhibited by grapefruit juice, 

00:03:14.114 --> 00:03:18.830
 the level of estrogen absorbed increases. 

00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:21.470
 How does it affect our own endogenous estrogen? 

00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:24.390
 This study shows a link between grapefruit consumption 

00:03:24.392 --> 00:03:27.750
 and breast cancer scared the medical community. 

00:03:27.753 --> 00:03:30.550
 However, follow-up studies conducted on even more women 

00:03:30.558 --> 00:03:33.030
 have not shown any connection in this respect 

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:35.620
 respectively, data from the Harvard Nurse's Study 

00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:39.610
 the risk of developing the most aggressive type of breast cancer. 

00:03:39.613 --> 00:03:41.700
 So you don't have to worry 

00:03:41.706 --> 00:03:44.220
 the negative impact of grapefruit on our "natural chemistry" 

00:03:44.222 --> 00:03:47.240
 but if we use unnatural, prescribed chemistry, 

00:03:47.244 --> 00:03:51.050
 it is better to skip grapefruit 

00:03:51.053 --> 00:03:55.060
 72 hours before taking the drug with which it interacts. 

00:03:55.065 --> 00:03:57.500
 If you don't want to give up grapefruit, 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.520
 you can ask your doctor to change medication, 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:04.080
 to take such medicines 

00:04:04.086 --> 00:04:10.160
 which do not show this type of interaction.
