00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.100 
hi so this is a the Baconator a big fun

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.589 
hi so this is a the Baconator a big fun
machine<00:00:06.520> I<00:00:06.640> built<00:00:06.850> with<00:00:06.970> my<00:00:07.029> buddy<00:00:07.420> Bitterman

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
machine I built with my buddy Bitterman

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.369 
machine I built with my buddy Bitterman
and<00:00:09.799> usually<00:00:10.799> these<00:00:11.250> machines<00:00:11.670> use<00:00:12.379> spawning

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:13.379 
and usually these machines use spawning

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.529 
and usually these machines use spawning
blocks<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.950> create<00:00:14.219> more<00:00:14.369> pigs<00:00:14.670> but<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.360> one

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:15.539 
blocks to create more pigs but this one

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.900 
blocks to create more pigs but this one
is<00:00:15.660> actually<00:00:15.840> just<00:00:16.289> using<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.910> normal

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
is actually just using the normal

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.019 
is actually just using the normal
mechanisms<00:00:18.450> in<00:00:18.599> Minecraft<00:00:19.640> I'm<00:00:20.640> just<00:00:20.880> going

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
mechanisms in Minecraft I'm just going

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.060 
mechanisms in Minecraft I'm just going
to<00:00:21.090> activate<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.869> explain<00:00:22.650> how<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.919> works

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.939 

okay<00:00:28.820> so<00:00:28.880> first<00:00:29.359> the<00:00:29.749> pigs<00:00:30.019> have<00:00:30.259> are<00:00:30.529> given

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
okay so first the pigs have are given

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.069 
okay so first the pigs have are given
who<00:00:31.160> eat<00:00:31.310> from<00:00:31.699> these<00:00:31.880> deployers<00:00:32.419> and<00:00:32.660> as<00:00:32.960> you

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
who eat from these deployers and as you

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.840 
who eat from these deployers and as you
can<00:00:33.230> see<00:00:33.410> there's<00:00:33.649> no<00:00:33.829> a<00:00:33.860> third<00:00:34.219> Pig<00:00:34.520> in<00:00:34.699> their

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
can see there's no a third Pig in their

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.439 
can see there's no a third Pig in their
own<00:00:36.100> and<00:00:37.100> now<00:00:37.519> it<00:00:37.640> waits<00:00:37.910> a<00:00:38.000> while

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:38.449 
own and now it waits a while

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.479 
own and now it waits a while
normally<00:00:39.290> it<00:00:39.350> would<00:00:39.379> wait<00:00:39.649> 20<00:00:40.190> minutes

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
normally it would wait 20 minutes

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.340 
normally it would wait 20 minutes
because<00:00:40.699> that's<00:00:41.149> the<00:00:41.420> time<00:00:41.750> it<00:00:41.780> takes<00:00:42.050> for<00:00:42.290> a

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
because that's the time it takes for a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.160 
because that's the time it takes for a
pig<00:00:42.589> to<00:00:42.769> fully<00:00:43.100> grow<00:00:43.309> up<00:00:43.460> but<00:00:44.390> I<00:00:44.629> have<00:00:44.780> sped<00:00:45.050> it

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
pig to fully grow up but I have sped it

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.200 
pig to fully grow up but I have sped it
up<00:00:45.199> a<00:00:45.470> little<00:00:45.559> bit<00:00:45.769> now<00:00:45.980> so<00:00:46.280> I<00:00:46.579> can<00:00:47.059> actually

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
up a little bit now so I can actually

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.990 
up a little bit now so I can actually
show<00:00:47.600> this<00:00:47.750> correctly<00:00:48.339> another<00:00:49.339> Pig<00:00:49.850> is

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
show this correctly another Pig is

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.270 
show this correctly another Pig is
placed<00:00:50.329> into<00:00:50.600> this<00:00:50.839> machine<00:00:51.379> which<00:00:51.829> takes<00:00:52.129> it

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
placed into this machine which takes it

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.420 
placed into this machine which takes it
to<00:00:52.430> this<00:00:52.550> of<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:53.269> chamber<00:00:53.659> here<00:00:53.839> and<00:00:54.250> you<00:00:55.250> can

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
to this of the chamber here and you can

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.600 
to this of the chamber here and you can
see<00:00:55.610> it's<00:00:56.269> burnt<00:00:57.140> alive<00:00:57.500> which<00:00:58.159> is<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.309> little

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
see it's burnt alive which is a little

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.939 
see it's burnt alive which is a little
cruel<00:00:59.180> but<00:00:59.449> yeah<00:00:59.780> this<00:00:59.930> is<00:01:00.080> minecraft<00:01:00.290> so<00:01:00.739> who

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
cruel but yeah this is minecraft so who

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.359 
cruel but yeah this is minecraft so who
cares<00:01:01.159> and<00:01:01.729> then<00:01:02.689> we<00:01:03.320> would<00:01:03.500> get<00:01:03.769> bacon<00:01:04.220> from

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
cares and then we would get bacon from

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.429 
cares and then we would get bacon from
it<00:01:04.489> well<00:01:04.790> it's<00:01:05.059> actually<00:01:05.239> well<00:01:05.750> pork<00:01:06.170> chops

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
it well it's actually well pork chops

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.620 
it well it's actually well pork chops
but<00:01:06.650> in<00:01:06.799> any<00:01:06.950> case<00:01:07.009> it<00:01:07.790> sucked<00:01:08.210> into<00:01:08.450> this

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
but in any case it sucked into this

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.260 
but in any case it sucked into this
Transposer<00:01:09.229> here<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.520> fire<00:01:10.729> is<00:01:10.759> actually

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
Transposer here so the fire is actually

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.179 
Transposer here so the fire is actually
generated<00:01:11.750> using<00:01:11.869> this<00:01:12.110> deployer<00:01:12.530> which<00:01:12.829> uses

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
generated using this deployer which uses

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.080 
generated using this deployer which uses
a<00:01:13.400> flint<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:14.240> steel

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.539 

oh<00:01:17.119> and<00:01:18.079> now<00:01:18.290> it's<00:01:18.439> repeating<00:01:19.040> again<00:01:19.220> because

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
oh and now it's repeating again because

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.700 
oh and now it's repeating again because
the<00:01:19.729> timer<00:01:20.149> isn't<00:01:20.390> set<00:01:20.780> correctly<00:01:21.020> well<00:01:21.530> I

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
the timer isn't set correctly well I

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.250 
the timer isn't set correctly well I
just<00:01:21.829> put<00:01:22.220> it<00:01:22.340> now

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.740 

so<00:01:27.260> it's<00:01:27.440> fully<00:01:27.710> automated<00:01:28.370> and<00:01:28.640> we<00:01:29.570> don't

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
so it's fully automated and we don't

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.420 
so it's fully automated and we don't
really<00:01:29.930> need<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.260> keep<00:01:30.530> an<00:01:30.710> eye<00:01:30.830> on<00:01:30.860> it<00:01:31.160> when

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
really need to keep an eye on it when

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.930 
really need to keep an eye on it when
it's<00:01:31.580> in<00:01:31.790> normal<00:01:32.180> operating<00:01:32.510> mode<00:01:33.820> there's<00:01:34.820> a

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
it's in normal operating mode there's a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.030 
it's in normal operating mode there's a
large<00:01:35.630> weed<00:01:36.170> storage<00:01:36.590> here<00:01:36.830> in<00:01:37.010> the<00:01:37.130> back<00:01:39.040> in

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
large weed storage here in the back in

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.430 
large weed storage here in the back in
this<00:01:40.190> chest<00:01:40.520> here<00:01:40.790> and<00:01:40.970> these<00:01:41.510> filters<00:01:42.260> that

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
this chest here and these filters that

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.770 
this chest here and these filters that
are<00:01:42.830> used<00:01:43.430> to<00:01:43.580> pull<00:01:43.760> the<00:01:43.790> weight<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.390> put<00:01:44.600> it

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
are used to pull the weight and put it

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.390 
are used to pull the weight and put it
into<00:01:45.080> these<00:01:45.230> deployers<00:01:45.860> in<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.250> big<00:01:46.970> chamber

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
into these deployers in the big chamber

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.880 
into these deployers in the big chamber
it's<00:01:49.400> a<00:01:49.670> little<00:01:50.330> enough<00:01:50.780> ineffective<00:01:51.740> because

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
it's a little enough ineffective because

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.520 
it's a little enough ineffective because
it<00:01:52.220> takes<00:01:52.760> like<00:01:52.940> 20<00:01:53.240> minutes<00:01:53.420> for<00:01:53.720> icing<00:01:54.260> it<00:01:54.380> is

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
it takes like 20 minutes for icing it is

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.390 
it takes like 20 minutes for icing it is
a<00:01:54.560> pork<00:01:54.920> chop<00:01:54.980> but<00:01:55.280> hey<00:01:55.520> who<00:01:55.760> cares<00:01:55.940> it's<00:01:56.180> funny
