00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
this is my other profit was this guy was

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.870 
this is my other profit was this guy was
a<00:01:24.810> cutting<00:01:25.170> from<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.500> guy<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:26.520> starting<00:01:26.790> to

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
a cutting from that guy it's starting to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.840 
a cutting from that guy it's starting to
climb<00:01:27.890> although<00:01:28.890> it's<00:01:29.100> not<00:01:29.250> doing<00:01:29.579> today<00:01:29.729> it's

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
climb although it's not doing today it's

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.469 
climb although it's not doing today it's
like<00:01:30.000> wilted<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.920> don't<00:01:31.920> know<00:01:32.009> why<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:32.970> I'm

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
like wilted I don't know why but I'm

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.840 
like wilted I don't know why but I'm
thinking<00:01:33.840> it'll<00:01:33.990> be<00:01:34.110> okay<00:01:34.460> it<00:01:35.460> was<00:01:35.610> kind<00:01:35.820> of

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
thinking it'll be okay it was kind of

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.460 
thinking it'll be okay it was kind of
this<00:01:36.090> longer<00:01:36.390> one<00:01:36.570> was<00:01:36.869> kind<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.110> out<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
this longer one was kind of out of the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.080 
this longer one was kind of out of the
pot<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:39.079> repotted<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.200> deeper<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.650> soil

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
pot so I repotted it deeper in the soil

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.660 
pot so I repotted it deeper in the soil
on<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.299> plant<00:01:42.570> here<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.869> my<00:01:43.049> Dracena

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
on this plant here is my Dracena

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.410 
on this plant here is my Dracena
again<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.790> don't<00:01:44.850> even<00:01:45.030> know<00:01:45.119> where<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.299> came

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
again I don't even know where it came

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.240 
again I don't even know where it came
from<00:01:45.479> either<00:01:46.049> most<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.439> these<00:01:46.530> plants<00:01:46.829> were<00:01:47.070> my

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
from either most of these plants were my

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.330 
from either most of these plants were my
great-grandmother's<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.180> think<00:01:49.189> when<00:01:50.189> she

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
great-grandmother's I think when she

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.050 
great-grandmother's I think when she
died<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.880> got<00:01:51.270> them<00:01:52.280> this<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.490> my<00:01:53.750> sunflowers<00:01:54.750> I

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
died I got them this is my sunflowers I

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.030 
died I got them this is my sunflowers I
did<00:01:57.060> these<00:01:57.270> before<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:57.930> went<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.380> vacation<00:01:58.409> and
