 of the largest displays in the class 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.680
 protected smartphones like b15 by the way he 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.540
 finally a decent colleague with them not 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.290
 interesting design and large screen 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.290
 this resident 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.680
 both devices besides worthy of attention 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.750
 appearance has a lot of displays and

 90 gram 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.530
 difference in size and weight with real 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:00.300
 use noticeably felt in terms of 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.129
 buttons and technology holes 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.140
 smartphones are almost the same if not 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.110
 count mechanical control buttons and 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.090
 j3 rosette button when compared 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.670
 smartphones for the duration of the work 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.920
 j3 triumphs him 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.290
 3000mAhm more capacious battery 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.790
 hours against two thousand y how that gives 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.400
 he can work without recharging 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.680
 Talk time up to 25 hours in 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.320
 caterpillar more familiar seven or eight 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.380
 hours also j3 has a little big 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.960
 display what to 4 3 inches vs 4 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.659
 however from a resolution of 480 by 800 pixels 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.219
 color level tft matrix you 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.840
 smartphones same what does 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:38.369
 image quality identical 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.829
 is at a high enough level 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.420
 nevertheless, there is a noticeable difference in the screens 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.490
 color temperature and also not 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.490
 significantly higher level of brightness 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.170
 The undeniable benefits of the same 3 is 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.600
 higher level of protection he 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.960
 complies with international standard

 ip68 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.399
 it is completely dustproof and waterproof and 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.320
 ready for a long dive on 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.929
 depth of more than one meter continuing 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.860
 work plus this smartphone is responsible

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.800
 chemicals as it were 15 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.870
 ip67 certified 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.910
 he withstand a half hour dive on 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.960
 depth up to 1 meter and not afraid to hit 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.610
 moisture and dust 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.610
 however, with responsible with military 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.320
 smartphone does not have j3 standards 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.810
 made from without plastic 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.490
 Wear-resistant rubber smartphone consists of 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.380
 3 pieces that are tightly twisted 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.480
 four metal bolts and 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.820
 additional brackets on the sides which 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.140
 significantly increase the reliability of the case under 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.120

 fixed and under a small lid 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.700
 there is a connector for sim cards and cards 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.980
 memory which increases protected

 anodized aluminum in places that 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.920
 most often hit from

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.090
 made of flexible plastic 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.430
 which not only perfectly bends well well not 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.350
 it dampens shocks attached body 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.300
 unconventional bolts with 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.010
 special mechanism with numerous

 characteristics 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.190
 however, the level of security j3 noticeable 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.510
 superior to his opponent and despite 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.130
 the fact that both devices can 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.260
 used within the city limits they 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.860
 completely different as well as preferences
