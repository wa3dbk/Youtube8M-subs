brush<00:00:59.660> was<00:00:59.900> fiercely<00:01:00.230> independent<00:01:00.820> she

brush was fiercely independent she

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.149 
brush was fiercely independent she
certainly<00:01:02.089> knows<00:01:02.809> quite<00:01:03.559> well<00:01:03.800> what's

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
certainly knows quite well what's

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.980 
certainly knows quite well what's
happening<00:01:04.640> around<00:01:04.760> her<00:01:05.150> within<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.840> art

happening around her within the art
world<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:06.440> I<00:01:06.500> think<00:01:06.680> her<00:01:06.770> Sunday<00:01:07.070> salons<00:01:07.460> are

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
world and I think her Sunday salons are

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.360 
world and I think her Sunday salons are
a<00:01:07.729> way<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:07.940> stay<00:01:08.420> in<00:01:08.450> touch<00:01:09.350> with<00:01:09.409> what<00:01:10.010> artists

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
a way to stay in touch with what artists

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.310 
a way to stay in touch with what artists
are<00:01:10.460> thinking<00:01:10.729> about<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.240> doing<00:01:11.420> I<00:01:11.840> showed

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
her work actually this past February and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.080 
her work actually this past February and
it<00:01:15.229> was<00:01:15.320> kind<00:01:15.620> of<00:01:15.680> an<00:01:15.830> amazing<00:01:16.100> thing<00:01:16.790> because

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
it was kind of an amazing thing because

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.260 
it was kind of an amazing thing because
I<00:01:17.299> and<00:01:17.540> she's<00:01:17.840> really<00:01:18.500> just<00:01:18.940> obviously<00:01:19.940> so

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
I and she's really just obviously so

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.140 
I and she's really just obviously so
such<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.570> presence<00:01:21.250> she's<00:01:22.250> someone<00:01:22.610> who's<00:01:22.790> very

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
such a presence she's someone who's very

very<00:01:23.479> complicated<00:01:24.260> and<00:01:24.619> at<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:24.830> same<00:01:25.010> time

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
very complicated and at the same time

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.789 
very complicated and at the same time
powerfully<00:01:26.030> direct<00:01:26.450> for<00:01:27.110> her<00:01:27.260> art<00:01:27.500> is<00:01:27.619> so

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
powerfully direct for her art is so

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.160
