00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:05.600 
hey guys I got one for you

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.700 
hey guys I got one for you
impeller<00:00:06.230> housings<00:00:06.880> let's<00:00:07.880> check<00:00:08.059> this<00:00:08.180> out

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.710 
impeller housings let's check this out

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.850 
impeller housings let's check this out
this<00:00:09.710> is<00:00:09.769> a<00:00:09.920> wood<00:00:10.730> chipper<00:00:11.030> of<00:00:11.090> mine<00:00:11.240> and<00:00:11.860> the

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
this is a wood chipper of mine and the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.779 
this is a wood chipper of mine and the
problem<00:00:13.190> is<00:00:13.370> with<00:00:14.060> all<00:00:14.300> impellers<00:00:14.870> is<00:00:15.789> if

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
problem is with all impellers is if

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.900 
problem is with all impellers is if
there<00:00:16.970> is<00:00:17.150> this<00:00:18.080> one<00:00:18.289> particularly<00:00:18.890> it<00:00:19.700> likes

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
there is this one particularly it likes

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.109 
there is this one particularly it likes
to<00:00:20.000> clog<00:00:20.270> up<00:00:21.039> if<00:00:22.039> you<00:00:22.130> feed<00:00:22.340> too<00:00:22.490> much<00:00:22.640> in<00:00:22.789> it<00:00:22.940> to

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
to clog up if you feed too much in it to

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.570 
to clog up if you feed too much in it to
it<00:00:23.240> at<00:00:23.330> a<00:00:23.420> time<00:00:23.600> it'll<00:00:24.530> clog<00:00:24.740> and<00:00:25.039> the<00:00:25.279> problem

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
it at a time it'll clog and the problem

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.120 
it at a time it'll clog and the problem
with<00:00:25.699> it<00:00:25.970> is<00:00:26.170> if<00:00:27.170> you<00:00:27.350> see<00:00:27.590> this<00:00:27.710> gap<00:00:27.949> between

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
with it is if you see this gap between

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.170 
with it is if you see this gap between
the<00:00:28.369> housing<00:00:28.699> and<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:28.880> impeller<00:00:29.470> but<00:00:30.910> you<00:00:31.910> can

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
the housing and the impeller but you can

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.330 
the housing and the impeller but you can
ever<00:00:32.419> get<00:00:32.780> much<00:00:33.379> closer<00:00:33.680> in<00:00:33.800> that<00:00:34.010> when<00:00:34.219> you're

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
ever get much closer in that when you're

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.040 
ever get much closer in that when you're
dealing<00:00:34.519> with<00:00:34.550> metal<00:00:34.850> on<00:00:34.909> metal<00:00:34.969> unless<00:00:35.839> it's

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
dealing with metal on metal unless it's

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.950 
dealing with metal on metal unless it's
a<00:00:36.109> precision<00:00:36.499> machined<00:00:37.010> surface<00:00:37.519> and<00:00:37.960> the

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
a precision machined surface and the

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.360 
a precision machined surface and the
reason<00:00:39.229> is<00:00:39.409> is<00:00:39.769> because<00:00:40.010> it<00:00:40.219> would<00:00:40.280> be

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
reason is is because it would be

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.660 
reason is is because it would be
catastrophic<00:00:40.579> failure<00:00:41.420> if<00:00:41.629> this<00:00:42.469> you<00:00:43.280> know<00:00:43.399> if

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
catastrophic failure if this you know if

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.910 
catastrophic failure if this you know if
your<00:00:43.850> big<00:00:43.999> flywheel<00:00:44.449> chipper<00:00:44.920> actually

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
your big flywheel chipper actually

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.450 
your big flywheel chipper actually
intersected<00:00:46.460> with<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.699> housing<00:00:47.289> a<00:00:48.460> trick

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
intersected with the housing a trick

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.250 
intersected with the housing a trick
I've<00:00:49.579> done<00:00:49.760> numerous<00:00:50.179> times<00:00:50.479> on<00:00:50.659> snowblowers

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260

I've done numerous times on snowblowers
I've<00:00:51.409> actually<00:00:51.559> never<00:00:51.799> done<00:00:52.069> it<00:00:52.190> on<00:00:52.309> a<00:00:52.399> wood

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:52.999 
I've actually never done it on a wood

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:58.090 
I've actually never done it on a wood
chipper<00:00:53.329> is<00:00:55.239> these<00:00:56.530> these<00:00:57.530> are<00:00:57.739> little<00:00:57.920> rubber

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
chipper is these these are little rubber

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.180 
chipper is these these are little rubber

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
around and beat the pavement and blow

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.810 
around and beat the pavement and blow
the<00:01:16.470> snow<00:01:17.810> but<00:01:18.810> what<00:01:19.620> you<00:01:19.740> do<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
the snow but what you do and I do the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.130 
the snow but what you do and I do the
same<00:01:21.090> thing<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.390> snowblower<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.870> I<00:01:21.960> said

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
same thing on the snowblower like I said

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.210 
same thing on the snowblower like I said
is<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.920> actually<00:01:23.420> just<00:01:24.420> screw<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:25.220> right

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
is you actually just screw it right

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.440 
is you actually just screw it right
inside<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.580> housing<00:01:26.970> just<00:01:27.300> like<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:30.240> it

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
inside the housing just like so and it

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.630 
inside the housing just like so and it
flex<00:01:30.870> I<00:01:31.230> have<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.980> trim<00:01:32.160> this<00:01:32.280> one<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.610> a

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
flex I have to trim this one just a

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.560 
flex I have to trim this one just a
little<00:01:32.670> bit<00:01:33.380> we'll<00:01:34.380> do<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.590> right<00:01:34.650> now

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
little bit we'll do that right now

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.630 
little bit we'll do that right now
so<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:37.290> put<00:01:37.740> them<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:37.890> there<00:01:38.070> long<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.460> then<00:01:38.580> I

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
so I I put them on there long and then I

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.770 
so I I put them on there long and then I
cut<00:01:38.880> them<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.090> fit<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.450> they'll<00:01:39.630> actually

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
cut them to fit and they'll actually

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.290 
cut them to fit and they'll actually
wear<00:01:40.170> out<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.380> fit<00:01:40.760> you<00:01:41.760> can<00:01:41.880> leave<00:01:42.000> them<00:01:42.060> just

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
wear out to fit you can leave them just

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:51.060 
wear out to fit you can leave them just
a<00:01:42.390> little<00:01:42.420> bit<00:01:42.900> snug<00:01:47.750> there<00:01:48.750> we<00:01:48.869> go

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.260 

so<00:01:51.640> now<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:53.140> size<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.590> fit<00:01:53.830> and<00:01:54.580> it<00:01:54.940> will<00:01:55.090> rub

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
so now that size to fit and it will rub

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.720 
so now that size to fit and it will rub
around<00:01:55.540> in<00:01:55.690> there<00:01:56.280> I'm<00:01:57.280> not<00:01:57.430> going<00:01:57.580> to<00:01:57.640> do<00:01:57.700> all

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
around in there I'm not going to do all

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.210 
around in there I'm not going to do all
four<00:01:57.880> paddles<00:01:58.300> I'm<00:01:58.450> just<00:01:58.570> going<00:01:58.690> to<00:01:58.750> do<00:01:58.900> two

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
four paddles I'm just going to do two

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.870 
four paddles I'm just going to do two
but<00:02:00.220> it<00:02:01.620> it<00:02:02.620> grabs<00:02:02.860> now<00:02:03.100> you<00:02:03.400> see<00:02:03.550> this<00:02:03.640> one<00:02:03.850> I

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
but it it grabs now you see this one I

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.030 
but it it grabs now you see this one I
did<00:02:04.060> on<00:02:04.150> the<00:02:04.210> other<00:02:04.240> side<00:02:04.540> it's<00:02:05.470> cleaning<00:02:05.800> all

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
did on the other side it's cleaning all

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.900 
did on the other side it's cleaning all
the<00:02:06.130> way<00:02:06.220> around<00:02:06.460> even<00:02:06.760> on<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.000> bottom<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.580> it

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
the way around even on the bottom and it

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.910 
the way around even on the bottom and it
will<00:02:09.940> only<00:02:10.179> take<00:02:10.330> you<00:02:10.750> know<00:02:10.960> 30<00:02:11.470> seconds<00:02:11.860> to

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
will only take you know 30 seconds to

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.040 
will only take you know 30 seconds to
running<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:12.370> these<00:02:12.430> will<00:02:12.640> be<00:02:12.730> worn<00:02:13.050> perfectly

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
running and these will be worn perfectly

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.930 
running and these will be worn perfectly
to<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.290> surface<00:02:14.590> as<00:02:14.740> close<00:02:14.890> as<00:02:15.070> possible<00:02:15.490> you

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
to the surface as close as possible you

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.910 
to the surface as close as possible you
also<00:02:16.120> notice<00:02:16.390> when<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:16.960> spin<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.500> this

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
also notice when you spin it that this

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.590 
also notice when you spin it that this
inside<00:02:18.400> housing<00:02:18.760> isn't<00:02:18.940> perfectly<00:02:19.360> round

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
inside housing isn't perfectly round

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.990 
inside housing isn't perfectly round
because<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:19.990> hits<00:02:20.220> it'll<00:02:21.220> hit<00:02:21.340> up<00:02:21.490> here<00:02:21.820> I

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
because it hits it'll hit up here I

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.750 
because it hits it'll hit up here I
won't<00:02:22.840> hit<00:02:22.990> down<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.350> bottom<00:02:23.560> side<00:02:23.770> but

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
won't hit down to the bottom side but

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.550 
won't hit down to the bottom side but
essentially<00:02:25.150> what's<00:02:25.300> happening<00:02:25.690> here<00:02:26.470> I'll

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
essentially what's happening here I'll

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.740 
essentially what's happening here I'll
show<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:26.740> on<00:02:26.890> this<00:02:27.060> your<00:02:28.060> rotor<00:02:28.240> spinning<00:02:28.630> in

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
show you on this your rotor spinning in

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.410 
show you on this your rotor spinning in
the<00:02:28.810> middle<00:02:28.840> but<00:02:29.680> they<00:02:29.770> have<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.010> leave<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.190> gap

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
the middle but they have to leave a gap

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.050 
the middle but they have to leave a gap
so<00:02:31.420> whether<00:02:32.170> it's<00:02:32.350> snow<00:02:32.440> or<00:02:32.860> wood<00:02:33.520> chips<00:02:33.550> as

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
so whether it's snow or wood chips as

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.260 
so whether it's snow or wood chips as
this<00:02:34.990> is<00:02:35.140> spinning<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:36.310> throw<00:02:36.580> out<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.970> the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
this is spinning to throw out the the

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.150 
this is spinning to throw out the the
wood<00:02:37.420> chips<00:02:37.660> they're<00:02:38.290> actually<00:02:38.530> falling<00:02:38.950> over

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
wood chips they're actually falling over

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.790 
wood chips they're actually falling over
the<00:02:39.280> top<00:02:39.990> losing<00:02:40.990> their<00:02:41.110> momentum<00:02:42.840> also<00:02:43.840> the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
the top losing their momentum also the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.170 
the top losing their momentum also the
speed<00:02:45.510> right<00:02:46.510> here<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:48.310> speed<00:02:48.550> right<00:02:48.760> here<00:02:48.790> is

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
speed right here the speed right here is

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.600 
speed right here the speed right here is
moving<00:02:49.750> slower<00:02:50.020> than<00:02:50.410> here<00:02:50.770> then<00:02:51.190> here<00:02:51.489> this

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
moving slower than here then here this

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.370 
moving slower than here then here this
is<00:02:51.670> faster<00:02:52.120> and<00:02:52.239> faster<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.540> faster<00:02:52.600> so<00:02:53.290> the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
is faster and faster and faster so the

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.560 
is faster and faster and faster so the
further<00:02:53.560> out<00:02:53.800> it<00:02:53.920> goes<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.459> faster<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:54.970> is<00:02:55.060> the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
further out it goes the faster it is the

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.240 
further out it goes the faster it is the
faster<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.080> velocity<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:56.920> know<00:02:57.010> you'll<00:02:57.160> have

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
faster the velocity you know you'll have

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.370 
faster the velocity you know you'll have
an<00:02:57.370> opening<00:02:57.670> right<00:02:57.760> here<00:02:57.940> in<00:02:58.030> your<00:02:58.090> snowblower

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
an opening right here in your snowblower

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.110 
an opening right here in your snowblower
or<00:02:59.380> what<00:02:59.560> not<00:02:59.769> the<00:03:00.340> faster<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.760> will<00:03:00.880> throw<00:03:01.030> it

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
or what not the faster it will throw it

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.460 
or what not the faster it will throw it
out<00:03:01.239> so<00:03:01.900> by<00:03:02.019> adding<00:03:02.200> a<00:03:02.730> rubber<00:03:03.730> paddle<00:03:04.120> piece

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
out so by adding a rubber paddle piece

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.370 
out so by adding a rubber paddle piece
to<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.560> front<00:03:05.680> edge<00:03:05.890> of<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.190> now<00:03:07.150> it'll<00:03:07.989> always

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
to the front edge of it now it'll always

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.710 
to the front edge of it now it'll always
scrape<00:03:08.739> along<00:03:09.060> giving<00:03:10.060> you<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.239> max<00:03:10.450> length

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
scrape along giving you the max length

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.170 
scrape along giving you the max length
and<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.560> mass<00:03:11.739> you<00:03:12.160> know<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:12.670> max<00:03:12.850> throwing

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
and the mass you know the max throwing

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.050 
and the mass you know the max throwing
power<00:03:13.920> just<00:03:14.920> adding<00:03:15.220> even<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.489> quarter<00:03:15.790> inch<00:03:15.940> on

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
power just adding even a quarter inch on

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.850 
power just adding even a quarter inch on
a<00:03:16.090> lot<00:03:16.299> of<00:03:16.330> these<00:03:16.450> snowblowers<00:03:16.959> makes<00:03:17.530> a<00:03:17.650> huge

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
a lot of these snowblowers makes a huge

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.190 
a lot of these snowblowers makes a huge
difference<00:03:21.630> if<00:03:22.630> you'll<00:03:22.780> notice<00:03:22.959> on<00:03:23.140> a

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
difference if you'll notice on a

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.180 
difference if you'll notice on a
snowblower<00:03:23.500> right<00:03:23.830> here<00:03:24.269> um<00:03:25.860> secretly<00:03:26.860> chien

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
snowblower right here um secretly chien

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.780 
snowblower right here um secretly chien
there<00:03:29.100> you'll<00:03:30.100> notice<00:03:30.280> that<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.580> gap<00:03:30.760> between

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
there you'll notice that the gap between

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.670 
there you'll notice that the gap between
the<00:03:31.090> housing<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.590> body<00:03:32.799> is<00:03:34.470> this<00:03:35.470> one's

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
the housing and the body is this one's

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.420 
the housing and the body is this one's
not<00:03:35.769> too<00:03:35.830> bad<00:03:36.239> but<00:03:37.239> one<00:03:37.570> gets<00:03:37.810> up<00:03:37.930> here<00:03:38.110> it's

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
not too bad but one gets up here it's

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.860 
not too bad but one gets up here it's
you<00:03:39.430> know<00:03:39.549> it's<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.090> good<00:03:40.269> eighth<00:03:40.510> of<00:03:40.660> an<00:03:40.750> inch

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
you know it's a good eighth of an inch

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.590 
you know it's a good eighth of an inch
and<00:03:41.860> that<00:03:42.130> makes<00:03:42.340> a<00:03:42.519> huge<00:03:42.760> difference<00:03:42.820> of<00:03:43.420> how

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
and that makes a huge difference of how

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.949 
and that makes a huge difference of how
far<00:03:43.840> it's<00:03:43.989> throws<00:03:45.330> I've<00:03:46.330> done<00:03:46.540> into<00:03:46.720> quite<00:03:46.900> a

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
far it's throws I've done into quite a

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.770 
far it's throws I've done into quite a
few<00:03:47.140> snow<00:03:47.320> blowers<00:03:47.590> that<00:03:47.650> I've<00:03:47.799> sold

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
few snow blowers that I've sold

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.900 
few snow blowers that I've sold
oh<00:03:49.810> you<00:03:50.560> guys<00:03:50.680> can't<00:03:50.950> even<00:03:50.980> see<00:03:51.250> I<00:03:51.430> did<00:03:51.670> your

oh you guys can't even see I did your

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.950 
oh you guys can't even see I did your
snowblower<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:52.570> John<00:03:53.560> Deere<00:03:53.770> in<00:03:53.950> here<00:03:54.840> maybe<00:03:55.840> I

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
snowblower a John Deere in here maybe I

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:04.170 
snowblower a John Deere in here maybe I
could<00:03:56.110> get<00:03:56.170> you<00:03:56.320> guys<00:03:56.470> in<00:03:56.650> here<00:04:02.550> yes<00:04:03.550> see<00:04:04.000> if

could get you guys in here yes see if
you'll<00:04:04.270> notice<00:04:04.450> in<00:04:04.600> this<00:04:04.720> John<00:04:04.960> do<00:04:05.080> you<00:04:05.110> notice

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
you'll notice in this John do you notice

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.560 
you'll notice in this John do you notice
that<00:04:05.590> I<00:04:05.740> I<00:04:05.950> put<00:04:06.670> a<00:04:06.700> paddle<00:04:07.030> in<00:04:07.090> there<00:04:07.300> and

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
that I I put a paddle in there and

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.960 
that I I put a paddle in there and
you'll<00:04:08.200> notice<00:04:08.410> that<00:04:08.530> it<00:04:08.710> sticks<00:04:08.920> up<00:04:09.100> roughly

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
you'll notice that it sticks up roughly

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.410 
you'll notice that it sticks up roughly
3/8<00:04:10.360> of<00:04:10.480> an<00:04:10.600> inch<00:04:10.720> because<00:04:11.410> that's<00:04:12.240> how<00:04:13.240> far

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
3/8 of an inch because that's how far

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.400 
3/8 of an inch because that's how far
off<00:04:13.600> it<00:04:13.750> was<00:04:13.930> a<00:04:15.840> little<00:04:16.840> thing<00:04:16.959> like<00:04:16.989> that's<00:04:17.230> a

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
off it was a little thing like that's a

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.560 
off it was a little thing like that's a
quick<00:04:17.590> easy<00:04:17.739> fix<00:04:18.100> and<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:19.000> makes<00:04:19.120> a<00:04:19.239> world<00:04:19.390> of

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
quick easy fix and it makes a world of
