per<00:00:29.640> gallon<00:00:29.910> or<00:00:30.090> more<00:00:30.300> we're<00:00:30.660> thinking<00:00:30.990> and

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
per gallon or more we're thinking and

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.799 
per gallon or more we're thinking and
Ranger<00:00:32.250> probably<00:00:32.489> 200<00:00:32.820> miles<00:00:32.969> how<00:00:33.660> do<00:00:33.719> you

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
Ranger probably 200 miles how do you

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.020 
Ranger probably 200 miles how do you
feel<00:00:33.930> about<00:00:33.960> your<00:00:34.230> performance<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.739> far<00:00:35.030> we

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
feel about your performance so far we

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.700 
feel about your performance so far we
are<00:00:36.120> pretty<00:00:36.360> happy<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.899> both<00:00:37.079> vehicles<00:00:37.290> got

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
are pretty happy that both vehicles got

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.650 
are pretty happy that both vehicles got
around<00:00:38.070> roughly<00:00:38.520> 180<00:00:39.120> miles<00:00:39.329> per<00:00:39.480> gallon

around roughly 180 miles per gallon

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.450 
around roughly 180 miles per gallon
actually<00:00:40.379> we're<00:00:40.469> thinking<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.100> can<00:00:41.219> get

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
actually we're thinking it can get

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.479 
actually we're thinking it can get
better<00:00:41.670> than<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.020> closer<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.110> 200<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.890> guess

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
better than that closer to 200 I guess

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.860 
better than that closer to 200 I guess
the<00:00:44.610> most<00:00:44.789> distinctive<00:00:45.210> thing<00:00:45.270> about<00:00:45.690> your

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the most distinctive thing about your

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.380 
the most distinctive thing about your
vehicle<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.039> has<00:00:47.399> wheels<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:48.000> pop

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
vehicle is that it has wheels that pop

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.590 
vehicle is that it has wheels that pop
out<00:00:48.600> tell<00:00:49.350> me<00:00:49.440> about<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.739> idea<00:00:50.190> behind<00:00:50.340> that

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
out tell me about the idea behind that

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.810 
out tell me about the idea behind that
it'll<00:00:51.600> essentially<00:00:51.899> it's<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> it's<00:00:53.160> replaced

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
it'll essentially it's the it's replaced

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.000 
it'll essentially it's the it's replaced
the<00:00:54.149> legs<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.750> feet<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.260> motorcycle<00:00:55.860> rider

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the legs and feet of a motorcycle rider

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.069 
the legs and feet of a motorcycle rider
since<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> vehicles<00:00:56.850> totally<00:00:57.149> enclosed<00:00:57.449> it

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
since the vehicles totally enclosed it

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.319 
since the vehicles totally enclosed it

to come up and down automatically but
they<00:01:06.810> found<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> little<00:01:07.439> better<00:01:07.619> with<00:01:07.830> human

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
they found it a little better with human

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.490 
they found it a little better with human
