00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hi everyone there will be a review today 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.210
 small so useful 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.730
 device so-called powerbank 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.519
 name black box 5 thousand 200 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:18.930
 milliampere hours capacity is such 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:21.769
 boxes comes inside the box 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.779
 directly power bank itself 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:29.279
 pretty heavy of this dimensions in 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:43.559
 arm and down here are a few 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:46.230
 Adapters Krishna for charge means 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:55.110
 instructions brief there characteristics 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:59.910
 its described how to charge it what 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.320
 denotes indicator here i am now 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.860
 tell it in your own words will 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:13.170
 clearer means to account perednichka in 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:17.280
 this is the actual output of yusbi here 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:22.880
 jack and it comes with three adapters 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.880
 set accordingly 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:34.360
 taste like this goes adapter i'm honest i'm not 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:37.869
 I know where to why not if anything 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.310
 Contact me I need this 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.850
 moment around the device and here is such 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.850
 micro usb 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.060
 that is , my smartphone is powered by 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.340
 microusb and the tablet that I showed 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.770
 according to a recent review is also used 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.630
 micro cheating most devices i 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.030
 I think many also use microusb 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.679
 port 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:06.250
 pier black box powerbank from the butt we 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:09.640
 here we see two connectors and LED lights 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.410
 but itâ€™s not like a flashlight 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.239
 very bright but at your feet last somewhere 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.720
 there is a keyhole to highlight quite 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.760
 you can ordinary visa port is 5 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.230
 volt output through which we 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.459
 connect directly to this cord 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:31.299
 and the necessary adapter is already on the cord and 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:35.280
 micro yusbi is 5 volt input in that is 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.280
 through it we charge the power bank itself 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.720
 here we have a button here we have 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:50.609
 there is a button oval shape is convenient 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:54.430
 under the finger and 4 LEDs therefore 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:56.260
 if one time we click we will see a test 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.389
 indication here are four LEDs all 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.200
 burn it means the power bank is charged 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:08.139
 fully if you hold the button and 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.400
 hold flashlight I 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:14.250
 burn in principle in the dark 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.329
 pretty useful thing and by 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:21.819
 pressing once we turn off 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:25.299
 powerbank everything now he is allowed power 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.430
 does not feed means its capacity is stated 5 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.750
 thousand 200 milliamps and I will say right away I already 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:35.850
 In principle , I checked it and I managed 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.850
 charge three times a single power bank 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.880
 battery for your smartphone lg 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.750
 optimus black 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.140
 which has a capacity of 1,500 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:50.819
 milliamper hours so that means 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:53.069
 indicators mean indicator mean 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.160
 if 4 LEDs are lit it is full 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.950
 charge capacity here are three LEDs 75 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.319
 percent two fifty percent and 125 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.000
 percent well that is broken into four 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:08.400
 the steps are exactly the same time the charge itself 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.989
 blackbox is very convenient 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.269
 indication that is when we have completely 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.060
 discharged all four LEDs 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.790
 alternately mega running lights such further 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.489
 when he gains 25 percent capacity 1 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.560
 LED shines continuously 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.750
 the other three flicker alternately when 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.300
 gaining 50 percent two leds 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.600
 burn continuously 2 mirza respectively 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.130
 75 scored 3 burn last flicker well and 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.000
 at the end when fully charged 74 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.050
 LED will not shed such an heir 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.300
 way that is basically possible 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.610
 understand to what level of my charge 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.830
 Do exactly the same when we use can 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.510
 track to what level we have 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:52.289
 discharged that it is of course very 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:55.050
 here is convenient standard label for what 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.610
 can use so well let's go for 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.210
 an example will show how it works on 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.650
 practice 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:04.100
 we take powerbank we take adapter yusbi 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.100
 micro usb 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:14.070
 respectively, and connect our smartphone 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:17.550
 and we accordingly immediately 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:20.539
 begins charging indication that is 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.539
 charge process went 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.690
 here you can click on the button to see 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.240
 What is the condition of our battery 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.280
 4 LEDs are on, it means we are full 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.410
 and accordingly I can expect that 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.639
 with a full charge I can about three times 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:40.550
 charge your smartphone fully therefore 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:45.650
 I think this 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.650
 powerbank is quite a useful thing 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.820
 because when a person is intense 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.370
 uses a smartphone either 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:57.539
 and the tablet has the property enough 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:59.389
 quickly lose charge sits well and the way out 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:02.100
 out of the situation for mobile charging 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:04.320
 accordingly use this 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.240
 octaves by the bank it is very convenient when in 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.440
 road or somewhere in the field 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:12.780
 when there is no opportunity to use 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.930
 outlet on this this video i 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.130
 I hope it was helpful 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.949
 someone will adopt this 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.789
 device thank you all for your attention 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:22.789
 good luck bye
