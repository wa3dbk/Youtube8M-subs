00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:03.909 

see<00:04:58.640> not<00:04:59.640> sure<00:04:59.850> if<00:04:59.910> that<00:05:00.120> works<00:05:00.360> or<00:05:00.600> not<00:05:00.630> though

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.990 

okay<00:05:04.639> and<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:06.560> reason<00:05:06.740> this<00:05:07.219> is<00:05:07.280> this<00:05:07.759> works

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
okay and the reason this is this works

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.820 
okay and the reason this is this works
is<00:05:08.210> you<00:05:08.360> look<00:05:08.509> at<00:05:08.599> your<00:05:08.659> speed<00:05:09.229> which<00:05:09.469> is<00:05:09.620> like

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
is you look at your speed which is like

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.439 
is you look at your speed which is like
a<00:05:10.129> lot<00:05:10.879> faster<00:05:11.629> than<00:05:12.909> the<00:05:13.909> things<00:05:14.180> we've<00:05:14.419> seen

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
a lot faster than the things we've seen

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:16.450 
a lot faster than the things we've seen
before<00:05:15.080> like<00:05:15.680> you<00:05:15.800> don't<00:05:15.949> get<00:05:16.039> that<00:05:16.189> in<00:05:16.370> the

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
before like you don't get that in the

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.700 
before like you don't get that in the
wireless<00:05:16.669> connection<00:05:17.090> not<00:05:17.960> will<00:05:18.139> do<00:05:18.289> it<00:05:18.469> still

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
wireless connection not will do it still

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.520 
wireless connection not will do it still
will<00:05:18.979> do<00:05:19.129> its<00:05:19.280> thing<00:05:19.340> it<00:05:19.580> will<00:05:19.699> take<00:05:19.879> a<00:05:19.909> while

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
will do its thing it will take a while

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.600 
will do its thing it will take a while
but<00:05:21.530> it'll<00:05:21.680> work<00:05:21.740> so<00:05:22.069> that's<00:05:22.250> how<00:05:22.340> you<00:05:22.400> pretty

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
but it'll work so that's how you pretty

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.070 
but it'll work so that's how you pretty
much<00:05:22.729> do<00:05:22.969> it<00:05:23.000> and<00:05:23.270> you<00:05:23.360> can<00:05:23.569> go<00:05:23.750> on<00:05:23.810> this<00:05:23.900> and

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
much do it and you can go on this and

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.260 
much do it and you can go on this and
the<00:05:24.319> guy<00:05:24.500> and<00:05:24.740> I<00:05:24.770> launch<00:05:25.039> the<00:05:25.250> game<00:05:25.400> now<00:05:26.210> I'm

the guy and I launch the game now I'm

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.820 
the guy and I launch the game now I'm
just<00:05:26.419> make<00:05:26.599> sure<00:05:26.750> did<00:05:26.930> not<00:05:26.960> touch<00:05:27.259> your<00:05:27.530> black

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
just make sure did not touch your black

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.409 
just make sure did not touch your black
boxes<00:05:28.340> just<00:05:28.490> littered<00:05:28.759> wrong<00:05:28.939> it<00:05:29.090> just<00:05:29.270> goes

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
boxes just littered wrong it just goes

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.899 
boxes just littered wrong it just goes
blank<00:05:29.719> a<00:05:29.870> bit<00:05:30.050> but<00:05:30.349> it's<00:05:30.500> still<00:05:30.680> running<00:05:30.909> all
