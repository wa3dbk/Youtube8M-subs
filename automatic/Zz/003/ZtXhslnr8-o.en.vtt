well<00:02:48.819> thread<00:02:49.180> he<00:02:49.810> ain't<00:02:49.930> standing<00:02:50.560> there<00:02:50.739> for

no-one to be on him and stuff and I

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.930 
no-one to be on him and stuff and I
guess<00:02:52.810> that's<00:02:53.049> why<00:02:53.230> he's<00:02:53.799> 48<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.579> all<00:02:54.730> he's

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
guess that's why he's 48 and all he's

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.759 
guess that's why he's 48 and all he's
still<00:02:55.060> fresh<00:02:55.599> he<00:02:55.870> still<00:02:56.139> can<00:02:56.319> do<00:02:56.440> what<00:02:56.620> he's

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
still fresh he still can do what he's

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.250 
still fresh he still can do what he's
always<00:02:56.980> done<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.519> I'm<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.150> think<00:02:58.359> because<00:02:58.750> he's

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
always done and I'm I think because he's

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.420 
always done and I'm I think because he's
always<00:02:59.409> trying<00:02:59.680> to<00:02:59.829> think<00:02:59.920> he's<00:03:00.280> always

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
always trying to think he's always

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.369 
always trying to think he's always

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
I was lost if I wanted to fight him I

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.430 
I was lost if I wanted to fight him I
checked<00:03:27.910> out<00:03:28.090> his<00:03:28.209> record<00:03:28.480> I<00:03:28.900> saw<00:03:29.139> that<00:03:29.290> he

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
checked out his record I saw that he

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.039 
checked out his record I saw that he
lost<00:03:29.650> two<00:03:29.829> colossal<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.730> borough<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.449> Eddie
