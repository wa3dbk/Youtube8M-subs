00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
reason being that they're not gonna

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.570 
reason being that they're not gonna
change<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.590> because<00:00:25.949> they<00:00:26.070> were<00:00:26.130> moving

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
change that is because they were moving

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.910 
change that is because they were moving
the<00:00:26.609> camera<00:00:26.880> out<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.689> box<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.560> reason<00:00:28.890> being

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the camera out the box the reason being

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.160 
the camera out the box the reason being
for<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.460> which<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.910> think<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.630> many<00:00:30.900> people

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
for this which I think and many people

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.470 
for this which I think and many people
think<00:00:31.560> as<00:00:31.769> well<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.700> attract<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.239> games

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
think as well is to attract the games

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.229 
think as well is to attract the games
from<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.809> xbox<00:00:34.140> one<00:00:34.350> over<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> PS<00:00:35.850> far

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
from the xbox one over to the PS far

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.389 
from the xbox one over to the PS far
this<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> good<00:00:37.110> tactic<00:00:37.469> because<00:00:37.649> as<00:00:37.920> gamers

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
this is a good tactic because as gamers

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.420 
this is a good tactic because as gamers
we<00:00:38.910> know<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.930> we<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.410> go<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:41.010> know<00:00:41.040> for

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
we know that we like to go you know for

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.330 
we know that we like to go you know for
the<00:00:41.489> cheaper<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.239> save<00:00:42.960> money<00:00:43.170> that's<00:00:44.129> good

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
the cheaper and save money that's good

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.520 
the cheaper and save money that's good
that<00:00:44.550> thought<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.480> also<00:00:45.870> concerns<00:00:46.379> as

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
that thought this is also concerns as

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.580 
that thought this is also concerns as
well<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:46.860> developers<00:00:47.600> developers<00:00:48.600> know<00:00:49.140> that
