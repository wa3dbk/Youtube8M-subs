Giants<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.299> think<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.750> had<00:01:12.869> them<00:01:12.960> left<00:01:13.170> over

Giants I think I just had them left over

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.780 
Giants I think I just had them left over
from<00:01:13.500> like<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> giant<00:01:14.040> healer<00:01:14.220> strategy<00:01:14.670> but

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
from like a giant healer strategy but

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.980 
from like a giant healer strategy but
it's<00:01:14.939> actually<00:01:15.240> gonna<00:01:15.360> work<00:01:15.509> out<00:01:15.659> pretty<00:01:15.869> well

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
it's actually gonna work out pretty well

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.810 
it's actually gonna work out pretty well
because<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:16.650> use<00:01:16.799> those<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.159> distract<00:01:17.580> and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
because I can use those to distract and

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.880 
because I can use those to distract and
then<00:01:18.299> use<00:01:18.450> my<00:01:18.600> archers<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.200> shoot<00:01:19.409> down<00:01:19.590> this

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
then use my archers to shoot down this

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.350 
then use my archers to shoot down this
air<00:01:20.070> defense<00:01:20.369> because<00:01:20.790> what<00:01:21.000> my<00:01:21.090> main

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
air defense because what my main

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.090 
air defense because what my main
strategy<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.960> gonna<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.680> I'm<00:01:22.860> gonna<00:01:22.950> drop

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
strategy is gonna be is I'm gonna drop

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.800 
strategy is gonna be is I'm gonna drop
all<00:01:23.280> my<00:01:23.310> Valkyries<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.390> see<00:01:24.659> right

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
all my Valkyries like you can see right

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.630 
all my Valkyries like you can see right
there<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.409> I'm<00:01:25.619> gonna<00:01:25.770> follow<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.159> up<00:01:26.310> with<00:01:26.340> my

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
there and I'm gonna follow it up with my

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.670 
there and I'm gonna follow it up with my
healer<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:28.170> if<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.320> guys<00:01:28.409> don't<00:01:28.590> know<00:01:28.650> what

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
healer so if you guys don't know what

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.899 
healer so if you guys don't know what
the<00:01:28.829> Valkyries<00:01:29.189> are<00:01:29.310> probably<00:01:29.610> because<00:01:29.790> no

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
the Valkyries are probably because no

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.850 
the Valkyries are probably because no
one<00:01:30.030> ever<00:01:30.150> uses<00:01:30.479> them<00:01:30.810> they<00:01:31.380> are<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> dark

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
one ever uses them they are a dark

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.830 
one ever uses them they are a dark
elixir<00:01:32.040> troop<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.610> think<00:01:32.880> they<00:01:33.180> take<00:01:33.540> about

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
elixir troop I think they take about

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.300 
elixir troop I think they take about
like<00:01:34.020> five<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.439> eight<00:01:34.560> spots<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.040> forget

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
like five to eight spots I forget

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.399 
like five to eight spots I forget
exactly<00:01:35.490> how<00:01:35.820> many<00:01:35.939> spots<00:01:36.240> they<00:01:36.450> take<00:01:36.630> up<00:01:36.810> but

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
exactly how many spots they take up but

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.380 
exactly how many spots they take up but
they're<00:01:37.530> seen<00:01:37.770> as<00:01:37.979> like<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.460> giant<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.000> dark

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
they're seen as like the giant of dark

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.749 
they're seen as like the giant of dark
elixir<00:01:39.600> troops<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.320> unlike<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> giant<00:01:41.700> they

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
elixir troops and unlike the giant they

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.370 
elixir troops and unlike the giant they
actually<00:01:42.090> attack<00:01:42.210> anything<00:01:42.869> which<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.170> big

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
actually attack anything which is a big

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.840 
actually attack anything which is a big
disadvantage<00:01:43.680> they'd<00:01:44.130> probably<00:01:44.310> be<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> lot

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
disadvantage they'd probably be a lot

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.399 
disadvantage they'd probably be a lot
better<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.240> they<00:01:45.360> attacked<00:01:45.659> only<00:01:45.869> defensive

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
better if they attacked only defensive

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.649 
better if they attacked only defensive
buildings<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:47.369> they<00:01:47.490> actually<00:01:47.909> swing<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.570> a

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
buildings but they actually swing in a

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.210 
buildings but they actually swing in a
circle<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.229> can<00:01:49.439> see<00:01:49.619> when<00:01:49.770> they<00:01:49.890> attack

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
circle so you can see when they attack

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.249 
circle so you can see when they attack
they<00:01:50.820> damage<00:01:51.270> anything<00:01:51.570> around<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.229> you

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
they damage anything around it so you

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.510 
they damage anything around it so you
can<00:01:52.439> see<00:01:52.619> they're<00:01:52.799> attacking<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.310> walls

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
can see they're attacking the walls

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.399 
can see they're attacking the walls
right<00:01:53.759> there<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.720> when<00:01:54.930> they're<00:01:55.079> like<00:01:55.259> in

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
right there and when they're like in

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.020 
right there and when they're like in
between<00:01:55.860> like<00:01:56.070> three<00:01:56.310> or<00:01:56.430> four<00:01:56.460> buildings

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
between like three or four buildings

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.819 
between like three or four buildings
they<00:01:57.180> actually<00:01:57.540> go<00:01:57.659> crazy<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.320> they<00:01:58.469> destroy

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
they actually go crazy and they destroy

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.039 
they actually go crazy and they destroy
a<00:01:58.860> lot<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.340> base<00:01:59.549> so<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.600> see<00:02:00.810> right<00:02:01.020> now

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
a lot of a base so you can see right now

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.990 
a lot of a base so you can see right now
my<00:02:01.200> Valkyries<00:02:01.829> are<00:02:02.009> actually<00:02:02.340> doing<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.759> lot<00:02:02.969> of

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
my Valkyries are actually doing a lot of

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.370 
my Valkyries are actually doing a lot of
work<00:02:03.360> they're<00:02:03.570> just<00:02:03.780> spinning<00:02:04.140> their<00:02:04.290> way

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
work they're just spinning their way

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.740 
work they're just spinning their way
through<00:02:04.560> their<00:02:04.680> base<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.250> even<00:02:05.880> at<00:02:06.119> level<00:02:06.479> one

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
through their base and even at level one

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.109 
through their base and even at level one
they<00:02:06.960> are<00:02:06.990> doing<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.560> lot<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.829> damage<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.610> know

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
they are doing a lot of damage I know

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.449 
they are doing a lot of damage I know
they<00:02:09.539> just<00:02:09.569> got<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.959> boost<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.619> like<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.220> last

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
they just got a boost in like the last

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.460 
they just got a boost in like the last
maybe<00:02:12.060> two<00:02:12.300> updates<00:02:12.480> ago<00:02:12.810> or<00:02:12.989> maybe<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.260> most

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
maybe two updates ago or maybe the most

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.320 
maybe two updates ago or maybe the most
recent<00:02:13.800> update<00:02:14.070> where<00:02:14.220> they<00:02:14.340> boost<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.180> like

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
recent update where they boost it like

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.210 
recent update where they boost it like
their<00:02:15.540> damage<00:02:15.960> or<00:02:16.140> their<00:02:16.260> health<00:02:16.440> by<00:02:16.650> like<00:02:16.800> 20%

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
their damage or their health by like 20%

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.550 
their damage or their health by like 20%
so<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.910> guess<00:02:18.630> when<00:02:18.810> you're<00:02:18.900> attacking<00:02:19.350> at<00:02:19.410> this

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
so I guess when you're attacking at this

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.170 
so I guess when you're attacking at this
Town<00:02:19.830> Hall<00:02:20.070> level<00:02:20.280> they're<00:02:20.580> actually<00:02:21.000> pretty

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
Town Hall level they're actually pretty

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.050 
Town Hall level they're actually pretty
good<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:22.410> might<00:02:23.100> have<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.460> try<00:02:23.610> them<00:02:23.790> out<00:02:23.880> on<00:02:23.910> my

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
good I might have to try them out on my

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.120 
good I might have to try them out on my
Champions<00:02:24.630> League<00:02:24.780> account<00:02:25.080> but<00:02:25.380> we'll<00:02:25.800> have

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
Champions League account but we'll have

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.350 
Champions League account but we'll have
to<00:02:26.190> see<00:02:26.490> what<00:02:26.580> happens<00:02:26.880> with<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.030> because

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
to see what happens with that because

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.330 
to see what happens with that because
I'm<00:02:27.450> not<00:02:27.480> sure<00:02:27.630> if<00:02:27.840> they're<00:02:27.960> that<00:02:28.140> good<00:02:28.410> but

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
I'm not sure if they're that good but

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.380 
I'm not sure if they're that good but
that'll<00:02:29.520> pretty<00:02:29.640> much<00:02:29.730> do<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.000> for<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.240> raid

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
that'll pretty much do it for this raid

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.340 
that'll pretty much do it for this raid
we<00:02:30.510> actually<00:02:30.810> took<00:02:30.960> care<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.110> all<00:02:31.230> the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
we actually took care of all the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.050 
we actually took care of all the
defenses<00:02:31.740> most<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.130> my<00:02:32.220> Valkyries<00:02:32.640> are<00:02:32.820> still

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
defenses most of my Valkyries are still

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.480 
defenses most of my Valkyries are still
alive<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.360> still<00:02:33.720> have<00:02:33.840> my<00:02:33.960> healer<00:02:34.320> so<00:02:34.920> not<00:02:35.220> too

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
alive I still have my healer so not too

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.670 
alive I still have my healer so not too
bad<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:36.210> I<00:02:36.510> might<00:02:36.720> have<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.930> go<00:02:37.050> ahead<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.440> try

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
bad and I might have to go ahead and try

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.860 
bad and I might have to go ahead and try
it<00:02:37.740> again<00:02:37.860> on<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.220> next<00:02:38.370> raid<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:39.540> total<00:02:39.690> we

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
it again on the next raid so in total we

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.840 
it again on the next raid so in total we
got<00:02:40.020> twenty<00:02:40.410> eight<00:02:40.530> trophies<00:02:40.740> not<00:02:41.280> too<00:02:41.460> bad<00:02:41.640> at

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
got twenty eight trophies not too bad at

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.790 
got twenty eight trophies not too bad at
all<00:02:41.880> we<00:02:42.330> still<00:02:42.570> really<00:02:43.320> not<00:02:43.440> too<00:02:43.620> many

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
all we still really not too many

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.110 
all we still really not too many
resources<00:02:44.130> but<00:02:44.490> again<00:02:44.700> that's<00:02:44.820> not<00:02:44.940> what

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
resources but again that's not what

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.580 
resources but again that's not what
we're<00:02:45.240> shooting<00:02:45.390> for<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:45.870> let's<00:02:46.050> go<00:02:46.170> ahead<00:02:46.290> and

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
we're shooting for so let's go ahead and

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.260 
we're shooting for so let's go ahead and
go<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:47.040> next<00:02:47.250> raid<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:47.760> see<00:02:47.940> if<00:02:48.030> we<00:02:48.120> can

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
go to the next raid and see if we can

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.540 
go to the next raid and see if we can
have<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.540> same<00:02:48.690> success<00:02:49.220> all<00:02:50.220> right<00:02:50.340> four

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
have the same success all right four

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.680 
have the same success all right four
raid<00:02:50.670> number<00:02:50.880> two<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.209> looks<00:02:51.360> like<00:02:51.510> we're

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
raid number two it looks like we're

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.780 
raid number two it looks like we're
attacking<00:02:52.020> Bryce<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.220> first<00:02:53.490> thing<00:02:53.700> I

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
attacking Bryce and the first thing I

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.880 
attacking Bryce and the first thing I
noticed<00:02:54.120> about<00:02:54.209> this<00:02:54.420> base<00:02:54.630> was<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.680> air

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
noticed about this base was that the air

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.410 
noticed about this base was that the air
defense<00:02:56.190> on<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.430> top<00:02:56.640> left<00:02:56.910> was<00:02:57.150> under

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
defense on the top left was under

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.420 
defense on the top left was under
construction<00:02:58.020> so<00:02:58.590> really<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:58.980> only<00:02:59.130> thing<00:02:59.340> I

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
construction so really the only thing I

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.550 
construction so really the only thing I
have<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.700> focus<00:02:59.880> on<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.930> air<00:03:01.110> defense<00:03:01.410> on

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
have to focus on is the air defense on

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.960 
have to focus on is the air defense on
the<00:03:01.620> bottom<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.220> air<00:03:02.370> defense<00:03:02.640> on<00:03:02.820> the

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
the bottom and the air defense on the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.000 
the bottom and the air defense on the
top<00:03:03.209> right<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.690> seeing<00:03:04.530> as<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.709> one<00:03:04.860> on<00:03:04.890> the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
top right and seeing as the one on the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.320 
top right and seeing as the one on the
bottom<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.459> higher<00:03:05.640> level<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.150> it's<00:03:06.270> a

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
bottom is a higher level and it's a

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.610 
bottom is a higher level and it's a
little<00:03:06.540> bit<00:03:06.630> harder<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:06.900> get<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.140> let's<00:03:07.500> go

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
little bit harder to get to let's go

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.230 
little bit harder to get to let's go
ahead<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:07.890> zap<00:03:08.040> but<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.340> one<00:03:08.520> and<00:03:08.760> now<00:03:09.180> we

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
ahead and zap but that one and now we

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.880 
ahead and zap but that one and now we
really<00:03:09.660> only<00:03:09.810> have<00:03:09.990> to<00:03:10.080> focus<00:03:10.260> on<00:03:10.530> this<00:03:10.709> one

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
really only have to focus on this one

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.460 
really only have to focus on this one
and<00:03:11.100> I<00:03:11.190> can<00:03:11.220> drop<00:03:11.459> my<00:03:11.520> healer<00:03:12.000> after<00:03:12.410> so<00:03:13.410> you

episode<00:04:17.910> I<00:04:17.940> do<00:04:18.150> want<00:04:18.450> to<00:04:18.510> upgrade<00:04:18.690> him<00:04:19.049> to

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
episode I do want to upgrade him to

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.960 
episode I do want to upgrade him to
level<00:04:19.290> 5<00:04:19.560> so<00:04:19.919> I<00:04:19.950> can<00:04:20.040> get<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.400> iron<00:04:20.580> fist

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
level 5 so I can get the iron fist

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.060 
level 5 so I can get the iron fist
because<00:04:21.599> really<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.320> iron<00:04:22.530> fist<00:04:22.770> is<00:04:22.890> so

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
because really the iron fist is so

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.680 
because really the iron fist is so
overpowered<00:04:23.610> whenever<00:04:23.910> you<00:04:24.060> use<00:04:24.300> that<00:04:24.450> it

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
overpowered whenever you use that it

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.280 
overpowered whenever you use that it
just<00:04:24.870> does<00:04:25.020> so<00:04:25.289> much<00:04:25.410> damage

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
just does so much damage

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.570 
just does so much damage
so<00:04:26.410> yeah<00:04:26.710> I<00:04:26.770> think<00:04:26.890> I<00:04:27.010> really<00:04:27.250> need<00:04:27.370> to<00:04:27.430> focus
