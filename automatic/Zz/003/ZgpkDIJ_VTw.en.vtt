00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:04.790
Welcome. In this video we show you
as we decorated a cake

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.309
with ribbon insertion tools.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.379
We use baking paper for
create a form that will help us

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:20.379
execution of the decoration.

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:27.509
Once you have found the measure, let's
fold to three times the baking paper.

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.850

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.040
The first, the second

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.940
and a third time.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.560
Now with this scissor

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.800
let's cut the baking paper,
the desired height,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.630
giving the slight curvature

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:04.420
to our cut.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.250
In this way

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.780
we will have a mask that will help us

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.570
execution

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.880
decoration. Using this special tool

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.160
we going to engrave the sugar paste
still fresh.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:28.160

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.370
At the end we can take off the baking paper

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.360
and we go to

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.300
realize decoration.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.380
First of all, we do a test to see

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.700
the right size of the ribbon.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.570
When we found the right size, let's cut to size

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.570
other pieces of tape using
the first as a reference.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.690
So let's put the tape

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.699
with the insertion tool and helping
with his left hand. You see, with the index finger

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:20.699
go to facilitate the insertion of the ribbon.

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:32.209
As you can see we have not covered the
cake board to be able to work without

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.100
worry can ruin

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.100
sugar paste.

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:50.359
After preparing bows.

00:02:53.589 --> 00:03:00.589
We create the first reference

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.749
and we measure all others by

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:15.049
first

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:22.049
so they have identical bows.

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.789
Now we brush with edible glue

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:44.529
and let's apply a strip of sugar paste

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:45.419

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:51.459
to cover the cake board.

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.399
With the smoother we smooth sugar paste to remove any

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:58.769
track juncture.

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:05.769
Eliminate sugar paste in
excess

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:09.209
and arrange the ribbon for

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:16.209
cover every juncture sign.

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:27.279
To secure use of edible glue.

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:31.849
We use the non-toxic glue sticks

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.460
to glue tape on the cake board

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:43.460
and we fix it with a pin.

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.969
After we placed a Roses sugar paste on

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:59.639
our cake.

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.699
And this is the final effect.

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.059

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:07.279
