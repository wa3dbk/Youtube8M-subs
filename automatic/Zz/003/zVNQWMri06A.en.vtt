00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.450
 we have tv since ifa 2014 one 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.980
 big trends this year 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.019
 also it's multi room it's the fact 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.219
 to have all his music in all 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.710
 parts of the house with a system 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.690
 hyper connected and easy to use 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.070
 ammann cardon was a late guy 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.880
 in this area that's it they are throwing 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:25.470
 their multi room and here is what 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.230
 looks like the harman multi room system 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.840
 kardon a ball 2006 you be and I 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.420
 go to the same halls up to 30 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.070
 balls you promise you see in 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.510
 his castle 32 pieces one is pile hair 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.370
 one is in town at his small models 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.530
 and then a model a little bit more expensive 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.820
 around 300 euros and a small 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.040
 little bigger with better 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.360
 sound quality we can call them two 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.239
 by two to make a real system 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.620
 stereo or and all this is driving to 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.100
 from a smartphone app or 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.079
 Tablet 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.090
 so it's spotify connect that too 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.070
 it's a big trend at the ifa de pas 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.969
 bad of systems are spotify connect that 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.879
 means what does it mean that since then 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.070
 the original spotify app you 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.399
 will be able to pilot this multi system 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.320
 room 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.909
 the other particularity is the bluetooth 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.530
 because then maybe you have 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.270
 a bluetooth system at home when 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.070
 you brought your speaker with your 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.900
 smartphone you can listen that the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.070
 music on a speaker and well ammann 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.590
 frame to the cardoons to find a system 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.850
 very ingenious to duplicate your 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.100
 source all of us who share your 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.840
 smartphone and send it on all 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.570
 speaker of the house then took 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.250
 converted from bluetooth or wifi to hd 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.540
 please and so we will be able to 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.680
 listen to all his music that we have on 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.150
 smartphone in every room 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.979
 here and we can thus pass 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.479
 select the music that we 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.829
 wish in this or that room where 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.479
 obviously send the same music 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.759
 everywhere then what is interesting 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.619
 it's at the interface 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.540
 user via a dedicated application 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.759
 of course that allows you to manage 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.500
 your own playlist of a slip of 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.729
 finger we send the piece we 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.250
 wish to listen to or wish 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.930
 include in a playlist and then we go 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.810
 power there on the left column 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.200
 gradually insert applications 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.360
 third 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.250
 you were talking about spotify maybe tomorrow 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.229
 others yes why not weaver well 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.979
 obviously 10 years is expected from elsewhere 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.689
 he will arrive soon 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.770
 then the price 199 for the title and 299 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.340
 for lens is a little bit more 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.720
 important 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.039
 what's interesting is that we 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.890
 can also transform this system into 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.660
 five points 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.250
 if you want it and for example if you 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.620
 have a blu ray player you go 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.500
 able to plug it into the system through 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.840
 to a small accessory and that allows you 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.970
 in fact to plug any amp 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.220
 to turn it into a multi system 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.740
 room also the famous multiroom which 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.570
 so far was mostly the market 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.250
 was busy by his brand very 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.900
 known and we see that today more 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.850
 in addition to other players getting into 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.300
 Here are 0 net and since the ifa we are 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.300
 find again very quickly
