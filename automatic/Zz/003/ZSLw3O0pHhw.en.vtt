00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.990
 With overhand 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.580
 Suno again 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:28.779
 There Toka underhand or let's compare the things that the nature 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:34.420
 The Sakura Ai hand always has its soul from top to bottom, so that the archery is a batter 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:35.980
 Masu enemy down his father in accordance with the approaching this is but looks horizontally if there is growth 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:41.079
 Also 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:43.150
 I think you are needed the sphere under slow go lifted this from the bottom to reverse 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.100
 That's why 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.100
 How to use the body is different 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.540
 Let's look at the difference of the change sphere on the day 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.130
 Overthrow curve 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.950
 I draw this kind of trajectory 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.600
 In the case of under throw from the bottom 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:05.100
 Turn sideways 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:10.580
 I really want the most necessary soul to come up, but this is already 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.200
 It is physically impossible, but please draw it and practice it in a dream 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.110
 In the case of shoot 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.110
 Because it is written sideways , it's easy to throw up objections 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.350
 It's a good time to just leave 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:30.619
 I use index finger or middle finger well though 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:33.440
 The shoot will rotate depending on how slightly different force is applied at the time of release . 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.920
 This kind of rotation in the case of 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.370
 Because it gives 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.260
 It is easy to throw this too 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.430
 Underslow pitchers are often considered to be vulnerable to large batter, but never 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.250
 It is not 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.890
 Please take courage 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.700
 Kun and throw it underhand throw of pitcher 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.580
 Lari butter you think you have the board closer toward their own 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.460
 It is very easy to see 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.670
 This is a general theory 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.829
 But there is a blind spot 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:06.760
 The ball flows to the batter's pocket 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:08.250
 If you go to the end, the batter will have a sense of fear to some extent and it will open 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.440
 Of batting 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.780
 The so-called hitting point comes out 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.510
 Next time the ball is opened, the outer ball will be very far next time 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:24.680
 There is such an advantage 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:28.569
 So never Throw ventured a large outside or advance the bosom is not a bearish 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.569
 I do not know the Anders way left
