ear pads are rather small

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.429

your ears but they're fairly comfortable

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:12.539 
your ears but they're fairly comfortable
so<00:01:09.850> I<00:01:09.880> think<00:01:10.539> they're<00:01:10.810> they<00:01:11.740> worked<00:01:12.009> fairly

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
so I think they're they worked fairly

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.469 
so I think they're they worked fairly
well<00:01:12.729> they<00:01:13.600> also<00:01:13.810> provide<00:01:14.289> a<00:01:15.209> fairly<00:01:16.209> good

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
well they also provide a fairly good

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.149 
well they also provide a fairly good
amount<00:01:16.569> of<00:01:16.780> isolation<00:01:17.530> so<00:01:17.770> these<00:01:17.920> headphones

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
amount of isolation so these headphones

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.789 
amount of isolation so these headphones
will<00:01:18.729> work<00:01:19.060> in<00:01:19.719> the<00:01:19.899> city<00:01:20.139> commuting<00:01:20.649> on<00:01:20.770> the

but as you can see it's fairly short in
this<00:02:06.279> dimension<00:02:06.849> here<00:02:06.880> which<00:02:07.689> means<00:02:07.959> that<00:02:08.229> you

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
this dimension here which means that you

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.139 
this dimension here which means that you

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
headphones was surprisingly good I

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.539 
headphones was surprisingly good I
really<00:02:44.760> wasn't<00:02:44.939> expecting<00:02:45.150> much<00:02:45.920> but<00:02:46.920> I

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
really wasn't expecting much but I

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.670 
really wasn't expecting much but I
thought<00:02:48.209> they<00:02:48.450> did<00:02:48.659> actually<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.200> pretty<00:02:49.439> good

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
thought they did actually a pretty good

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.559 
thought they did actually a pretty good
job<00:02:49.889> with<00:02:50.099> these<00:02:50.189> headphones<00:02:50.459> they<00:02:51.299> are

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
job with these headphones they are

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.409 
job with these headphones they are
fairly<00:02:52.169> flat<00:02:52.650> in<00:02:52.950> their<00:02:53.099> response<00:02:53.579> from<00:02:53.849> 500

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:54.419

fairly flat in their response from 500

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.800 
Hertz and below and above 500 Hertz they
they<00:02:58.439> begin<00:02:58.829> to<00:02:58.950> roll<00:02:59.189> off<00:02:59.459> fairly<00:03:00.060> at<00:03:00.750> a

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
they begin to roll off fairly at a

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.379 
they begin to roll off fairly at a
fairly<00:03:01.169> good<00:03:01.319> clip<00:03:01.560> into<00:03:02.159> the<00:03:02.189> highs<00:03:02.430> but<00:03:03.180> the

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
fairly good clip into the highs but the

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.030 
fairly good clip into the highs but the
frequency<00:03:03.900> response<00:03:04.260> curve<00:03:04.469> is<00:03:04.680> nice<00:03:04.859> and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
frequency response curve is nice and

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
frequency response curve is nice and
smooth<00:03:05.419> and<00:03:06.590> what<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.620> heard<00:03:08.099> was<00:03:08.489> a<00:03:08.730> fairly

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
smooth and what I heard was a fairly

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.539 
smooth and what I heard was a fairly
warm<00:03:09.540> sounding<00:03:10.109> headphone<00:03:10.819> with<00:03:11.819> a<00:03:12.180> laid<00:03:13.139> back

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
warm sounding headphone with a laid back

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.170 
warm sounding headphone with a laid back
upper<00:03:14.549> mids<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:15.060> treble<00:03:16.459> but<00:03:17.459> fairly<00:03:17.819> well

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
upper mids and treble but fairly well

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.009 
upper mids and treble but fairly well
behaved<00:03:18.659> I<00:03:19.620> call<00:03:20.579> a<00:03:20.609> coherent<00:03:21.329> sounding<00:03:21.810> I

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
behaved I call a coherent sounding I

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.920 
behaved I call a coherent sounding I
think<00:03:22.549> they<00:03:23.549> did<00:03:23.819> a<00:03:23.849> fairly<00:03:24.239> good<00:03:24.510> job<00:03:24.540> of

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
think they did a fairly good job of

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.379 
think they did a fairly good job of
imaging<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.769> fairly<00:03:26.280> good<00:03:26.400> job<00:03:26.430> in<00:03:26.819> dynamics

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
imaging and fairly good job in dynamics

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:28.849 
imaging and fairly good job in dynamics
and<00:03:27.540> those<00:03:27.659> are<00:03:27.780> kind<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:27.959> hard<00:03:28.169> to<00:03:28.229> do<00:03:28.530> unless

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
and those are kind of hard to do unless

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.699 
and those are kind of hard to do unless
you<00:03:29.159> get<00:03:29.579> things<00:03:29.819> fairly<00:03:30.239> coherent<00:03:30.659> and<00:03:30.959> they

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
you get things fairly coherent and they

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.490 
you get things fairly coherent and they
did<00:03:31.949> an<00:03:32.069> acceptable<00:03:32.579> job<00:03:32.819> there<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:36.500> elevated

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
did an acceptable job there the elevated

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.250 
did an acceptable job there the elevated
low<00:03:38.400> frequencies<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.359> wouldn't<00:03:39.900> call<00:03:40.079> it<00:03:40.109> a

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
low frequencies I wouldn't call it a

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.199 
low frequencies I wouldn't call it a

from 500 Hertz and below but it is that

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.210 
from 500 Hertz and below but it is that
that<00:03:45.509> region<00:03:45.959> is<00:03:46.319> quite<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.560> bit<00:03:46.709> stronger<00:03:47.009> than

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
that region is quite a bit stronger than

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.710 
that region is quite a bit stronger than

the upper mids and the trebles and

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.710 
the upper mids and the trebles and
sometimes<00:03:51.720> got<00:03:52.349> a<00:03:53.209> little<00:03:54.209> congested

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
sometimes got a little congested

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.520 
sometimes got a little congested
sounding<00:03:55.409> in<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.680> in<00:03:55.919> the<00:03:56.040> lower<00:03:56.280> mids<00:03:57.530> the

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
sounding in the in the lower mids the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.170 
sounding in the in the lower mids the
lower<00:03:58.739> mids<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.340> bass<00:03:59.549> but<00:03:59.819> I<00:03:59.879> wouldn't

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
lower mids and the bass but I wouldn't

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.179 
lower mids and the bass but I wouldn't
say<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.930> was<00:04:01.340> bloated<00:04:02.340> or<00:04:03.000> murky<00:04:03.870> or<00:04:03.900> muddy<00:04:04.620> or

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:05.189 
say it was bloated or murky or muddy or

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:06.770 
say it was bloated or murky or muddy or
anything<00:04:05.459> like<00:04:05.669> that<00:04:05.729> the<00:04:06.090> bass<00:04:06.239> was<00:04:06.419> fairly

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
anything like that the bass was fairly

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.099 
anything like that the bass was fairly
tight<00:04:07.199> and<00:04:07.500> clear

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
tight and clear

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.710 
tight and clear
I<00:04:10.340> think<00:04:11.340> they<00:04:11.489> sounded<00:04:11.939> substantially

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
I think they sounded substantially

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.339 
I think they sounded substantially
better<00:04:12.870> than<00:04:13.079> the<00:04:13.739> SL<00:04:14.310> 300<00:04:14.909> or<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.299> SL<00:04:15.659> 100<00:04:16.229> in

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
better than the SL 300 or the SL 100 in

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.199 
better than the SL 300 or the SL 100 in
this<00:04:16.500> line<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.400> substantially<00:04:18.060> better

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
this line and and substantially better

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.539 
this line and and substantially better
than<00:04:18.409> virtually<00:04:19.409> all<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.739> monster<00:04:20.130> products

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
than virtually all the monster products

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.640 
than virtually all the monster products
certainly<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.690> product<00:04:22.139> that<00:04:22.289> competes

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
certainly the the product that competes

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.800 
certainly the the product that competes
with<00:04:22.770> this<00:04:23.099> is<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.930> beats<00:04:24.930> by<00:04:25.050> dre<00:04:26.150> solo<00:04:27.150> HD

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
with this is the beats by dre solo HD

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.390 
with this is the beats by dre solo HD
and<00:04:28.200> these<00:04:28.469> sounded

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
and these sounded

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.800 
and these sounded
a<00:04:29.430> better<00:04:29.820> than<00:04:30.330> those<00:04:30.570> two<00:04:31.320> my<00:04:31.440> ears<00:04:32.780> so<00:04:33.780> I

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
a better than those two my ears so I

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.749 
a better than those two my ears so I
thought<00:04:34.290> all<00:04:34.500> in<00:04:34.680> all<00:04:34.830> they<00:04:35.190> were<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.340> pretty

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
thought all in all they were a pretty

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.689 
thought all in all they were a pretty
good<00:04:36.030> headphone<00:04:36.720> and<00:04:36.900> a<00:04:36.990> pretty<00:04:37.169> good<00:04:37.380> showing

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
good headphone and a pretty good showing

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.890 
good headphone and a pretty good showing
by<00:04:39.320> Ludacris<00:04:40.320> so<00:04:40.759> I'll<00:04:41.759> happily<00:04:42.240> give<00:04:42.660> them<00:04:42.870> a

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900
