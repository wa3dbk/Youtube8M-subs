and my hope is my work right now is
focused<00:00:16.109> on<00:00:16.320> developing<00:00:16.680> my<00:00:17.100> research<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.940> go

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
focused on developing my research to go

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.590 
focused on developing my research to go
back<00:00:18.420> into<00:00:20.000> technological<00:00:21.000> realms<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.359> are

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
back into technological realms that are

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.359 
back into technological realms that are
specifically<00:00:22.529> working<00:00:22.859> with<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
specifically working with the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.040 
specifically working with the
development<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.910> virtual<00:00:24.330> worlds<00:00:24.810> because

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
development of virtual worlds because

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.950 
development of virtual worlds because
virtual<00:00:25.590> worlds<00:00:26.070> are<00:00:26.330> really<00:00:27.330> these

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
virtual worlds are really these

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.279 
virtual worlds are really these
incredible<00:00:28.890> I'll<00:00:29.189> chemical<00:00:30.060> containers<00:00:30.570> for

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
incredible I'll chemical containers for

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.709 
incredible I'll chemical containers for
psyche<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:32.009> reside<00:00:32.369> in<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.910> they<00:00:33.450> are<00:00:33.600> truly<00:00:34.230> a

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
psyche to reside in and they are truly a

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.030 
psyche to reside in and they are truly a
different<00:00:36.719> experience<00:00:37.140> where<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.800> people

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
different experience where the people

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.869 
different experience where the people
are<00:00:38.370> shifting<00:00:39.270> their<00:00:39.300> gaze<00:00:40.160> into<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.550> digital

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
are shifting their gaze into a digital

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.840 
are shifting their gaze into a digital
realm<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.050> there's<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.920> transition

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
realm and so there's this transition

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.240 
realm and so there's this transition
where<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.239> are<00:00:45.390> becoming<00:00:45.719> embodied<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.739> those

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
where we are becoming embodied in those

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.080 
where we are becoming embodied in those
virtual<00:00:47.789> states<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.660> being<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.730> so<00:00:50.730> my<00:00:50.850> hope

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
virtual states of being and so my hope

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.600 
virtual states of being and so my hope
is<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.539> work<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.559> developers<00:00:53.309> and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
is to work with the developers and

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.610 
is to work with the developers and
designers<00:00:53.690> who<00:00:54.690> are<00:00:54.840> designing<00:00:55.289> those

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
designers who are designing those

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.279 
designers who are designing those
virtual<00:00:56.039> worlds<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.969> we<00:00:57.570> might<00:00:57.780> invite

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
virtual worlds so that we might invite

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.700 
virtual worlds so that we might invite
soul<00:00:58.710> in<00:01:00.109> unconsciously<00:01:01.109> into<00:01:01.530> that

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
soul in unconsciously into that

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.990 
soul in unconsciously into that
development<00:01:02.280> process<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.390> as<00:01:04.260> we<00:01:04.820> alter<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:05.970> a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
development process and as we alter as a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.670 
development process and as we alter as a
humanity<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.979> are<00:01:08.189> aware<00:01:08.880> and

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
humanity that we are aware and

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.469 
humanity that we are aware and
participating<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.920> inviting<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.820> soul<00:01:12.450> of

the world to move with us depth
psychology<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:16.380> technology<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.100> think<00:01:17.159> is

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
psychology in technology I think is

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.390 
psychology in technology I think is
essential<00:01:18.150> I'm<00:01:18.710> when<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.740> go<00:01:20.009> out<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
essential I'm when I go out to the

and developers and key people that are

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.440 
and developers and key people that are
creating<00:01:25.320> massive<00:01:26.280> games<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.180> have

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
creating massive games that have

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.359 
creating massive games that have
millions<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:28.140> players<00:01:28.320> they<00:01:28.829> are<00:01:28.890> really

participate with that myth by hearing

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.609 
participate with that myth by hearing
the<00:01:56.460> story<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.210> actually<00:01:57.570> going<00:01:57.750> into<00:01:58.229> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
game and into Anna bodies state so we're

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.569 
game and into Anna bodies state so we're
now<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.899> in<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:04.259> different<00:02:04.680> dynamic<00:02:04.920> with

bella person I'm here talking to are

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.110 
bella person I'm here talking to are
very<00:02:16.110> very<00:02:16.380> excited<00:02:17.040> about<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.489> I've<00:02:17.880> been

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
very very excited about it I've been

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.910 
very very excited about it I've been
surprised<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.810> how<00:02:19.290> many<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.709> them<00:02:19.830> are

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
surprised that how many of them are

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.800 
surprised that how many of them are
really<00:02:20.130> familiar<00:02:20.370> with<00:02:20.730> Joseph<00:02:21.180> Campbell<00:02:21.660> and

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
really familiar with Joseph Campbell and

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.199 
really familiar with Joseph Campbell and
since<00:02:22.380> Joseph<00:02:22.860> Campbell<00:02:23.310> was<00:02:23.459> one<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.910> key

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
since Joseph Campbell was one of the key

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.380 
since Joseph Campbell was one of the key
instruments<00:02:25.020> in<00:02:25.140> putting<00:02:25.620> forward<00:02:26.390> pacifica

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
instruments in putting forward pacifica

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.550 
instruments in putting forward pacifica
i<00:02:28.230> am<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.640> whole<00:02:30.000> concept<00:02:30.690> of<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.110> hero's

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
i am the whole concept of the hero's

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.979 
i am the whole concept of the hero's
journey<00:02:31.819> because<00:02:32.819> many<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.180> these<00:02:33.330> games<00:02:33.690> are

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
journey because many of these games are

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.470 
journey because many of these games are
looking<00:02:34.440> at<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.800> hero's<00:02:35.250> journey<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:36.239> that's

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
looking at that hero's journey so that's

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.780 
looking at that hero's journey so that's
one<00:02:36.750> way<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:36.989> ground<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.620> work<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.400> them<00:02:38.550> on

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
one way I ground the work to them on

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.580 
one way I ground the work to them on
talking<00:02:39.269> about<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.690> myth-making<00:02:39.959> the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
talking about the myth-making the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.620 
talking about the myth-making the
meaning<00:02:40.950> making<00:02:41.190> through<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:42.269> myth<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.599> the

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
meaning making through the myth of the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.990 
meaning making through the myth of the
hero's<00:02:42.989> journey<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:43.709> if<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.459> look<00:02:44.610> at<00:02:44.760> every

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
hero's journey and if you look at every

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.820 
hero's journey and if you look at every
game<00:02:45.239> they're<00:02:45.930> all<00:02:46.110> going<00:02:46.440> through<00:02:46.709> that

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
game they're all going through that

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.220 
game they're all going through that
Harold's<00:02:47.190> journey<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:48.360> other<00:02:48.569> thing<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.049> I

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
Harold's journey the other thing that I

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.890 
Harold's journey the other thing that I
also<00:02:49.440> ground<00:02:49.830> them<00:02:49.980> in<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.790> mention<00:02:51.180> which<00:02:51.690> I

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
also ground them in and mention which I

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.270 
also ground them in and mention which I
don't<00:02:52.049> think<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.290> lot<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.500> people<00:02:52.620> are<00:02:52.950> aware<00:02:53.220> of

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
don't think a lot of people are aware of

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.680 
don't think a lot of people are aware of
is<00:02:53.700> how<00:02:54.660> Carl<00:02:55.019> Jung<00:02:55.459> worked<00:02:56.459> with<00:02:56.819> some<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:57.480> our

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
is how Carl Jung worked with some of our

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.729 
is how Carl Jung worked with some of our
most<00:02:57.900> brilliant<00:02:58.250> scientist<00:02:59.250> very<00:03:00.090> intimately

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
most brilliant scientist very intimately

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.430 
most brilliant scientist very intimately
particularly<00:03:02.060> Wolfgang<00:03:03.060> Pauli<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.810> most

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
particularly Wolfgang Pauli and most

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.729 
particularly Wolfgang Pauli and most
people<00:03:04.769> don't<00:03:04.920> realize<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:07.290> out<00:03:07.560> of

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
people don't realize that that out of

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.770 
people don't realize that that out of
size<00:03:07.980> because<00:03:08.489> a<00:03:08.700> lot<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.299> gamers<00:03:09.630> are

okay<00:03:10.170> give<00:03:10.349> me<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.530> science<00:03:10.920> let's<00:03:11.130> be<00:03:11.310> very

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
okay give me the science let's be very

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.229 
okay give me the science let's be very
factual<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.330> when<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.540> talk<00:03:12.840> about<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:14.760> work<00:03:14.970> of

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
factual so when I talk about the work of

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.970 
factual so when I talk about the work of
Niels<00:03:15.510> Bohr<00:03:15.840> or<00:03:16.140> Wolfgang<00:03:16.739> Pauli

Niels Bohr or Wolfgang Pauli

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.949 
Niels Bohr or Wolfgang Pauli
particularly<00:03:17.640> Wolfgang<00:03:17.970> Pauli<00:03:18.180> because<00:03:18.630> he

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
particularly Wolfgang Pauli because he

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.890 
particularly Wolfgang Pauli because he
worked<00:03:19.620> with<00:03:19.829> Carl<00:03:20.160> Jung<00:03:20.489> for<00:03:20.910> decades<00:03:21.690> and

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
worked with Carl Jung for decades and

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.620 
worked with Carl Jung for decades and
decades<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.739> many<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.519> his<00:03:23.760> dreams<00:03:24.299> were

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
decades and many of his dreams were

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.199 
decades and many of his dreams were
instrumental<00:03:25.440> in<00:03:25.650> Carl<00:03:26.100> Jung's<00:03:26.459> development

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
instrumental in Carl Jung's development

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.780 
instrumental in Carl Jung's development
of<00:03:27.450> his<00:03:27.720> warp<00:03:28.109> theories<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:29.160> many<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.519> Carl

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
of his warp theories and many of Carl

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.870 
of his warp theories and many of Carl
Jung's<00:03:30.090> work<00:03:30.540> allowed<00:03:31.109> Wolfgang<00:03:31.650> Pauli<00:03:32.010> to

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
Jung's work allowed Wolfgang Pauli to

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.150 
Jung's work allowed Wolfgang Pauli to
find<00:03:33.180> some<00:03:33.569> of<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.720> key<00:03:33.989> concepts<00:03:34.799> that<00:03:35.100> are

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
find some of the key concepts that are

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.210 
find some of the key concepts that are
in<00:03:35.780> quantum<00:03:36.780> physics<00:03:36.989> that<00:03:37.350> he<00:03:37.530> passed<00:03:37.769> on<00:03:37.980> to

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
in quantum physics that he passed on to

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.309 
in quantum physics that he passed on to
Eisenberg<00:03:38.819> and<00:03:39.120> he<00:03:39.329> passed<00:03:39.540> on<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.750> Einstein

Eisenberg and he passed on to Einstein

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.830 
Eisenberg and he passed on to Einstein
most<00:03:40.980> people<00:03:41.370> don't<00:03:41.549> realize<00:03:41.640> that<00:03:41.970> Einstein

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
most people don't realize that Einstein

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.699 
most people don't realize that Einstein
had<00:03:43.079> actually<00:03:43.670> asked<00:03:44.780> Wolfgang<00:03:45.780> Pauli<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.560> be

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
had actually asked Wolfgang Pauli to be

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.960 
had actually asked Wolfgang Pauli to be
his<00:03:46.950> successor<00:03:47.370> at<00:03:47.760> Princeton<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:48.810> he

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
his successor at Princeton and he

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.729 
his successor at Princeton and he
because<00:03:50.970> they<00:03:51.120> he<00:03:51.780> admired<00:03:52.200> what<00:03:52.530> game

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
because they he admired what game

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.270 
because they he admired what game
Polly's<00:03:53.130> work<00:03:53.400> so<00:03:53.700> much<00:03:53.940> and<00:03:54.900> he<00:03:55.620> returned<00:03:56.069> to

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
Polly's work so much and he returned to

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.400 
Polly's work so much and he returned to
Europe<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:56.549> gather<00:03:56.880> his<00:03:57.180> things<00:03:57.569> and<00:03:57.870> decided

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
Europe to gather his things and decided

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.050 
Europe to gather his things and decided
to<00:03:58.560> stay<00:03:58.889> in<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.280> war-torn<00:03:59.459> Europe<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:01.040> help

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
to stay in the war-torn Europe to help

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.729 
to stay in the war-torn Europe to help
revitalize<00:04:03.060> Europe<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:03.870> as<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.530> result

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
revitalize Europe and as a result

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.520 
revitalize Europe and as a result
Oppenheimer<00:04:05.579> took<00:04:06.090> his<00:04:06.269> place<00:04:06.480> but<00:04:06.840> Einstein

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
Oppenheimer took his place but Einstein

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.120 
Oppenheimer took his place but Einstein
had<00:04:08.069> preferred<00:04:09.350> Wolfgang<00:04:10.350> Pauli<00:04:10.650> and

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
had preferred Wolfgang Pauli and

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.729 
had preferred Wolfgang Pauli and
Wolfgang<00:04:11.579> Pauli<00:04:11.880> had<00:04:12.209> this<00:04:12.329> very<00:04:12.630> close<00:04:13.170> three

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
Wolfgang Pauli had this very close three

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.310 
Wolfgang Pauli had this very close three
decade<00:04:14.340> intimate<00:04:15.030> relationship<00:04:15.690> with<00:04:15.900> Carl

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
decade intimate relationship with Carl

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.170 
decade intimate relationship with Carl
Jung<00:04:16.680> so<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:17.519> don't<00:04:17.760> think<00:04:17.940> most<00:04:18.090> people

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
Jung so I don't think most people

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.870 
Jung so I don't think most people
recognize<00:04:18.780> that<00:04:19.530> how<00:04:20.039> our<00:04:20.220> work<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.639> actually

notions when I initially came into the

notions when I initially came into the
program<00:04:35.430> I<00:04:35.870> looked<00:04:36.870> at<00:04:37.020> virtual<00:04:37.320> worlds<00:04:37.740> and

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
program I looked at virtual worlds and

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
started to delve more into the concepts

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.530 
started to delve more into the concepts
of<00:04:48.390> young<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.370> Joseph<00:04:50.370> Campbell<00:04:50.970> and

of young and Joseph Campbell and
Heidegger<00:04:52.260> I<00:04:52.470> started<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.160> realize<00:04:53.490> that

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
Heidegger I started to realize that

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.510 
Heidegger I started to realize that
there's<00:04:54.150> far<00:04:54.570> more<00:04:54.710> happening<00:04:55.710> within<00:04:56.280> those

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
there's far more happening within those

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.410 
there's far more happening within those
virtual<00:04:57.000> realms<00:04:57.420> than<00:04:57.690> I<00:04:57.720> initially<00:04:58.400> had

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
virtual realms than I initially had

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.660 
virtual realms than I initially had
anticipated<00:05:00.420> so<00:05:01.350> it's<00:05:01.560> broadening<00:05:02.130> me<00:05:02.370> to

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
anticipated so it's broadening me to

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.700 
anticipated so it's broadening me to
look<00:05:03.450> more<00:05:03.660> critically<00:05:04.470> about<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:06.710> the

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
look more critically about the the

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.100 
look more critically about the the
traditional<00:05:08.640> negatives<00:05:09.150> that<00:05:09.270> may<00:05:10.050> be

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
traditional negatives that may be

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.500 
traditional negatives that may be
perceived<00:05:10.680> by<00:05:10.800> people<00:05:11.240> spending<00:05:12.240> so<00:05:12.390> much

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
perceived by people spending so much

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.380 
perceived by people spending so much
time<00:05:12.570> there<00:05:13.080> but<00:05:13.230> also<00:05:13.710> to<00:05:14.010> look<00:05:14.460> at<00:05:14.820> where

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
time there but also to look at where

there's hope and where there are lives

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.460 
there's hope and where there are lives
tremendous<00:05:18.090> potential<00:05:18.780> for<00:05:18.810> us<00:05:19.050> to<00:05:19.170> advance

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
tremendous potential for us to advance

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.980 
tremendous potential for us to advance

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.710 
as a culture and as a society and as a
humanity<00:05:22.740> so<00:05:23.190> what<00:05:23.400> I<00:05:23.430> see<00:05:23.760> is<00:05:23.910> is<00:05:24.150> a<00:05:24.210> lot<00:05:24.570> of

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
humanity so what I see is is a lot of

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.470 
humanity so what I see is is a lot of
compassion<00:05:25.230> from<00:05:26.190> the<00:05:26.520> students<00:05:26.970> that<00:05:27.030> are

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
compassion from the students that are

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.930 
compassion from the students that are
who've<00:05:28.290> gone<00:05:28.500> through<00:05:28.560> the<00:05:28.950> program<00:05:29.220> towards

who've gone through the program towards

their work towards really doing

something of significance by listening
