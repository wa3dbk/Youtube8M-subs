 hello how about friends someone talks to 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.930
 of the panama channel system edition and in 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.210
 this time I will present you as 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.200
 optimize and clean what is your 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.730
 computer 100% with three programs 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.330
 the truth for my opinion are the 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.090
 better and they will accelerate to use 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.460
 clean the computer so that 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.590
 work at 100% ok 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.769
 good this time let's start 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.280
 with what is the antivirus we are going to 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.610
 enjoy it 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.800
 and then we go 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.430
 to examine the equipment a scan 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.590
 intelligent to the computer to examine 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.260
 that there is not a spyware virus that is 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.050
 affecting the performance of what is your 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.380
 computer ok let's explore the 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.380
 team 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.210
 in my case, how to see the activation 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.180
 what it is 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.360
 the compiler takes too long what is 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:18.790
 the approval if I'm going to cancel it 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.790
 by not to lengthen the video ok 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.880
 good ok let's continue with the other program 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.280
 this is a cleaner called city 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.850
 Kleenex 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.049
 this program will clean your computer 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.590
 completely what cookies are 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.729
 data from the junk file navigation 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.250
 to fix problems errors too 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.700
 the alarms can also be presented 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.580
 ok well I'm going to execute it 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.250
 Program 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.500
 and in this part the cleaner we are going to 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.860
 analyze electrical let's analyze the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.860
 team 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.729
 once ready we will execute the 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.729
 cleaner and we will accept 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.140
 ok run the cleaner again 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.730
 and as you can see, what I know came out 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.489
 all the files were deleted and now 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.830
 was the cleanup was completed as 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.959
 are watching in this part now we're going 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.980
 to the registry here we are going to search 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.060
 problems 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.060
 let's wait a moment 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:48.600
 and in my case there was no problem 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.970
 because I analyzed this recently 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.100
 so for now there are no problems but 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.350
 in your case yes of salts problems in the 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.190
 record for nothing where it says repair 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.490
 selected and then they put I do not know if 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.140
 they want to create a copy of the system 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.490
 you say no and after that they 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.960
 a telemann window will come out 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:12.710

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.740
 tools 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.500
 this part will come out of what are the 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.980
 programs you are going to install the 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.750
 programs that do not use 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.170
 only in order those who have new 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.170
