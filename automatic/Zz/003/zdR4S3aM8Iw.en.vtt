dude and today we're going to discuss
something<00:00:04.589> a<00:00:04.740> little<00:00:04.950> bit<00:00:05.040> more

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.080 
something a little bit more

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.350 
something a little bit more
controversial<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.410> little<00:00:07.859> bit<00:00:07.950> different<00:00:08.370> and

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
controversial a little bit different and

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.580 
controversial a little bit different and
that<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.820> act<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:12.210> spying<00:00:12.780> on<00:00:13.200> someone

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
that is the act of spying on someone

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.349 
that is the act of spying on someone
with<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:13.980> drone<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.509> what<00:00:15.690> I've<00:00:15.780> done<00:00:15.960> is

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
with a drone and so what I've done is

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.800 
with a drone and so what I've done is
create<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.630> series<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.619> clips<00:00:20.180> put<00:00:21.180> together<00:00:21.300> to

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
create a series of clips put together to

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.340 
create a series of clips put together to
try<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.590> determine<00:00:22.949> if<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.900> technology<00:00:24.900> is

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
try to determine if this technology is

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.679 
try to determine if this technology is
actually<00:00:25.710> feasible<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.550> spying<00:00:26.970> on<00:00:27.240> somebody

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
actually feasible for spying on somebody

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.740 
actually feasible for spying on somebody
so<00:00:28.650> let's<00:00:28.859> begin<00:00:29.240> so<00:00:30.240> let's<00:00:30.390> go<00:00:30.510> ahead<00:00:30.570> and

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
so let's begin so let's go ahead and

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.030 
so let's begin so let's go ahead and
discuss<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.199> kind<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.380> equipment<00:00:31.650> I'll<00:00:31.949> be

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
discuss the kind of equipment I'll be

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.340 
discuss the kind of equipment I'll be
using<00:00:32.189> today<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.969> will<00:00:33.180> use<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.719> four<00:00:34.230> hundred

market today for cinematography and
spying<00:00:59.730> I<00:01:00.090> guess<00:01:00.510> will<00:01:00.690> test<00:01:00.899> out<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.440> just<00:01:02.010> a

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
spying I guess will test out in just a

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.009 
spying I guess will test out in just a
couple<00:01:02.219> minutes<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:02.850> let's<00:01:03.629> go<00:01:03.750> ahead<00:01:03.870> and

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
couple minutes so let's go ahead and

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.730 
couple minutes so let's go ahead and
begin<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.640> daytime<00:01:05.640> shots<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.710> I

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
begin with the daytime shots so so I

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.770 
begin with the daytime shots so so I
have<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> little<00:01:08.159> map<00:01:08.340> here<00:01:08.670> taken<00:01:09.479> from<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
have a little map here taken from the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.710 
have a little map here taken from the
DJI<00:01:10.140> phantom<00:01:10.880> of<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.330> different<00:01:12.630> locations

I'll<00:01:13.200> be<00:01:13.290> shooting<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.799> first<00:01:14.100> arrow<00:01:14.400> is

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
I'll be shooting this first arrow is

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.070 
I'll be shooting this first arrow is
about<00:01:14.970> five<00:01:15.270> feet<00:01:15.509> away<00:01:15.600> from<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
about five feet away from the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.399 
about five feet away from the

second-story window the second arrow is
about<00:01:19.650> 75<00:01:20.250> feet<00:01:20.490> away<00:01:20.610> from<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.720> house<00:01:22.130> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
about 75 feet away from the house the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.030 
about 75 feet away from the house the
third<00:01:23.640> arrow<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.390> about<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.110> hundred<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.799> fifty

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
third arrow is about a hundred and fifty

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.510 
third arrow is about a hundred and fifty
feet<00:01:26.220> away<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.780> fourth<00:01:27.780> arrow<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.560> around<00:01:28.860> two

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
feet away and fourth arrow is around two

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.730 
feet away and fourth arrow is around two
hundred<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.030> fifty<00:01:30.479> feet<00:01:30.630> away<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.619> we're

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
hundred and fifty feet away so we're

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.020 
hundred and fifty feet away so we're
gonna<00:01:31.799> go<00:01:32.009> ahead<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.250> begin<00:01:32.369> with<00:01:32.520> our<00:01:32.790> first

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
gonna go ahead and begin with our first

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.760 
gonna go ahead and begin with our first
location<00:01:33.210> which<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.900> roughly<00:01:34.110> three<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.619> five

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
location which is roughly three to five

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.800 
location which is roughly three to five
feet<00:01:34.799> away<00:01:35.130> from<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.490> window<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.689> I'm

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
feet away from the window and I'm

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.010 
feet away from the window and I'm
standing<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> deck<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.920> get<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.250> shot

to<00:02:02.219> 300<00:02:02.520> feet<00:02:02.880> because<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.960> see

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
to 300 feet because you can see

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.819 
to 300 feet because you can see
absolutely<00:02:05.009> nothing<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.600> house<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.680> then

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
absolutely nothing of the house so then

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.919 
absolutely nothing of the house so then
we<00:02:07.920> wanted<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.280> try<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.489> do<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> test<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.360> noise

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
we wanted to try to do a test of noise

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:10.990 
we wanted to try to do a test of noise
levels

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
levels

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.400 
levels
different<00:02:11.330> distances<00:02:12.020> with<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.440> DJI<00:02:12.860> inspire

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
different distances with the DJI inspire

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.600 
different distances with the DJI inspire
and<00:02:15.410> so<00:02:15.680> we're<00:02:15.770> gonna<00:02:15.890> start<00:02:16.190> out<00:02:16.310> by<00:02:16.550> the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
and so we're gonna start out by the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.220 
and so we're gonna start out by the
house<00:02:16.850> here<00:02:17.180> at<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.540> three<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.810> five<00:02:17.960> foot

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
house here at the three to five foot

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.060 
house here at the three to five foot
mark

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
mark

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.620 
mark
and<00:02:19.310> this<00:02:19.430> is<00:02:19.580> what<00:02:19.760> someone<00:02:20.060> would<00:02:20.150> hear<00:02:20.390> in

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
and this is what someone would hear in

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.200 
and this is what someone would hear in
their<00:02:20.810> house<00:02:21.020> with<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.530> door<00:02:22.030> or<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.180> window

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
their house with the door or the window

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.340 
their house with the door or the window
open

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.140 

now<00:02:30.350> we're<00:02:30.500> approximately<00:02:31.340> seventy-five

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
now we're approximately seventy-five

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.230 
now we're approximately seventy-five
feet<00:02:32.330> away<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:33.350> then<00:02:33.530> once<00:02:34.070> we<00:02:34.220> move<00:02:34.580> on<00:02:34.760> even

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
feet away and then once we move on even

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.320 
feet away and then once we move on even
farther<00:02:35.570> to<00:02:35.840> 150<00:02:36.500> feet<00:02:36.910> it's<00:02:37.910> gonna<00:02:38.060> sound

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
farther to 150 feet it's gonna sound

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.930 
farther to 150 feet it's gonna sound
maybe<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.440> like<00:02:39.620> your<00:02:39.890> neighbors<00:02:40.460> lawn<00:02:40.730> mower

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
maybe you like your neighbors lawn mower

so first off we have the cannon at

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.880 
so first off we have the cannon at
seventy-five<00:02:44.900> feet<00:02:45.140> away<00:02:45.260> from<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.590> window

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
seventy-five feet away from the window

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.310 
seventy-five feet away from the window
