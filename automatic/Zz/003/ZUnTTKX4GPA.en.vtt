now<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.860> cynic<00:02:14.490> that<00:02:14.670> way<00:02:14.820> point<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.360> can<00:02:15.810> now

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
now I cynic that way point I can now

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.900 
now I cynic that way point I can now
press<00:02:16.410> control<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.070> add<00:02:17.190> another<00:02:17.430> Waypoint

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
press control and add another Waypoint

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.780 
press control and add another Waypoint
off<00:02:18.090> down<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.480> road<00:02:18.660> here<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.110> left<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:20.430> I

off down the road here to the left and I

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.580 
off down the road here to the left and I
can<00:02:20.820> add<00:02:21.060> another<00:02:21.180> Waypoint<00:02:21.750> further<00:02:22.380> down

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
can add another Waypoint further down

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.730 
can add another Waypoint further down
the<00:02:22.710> road<00:02:22.860> yeah<00:02:23.790> we'll<00:02:23.970> keep<00:02:24.060> scrolling<00:02:24.330> along

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.010 
the road yeah we'll keep scrolling along
adding<00:02:25.740> waypoints<00:02:26.280> as<00:02:26.400> we<00:02:27.030> go<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:27.510> there<00:02:27.720> we<00:02:27.840> go

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
adding waypoints as we go so there we go

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.170 
adding waypoints as we go so there we go
I've<00:02:28.200> had<00:02:28.350> it<00:02:28.500> now<00:02:28.710> 1<00:02:29.310> 2<00:02:29.550> 3<00:02:29.580> 4<00:02:30.210> 5<00:02:32.000> waypoints<00:02:33.000> in

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
I've had it now 1 2 3 4 5 waypoints in

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.600 
I've had it now 1 2 3 4 5 waypoints in
addition<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.960> first<00:02:34.590> spawn<00:02:36.380> now<00:02:37.380> any<00:02:38.370> of

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
addition to the first spawn now any of

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.730 
addition to the first spawn now any of
these<00:02:38.730> waypoints<00:02:39.300> can<00:02:39.480> be<00:02:39.740> manipulated

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
these waypoints can be manipulated

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.590 
these waypoints can be manipulated
individually<00:02:41.340> by<00:02:41.670> left<00:02:41.910> clicking<00:02:42.000> on<00:02:42.390> them

individually by left clicking on them
and<00:02:42.720> highlighting<00:02:43.500> them<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:43.800> let's<00:02:43.980> take<00:02:44.250> the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
and highlighting them so let's take the

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.470 
and highlighting them so let's take the
center<00:02:45.120> Waypoint<00:02:45.540> down<00:02:45.750> by<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:45.960> curve<00:02:46.200> here

on<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.910> Waypoint<00:03:09.330> tab<00:03:09.570> okay<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:09.990> here's<00:03:10.200> our

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
on the Waypoint tab okay so here's our

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.380 
on the Waypoint tab okay so here's our
Waypoint<00:03:10.500> if<00:03:11.000> there's<00:03:12.000> nothing<00:03:12.210> much

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
Waypoint if there's nothing much

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.360 
Waypoint if there's nothing much
happening<00:03:12.690> here<00:03:12.750> really<00:03:13.080> we<00:03:13.350> can<00:03:13.530> do<00:03:13.740> a<00:03:13.770> normal

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
happening here really we can do a normal

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.750 
happening here really we can do a normal
move<00:03:14.630> or<00:03:15.630> we<00:03:15.870> can<00:03:16.020> specify<00:03:16.320> attacking<00:03:17.280> targets

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
move or we can specify attacking targets

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.610 
move or we can specify attacking targets
or<00:03:17.910> attack<00:03:18.209> ground<00:03:18.570> areas<00:03:18.930> or<00:03:19.110> laying<00:03:19.350> mines

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
or attack ground areas or laying mines

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.390 
or attack ground areas or laying mines
now<00:03:19.890> because<00:03:20.160> this<00:03:20.310> vehicle<00:03:20.910> has<00:03:21.209> no<00:03:21.240> weapons

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
now because this vehicle has no weapons

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.970 
now because this vehicle has no weapons
there's<00:03:23.400> no<00:03:23.580> point<00:03:23.880> in<00:03:24.260> specifying<00:03:25.260> any

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
there's no point in specifying any

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.830 
there's no point in specifying any
attack<00:03:26.490> move<00:03:26.760> so<00:03:27.000> it's<00:03:27.150> just<00:03:27.240> going<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.480> normal

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
attack move so it's just going to normal

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.320 
attack move so it's just going to normal
move<00:03:28.050> and<00:03:28.380> this<00:03:29.130> vehicle<00:03:29.640> will<00:03:29.790> spawn<00:03:30.060> there

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
move and this vehicle will spawn there

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.030 
move and this vehicle will spawn there
and<00:03:30.750> we'll<00:03:31.260> move<00:03:31.410> along<00:03:31.620> let's<00:03:33.980> unselect<00:03:34.980> that

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
and we'll move along let's unselect that

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:43.190 
and we'll move along let's unselect that
now<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:39.050> we'll<00:03:40.050> try<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:41.540> quickly<00:03:42.540> place<00:03:42.959> an

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
now and we'll try and quickly place an

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.270 
now and we'll try and quickly place an
aircraft<00:03:43.650> in<00:03:43.830> that<00:03:43.980> we<00:03:44.070> can<00:03:44.220> spawn<00:03:44.580> in<00:03:48.560> ok<00:03:49.560> so

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
aircraft in that we can spawn in ok so

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.210 
aircraft in that we can spawn in ok so
now<00:03:50.459> for<00:03:50.520> for<00:03:51.300> shits<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.630> giggles<00:03:51.720> let's<00:03:52.320> look

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
now for for shits and giggles let's look

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.880 
now for for shits and giggles let's look
at<00:03:53.459> placing<00:03:54.180> some<00:03:54.420> German<00:03:55.020> tanks<00:03:55.410> onto<00:03:55.650> this

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
at placing some German tanks onto this

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.550 
at placing some German tanks onto this
map<00:03:56.730> as<00:03:56.970> well<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.420> we'll<00:03:57.930> have<00:03:58.080> them<00:03:58.260> spawn

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
map as well and we'll have them spawn

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.140 
map as well and we'll have them spawn
down<00:03:58.800> here<00:03:59.010> south<00:03:59.340> west<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.540> airport<00:04:00.720> and

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
down here south west of the airport and

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.699 
down here south west of the airport and
driving<00:04:03.150> up<00:04:03.270> to<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.810> air<00:04:03.930> for<00:04:04.140> airport

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
driving up to the air for airport

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.060 
driving up to the air for airport
perimeter<00:04:05.690> so<00:04:06.690> go<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.650> object<00:04:07.770> browser

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
perimeter so go to the object browser

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.820 
perimeter so go to the object browser
and<00:04:08.750> instead<00:04:09.750> of<00:04:09.870> vehicle<00:04:10.200> this<00:04:10.350> time<00:04:10.560> we're

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
and instead of vehicle this time we're

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.930 
and instead of vehicle this time we're
actually<00:04:10.920> going<00:04:11.130> to<00:04:11.220> scroll<00:04:11.459> up<00:04:11.520> and<00:04:11.790> we're

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
actually going to scroll up and we're

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.860 
actually going to scroll up and we're
going<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.090> choose<00:04:12.239> armor<00:04:13.010> select<00:04:14.010> armor<00:04:14.459> and

going to choose armor select armor and

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.940 
going to choose armor select armor and
then<00:04:15.870> let's<00:04:16.320> go<00:04:16.590> for<00:04:16.919> a<00:04:18.470> we'll<00:04:19.470> go<00:04:19.620> for<00:04:19.859> a<00:04:19.890> 35<00:04:20.850> T

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
then let's go for a we'll go for a 35 T

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.780 
then let's go for a we'll go for a 35 T
which<00:04:22.950> looks<00:04:23.370> like<00:04:23.460> this

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
which looks like this

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.740 
add a few waypoints and one across the
road<00:05:29.880> that's<00:05:30.880> gonna<00:05:31.150> be<00:05:31.330> a<00:05:31.360> bit<00:05:31.510> annoying

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
road that's gonna be a bit annoying

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.150 
road that's gonna be a bit annoying
because<00:05:31.990> I<00:05:32.230> suspect<00:05:32.620> those<00:05:32.770> tankers<00:05:33.130> are

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
because I suspect those tankers are

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.950 
because I suspect those tankers are
going<00:05:33.310> to<00:05:33.370> nearly<00:05:33.550> crash<00:05:34.150> into<00:05:34.450> each<00:05:34.480> other<00:05:34.720> so

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
going to nearly crash into each other so

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.750 
going to nearly crash into each other so
I've<00:05:35.020> just<00:05:35.140> got<00:05:35.290> to<00:05:35.380> move<00:05:35.500> this<00:05:35.710> one<00:05:35.920> but<00:05:36.730> for

I've just got to move this one but for

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.470 
I've just got to move this one but for
the<00:05:37.030> south<00:05:37.330> east<00:05:38.110> so<00:05:38.530> that<00:05:38.710> the<00:05:39.210> both<00:05:40.210> tanks

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.110 
the south east so that the both tanks
don't<00:05:41.070> merge<00:05:42.070> on<00:05:42.340> the<00:05:42.430> same<00:05:42.640> point<00:05:42.910> on<00:05:43.000> that

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
don't merge on the same point on that
