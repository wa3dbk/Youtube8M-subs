00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.560
 Special seed for survival well 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.080
 because this is one of those seeds 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.760

 a seed as I said for lovers 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.219
 of survival the reason why not 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.499
 there is space there is not much earth are 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.149
 small islands the truth is that you go 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:42.789
 to see right now the first island is a 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.670
 little bigger than the rest we do 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.440
 he answers is a place where there is lava and 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.019
 there is a small one for a small one that 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.089
 fuck a pit of the host is to say a 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.999
 fails these great good ones that come out 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.789
 in version 1.8 point 2 this island as 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:01:00.370
 I say is the biggest there is of all the 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.659
 map the rest is almost all water then 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.429
 all those people who like 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.040
 make constructions the style of 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:08.470
 pixel and they need semi world 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.600
 flat this is not a seed but for the 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.180
 lovers of survival 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.240
 for many reasons, you guys have many 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.009
 islands where you choose to start what 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.979
 it's your adventure in survival 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.990
 it's being the biggest island too 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.820
 It is also quite it is clear 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.140
 that will appear on the surface more 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.780
 monsters and apart has a 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.549
 peculiarity aside from having that flaw 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.840
 Fantastic let's see now 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:37.270
 in which they go down a lot and you can 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.990
 find material pretty easy so much 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.030
 coal as you can see iron there is gold 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.920
 in the in the area below is also 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.119
 some iron formula but find 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.770
 a place where there was now I do not remember 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.670
 knows where is proposed here in the fault 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.800
 you are going to find it because it has a 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.100
 quite good peculiarity and is that 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.479
 let's find an area one 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.399
 library let's call it a 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.319
 library very close to here what happens 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.030
 that we are going to have to finish but before 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.920
 I want to show you that you can see that 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.780
 quite full of water that is to say about 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.119
 all water and you have the small ones of this 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.530
 style in case you want to increase the 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.319
 difficulty of your survival mode 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.050
 that is to say the good thing would be for example 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.720
 start at one taking advantage of that we have 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.510
 start in one of these in one of these 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.310
 islands and try to do the most in this 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.860
 island now if what I told you right 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.000
 point to any specific area we are going to 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.460
 see is covered not so that it does not exceed 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.340
 here pa where it came right at this point 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.810
 of the island yes here we go down you see 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.090
 that there is a way like a small 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.650
 little arrow down you will divert it to 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.000
 ive is the map where I'm fine then there 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.790
 in those little arrows you see there in that area 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.620
 hence there just not there yes we will 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.730
 down continuously I tell you 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.340
 you can know in doing the mode 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.430
 survival let's get to a cave 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.770
 the truth is that it is an authentic past of 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.630
 big and some partner came out taking 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.780
 a series in which this appeared just 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.880
 in the area let's say the surface but 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.940
 here it is not on the surface but 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.130
 we can play with survival mode 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.490
 and try to make it our first 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.530
 house or our first refuge and do 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.440
 so an exit to an elevator or what 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.290
 you want to the outside 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.540
 all right 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:29.870
 a trunk in which there are books and leaves and the 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:31.879
 another trunk is taba I think there's the 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.480
 another magician who also has leaves and 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:38.180
 books well this area is quite broad 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.819
 It has many, many, many, many 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.079
 corridors cells rooms I'll catch 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.540
 this a little bit to light up so that 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.659
 you see the truth is that it is very good is 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.639
 very curious are also areas 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.780
 of abandoned mines if we throw a 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.370
 little bit more down but then I go 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.590
 to teach the most superficial the most 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.810
 more affordable from the area of ​​the 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.159
 library where I found good 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.829
 stairs down up with 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:02.329
 this then we can say decorate the 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.669
 who put it on the door decorating the 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.379
 way you want to say 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.599
 have it better as a main house or as 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.980
 If you want like I do not know how to tell you 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.720
 to make here an adventure map that 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.639
 I do not like this area very much to get there 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.220
 to make adventure maps what they are 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:18.859
 this kind of caves and this kind of 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.660
 areas already built well guys what 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.430
 I told you all those lovers of 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.380
 survival that you were asking me 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.570
 please map survival maps 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.310
 that is not the typical map in which it is 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.410
 easy to find 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.720
 I can not look at this map 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.720
 it's the flight then we have this other island 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.180
 that is also very good is very curious 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.910
 and here where you see this strip is fine 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.880
 it's south is south west guys to the 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:47.630
 south west well as you can see there was a 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.669
 small strip of sand there you see it at 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.900
 background well that here in the middle yes 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:55.580
 also bite down you go to 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.770
 find another one of the holes today 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.360
 I also do not know how to call the fault myself 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.560
 llamo de las fallas law is another of the 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.760
 failures but this fault is super 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.680
 illuminated is a fault in which you have 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.410
 very much washes a lot of water and also 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.090
 You'll find a lot of material very 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.740
 the view the truth that also yes 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.490
 you want to start survival mode in 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.370
 this island 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.470
 because things have pretty good hand 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.300
 and you always know you have to have in 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.130
 account that from these failures is 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.310
 very easy to find then mines 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.599
 abandoned and also find caves 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.310
 what happens that you have to be careful 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:27.960
 when going down taking into account that we are 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.300
 well you can see that there is a lot of 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.889
 lava yesterday there on the left you saw there 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.080
 out there coal the truth that is very 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.599
 well it 's great there seemed to be a 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.419
 map that is worth taking a look 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:41.310
 more than anything for those people and 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.500
 I keep repeating I 'm going to do a little bit 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.659
 heavy to those people that you like 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.250
 survival mode and either nothing or 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:49.800
 the map in general so that what 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.860
 you see look as you see that it has very little 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:56.069
 zone is all island island 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.539
 On the right is an island of ice 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:59.849
 down is the one we saw the ones in the 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.289
 left and the center are those 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.520
 they are also smaller 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.840

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.699
 Take a look and if you like it 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.620
