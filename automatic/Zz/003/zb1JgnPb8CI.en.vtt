instance discovery is my least favorite

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.640

map<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:12.150> spawning<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.020> just<00:01:13.380> find

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
map the spawning in that I just find

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.640 
map the spawning in that I just find
they<00:01:14.610> always<00:01:14.880> spawn<00:01:15.150> behind<00:01:15.390> me<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.500> always

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
get shot in the ass so that's why I

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.609 
get shot in the ass so that's why I
don't<00:01:19.110> like<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.570> Kowloon<00:01:21.619> it's

like<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.150> haven't<00:01:37.049> played<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.290> maps<00:01:37.470> too<00:01:37.680> many

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
like I haven't played the maps too many

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.789 
like I haven't played the maps too many
times<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.900> maybe<00:01:39.900> i<00:01:39.990> might<00:01:40.290> get<00:01:40.439> better<00:01:40.619> at

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
times so maybe i might get better at

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.200 
times so maybe i might get better at
them<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.100> start<00:01:41.280> liking<00:01:41.579> them<00:01:41.670> but<00:01:41.850> raised<00:01:42.060> as

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
them and start liking them but raised as

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.569 
them and start liking them but raised as
of<00:01:42.479> now<00:01:42.630> i<00:01:42.930> don't<00:01:43.140> really<00:01:43.500> like<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> map<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.310> a

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.700 
of now i don't really like the map so a
favorite<00:01:45.570> thing<00:01:45.720> about<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.259> zombies

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
favorite thing about it is the zombies

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
off but I like the reticule that he's

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.960 
off but I like the reticule that he's
got<00:02:49.959> on<00:02:50.109> this<00:02:50.319> gun<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:50.829> don't<00:02:51.489> really<00:02:51.579> know<00:02:51.819> why

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
got on this gun I don't really know why

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.420 
got on this gun I don't really know why
it's<00:02:52.209> just<00:02:52.329> got<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.569> nice<00:02:52.750> feel<00:02:52.989> to<00:02:53.049> it<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.739> it's

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
it's just got a nice feel to it and it's

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.770 
it's just got a nice feel to it and it's
other<00:02:54.549> gonna<00:02:54.730> make<00:02:54.849> another<00:02:55.060> class<00:02:55.359> with<00:02:55.750> the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
other gonna make another class with the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.220 
other gonna make another class with the
m16<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.500> put<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.709> reticule<00:02:57.040> on<00:02:57.250> it<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:58.230> think

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
m16 and put that reticule on it I think

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.670 
m16 and put that reticule on it I think
that<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.769> ACOG<00:03:00.220> scope<00:03:00.250> on<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.939> m16<00:03:01.680> improves

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
that the ACOG scope on the m16 improves

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.099 
that the ACOG scope on the m16 improves
the<00:03:03.129> stats<00:03:03.489> of<00:03:03.730> it<00:03:03.909> or<00:03:04.030> somehow<00:03:04.269> it<00:03:04.599> makes<00:03:04.810> it

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
the stats of it or somehow it makes it

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.490 
the stats of it or somehow it makes it
shoot<00:03:05.349> faster<00:03:05.920> i'm<00:03:06.220> not<00:03:06.400> quite<00:03:06.609> sure<00:03:06.639> but

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
shoot faster i'm not quite sure but

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.280
