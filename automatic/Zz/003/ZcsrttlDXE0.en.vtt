had a red or no I had to listen to a
radio<00:01:18.890> program<00:01:19.759> and<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:21.080> person<00:01:21.710> was<00:01:22.070> talking

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
radio program and the person was talking

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.609 
radio program and the person was talking
about<00:01:22.759> enzymes<00:01:23.330> and<00:01:23.720> how<00:01:23.899> it<00:01:24.110> was<00:01:24.259> a<00:01:24.290> life

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
about enzymes and how it was a life

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.770 
about enzymes and how it was a life
force<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:26.680> how<00:01:27.680> it<00:01:27.860> was<00:01:28.009> actually<00:01:28.970> a<00:01:29.149> healing

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
force and how it was actually a healing

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.359 
force and how it was actually a healing
element<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:31.360> so<00:01:32.360> I<00:01:32.690> started<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:33.979> really

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
element and so I started to really

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:41.790 
element and so I started to really
believe<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:36.640> this<00:01:37.640> was<00:01:38.149> the<00:01:38.360> key<00:01:38.690> to<00:01:39.080> our<00:01:40.720> our

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
believe that this was the key to our our

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.910 
believe that this was the key to our our
health<00:01:42.800> and<00:01:43.300> I<00:01:44.300> started<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.780> incorporate<00:01:44.920> the

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920
