00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.090
 the guys are yours again 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.380
 I drive a mother talking here to the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.420
 brown channel 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.650
 then according to our line of 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.150
 revenue 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.950
 I'm doing it now that I said 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.020
 'do not you start to prepare the chicken okay 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.869
 nor does it consider the recipe for them 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.460
 consider a way to make chicken is 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.279
 how I've been doing like chicken 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.720
 enough times a day with a lot more but 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.820
 I think it's cool for those who are starting to 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.160
 take these tips faro beach is 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.070
 Improving is to put in your arena 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.840
 so let's go to the right cold details 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:43.430
 chicken or Brazil only 150 have already separated 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.430
 Amazonas frozen in favor for damn 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.440
 is an important detail to ifr I do not 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.420
 I put it straight into the frying pan because 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.850
 It takes too long to get done right. 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.210
 It ends up with taste taste so bad 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.089
 What I do is that it puts you in the micro 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.289
 I will come here for us to it already gives a 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.929
 right. 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.170
 she was clicked to save my time 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.170
 after 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.009
 So it's starting in this order of ideas. 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.390
 I am sure that it is important to 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.270
 inclusion of time in time for 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.880
 to continue is not not developing 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.950
 so the canon take so long kaka 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.929
 still so beautiful and can use her 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.210
 time to do other things is the 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.520
 fifth to understand having a chicken and 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.709
 chicken was kind of prepared in the book 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.780
 He is not getting ready here and there. 

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:38.789
 I'll finish then and the wallet is 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.709
 showing you too and this is going to 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.939
 facilitate our life our repair 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:44.700
 Let's have a look, he's fine. 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:53.420
 important you have seen these chickens 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:59.810
 to defrost only on one side and 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.810
 put in another two minutes 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.920
 I think I have chicken how does he 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.250
 It's up to china micro housing 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.310
 practically ready and now I can 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.250
 wash it put in the frying pan let's go 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.010
 accompany this process also to 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.680
 whoever follows the movie stays like a car 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.420
 white underneath there I believe it is the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.840
 then what do I do to take away 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.840
 this one 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.100
 for those who understand, then you know how to put 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.530
 the whole chicken in the frying pan it goes 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.350
 get cooked some side and some side will 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.440
 end up getting cancer I'll cut and 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.300
 to make my life easier I have 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.490
 I already see how the 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.870
 much lower proportion 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:17.670
 Okay, now I'll have to fry this up. 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.560
 use a simple non-stick frying pan 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:25.590
 on the wood is not very good 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:27.270
 I'm going to use coconut oil here. 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.540
 For those who have seen some videos, you know that 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.540
 I drew special wine 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:44.300
 and a woman with child lived the ball 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.610
 that went straight into the bottle 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.640
 Okay, I'll wait here is to be one. 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.200
 little more eye species start to 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:04.050
 stay in the pan after I can 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:05.970
 begin to put the blood to make a 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.120
 test aims is good enough already 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.840
 hot the gaucho started to work I 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.840
 Can I play the rest? 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.020
 go to the bathroom 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.990
 I'll leave it here some time, let's go 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.750
 make ours come next 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:42.400
 It's just that our training starts giving it to him. 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.400
 a little corner weighed 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:07.160
 is our nobody was being made of 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.160
 good noice can start to 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.760
 practically ready now our kitchen 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:18.480

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:21.390
 taewan ready in the pan 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.310
 the pot that I went through to put a 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:26.700
 or two games do not give a life them 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.150
 scavenge with dry chicken and also has 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.150
 helped a lot 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.080

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.270
 We're ready, we 're all alone. 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.290
 it would be blah it's only bare 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.910
 note that it sits well in the garden 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.790
 trianon 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:51.020
 look at the conversation of the two votes to 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:53.220
 Please, this is it for me. 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.470
 This is another tip of the online channel 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.200
 prepared for the day before 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.960
 some meals before you put the 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.720
 name put on my micro that 2,500 channel 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.940
 to set the two boys or more time 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.740
 to think I'll put him to sleep 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.580
 and make it much easier for me to 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.610
 preparation 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.270
 I was a fan and not weak in a lava who 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.670
 want to show quality 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.190

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:21.100
 can put of graphite did much to 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.470
 affect the order stayed but that's what gives 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.820
 put a final amount of time until one eye and 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.920
 was released ahead 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.260
 put it and see this is another tip 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.890
