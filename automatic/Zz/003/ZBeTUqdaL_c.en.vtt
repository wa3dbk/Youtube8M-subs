once you've made that investment and it
comes<00:00:13.830> time<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.190> update<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.210> scan<00:00:15.540> tool<00:00:15.809> what

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
comes time to update the scan tool what

will<00:01:22.619> check<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.920> global<00:01:23.460> codes

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
will check the global codes

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.649 
will check the global codes
it'll<00:01:24.360> also<00:01:24.570> check<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.409> powertrain

manufacture<00:01:27.659> side<00:01:27.930> codes<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:28.890> you

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
manufacture side codes and then you

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.859 
manufacture side codes and then you
really<00:01:29.430> need<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.670> check<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> codes<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.750> all

found<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.130> intermittent<00:01:59.700> problem<00:02:00.320> again

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
found the intermittent problem again

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.620 
found the intermittent problem again
that<00:02:01.350> high<00:02:01.829> voltage<00:02:01.890> computer<00:02:02.880> was<00:02:03.090> telling

that high voltage computer was telling

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.050 
that high voltage computer was telling
the<00:02:04.350> whole<00:02:04.710> network<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.700> there<00:02:05.880> was<00:02:06.030> a

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
the whole network that there was a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.119 
the whole network that there was a
problem<00:02:06.450> there<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.170> need<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.740> have<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
problem there so you need to have the

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.910

so we can repair it properly we also

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.310 
so we can repair it properly we also
have<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.760> ask<00:02:53.820> this<00:02:54.120> question<00:02:54.180> after<00:02:54.900> we've
