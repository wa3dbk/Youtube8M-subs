00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 model you want it very often 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.220
 over all those matches yes put played 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.349
 this season 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:13.410
 35 36 37 38 do you want to talk about that 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.299
 you can look nice up there alone 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.270
 to my real competitions ahead 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.980
 and after those two him sometimes 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.869
 can look back on one 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.330
 anyway very nice they are alone 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.189
 hopefully with a nice prank prize 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.119
 is very often about being tired and the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.609
 is to will writing the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.810
 outside world comfort so you first get there 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.590
 getting a little tired of all that 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.270
 stories 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.130
 yes you hear very nice there and leave alone 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.410
 in plays for competitions only you 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.160
 it also gets stronger and I think the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.300
 whole group 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.700
 and I think we are also against Heerenveen 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.090
 nevertheless have proved that after it anyway 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.680
 again result channel and I mean the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.420
 trainer has canceled 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.850
 we are all still young and our bodies 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.350
 recovers very quickly against Groningen 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.550
 can simply be in full container 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.820
 let's just walk that nice until that 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.160
 suspect yes they sure no I for 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.770
 80% it is mental so it completely 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.480
 channel is crazy how mental is the concept 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.400
 form as I map my results 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.880
 of the last 10 games once 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.570
 green 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:14.159
 van heerenveen and groningen 888 yes 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.049
 just put it down so there form but we 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.360
 I think we have some good ones 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.860
 Lessons show it too 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.320
 for example ice against benfica loss 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.210
 you but you see that you eat 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.560
 good football is going to jump and at home 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.630
 against the bogs 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.180
 one also took you three it became good 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.650
 so both the according is that one 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.590
 example to against Groningen too 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.990
 to go to full capacity and we have 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.880
 groningen thai wind season also good 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.040
 have played equi it was put down 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.530
 and so also won for that matter 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.540
 the go with full confidence is russians 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.790
 form of depends on result or is 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.900
 that overestimated something 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.570
 no, that's something I think is overrated 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.980
 Also has to do with game only the and 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.020
 groningen that 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.080
 it has a good shape if you 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.300
 in terms of results and to our city 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.550
 to add it now 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.100
 I think it will be an hour now 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.979
 or down and therefore the final of plugt 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.500
 describe your shape is how good it is 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.010
 our form yes our form everyone has too 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.660
 trust 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.090
 I mean you come to the final of the 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.710
 play-offs quarter final europe league eh 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.380
 in the cup you come to the semi-final 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.270
 So our team knows we have one on 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.940
 we have come very far on every front and 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.220
 Every now want to do everything to all 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.840
 my gaze and the sludge that feels 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.150
 also its real prize european football 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.680
 pick yes for our well have imagined 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.770
 have fought on a great deal of land and 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.150
 come a long way and if you are European 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.310
 picks up and 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.260
 yes then you can still speak for us 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.600
 are there any price than how we 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.900
 we are going to celebrate it is celebrated 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.959
 we will see that I can do it myself 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.850
 not have to go through 400 again 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.310
 dare same only it is very beautiful and 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.810
 for the club and then for the players one 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.880
 European games under next year 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.709
 nevertheless very beautiful while playing it along 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.600
 to make is a kind of other 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.400
 football a higher level 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.470
 service team you must own at each 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.610
 price for me is that also on a check 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.220
 is right 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.489
 you call that seen after I celebrated 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.590
 fly I heard it from the trainer 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.150
 from the club that I received an invitation 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.130
 so that is very beautiful 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.459
 So we have a good time with three 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.380
 you three beautiful matches and you come in 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.230
 beautiful countries back so you see you see 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.849
 there for what one 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.670
 June 6 is the last one against it 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:32.220
 Brazil and June 7 starts with vacation 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.810
 yes then you can finally go on holiday and 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.700
 if you then the players win how 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.709
 For a long time you can go on holiday there as well 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.930
 is then we still have to discuss exactly 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.810
 with the medical staff and technical staff 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.370
 only get about four weeks 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.530
 so I'll probably leave something 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.849
 start 0 then the rest none 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.890
 failure center parcs because you like that 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.819
