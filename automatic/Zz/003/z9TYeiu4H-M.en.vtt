00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
hairs once it has already happened is a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.830 
hairs once it has already happened is a
little<00:01:02.879> bit<00:01:02.969> more<00:01:03.149> difficult<00:01:03.510> than

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
little bit more difficult than

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.440 
little bit more difficult than
prevention<00:01:04.470> but<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.159> light<00:01:05.430> exfoliant<00:01:06.119> works

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
prevention but a light exfoliant works

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.520 
prevention but a light exfoliant works
best<00:01:06.780> what<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.590> prefer<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.810> actually<00:01:09.810> ground<00:01:10.350> up

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
best what I prefer is actually ground up

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.679 
best what I prefer is actually ground up
coffee<00:01:10.770> beans<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:12.030> these<00:01:12.150> are<00:01:12.210> ground<00:01:12.600> up

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
coffee beans so these are ground up

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.510 
coffee beans so these are ground up
coffee<00:01:12.930> beans<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.470> I've<00:01:13.590> actually<00:01:13.830> already

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
coffee beans that I've actually already

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.649 
coffee beans that I've actually already
made<00:01:15.360> coffee<00:01:15.659> with<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.439> they<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> slight

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
made coffee with so they have a slight

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.270 
made coffee with so they have a slight
moisturize<00:01:18.659> moisture<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.409> them<00:01:19.560> some<00:01:20.040> water

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
moisturize moisture to them some water

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.550 
moisturize moisture to them some water
the<00:01:21.270> reason<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.780> coffee<00:01:21.990> beans<00:01:22.320> and

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
the reason for the coffee beans and

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.469 
the reason for the coffee beans and
ingrown<00:01:22.890> hairs<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.549> coffee<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:24.119> full<00:01:24.390> of

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
ingrown hairs is that coffee is full of

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.030 
ingrown hairs is that coffee is full of
caffeine<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.080> caffeine<00:01:25.500> gets<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.799> blood

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
caffeine and caffeine gets the blood

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.010 
caffeine and caffeine gets the blood
flowing<00:01:26.100> blood<00:01:27.090> carries<00:01:27.479> our<00:01:27.630> white<00:01:27.780> blood

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
flowing blood carries our white blood

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.410 
flowing blood carries our white blood
cells<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.590> heals<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.220> skin<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:30.270> those

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
cells and that heals the skin so those

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.819 
cells and that heals the skin so those
little<00:01:30.450> tiny<00:01:30.810> ingrown<00:01:31.200> hairs<00:01:31.470> they<00:01:31.680> could

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
little tiny ingrown hairs they could

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.560 
little tiny ingrown hairs they could
become<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> little<00:01:32.280> bit<00:01:32.369> infected<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.060> when

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
become a little bit infected and when

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.020

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
secret to the best lubrication for the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.240 
secret to the best lubrication for the
razor<00:02:41.769> to<00:02:42.160> cross<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:43.030> actually<00:02:43.569> with<00:02:43.750> an<00:02:43.900> oil

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
razor to cross is actually with an oil

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.830 
razor to cross is actually with an oil
so<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.310> apply<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.700> oil<00:02:45.970> underneath<00:02:46.510> the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
so you apply the oil underneath the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.509 
so you apply the oil underneath the
shaving<00:02:47.260> cream<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.560> this<00:02:47.890> just<00:02:48.160> adds<00:02:48.280> for

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
shaving cream and this just adds for

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.150 
shaving cream and this just adds for
extra<00:02:48.819> lubrication<00:02:49.060> so<00:02:50.049> here<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.500> have<00:02:50.680> sweet

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160
