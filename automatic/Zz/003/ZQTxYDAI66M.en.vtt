00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.649 
differentials and I have a feeling
that's<00:02:01.590> gonna<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.130> kind<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.180> gonna<00:02:03.299> kill

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
that's gonna be like kind of gonna kill

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.499 
that's gonna be like kind of gonna kill
me<00:02:03.840> on<00:02:03.960> some<00:02:04.140> axles<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.770> got<00:02:05.729> plastic<00:02:06.000> front

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
me on some axles I got plastic front

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.730 
me on some axles I got plastic front
ones<00:02:06.689> right<00:02:06.840> now<00:02:07.020> they're<00:02:07.229> kind<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.530> wore<00:02:07.710> out

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
ones right now they're kind of wore out

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.580 
ones right now they're kind of wore out
I<00:02:08.099> got<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.489> MIP<00:02:08.789> heavy-duty<00:02:09.450> rears

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
I got the MIP heavy-duty rears

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.300 
I got the MIP heavy-duty rears
but<00:02:10.920> uh<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.370> got<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> set<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.330> MIP<00:02:13.310> heavy-duty

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
but uh I got a set of MIP heavy-duty

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.369 
but uh I got a set of MIP heavy-duty
fronts<00:02:14.910> hopefully<00:02:15.660> should<00:02:15.870> be<00:02:15.959> get<00:02:16.140> them<00:02:16.230> by

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
fronts hopefully should be get them by

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.790 
fronts hopefully should be get them by
Christmas<00:02:17.269> but<00:02:18.269> I'm<00:02:18.870> really<00:02:19.290> impressed<00:02:19.590> with

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
these that they're the m2 compound

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.290 
these that they're the m2 compound
they're<00:02:22.110> actually<00:02:22.709> really<00:02:23.040> really<00:02:23.489> soft<00:02:23.760> real

real<00:02:24.720> soft<00:02:24.959> rubber<00:02:25.410> on<00:02:26.510> they<00:02:27.510> grip<00:02:27.810> really

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
real soft rubber on they grip really

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:33.080 
real soft rubber on they grip really
well<00:02:28.549> and<00:02:29.629> I<00:02:30.890> mean<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.280> desperado<00:02:32.700> wheels

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
well and I mean the desperado wheels

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.850 
well and I mean the desperado wheels
look<00:02:33.390> really<00:02:33.750> good<00:02:33.900> with<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.290> molded<00:02:34.650> bead

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
look really good with the molded bead

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.130 
look really good with the molded bead
lock<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:35.250> everything<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:36.420> only<00:02:36.660> thing<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:36.930> had

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
lock and everything the only thing I had

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.350 
lock and everything the only thing I had
to<00:02:37.260> do<00:02:37.410> is<00:02:37.680> if<00:02:38.190> any<00:02:38.489> of<00:02:38.640> y'all<00:02:38.849> and<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.090> know<00:02:39.150> I'm

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
to do is if any of y'all and I know I'm

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.030 
to do is if any of y'all and I know I'm
not<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.540> only<00:02:39.599> one<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.019> does<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.230> but<00:02:40.799> if<00:02:40.890> you

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
not the only one that does it but if you

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.490 
not the only one that does it but if you
run<00:02:41.250> rear<00:02:41.580> shocks<00:02:41.940> upfront<00:02:42.420> like<00:02:42.810> if<00:02:43.410> you

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
run rear shocks upfront like if you

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.259 
run rear shocks upfront like if you
bought<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.709> set<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.130> rear<00:02:44.310> ultra<00:02:44.730> shocks<00:02:45.000> and

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
bought a set of rear ultra shocks and

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.300 
bought a set of rear ultra shocks and
put<00:02:45.390> them<00:02:45.480> up<00:02:45.569> front<00:02:45.870> one<00:02:46.769> thing<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:46.980> they

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
put them up front one thing that they

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.660 
put them up front one thing that they
won't<00:02:47.549> do<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:48.380> if<00:02:49.380> it'll<00:02:49.709> focus<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.250> can<00:02:50.280> see

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
won't do is if it'll focus you can see

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.110 
won't do is if it'll focus you can see
where<00:02:50.970> my<00:02:52.130> you<00:02:53.130> can't<00:02:53.400> really<00:02:53.610> see<00:02:53.849> it<00:02:53.970> right

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
where my you can't really see it right

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.699 
where my you can't really see it right
there<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.569> can<00:02:54.690> see<00:02:54.870> where<00:02:55.079> the<00:02:55.410> shocks

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
there you can see where the shocks

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.039 
there you can see where the shocks
mounted<00:02:56.220> its<00:02:56.400> own<00:02:56.579> like<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:57.480> fourth<00:02:57.780> hole

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
mounted its own like the fourth hole

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.559 
mounted its own like the fourth hole
from<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.379> inside<00:02:58.670> it's<00:02:59.670> on<00:02:59.849> the<00:03:00.120> third<00:03:00.329> hole

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
from the inside it's on the third hole

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.990 
from the inside it's on the third hole
from<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.870> outside<00:03:01.349> on<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.340> third<00:03:02.579> hole<00:03:02.760> from

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
from the outside on the third hole from

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.670 
from the outside on the third hole from
the<00:03:03.060> inside<00:03:03.150> fourth<00:03:03.900> hole<00:03:04.079> from<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.260> outside

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
the inside fourth hole from the outside

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.199 
the inside fourth hole from the outside
and<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:06.030> had<00:03:06.299> mine<00:03:06.709> way<00:03:07.709> out<00:03:08.040> like<00:03:08.370> on<00:03:08.910> this

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
and I had mine way out like on this

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.289 
and I had mine way out like on this
second<00:03:10.140> last<00:03:10.349> hole<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:11.640> when<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:11.790> had<00:03:12.030> him<00:03:12.150> and

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
second last hole and when I had him and

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.240 
second last hole and when I had him and
I<00:03:12.360> put<00:03:12.510> him<00:03:12.599> on<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:13.140> tires<00:03:13.379> wasn't<00:03:13.769> clear<00:03:14.010> they

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
I put him on the tires wasn't clear they

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.430 
I put him on the tires wasn't clear they
were<00:03:14.370> rubbing<00:03:14.819> so<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:15.480> have<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.870> move<00:03:16.079> them<00:03:16.260> in

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
were rubbing so you have to move them in

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.759 
were rubbing so you have to move them in
to<00:03:17.010> get<00:03:17.190> them<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.430> clear<00:03:18.290> that's<00:03:19.290> one<00:03:19.500> thing<00:03:19.680> I

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
to get them to clear that's one thing I

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.349 
to get them to clear that's one thing I
did<00:03:19.950> another<00:03:20.160> thing<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:20.459> did<00:03:20.639> is<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:20.910> adjusted

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
did another thing I did is I adjusted

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.199 
did another thing I did is I adjusted
the<00:03:21.510> turnbuckles<00:03:22.139> down<00:03:22.319> you<00:03:23.100> they<00:03:23.310> have<00:03:23.549> two

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
the turnbuckles down you they have two

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.539 
the turnbuckles down you they have two
positions<00:03:24.780> for<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.109> turnbuckles<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:26.430> I

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
positions for the turnbuckles and I

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.690 
positions for the turnbuckles and I
moved<00:03:26.819> it<00:03:26.970> down<00:03:27.049> to<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.319> bottom<00:03:28.769> one<00:03:28.889> just<00:03:29.609> to

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
moved it down to the bottom one just to

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.150 
moved it down to the bottom one just to
make<00:03:29.880> sure<00:03:29.910> when<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.049> suspension<00:03:31.410> was<00:03:31.680> like

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
make sure when the suspension was like

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.309 
make sure when the suspension was like
all<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.519> way<00:03:32.549> all<00:03:32.819> up<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.139> will

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
all the way all up that the will

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.319 
all the way all up that the will
wouldn't<00:03:34.650> be<00:03:34.709> rubbing<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.130> but<00:03:35.910> everything

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
wouldn't be rubbing it but everything

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.509 
wouldn't be rubbing it but everything
else<00:03:36.510> clears<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.170> then<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.349> back<00:03:37.560> this<00:03:38.280> is

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
else clears and then the back this is

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.159 
else clears and then the back this is
probably<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.030> biggest<00:03:39.180> tire<00:03:39.540> you<00:03:39.690> can<00:03:39.750> put<00:03:40.049> on

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
probably the biggest tire you can put on

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:41.690 
probably the biggest tire you can put on
one<00:03:40.380> because<00:03:40.709> you<00:03:40.859> can<00:03:41.040> kind<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.400> see<00:03:41.579> the

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
one because you can kind of see the

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.940 
one because you can kind of see the
clearance<00:03:42.060> let<00:03:42.269> me<00:03:42.359> get<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.630> in<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:43.019> light

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
clearance let me get it in the light

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.400 
clearance let me get it in the light
you're<00:03:45.950> cleared<00:03:46.310> right<00:03:46.670> there<00:03:46.849> is<00:03:47.090> not<00:03:47.410> it
