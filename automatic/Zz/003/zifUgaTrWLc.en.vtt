00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
the lashes look thick I am having some

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.589 
the lashes look thick I am having some
of<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.140> blobby<00:02:26.530> nasur<00:02:27.220> clumpiness<00:02:27.849> slight

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
of the blobby nasur clumpiness slight

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.289 
of the blobby nasur clumpiness slight
bit<00:02:28.959> of<00:02:28.989> likely<00:02:29.860> key<00:02:30.040> fall<00:02:30.459> out<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.879> little<00:02:31.090> bit

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
bit of likely key fall out a little bit

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.119 
bit of likely key fall out a little bit
of<00:02:31.390> smudging<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:31.930> got<00:02:32.140> on<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.410> top<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.739> my<00:02:32.860> lids

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
of smudging I got on the top of my lids

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.030 
of smudging I got on the top of my lids
just<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.640> little<00:02:33.970> bit<00:02:34.150> under<00:02:34.569> my<00:02:34.780> eyebrows<00:02:35.349> it

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
just a little bit under my eyebrows it

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.559 
just a little bit under my eyebrows it
really<00:02:36.310> doesn't<00:02:36.580> look<00:02:36.610> like<00:02:36.819> it's<00:02:37.000> moved<00:02:37.299> any

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
really doesn't look like it's moved any

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.900 
really doesn't look like it's moved any
further<00:02:37.930> down<00:02:38.290> as<00:02:38.739> far<00:02:38.980> as<00:02:39.069> the<00:02:39.280> smudging

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
further down as far as the smudging

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.610 
further down as far as the smudging
doesn't<00:02:40.450> really<00:02:40.630> look<00:02:40.780> like<00:02:40.840> there's<00:02:41.230> more

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
doesn't really look like there's more

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.100 
doesn't really look like there's more
fallout<00:02:42.040> than<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.910> beginning<00:02:43.569> few<00:02:43.840> little

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
fallout than that beginning few little

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.530 
fallout than that beginning few little
dots<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:44.860> think<00:02:45.250> it<00:02:45.400> held<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:45.849> out<00:02:46.000> looks<00:02:46.360> like

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
dots I think it held it out looks like

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.390 
dots I think it held it out looks like
there<00:02:46.720> is<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:46.900> little<00:02:47.260> bit<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.620> flaking<00:02:47.950> there

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
there is a little bit of flaking there

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.699 
there is a little bit of flaking there
underneath<00:02:48.790> just<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.690> tiny<00:02:49.900> bit<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.349> little

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
underneath just a tiny bit a little

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.009 
underneath just a tiny bit a little
speckles<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.610> is<00:02:51.760> clumpy<00:02:52.390> looking<00:02:52.840> though

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
speckles it is clumpy looking though

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.199 
speckles it is clumpy looking though
with<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:53.620> primer<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.370> lashes<00:02:54.819> do<00:02:55.000> look

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
with the primer and the lashes do look

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.880 
with the primer and the lashes do look
thicker<00:02:55.510> but<00:02:55.810> they're<00:02:56.019> also<00:02:56.200> clumpy<00:02:56.860> err

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
thicker but they're also clumpy err

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.759 
thicker but they're also clumpy err
there<00:02:57.280> is<00:02:57.549> a<00:02:57.660> little<00:02:58.660> bit<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:58.930> all<00:02:59.079> out<00:02:59.349> a

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
there is a little bit of all out a

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.039 
there is a little bit of all out a
little<00:02:59.890> bit<00:03:00.099> of<00:03:00.220> flakiness<00:03:00.700> under<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.510> lashes

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
little bit of flakiness under the lashes

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.229 
little bit of flakiness under the lashes
the<00:03:02.170> bottom<00:03:02.440> lashes<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:03.069> it<00:03:03.220> is<00:03:03.459> about<00:03:03.970> the

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
the bottom lashes that it is about the

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.720 
the bottom lashes that it is about the
same<00:03:04.540> as<00:03:04.930> without<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.829> primer<00:03:06.099> but<00:03:06.430> there<00:03:06.579> is

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
same as without the primer but there is

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.759 
same as without the primer but there is
I<00:03:06.760> think<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.329> definite<00:03:07.750> difference<00:03:07.900> in<00:03:08.410> the

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
I think a definite difference in the

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.009 
I think a definite difference in the
size<00:03:09.129> of<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.610> lashes<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.599> way<00:03:10.720> that<00:03:10.900> they

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
size of the lashes the way that they

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.110 
size of the lashes the way that they
look<00:03:11.230> they<00:03:11.560> do<00:03:11.620> look<00:03:11.980> thicker<00:03:12.549> with<00:03:12.880> the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
look they do look thicker with the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.599 
look they do look thicker with the
primer<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.720> held<00:03:13.959> up<00:03:14.109> with<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.410> primer<00:03:14.799> no<00:03:15.220> no

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
primer it held up with the primer no no

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.610 
primer it held up with the primer no no

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
that it's hard to get it down here on my

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.960 
that it's hard to get it down here on my
bottom<00:03:25.840> ones<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.680> I<00:03:26.769> don't<00:03:26.980> like<00:03:27.250> it<00:03:27.579> when<00:03:27.819> it

bottom ones and I don't like it when it

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.539 
bottom ones and I don't like it when it
does<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.540> clumpy<00:03:29.230> tip<00:03:29.560> so<00:03:29.829> it<00:03:30.010> does<00:03:30.220> give

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
does the clumpy tip so it does give

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.729 
does the clumpy tip so it does give
fullness<00:03:31.299> but<00:03:31.660> you<00:03:31.870> really<00:03:32.230> have<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:32.620> be

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
fullness but you really have to be

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.920 
fullness but you really have to be
careful<00:03:33.220> for<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.549> clumpiness<00:03:34.030> didn't<00:03:34.690> Lake

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
careful for the clumpiness didn't Lake

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.620 
careful for the clumpiness didn't Lake
and<00:03:35.200> smudge<00:03:35.769> very<00:03:36.370> much<00:03:36.639> I<00:03:37.000> might<00:03:37.269> be<00:03:37.419> able<00:03:37.510> to

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
and smudge very much I might be able to

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.360 
and smudge very much I might be able to
deal<00:03:37.810> with<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.139> clumpiness<00:03:38.500> because<00:03:39.069> you

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
deal with the clumpiness because you

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.949 
deal with the clumpiness because you
know<00:03:39.489> you're<00:03:39.609> gonna<00:03:39.730> have<00:03:39.910> full<00:03:40.180> lashes<00:03:40.480> it's
