00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
system right there let's go ahead and

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.040 
system right there let's go ahead and
get<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.250> better<00:02:54.490> glimpse<00:02:54.850> of<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.270> guts<00:02:56.400> yeah

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
get a better glimpse of the guts yeah

april<00:04:17.299> two<00:04:17.449> gpus<00:04:18.280> they're<00:04:19.280> both<00:04:19.579> that<00:04:19.880> up

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
april two gpus they're both that up

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.839 
april two gpus they're both that up
gotta<00:04:22.660> shaders<00:04:23.660> right<00:04:23.840> there<00:04:24.370> two<00:04:25.370> gigabytes

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
gotta shaders right there two gigabytes

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:31.570 
gotta shaders right there two gigabytes
it's<00:04:26.509> the<00:04:26.690> newest<00:04:27.160> 11.2<00:04:28.160> drivers<00:04:30.490> when<00:04:31.490> we

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
it's the newest 11.2 drivers when we

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.219 
it's the newest 11.2 drivers when we
clocked<00:04:31.819> at<00:04:31.940> 900<00:04:32.479> I<00:04:32.539> don't<00:04:32.660> gotta<00:04:32.810> really

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
clocked at 900 I don't gotta really

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:34.659 
clocked at 900 I don't gotta really
overclock<00:04:33.800> too<00:04:33.979> much<00:04:34.220> because<00:04:34.340> i'm<00:04:34.520> not
