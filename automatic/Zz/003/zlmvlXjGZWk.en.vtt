00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:22.100
 means 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.290
 there were 106 here these here this garbage so 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.450
 would i have them yet 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.930
 surrender people process a little bit in the attack 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.199
 I have to be completely wigged out 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.940
 this attack hope you understand 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:37.340
 circumstances has some 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.739
 an aggressive way of assessing the situation then 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.170
 that time is not much all some 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.730
 there is an hour yes I donâ€™t remember how many 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.210
 Today, the program is slightly shifted 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:53.390
 gave the weather was stormy and windy 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:57.379
 start 3 if so as it is called left to 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.600
 closer to business ski number 106 with good 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.739
 words principle characteristics but 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.320
 first on 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.910
 left some thinking and immediately 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.850
 go to be a good and aggressive 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.300
 close to not 0 want to require 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.070
 getting used to her behavior though 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.890
 relatively there previous relatively 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.550
 the fact that I'm used to a little ball and 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:22.760
 a little less recoil though stability 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.540
 everything is also missing everything just very very 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.189
 very nice but i say i can 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.650
 be better can be better too 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.020
 soft would be so too soft that is it 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.850
 when will there be a category if you are a beginner 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.520
 what could be more suitable for you 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.040
 But for the beginner and the best woman 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.140
 maybe a woman can be good this i 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.229
 it was also good and on him year on 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.740
 steep on steep where loose snow but not 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.890
 agro 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.150
 I mean, no, I don't want to 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.820
 I don't want to cling to it 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.970
 and zinc mouth shorter praetoria 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.930
 mini 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.090
 psychologically something stops it 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.280
 it all depends of course the first such 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.710
 us secondarily from person in 3 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.530
 more often than other parameters 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.840
 sun parties look at me okay on 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.410
