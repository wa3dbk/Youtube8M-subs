00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
the best teams in the country all the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.020 
the best teams in the country all the
way<00:01:36.659> over<00:01:36.960> 180<00:01:37.470> minutes<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.610> surely<00:01:38.820> must

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
way over 180 minutes that surely must

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.460 
way over 180 minutes that surely must
give<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.570> lot<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.810> confidence<00:01:40.200> moving

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
give you a lot of confidence moving

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.880 
give you a lot of confidence moving
forward<00:01:41.060> yeah<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.689> think<00:01:43.500> they'll<00:01:43.649> certainly

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
forward yeah I think they'll certainly

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.410 
forward yeah I think they'll certainly
feel<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:44.399> they<00:01:44.549> were<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.759> cup<00:01:44.939> tie<00:01:45.149> and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
feel like they were in a cup tie and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.410 
feel like they were in a cup tie and
there's<00:01:46.200> no<00:01:46.320> doubt<00:01:46.500> about<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.860> but<00:01:47.360> like<00:01:48.360> I

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
there's no doubt about that but like I

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.170 
there's no doubt about that but like I
said<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.049> for<00:01:49.619> straighten<00:01:49.979> because<00:01:50.280> we're

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180
