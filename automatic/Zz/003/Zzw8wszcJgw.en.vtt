00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.629
 good minutes to a good new video 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.279
 it seems to be promising exciting 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:09.040
 announcements for this year and good the truth 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.090
 we go up all the hype enough and 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.310
 well you know that for this year 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.540
 we have the elder scrolls online in that 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.000
 is that it's a pc game a game 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.860
 massive role multiplayer and good 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.240
 basically, yes, it is true that 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.070
 It looks good but really 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.740
 I understand is a game that is waiting 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.000
 well with much anxiety and really there was what 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.710
 It seems that I am this year 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.890
 because it will announce something bigger by 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.800
 say it one way and I guess the 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.179
 shots can go by 44 or so 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.760
 except that I hope I want to see a new 

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:39.339
 good palau a bluff that really 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.569
 make feel good things like he did 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.019
 fallout 3 that I liked grace 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:43.569
 quite 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.249
 it was the first failure that I tried and 

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:46.510
 I really liked it, I liked it very much 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:47.649
 very much very much I have done what 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.069
 recommended the world because you can 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.620
 find for ridiculous prices of 5 to 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:55.780
 10 euros even and they are total games and it is 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.760
 a totally terrific game and the 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.309
 true let's hope four are down 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.559
 to the proper analogue good and I do not know if 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.780
 will announce a new one of the corts for 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.810
 for next generation consoles or 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.640
 well to look 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.280
 It would be too soon to announce it 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.149
 but shots can also go around 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.430
 we can really do very 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.470
 great for this year either on the e3 or 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.270
 before and the truth that we will be attentive 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.420
 to see what it is that they present 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.860
 because one solar day two I also 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.600
 great things would happen in the heart 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.009
 in fact for me dictionary in case 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.689
 Someone does not know, I thought it was the 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.979
 sign of the best game of this 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.020
 generation for me almost the best 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.149
 dishonored for me has been a great game 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.250
 but in all fucking rules we go without 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.530
 doubt like that came the super truth 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.060
 expectant betesda is one of the best 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.069
 developers of this generation for 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.569
 me is first together with naughty dog ​​and the 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:43.009
 truth is waiting for very good things 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:45.170
 so good to see let's see what it is 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.700
 what they present are presented 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.830
 even a new franchise or what is it 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.750
 what they do because good interesting not 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.189
 stop being it, you have not bet 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.530
 that can reach that can reach 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.270
 present minds to put in the 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.130
 comments that you think it can be and 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.750
 nothing is going to stretch all the 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.189
 wishes to know what it is that is what 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.640
 they say we're going in the next video 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.640
 until next time
