 the cruelty of pain is much greater 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.989

 they are part of the ecological balance of the place where they live

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.979
 your capture can drive them 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.370
 irremediably to the exhibition 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.640

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.710
 very little activity 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.710
 we will be contributing to its conservation 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.090
 hard in a home 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.650

 of a room 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.509
 some animals live in pairs 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.979
 and others are in fifteen of integrity 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.139
 for this reason 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:17.049
 to separate them and confine them to a cage would bring their sadness 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:20.329
 unwittingly

 the case is unknown feeding their animals 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.320
 in many occasions it is that we seek diseases or death 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.390
 for giving them 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.390
 an inadequate diet 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.709
 many wild animals are territory 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.079
 so they require minimal spaces to survive 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:48.429
