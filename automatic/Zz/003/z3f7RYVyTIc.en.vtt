00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
want to talk about what cell therapy is

want to talk about what cell therapy is
all<00:00:23.789> about<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.240> we're<00:00:24.330> going<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.480> show<00:00:24.779> some

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
all about and we're going to show some

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.390 
all about and we're going to show some
video<00:00:25.199> here<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.800> just<00:00:25.980> want<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.189> let<00:00:26.279> people

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
video here and I just want to let people

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.710 
video here and I just want to let people
know<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.670> those<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.300> might<00:00:27.420> be<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.599> little

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
know that those that might be a little

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.540 
know that those that might be a little
squeamish<00:00:28.080> when<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.439> comes<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.830> shots<00:00:29.070> you

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
squeamish when it comes to shots you

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.009 
squeamish when it comes to shots you
might<00:00:29.670> want<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.820> divert<00:00:30.090> your<00:00:30.300> eyes<00:00:30.480> because

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
might want to divert your eyes because

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.240 
might want to divert your eyes because
it<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.289> be<00:00:31.439> it's<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.710> little<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.219> little

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
it can be it's a little it's a little

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.910 
it can be it's a little it's a little
explicit<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:33.719> think<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.140> really

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
explicit but I do think it really

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.010 
explicit but I do think it really
demonstrates<00:00:35.100> what<00:00:36.030> cell<00:00:36.329> therapy<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.809> all

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
demonstrates what cell therapy is all

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.240 
demonstrates what cell therapy is all
about<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.410> while<00:00:37.559> we'll<00:00:37.710> watch<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.070> why<00:00:38.190> don't

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
about so while we'll watch you why don't

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.920 
about so while we'll watch you why don't
you<00:00:38.370> describe<00:00:38.730> before<00:00:38.940> cell<00:00:39.390> therapy<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
you describe before cell therapy is the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.750 
you describe before cell therapy is the
term<00:00:40.200> that's<00:00:40.350> been<00:00:40.559> developed<00:00:41.100> when<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.430> use

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
term that's been developed when we use

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.979 
term that's been developed when we use
your<00:00:42.120> own<00:00:42.360> cells<00:00:42.890> to<00:00:43.890> address<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.850> disease<00:00:45.600> or

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
your own cells to address a disease or

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.869 
your own cells to address a disease or
injury<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.210> in<00:00:48.210> particular<00:00:48.570> what<00:00:48.960> we<00:00:49.079> do<00:00:49.320> is

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
injury and in particular what we do is

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.459 
injury and in particular what we do is
we<00:00:50.879> do<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> small<00:00:51.360> amount<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.690> liposuction<00:00:51.840> or

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
we do a small amount of liposuction or

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.340 
we do a small amount of liposuction or
local<00:00:52.800> anesthesia<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.760> harvest<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.570> small

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
local anesthesia and we harvest a small

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.979 
local anesthesia and we harvest a small
number<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.829> fat<00:00:55.980> cells<00:00:56.210> we<00:00:57.210> then<00:00:57.539> take<00:00:57.930> that

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
number of fat cells we then take that

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.439 
number of fat cells we then take that
sample<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.219> do<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> little<00:00:59.640> bit<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.940> processing

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
sample and do a little bit of processing

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.750 
sample and do a little bit of processing
and<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.899> isolate<00:01:01.440> out<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.129> two<00:01:02.520> things

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
and we isolate out of that two things

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.390 
and we isolate out of that two things
the<00:01:03.510> both<00:01:03.750> factors<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.559> stem<00:01:04.799> cells<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
the both factors in the stem cells and

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.230 
the both factors in the stem cells and
that<00:01:06.290> collection<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.860> gathering<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.030> growth

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
that collection that gathering of growth

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.660 
that collection that gathering of growth
factors<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.810> stem<00:01:10.200> cells<00:01:10.470> has<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> name<00:01:11.070> that

folks<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.090> google<00:01:12.360> at<00:01:12.510> home<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:12.990> called

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
folks can google at home it's called

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.429 
folks can google at home it's called
stromal<00:01:13.799> vascular<00:01:14.460> fraction<00:01:15.000> or<00:01:15.150> SPF<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.320> you

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
stromal vascular fraction or SPF and you

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.350 
stromal vascular fraction or SPF and you
can<00:01:16.560> actually<00:01:16.799> Google<00:01:16.950> SPF<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.090> get<00:01:18.180> some

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
can actually Google SPF and get some

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.840 
can actually Google SPF and get some
information<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:19.200> what<00:01:19.860> we're<00:01:20.070> actually<00:01:20.310> using

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
information on what we're actually using

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.830 
information on what we're actually using
because<00:01:21.210> that's<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.630> product<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.320> has<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
because that's the product that has the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.240 
because that's the product that has the
features<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.869> we<00:01:25.229> want<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.500> use<00:01:25.710> well<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.189> I

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
features that we want to use well and I

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.560 
features that we want to use well and I
think<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:26.580> also<00:01:26.729> important<00:01:27.270> when<00:01:27.420> people

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
think it's also important when people

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.170 
think it's also important when people
hear<00:01:28.140> stem<00:01:28.650> cell<00:01:29.009> there<00:01:29.490> are<00:01:29.520> immediately

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
hear stem cell there are immediately

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.490 
hear stem cell there are immediately
there's<00:01:30.360> there's<00:01:30.570> like<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.200> sometimes

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
there's there's like that can sometimes

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.819 
there's there's like that can sometimes
be<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.799> polarizing<00:01:32.720> idea<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:34.229> what<00:01:34.590> you're

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
be a polarizing idea but what you're

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.190 
be a polarizing idea but what you're
doing<00:01:35.159> here<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.460> actually<00:01:35.970> removing<00:01:36.540> your<00:01:36.990> own

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
doing here is actually removing your own

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.649 
doing here is actually removing your own
cells<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.430> lot<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.880> interest<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.509> lot<00:01:39.630> of

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
cells a lot of interest and a lot of

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.080 
cells a lot of interest and a lot of
controversy<00:01:40.470> about<00:01:40.680> stem<00:01:41.220> cells<00:01:41.520> right<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
controversy about stem cells right the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.870 
controversy about stem cells right the
interest<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.990> because<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.189> their<00:01:44.460> potential

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
interest is because of their potential

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.810 
interest is because of their potential
stem<00:01:45.750> cells<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.200> two<00:01:46.590> really<00:01:47.250> unique

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
stem cells have two really unique

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.510 
stem cells have two really unique
features<00:01:48.270> one<00:01:48.780> they<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.100> ability<00:01:50.159> to

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
features one they have the ability to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520 
features one they have the ability to
become<00:01:50.610> other<00:01:50.970> types<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.479> cells<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.320> take

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
become other types of cells so if I take

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.679 
become other types of cells so if I take
a<00:01:52.560> fat<00:01:52.890> cell<00:01:53.189> that's<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.700> stem<00:01:53.939> cell<00:01:54.180> from<00:01:54.479> your

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
a fat cell that's a stem cell from your

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.260 
a fat cell that's a stem cell from your
own<00:01:54.810> body<00:01:55.049> become<00:01:55.590> muscle<00:01:56.460> cells<00:01:56.880> and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
own body become muscle cells and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.389 
own body become muscle cells and
cartilage<00:01:57.659> cells<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.350> lots<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.770> other<00:01:58.979> kinds

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
cartilage cells and lots of other kinds

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.039 
cartilage cells and lots of other kinds
of<00:01:59.490> cells<00:01:59.729> that's<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.390> really<00:02:00.750> exciting

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
of cells that's a really exciting

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.039 
of cells that's a really exciting
potential<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.159> other<00:02:02.340> potential<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.210> stem

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
potential the other potential that stem

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.740 
potential the other potential that stem
cells<00:02:04.320> have<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.770> they<00:02:04.920> can<00:02:05.100> grow<00:02:05.280> more<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:06.270> just

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
cells have is they can grow more so just

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.559 
cells have is they can grow more so just
because<00:02:06.990> just<00:02:07.530> because<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.890> harvest<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.819> few<00:02:08.849> or

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
because just because I harvest a few or

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.990 
because just because I harvest a few or
we<00:02:09.840> actually<00:02:10.200> harvest<00:02:10.560> millions<00:02:10.979> but

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
we actually harvest millions but

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.640 
we actually harvest millions but
they<00:02:12.120> have<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.450> potential<00:02:12.960> to<00:02:13.230> grow<00:02:13.380> many

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
they have the potential to grow many

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.920 
they have the potential to grow many
more<00:02:13.980> that's<00:02:14.820> what<00:02:14.970> makes<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.300> exciting<00:02:15.390> has<00:02:15.900> a

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
more that's what makes it exciting has a

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.790 
more that's what makes it exciting has a
fantastic<00:02:16.590> ability<00:02:17.900> fantastic<00:02:18.900> potential

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
fantastic ability fantastic potential

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.250 
fantastic ability fantastic potential

that have been diseased or damaged and I
want<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.120> talk<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.330> little<00:02:24.480> bit<00:02:24.630> later<00:02:24.720> on<00:02:24.960> about

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
want to talk a little bit later on about

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.680 
want to talk a little bit later on about
really<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.490> potential<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.270> impact<00:02:27.630> that

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
really the potential and the impact that

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.940 
really the potential and the impact that
it<00:02:27.870> can<00:02:27.990> have<00:02:28.140> on<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.290> variety<00:02:28.500> of<00:02:28.800> different

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
it can have on a variety of different

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.800 
it can have on a variety of different
health<00:02:29.310> concerns<00:02:29.760> but<00:02:30.209> let's<00:02:30.420> talk<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.690> bit

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
health concerns but let's talk a bit

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.550 
health concerns but let's talk a bit
more<00:02:31.020> about<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.700> SVS<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.209> it<00:02:33.600> can<00:02:33.750> tell<00:02:33.959> and

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
more about the SVS and it can tell and

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.140 
more about the SVS and it can tell and
the<00:02:34.709> fact<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.190> contains<00:02:35.670> these<00:02:35.880> cells

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
the fact that it contains these cells

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.699 
the fact that it contains these cells
stem<00:02:36.570> cells<00:02:36.870> can<00:02:37.050> you<00:02:37.140> give<00:02:37.320> us<00:02:37.440> some<00:02:37.470> more

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
stem cells can you give us some more

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.160 
stem cells can you give us some more
insights<00:02:38.130> into<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.910> SVF<00:02:39.450> contains<00:02:39.870> two

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
insights into that the SVF contains two

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.780 
insights into that the SVF contains two
important<00:02:40.620> things<00:02:40.650> growth<00:02:41.100> factors<00:02:41.610> which

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
important things growth factors which

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.580 
important things growth factors which
are<00:02:41.970> our<00:02:42.120> body's<00:02:42.480> main<00:02:42.810> communicating

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
are our body's main communicating

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.770 
are our body's main communicating
proteins<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.340> that's<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.790> really<00:02:45.180> important

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
proteins and that's a really important

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.990 
proteins and that's a really important
factor<00:02:46.290> because<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.950> growth<00:02:47.190> factors<00:02:47.700> have<00:02:47.970> a

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
factor because the growth factors have a

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.100 
factor because the growth factors have a
dramatic<00:02:49.400> anti-inflammatory<00:02:50.400> effect<00:02:51.209> okay

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
dramatic anti-inflammatory effect okay

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.320 
dramatic anti-inflammatory effect okay
that's<00:02:52.440> number<00:02:52.680> one<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.220> other<00:02:53.400> piece<00:02:53.730> is<00:02:53.970> the

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
that's number one the other piece is the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.449 
that's number one the other piece is the
stem<00:02:54.570> cells<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.080> we're<00:02:55.590> talking<00:02:55.800> stem<00:02:56.190> cells

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
stem cells and we're talking stem cells

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.100 
stem cells and we're talking stem cells
that<00:02:56.580> we've<00:02:56.820> gotten<00:02:57.120> from<00:02:57.330> your<00:02:57.630> own<00:02:57.750> fat

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
that we've gotten from your own fat

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.500 
that we've gotten from your own fat
they're<00:02:58.650> not<00:02:58.860> from<00:02:59.340> embryos<00:02:59.820> they're<00:03:00.270> not

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
they're not from embryos they're not

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.800 
they're not from embryos they're not
from<00:03:01.110> other<00:03:01.500> persons<00:03:02.340> we<00:03:03.030> can<00:03:03.239> test<00:03:03.540> the

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
from other persons we can test the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.990 
from other persons we can test the
quality<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.560> cells<00:03:04.770> in<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.220> office<00:03:05.760> and

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
quality of the cells in the office and

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.970 
quality of the cells in the office and
make<00:03:06.120> sure<00:03:06.360> that<00:03:06.870> we<00:03:06.989> have<00:03:07.170> adequate<00:03:07.410> numbers

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
make sure that we have adequate numbers

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.530 
make sure that we have adequate numbers
and<00:03:08.489> that<00:03:08.670> they're<00:03:08.880> alive

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
and that they're alive

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.300 
and that they're alive
so<00:03:09.930> all<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.590> controversies<00:03:11.280> have

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
so all of the controversies have

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.940 
so all of the controversies have
surrounded<00:03:11.970> stem<00:03:12.180> cells<00:03:12.480> this<00:03:13.140> process<00:03:13.770> of

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
surrounded stem cells this process of

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.840 
surrounded stem cells this process of
giving<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.820> back<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:15.840> has<00:03:16.769> really<00:03:17.459> gotten

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
giving you back to you has really gotten

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.789 
giving you back to you has really gotten
around<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.540> controversy<00:03:19.110> I<00:03:19.290> think<00:03:19.650> that's

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
around the controversy I think that's

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.590 
around the controversy I think that's
great<00:03:20.010> it's<00:03:20.340> giving<00:03:20.640> you<00:03:20.820> back<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.269> you're<00:03:21.480> not

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
great it's giving you back to you're not

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.300 
great it's giving you back to you're not
pulling<00:03:21.989> it<00:03:22.230> from<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.560> secondary<00:03:22.980> source

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
pulling it from a secondary source

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.759 
pulling it from a secondary source
you're<00:03:23.820> pulling<00:03:24.150> your<00:03:24.269> own<00:03:24.480> stem<00:03:24.900> cells<00:03:24.930> so

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
you're pulling your own stem cells so

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.860 
you're pulling your own stem cells so
now<00:03:25.980> let's<00:03:26.280> talk<00:03:26.489> about<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:27.180> impact<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.690> it

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
now let's talk about the impact that it

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.780 
now let's talk about the impact that it
can<00:03:27.900> have<00:03:28.080> on<00:03:28.590> different<00:03:28.950> medical<00:03:29.459> issues

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
can have on different medical issues

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.940 
can have on different medical issues
well<00:03:29.970> we<00:03:30.420> have<00:03:30.570> we're<00:03:31.110> working<00:03:31.470> under<00:03:31.739> an

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
well we have we're working under an

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.710 
well we have we're working under an
investigational<00:03:32.730> Review<00:03:32.790> Board<00:03:33.330> which<00:03:33.690> is

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
investigational Review Board which is

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.500 
investigational Review Board which is
real<00:03:34.080> important<00:03:34.590> because<00:03:34.620> this<00:03:35.190> is

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
real important because this is

very<00:03:48.690> good<00:03:48.900> candidates<00:03:49.350> for<00:03:49.440> this<00:03:49.739> we<00:03:50.489> have

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
very good candidates for this we have

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.410 
very good candidates for this we have
protocols<00:03:51.360> for<00:03:51.920> some<00:03:52.920> disorders<00:03:53.489> like<00:03:53.519> anti
