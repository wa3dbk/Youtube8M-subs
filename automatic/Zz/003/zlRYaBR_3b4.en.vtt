they are an energy core the power cord

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.630 
they are an energy core the power cord
they<00:01:59.600> bring<00:01:59.900> the<00:02:00.140> energy<00:02:00.320> of<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.950> sunlight

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
they bring the energy of the sunlight

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.720 
they bring the energy of the sunlight

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
the salmon back the problem is solved

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.199 
the salmon back the problem is solved
but<00:02:34.820> it's<00:02:35.540> not<00:02:35.780> if<00:02:36.170> we<00:02:36.470> knew<00:02:37.040> why<00:02:37.459> there<00:02:37.970> was<00:02:38.090> so

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
but it's not if we knew why there was so

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.720 
but it's not if we knew why there was so
many<00:02:38.270> fish<00:02:38.510> this<00:02:38.690> year<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:39.800> few<00:02:40.010> last<00:02:40.310> year

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
many fish this year and so few last year

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.180 
many fish this year and so few last year
problem<00:02:41.600> would<00:02:41.750> be<00:02:41.780> solved<00:02:42.320> but<00:02:43.070> we're

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
problem would be solved but we're

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.070 
problem would be solved but we're
running<00:02:43.340> blind<00:02:43.820> right<00:02:44.120> now<00:02:44.300> we<00:02:44.360> have<00:02:44.630> no<00:02:44.840> idea

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
running blind right now we have no idea

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.590 
running blind right now we have no idea
why<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:45.709> many<00:02:45.830> fish<00:02:46.100> came<00:02:46.370> back<00:02:46.610> but<00:02:47.300> we<00:02:47.420> do

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
why so many fish came back but we do

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.480 
why so many fish came back but we do
know<00:02:47.840> though<00:02:48.110> is<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.770> river<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.220> fish

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
know though is the river and the fish

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.210 
know though is the river and the fish
can<00:02:50.240> still<00:02:50.540> survive<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.410> ocean<00:02:51.800> is<00:02:51.920> giving

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
can still survive the ocean is giving

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.000 
can still survive the ocean is giving
them<00:02:52.370> food<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.940> it's<00:02:53.720> up<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:53.900> us<00:02:54.020> if<00:02:54.500> we<00:02:54.800> want

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
them food and it's up to us if we want

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:14.430 
them food and it's up to us if we want
to<00:02:55.100> have<00:02:55.250> this<00:02:55.430> happen<00:02:55.490> every<00:02:55.940> four<00:02:56.300> years

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.680 

they<00:03:15.440> have<00:03:15.740> proven<00:03:16.190> without<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.670> doubt<00:03:16.970> that

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
they have proven without a doubt that

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.830 
they have proven without a doubt that
fish<00:03:18.260> farms<00:03:18.620> do<00:03:18.890> kill<00:03:19.250> juvenile<00:03:20.150> salmon<00:03:20.630> swim

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
fish farms do kill juvenile salmon swim

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.840

and<00:03:21.200> when<00:03:21.350> they<00:03:21.440> go<00:03:21.590> up<00:03:21.770> and<00:03:22.310> not<00:03:22.520> only<00:03:22.700> that

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
and when they go up and not only that

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.200 
and when they go up and not only that
they<00:03:23.270> destroy<00:03:23.690> a<00:03:23.720> lot<00:03:23.990> of<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.730> other<00:03:25.730> marine
