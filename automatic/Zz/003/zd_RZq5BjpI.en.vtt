not my favorite I don't really dislike
it<00:01:15.240> but<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:15.869> certainly<00:01:16.140> not<00:01:16.320> one<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.500> my

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
it but it's it's certainly not one of my

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.210 
it but it's it's certainly not one of my
favorite<00:01:17.040> maps<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.900> I<00:01:18.900> don't<00:01:19.619> die<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> lot<00:01:20.100> in

this<00:01:20.280> match<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.450> thought<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.750> would<00:01:22.049> be<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
this match and I thought that would be a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.070 
this match and I thought that would be a
good<00:01:23.700> reason<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.180> post<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.570> up<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:24.930> not

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
good reason to post this up it's not

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.260 
good reason to post this up it's not
it's<00:01:25.350> not<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.619> most<00:01:25.830> kills<00:01:26.189> you're<00:01:26.850> gonna<00:01:26.939> see

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
it's not the most kills you're gonna see

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.530 
it's not the most kills you're gonna see
from<00:01:27.540> me<00:01:27.689> certainly<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.159> think<00:01:29.850> trying<00:01:30.390> to

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
from me certainly but I think trying to

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.030 
from me certainly but I think trying to
give<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.810> guys<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> little<00:01:31.229> bit<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.650> better

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
give you guys a little bit of a better

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.039 
give you guys a little bit of a better
idea<00:01:32.220> how<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.520> survive<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.210> map<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.479> is

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
idea how to survive on this map is is

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.170 
idea how to survive on this map is is
more<00:01:34.380> important<00:01:34.890> than<00:01:35.100> posting<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.850> match<00:01:36.000> with

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
more important than posting a match with

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.880 
more important than posting a match with
a<00:01:36.210> ton<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.450> kills<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.900> lot<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.079> deaths<00:01:37.350> so

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
a ton of kills and a lot of deaths so

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.310 
a ton of kills and a lot of deaths so
where<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.369> saw<00:01:38.520> me<00:01:38.549> back<00:01:38.880> there<00:01:39.229> it's<00:01:40.229> a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
where you just saw me back there it's a

six<00:03:18.720> on<00:03:18.840> six<00:03:19.110> team<00:03:19.380> deathmatch<00:03:19.769> especially

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
six on six team deathmatch especially

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.970 
six on six team deathmatch especially
when<00:03:20.489> there's<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:20.700> lot<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:20.910> buildings<00:03:21.709> you<00:03:22.709> want

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
when there's a lot of buildings you want

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.680 
when there's a lot of buildings you want

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
to take scavenger pro in your claymores

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.170

and<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.320> want<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.920> get<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.250> entrances<00:03:26.790> you

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
and you want to get the entrances you

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.610 
and you want to get the entrances you
don't<00:03:27.360> want<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.570> place<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.780> Claymore<00:03:28.440> right

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
see it and avoid it and you know we

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.520 
see it and avoid it and you know we
really<00:03:52.500> don't<00:03:52.890> want<00:03:53.130> that<00:03:53.250> at<00:03:53.310> all<00:03:54.500> yeah<00:03:55.500> I

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
really don't want that at all yeah I

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.170 
really don't want that at all yeah I
know<00:03:55.650> another<00:03:56.250> chopper<00:03:56.519> gunner<00:03:56.790> gameplay

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
know another chopper gunner gameplay

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.170 
know another chopper gunner gameplay
here<00:03:57.360> this<00:03:57.540> was<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:58.280> think<00:03:59.280> I<00:03:59.400> was<00:03:59.549> trying<00:04:00.120> to

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
here this was I think I was trying to

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.539 
here this was I think I was trying to
finish<00:04:00.420> this<00:04:00.630> prestige<00:04:01.110> so<00:04:01.380> i<00:04:01.410> was<00:04:01.680> using<00:04:02.250> some

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
finish this prestige so i was using some

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.000 
finish this prestige so i was using some
of<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.700> higher<00:04:03.090> killstreaks<00:04:03.660> a<00:04:03.780> lot<00:04:03.930> here

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010

one<00:04:06.010> thing<00:04:06.189> you'll<00:04:06.310> notice<00:04:06.430> about<00:04:06.579> bailout<00:04:07.030> is

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
one thing you'll notice about bailout is

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.910 
one thing you'll notice about bailout is
it<00:04:07.510> is<00:04:07.629> dominated<00:04:08.260> by<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.409> two<00:04:08.709> long

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
it is dominated by the two long

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.550 
it is dominated by the two long

ac-130 so I did that I came back up here
I<00:04:41.350> picked<00:04:41.650> out<00:04:41.770> my<00:04:41.919> m16<00:04:42.460> and<00:04:43.090> like<00:04:43.840> I<00:04:43.960> said<00:04:44.020> at

sight the m16 with holographic sight is

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.279 
sight the m16 with holographic sight is
