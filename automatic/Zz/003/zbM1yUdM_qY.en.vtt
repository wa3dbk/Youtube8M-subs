00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
and it's using something called the

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.740 
and it's using something called the
random<00:00:46.329> effector<00:00:46.870> cinema<00:00:47.350> 4d<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:48.670> yeah<00:00:49.480> okay

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
random effector cinema 4d but yeah okay

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.529 
random effector cinema 4d but yeah okay
so<00:00:49.809> it's<00:00:50.079> going<00:00:50.230> to<00:00:50.320> sit<00:00:50.469> him<00:00:50.590> a<00:00:50.620> four<00:00:50.829> day<00:00:51.010> oh

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
so it's going to sit him a four day oh

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.650 
so it's going to sit him a four day oh
no<00:00:52.539> and<00:00:53.699> what<00:00:54.699> you<00:00:54.789> want<00:00:54.940> to<00:00:54.969> do<00:00:55.180> is<00:00:55.480> you<00:00:55.539> want

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
no and what you want to do is you want

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.650 
no and what you want to do is you want
to<00:00:55.809> make<00:00:55.870> a<00:00:55.989> text<00:00:56.469> object<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:58.149> want<00:00:58.270> to<00:00:58.420> rotate

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
to make a text object you want to rotate

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:05.510 
to make a text object you want to rotate
the<00:00:58.899> camera<00:00:59.079> a<00:00:59.289> bit<00:00:59.379> and<00:01:02.850> let's<00:01:03.850> change<00:01:04.780> it<00:01:04.989> to

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
the camera a bit and let's change it to

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:12.560 
the camera a bit and let's change it to
this<00:01:06.520> one<00:01:07.530> Batman<00:01:09.060> make<00:01:10.060> a<00:01:10.090> bit<00:01:10.330> deeper<00:01:10.570> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
this one Batman make a bit deeper and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.289 
this one Batman make a bit deeper and
scroll<00:01:13.570> its<00:01:13.840> Steve<00:01:14.320> right<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.520> next<00:01:19.060> thing

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
scroll its Steve right and so next thing

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.120 
scroll its Steve right and so next thing
you<00:01:19.479> want<00:01:19.659> to<00:01:19.780> do<00:01:20.080> is<00:01:20.380> you<00:01:22.500> up<00:01:23.500> to<00:01:23.680> here<00:01:23.890> come<00:01:24.009> to

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
you want to do is you up to here come to

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.999 
you want to do is you up to here come to
mow<00:01:24.340> grass<00:01:24.369> and<00:01:25.090> then<00:01:25.479> go<00:01:25.630> to<00:01:25.659> random<00:01:26.350> effector

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
mow grass and then go to random effector

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.969 
mow grass and then go to random effector
and<00:01:27.280> put<00:01:27.970> the<00:01:28.090> text<00:01:28.479> object<00:01:28.990> into<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.740> random

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
and put the text object into the random

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.240 
and put the text object into the random
effector<00:01:30.460> so<00:01:30.850> it<00:01:31.329> the<00:01:32.110> arrow<00:01:32.320> there<00:01:32.799> is<00:01:33.009> going

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
effector so it the arrow there is going

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.910 
effector so it the arrow there is going
down<00:01:33.579> not<00:01:33.970> will<00:01:34.150> not<00:01:34.180> like<00:01:34.450> that<00:01:34.630> and<00:01:34.900> down<00:01:35.140> now

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
down not will not like that and down now

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.010 
down not will not like that and down now
that<00:01:36.100> sure<00:01:36.280> makes<00:01:36.400> a<00:01:36.610> pair<00:01:36.939> that<00:01:37.509> makes<00:01:37.750> random

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
that sure makes a pair that makes random

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.020 
that sure makes a pair that makes random
effect<00:01:38.229> or<00:01:38.320> a<00:01:38.350> parent<00:01:38.860> but<00:01:38.920> here<00:01:39.549> which<00:01:39.700> have

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
effect or a parent but here which have

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.069 
effect or a parent but here which have
the<00:01:40.409> emotion<00:01:41.409> but<00:01:41.860> it's<00:01:41.979> a<00:01:42.040> bit<00:01:42.159> crap<00:01:42.549> and<00:01:43.079> what

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
the emotion but it's a bit crap and what

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:45.300 
the emotion but it's a bit crap and what
you<00:01:44.170> want<00:01:44.320> to<00:01:44.380> do<00:01:44.560> is<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:44.799> want<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:45.009> make<00:01:45.070> it<00:01:45.250> a

it's like a lot more crazy so but you
won't<00:01:53.979> you<00:01:54.130> want<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.399> keep<00:01:54.549> this<00:01:54.670> motion<00:01:55.119> need

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
won't you want to keep this motion need

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.620 
won't you want to keep this motion need
to<00:01:55.299> keyframe<00:01:55.540> so<00:01:56.320> we'll<00:01:57.070> go<00:01:57.369> to<00:01:57.430> zero<00:01:58.180> percent

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
to keyframe so we'll go to zero percent

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.719 
to keyframe so we'll go to zero percent
make<00:01:59.140> sure<00:01:59.320> they're<00:01:59.530> keyframe<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.520> time

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
make sure they're keyframe the time

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.899 
make sure they're keyframe the time
lines<00:02:00.969> up<00:02:01.119> 0%<00:02:01.810> then<00:02:02.740> you<00:02:02.829> want<00:02:03.009> to<00:02:03.070> just<00:02:03.219> hold

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
lines up 0% then you want to just hold

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.880 
lines up 0% then you want to just hold
down<00:02:04.000> control<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:04.630> hit<00:02:05.350> this<00:02:05.439> little<00:02:05.619> circle

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
down control and hit this little circle

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.940 
down control and hit this little circle
here<00:02:06.490> which<00:02:07.390> makes<00:02:07.509> it<00:02:07.659> red<00:02:07.930> and<00:02:08.470> you<00:02:08.739> want<00:02:08.890> to

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
here which makes it red and you want to

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.400 
here which makes it red and you want to
come<00:02:09.039> along<00:02:09.099> to<00:02:09.489> say<00:02:09.849> 90<00:02:10.300> frames<00:02:10.539> or<00:02:10.959> how<00:02:11.170> when

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
come along to say 90 frames or how when

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.610 
come along to say 90 frames or how when
is<00:02:11.590> you<00:02:11.680> need<00:02:11.830> timeline

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
is you need timeline

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.869 
is you need timeline
and<00:02:12.769> then<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:14.650> hundred<00:02:15.650> percent<00:02:15.739> there<00:02:16.129> till

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
and then a hundred percent there till

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.399 
and then a hundred percent there till
the<00:02:16.940> moment<00:02:17.090> it's<00:02:17.420> going<00:02:17.720> like<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.260> it's

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
the moment it's going like that so it's

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.220 
the moment it's going like that so it's
actually<00:02:18.560> moving<00:02:19.280> away<00:02:19.459> from<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.940> writing<00:02:20.480> if

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
actually moving away from the writing if

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.539 
actually moving away from the writing if
you<00:02:21.349> want<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:21.560> swap<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.860> around<00:02:21.920> just<00:02:22.280> actually

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
you want to swap it around just actually

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:33.880 
you want to swap it around just actually
swap<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.239> keyframes<00:02:29.440> yeah<00:02:30.489> so<00:02:31.489> but<00:02:32.890> what

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
swap the keyframes yeah so but what

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.369 
swap the keyframes yeah so but what
you've<00:02:34.250> got<00:02:34.370> all<00:02:34.459> these<00:02:34.579> different<00:02:35.079> mode<00:02:36.079> you

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
you've got all these different mode you

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.270 
you've got all these different mode you
can<00:02:36.409> do<00:02:36.860> so<00:02:37.159> you<00:02:37.220> can't<00:02:37.489> make<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:38.150> scale

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
can do so you can't make it to scale

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.220 
can do so you can't make it to scale
rotation<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.760> as<00:02:41.150> long<00:02:41.269> as<00:02:41.420> it's<00:02:41.540> on<00:02:41.599> 0%<00:02:42.170> you

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
rotation and as long as it's on 0% you

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.289 
rotation and as long as it's on 0% you
can<00:02:42.379> go<00:02:42.470> crazy<00:02:42.799> with<00:02:43.099> s<00:02:43.220> you<00:02:43.370> mean<00:02:43.519> put<00:02:44.150> them

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
can go crazy with s you mean put them

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.089 
can go crazy with s you mean put them
all<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.569> way<00:02:44.660> over<00:02:44.840> there<00:02:44.870> all<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.829> way<00:02:45.890> down

like<00:02:57.829> to<00:02:58.099> add<00:02:58.609> a<00:02:58.670> rotation<00:02:58.970> and<00:03:00.069> scale<00:03:01.069> and

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
like to add a rotation and scale and

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.800 
like to add a rotation and scale and
kind<00:03:03.349> of<00:03:03.409> just<00:03:03.560> make<00:03:04.280> it<00:03:04.310> look<00:03:04.519> really

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
abstract but give a rotation it kind of

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.539 
abstract but give a rotation it kind of
makes<00:03:08.989> it<00:03:09.230> really<00:03:09.500> crazy<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:10.370> like<00:03:10.549> this<00:03:11.269> I

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
could just have the optical flares or

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.369 
could just have the optical flares or
your<00:03:34.250> textures<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.540> don't<00:03:35.870> know<00:03:35.959> whatever<00:03:36.200> you
