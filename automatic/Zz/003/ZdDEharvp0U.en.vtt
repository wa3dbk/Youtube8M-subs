you know as expected we got some

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.780 
you know as expected we got some
feedback<00:00:08.990> from<00:00:09.469> some<00:00:09.710> traditional<00:00:09.830> squaring

feedback from some traditional squaring

feedback from some traditional squaring
shooters<00:00:11.090> saying<00:00:11.809> that<00:00:11.930> some<00:00:12.049> of<00:00:12.139> the

shooters saying that some of the

shooters saying that some of the
close-quarter<00:00:12.889> shooting<00:00:13.639> techniques<00:00:13.940> we

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
close-quarter shooting techniques we

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.480 
close-quarter shooting techniques we
were<00:00:14.150> demonstrating<00:00:14.690> weren't<00:00:15.290> safe<00:00:15.590> well<00:00:16.340> in

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
were demonstrating weren't safe well in

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.580 
were demonstrating weren't safe well in
fact<00:00:16.580> they<00:00:16.730> were<00:00:16.790> safe<00:00:17.180> but<00:00:17.840> they<00:00:18.170> just<00:00:18.349> didn't

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
fact they were safe but they just didn't

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.170 
fact they were safe but they just didn't
appear<00:00:18.950> to<00:00:19.040> be<00:00:19.130> safe<00:00:19.340> to<00:00:19.700> the<00:00:19.730> traditional

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
appear to be safe to the traditional

appear to be safe to the traditional
shooters<00:00:20.920> the<00:00:21.920> particular<00:00:22.340> technique<00:00:22.670> that

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
shooters the particular technique that

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.640 
shooters the particular technique that
we<00:00:22.880> got<00:00:23.000> feedback<00:00:23.270> about<00:00:23.420> was<00:00:24.170> the<00:00:24.289> one<00:00:24.439> where

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
we got feedback about was the one where

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.519 
we got feedback about was the one where
we<00:00:24.710> advocated<00:00:25.720> throwing<00:00:26.720> your<00:00:26.840> hand<00:00:27.109> up<00:00:27.289> here

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
we advocated throwing your hand up here

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.089 
we advocated throwing your hand up here
simulating<00:00:28.310> a<00:00:28.490> punch<00:00:29.320> blow<00:00:30.320> to<00:00:30.380> the<00:00:30.560> to<00:00:31.010> the

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
hand up here perhaps grabbing the

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.759 
hand up here perhaps grabbing the
targets<00:00:35.480> and<00:00:35.600> if<00:00:35.690> it's<00:00:35.780> flimsy<00:00:36.080> at<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.559> same

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
targets and if it's flimsy at the same

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.250 
targets and if it's flimsy at the same
time<00:00:37.010> you've<00:00:37.549> draw<00:00:37.760> your<00:00:37.940> gun<00:00:38.089> and<00:00:38.930> with<00:00:39.199> the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
time you've draw your gun and with the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.990 
time you've draw your gun and with the
muzzle<00:00:39.470> pointing<00:00:39.979> away<00:00:40.129> from<00:00:40.549> your<00:00:40.820> hand

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
muzzle pointing away from your hand

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.210 
muzzle pointing away from your hand
obviously<00:00:41.449> you<00:00:42.320> take<00:00:42.440> a<00:00:42.500> shot<00:00:42.769> and<00:00:42.949> the<00:00:43.040> shot

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
obviously you take a shot and the shot

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.579 
obviously you take a shot and the shot
usually<00:00:43.489> goes<00:00:43.580> around<00:00:43.760> here<00:00:43.970> somewhere<00:00:44.589> now

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
usually goes around here somewhere now

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.310 
usually goes around here somewhere now
if<00:00:45.710> you<00:00:45.799> recall<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.250> way<00:00:46.460> we<00:00:46.640> taught<00:00:46.909> this<00:00:47.320> was

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
if you recall the way we taught this was

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.829 
if you recall the way we taught this was
a<00:00:48.350> progression<00:00:49.059> we<00:00:50.059> started<00:00:50.510> out<00:00:50.600> by<00:00:50.720> going

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
a progression we started out by going

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.479 
a progression we started out by going
hand<00:00:51.500> forward<00:00:52.299> hand<00:00:53.299> on<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.479> gun<00:00:54.369> bring<00:00:55.369> the

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
hand forward hand on the gun bring the

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.560 
hand forward hand on the gun bring the
gun<00:00:55.640> to<00:00:55.790> the<00:00:55.879> shooting<00:00:56.119> position<00:00:56.540> look<00:00:57.519> look

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
gun to the shooting position look look

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.509 
gun to the shooting position look look
make<00:00:59.570> sure<00:00:59.600> at<00:01:00.589> the<00:01:00.650> hand<00:01:00.949> and<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.129> muzzle<00:01:01.309> are

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
make sure at the hand and the muzzle are

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.100 
make sure at the hand and the muzzle are
in<00:01:01.610> different<00:01:01.820> places<00:01:01.970> or<00:01:02.210> point<00:01:02.479> in<00:01:02.750> places

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
in different places or point in places

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.649 
in different places or point in places
then<00:01:03.920> you<00:01:04.070> pull<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:04.309> trigger<00:01:04.460> and<00:01:04.729> from<00:01:05.330> there

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
then you pull the trigger and from there

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.200 
then you pull the trigger and from there
we<00:01:06.470> built<00:01:06.680> up<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:07.280> doing<00:01:07.430> it<00:01:07.640> at<00:01:07.880> slightly

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
we built up to doing it at slightly

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.380 
we built up to doing it at slightly
higher<00:01:08.810> speeds<00:01:09.170> more<00:01:09.380> realistic<00:01:09.650> speeds<00:01:10.390> the

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
higher speeds more realistic speeds the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.910 
higher speeds more realistic speeds the
fact<00:01:11.660> is<00:01:11.810> this<00:01:11.960> is<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.170> safe<00:01:12.380> technique<00:01:12.740> when

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
fact is this is a safe technique when

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.760 
fact is this is a safe technique when
you<00:01:13.010> do<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.370> way<00:01:13.460> we<00:01:13.640> teach<00:01:13.820> him<00:01:14.560> yes<00:01:15.560> your

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
you do it the way we teach him yes your

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.470 
you do it the way we teach him yes your
hand<00:01:15.920> is<00:01:16.010> in<00:01:16.100> front<00:01:16.130> of<00:01:16.310> a<00:01:16.370> muscle<00:01:16.640> on<00:01:16.790> the

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
hand is in front of a muscle on the
