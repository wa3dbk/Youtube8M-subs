00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
make it look cool but sadly fire can

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.390 
make it look cool but sadly fire can
still<00:01:24.900> catch<00:01:25.409> things<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.799> fire<00:01:25.979> even<00:01:26.280> if

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
still catch things on fire even if

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
there's blocks between it so I didn't

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.880 
there's blocks between it so I didn't
really<00:01:29.280> get<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.640> go<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.030> my<00:01:30.210> full<00:01:30.619> like<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
really get to go to my full like the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.350

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
build like in terms of detail because

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.280 
build like in terms of detail because
the<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.150> game<00:01:36.360> limitations<00:01:36.900> wouldn't<00:01:37.110> allow

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
then you can use whatever material you

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.630 
then you can use whatever material you
want<00:01:40.049> but<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.560> assume<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.009> lot<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.250> people<00:01:41.340> like

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.639 
to play with it on for the realistic
part<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.270> i<00:01:45.390> guess<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:45.659> like<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.470> feels

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
part of it i guess like like it feels

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.870 
part of it i guess like like it feels
kind<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:46.920> cheating<00:01:47.340> if<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.460> don't<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.850> it

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
kind of cheating if you don't have it

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.760 
kind of cheating if you don't have it
out<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.149> don't<00:01:48.390> know<00:01:48.450> honestly<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.500> like<00:01:49.649> I

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
out I don't know honestly but like I

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.380 
out I don't know honestly but like I
said<00:01:49.829> if<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.490> play<00:01:50.700> with<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.909> off<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.240> can

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
said if you play with it off you can

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.170 
said if you play with it off you can
make<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.720> whatever<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.170> want<00:01:52.439> but<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.670> me<00:01:53.909> I

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
make this whatever you want but to me I

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.600 
make this whatever you want but to me I
really<00:01:54.960> didn't<00:01:55.619> get<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.860> go<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.189> full

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
really didn't get to go to the full

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.030 
really didn't get to go to the full
extent<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.180> what<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.360> want<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.689> do<00:01:57.840> due<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.799> what

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
extent of what I want to do due to what

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.380 
extent of what I want to do due to what
the<00:01:59.130> game<00:01:59.280> would<00:01:59.399> allow<00:01:59.610> me<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.820> do<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.299> guys

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the game would allow me to do you guys

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.870 
the game would allow me to do you guys
understand<00:02:00.869> what<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.020> mean<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.310> it's<00:02:02.850> a

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
understand what I mean and I it's a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.429 
understand what I mean and I it's a
pretty<00:02:03.090> simple<00:02:03.420> build<00:02:03.810> honestly<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.380> just

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
pretty simple build honestly you just

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.590 
pretty simple build honestly you just
have<00:02:04.649> like<00:02:04.829> three<00:02:05.189> little<00:02:05.340> sections<00:02:05.939> got<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
have like three little sections got the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.089 
have like three little sections got the
glass<00:02:06.840> blocks<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.439> may<00:02:07.560> be<00:02:07.619> like<00:02:07.799> what<00:02:07.979> are

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
glass blocks you may be like what are

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.979 
glass blocks you may be like what are
those<00:02:08.220> but<00:02:08.610> it's<00:02:08.729> like<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.970> put<00:02:09.179> carpet<00:02:09.810> on

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
those but it's like you put carpet on

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.449 
those but it's like you put carpet on
top<00:02:10.229> just<00:02:10.470> cuz<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.739> looks<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.950> little<00:02:11.069> neat<00:02:11.310> and

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
top just cuz it looks a little neat and

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.980 
top just cuz it looks a little neat and
they<00:02:11.520> put<00:02:11.730> some<00:02:11.849> slabs<00:02:12.150> up

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
they put some slabs up

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.210 
they put some slabs up
run<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.350> that's<00:02:13.650> pretty<00:02:13.800> much<00:02:13.890> where<00:02:14.130> you

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
run and that's pretty much where you

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.460 
run and that's pretty much where you
would<00:02:14.310> sit<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:15.240> it's<00:02:15.630> just<00:02:15.780> like<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.930> cool<00:02:16.200> room

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
would sit and it's just like a cool room

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.920 
would sit and it's just like a cool room
I<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.730> feel<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.450> think<00:02:18.660> I

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
I like that the feel of it I think I

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.970 
I like that the feel of it I think I
definitely<00:02:19.170> look<00:02:19.350> better<00:02:19.410> if<00:02:19.740> it<00:02:19.830> was<00:02:19.890> like

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
definitely look better if it was like

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.440 
definitely look better if it was like
spruce<00:02:20.310> wouldn't<00:02:20.700> add<00:02:20.820> more<00:02:21.030> color<00:02:21.180> it's

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
spruce wouldn't add more color it's

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.780 
spruce wouldn't add more color it's
really<00:02:21.660> gray<00:02:22.020> so<00:02:22.860> that's<00:02:22.980> that's<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.640> only

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
really gray so that's that's the only

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.250 
really gray so that's that's the only
downside<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.390> but<00:02:24.600> like<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.840> said<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.050> didn't

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
downside to it but like I said I didn't

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.080 
downside to it but like I said I didn't
have<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.410> lot<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.560> options<00:02:26.130> because<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.910> game

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
have a lot of options because the game

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.030 
have a lot of options because the game
wouldn't<00:02:27.360> allow<00:02:27.540> me<00:02:27.750> but<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.020> pretty<00:02:28.710> simple

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
wouldn't allow me but I pretty simple

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.470 
wouldn't allow me but I pretty simple
then<00:02:29.430> really<00:02:29.610> have<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.790> go<00:02:29.910> into<00:02:30.060> detail<00:02:30.360> to

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
then really have to go into detail to

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.580 
then really have to go into detail to
explain<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.930> guys<00:02:31.050> are<00:02:31.200> smart<00:02:31.350> enough<00:02:31.440> to
