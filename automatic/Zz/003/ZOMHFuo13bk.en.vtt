I'm going to use this pin blank to

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.680 
I'm going to use this pin blank to
illustrate<00:00:13.590> how<00:00:13.770> CA<00:00:14.070> glue<00:00:14.490> can<00:00:14.850> be<00:00:15.030> used<00:00:15.360> as<00:00:15.600> a

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
illustrate how CA glue can be used as a

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.250 
illustrate how CA glue can be used as a
wood<00:00:16.230> hardener<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.770> as<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.340> filler<00:00:18.260> this

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
wood hardener and as a filler this

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.190 
wood hardener and as a filler this
particular<00:00:19.740> piece<00:00:20.610> of<00:00:20.670> wood<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> very<00:00:21.689> soft

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
particular piece of wood is a very soft

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.830 
particular piece of wood is a very soft
spalted<00:00:22.980> maple<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:24.119> does<00:00:24.330> have<00:00:24.360> some

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
spalted maple and it does have some

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.279 
spalted maple and it does have some
voids<00:00:25.110> in<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.800> have<00:00:26.580> sanded<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.360> with<00:00:27.570> 150

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
voids in it I have sanded that with 150

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.939 
voids in it I have sanded that with 150
grit<00:00:28.530> I<00:00:29.210> choose<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.449> use<00:00:30.600> 150<00:00:31.380> because<00:00:31.740> it's

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
grit I choose to use 150 because it's

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.760 
grit I choose to use 150 because it's
faster<00:00:32.190> and<00:00:32.809> we'll<00:00:33.809> see<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.260> minute<00:00:34.410> why<00:00:34.710> it

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
faster and we'll see in a minute why it

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.830 
faster and we'll see in a minute why it
might<00:00:35.100> be<00:00:35.340> better<00:00:35.580> I'm<00:00:35.940> going<00:00:36.330> to<00:00:36.420> turn<00:00:36.629> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
might be better I'm going to turn the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.049 
might be better I'm going to turn the
lathe<00:00:37.020> down<00:00:37.350> slow<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.190> i'm<00:00:38.400> going<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.760> wet

lathe down slow and i'm going to wet
sand<00:00:39.420> with<00:00:39.690> CA<00:00:40.019> glue<00:00:40.400> we<00:00:41.400> have<00:00:41.610> two<00:00:41.820> choices<00:00:42.120> of

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
sand with CA glue we have two choices of

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.479 
sand with CA glue we have two choices of
where<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.809> go<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.470> glue<00:00:43.739> i<00:00:43.980> can<00:00:44.340> either

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
where to go with the glue i can either

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.630 
where to go with the glue i can either
use<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.910> superfast<00:00:45.780> glue<00:00:46.170> or<00:00:46.710> i<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:47.010> use<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
use the superfast glue or i can use the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.060 
use the superfast glue or i can use the
super<00:00:48.030> team<00:00:48.239> which<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.630> a<00:00:48.660> little<00:00:48.989> slower<00:00:49.350> so

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
super team which is a little slower so

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.819 
super team which is a little slower so
this<00:00:50.309> wood<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.820> fairly<00:00:51.180> open<00:00:51.360> i<00:00:51.989> am<00:00:52.440> going<00:00:52.710> to

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
this wood is fairly open i am going to

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.430 
this wood is fairly open i am going to
do<00:00:53.010> two<00:00:53.280> things<00:00:53.610> i<00:00:54.000> am<00:00:54.540> going<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.930> fill<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
do two things i am going to fill the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.069 
do two things i am going to fill the
wood<00:00:55.680> with<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.340> thin<00:00:56.670> because<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.480> penetrates

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
wood with the thin because it penetrates

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.530 
wood with the thin because it penetrates
more<00:00:58.379> deeply<00:00:58.829> into<00:00:59.040> the<00:00:59.280> wood<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.640> that<00:01:00.300> gives

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
more deeply into the wood and that gives

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.840 
more deeply into the wood and that gives
the<00:01:00.750> woods<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.230> hardness<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.920> then<00:01:02.579> i<00:01:02.730> am

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the woods and hardness and then i am

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.440 
the woods and hardness and then i am
going<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.239> wet<00:01:03.600> sand<00:01:04.160> with<00:01:05.160> the<00:01:05.190> 150<00:01:05.970> grit<00:01:06.180> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
going to wet sand with the 150 grit and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.859 
going to wet sand with the 150 grit and
the<00:01:06.600> thicker<00:01:06.869> CA<00:01:07.229> glue<00:01:07.729> my<00:01:08.729> preference<00:01:09.360> for<00:01:09.570> CA

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869

and then another piece is wrapped around

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.199 
and then another piece is wrapped around
it<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:23.490> something<00:01:23.789> to<00:01:23.970> hold

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:24.209 
it so that you have something to hold

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
a mild accelerator for the glue and we

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.520 
a mild accelerator for the glue and we
will<00:01:44.849> take<00:01:45.060> advantage<00:01:45.660> of<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.990> later<00:01:46.319> I<00:01:48.530> am

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
start down on that and make sure we have

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.420 
start down on that and make sure we have
good<00:02:13.280> glue<00:02:13.820> now<00:02:14.120> this<00:02:14.360> thin<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:14.930> going<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.430> be

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
good glue now this thin is going to be

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.970 
good glue now this thin is going to be
absorbed<00:02:16.850> into<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.480> wood<00:02:17.780> now<00:02:18.440> I'm<00:02:18.680> going<00:02:18.890> to

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
absorbed into the wood now I'm going to

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.160 
absorbed into the wood now I'm going to
take<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.340> paper<00:02:19.700> towel<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.450> wipe<00:02:20.690> off<00:02:20.959> the

take the paper towel and wipe off the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.440 
take the paper towel and wipe off the
excess<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.890> that<00:02:22.610> will<00:02:22.820> act<00:02:23.030> as<00:02:23.240> an

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
excess and that will act as an

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.400 
excess and that will act as an
accelerator<00:02:25.090> I'm<00:02:26.090> turning<00:02:26.630> this<00:02:26.750> lathe<00:02:27.050> very

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
accelerator I'm turning this lathe very

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.440 
accelerator I'm turning this lathe very
slow<00:02:27.800> because<00:02:27.830> I<00:02:28.400> don't<00:02:28.760> want<00:02:28.820> that<00:02:29.150> glue

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
slow because I don't want that glue

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.229 
being slung off in my face it will do
that<00:02:32.360> now<00:02:32.840> I'm<00:02:33.020> going<00:02:33.290> back<00:02:33.500> to<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.800> 150<00:02:34.459> grit

don't<00:02:42.020> use<00:02:42.230> an<00:02:42.410> accelerator<00:02:43.100> on<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:44.620> now<00:02:45.620> i'm

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
don't use an accelerator on it now i'm

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.180 
don't use an accelerator on it now i'm
going<00:02:46.070> to<00:02:46.190> put

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:59.170 

I<00:02:51.280> put<00:02:51.970> about<00:02:52.210> six<00:02:52.540> drops<00:02:52.840> on<00:02:53.140> there

get both pieces coated real quickly come
over<00:03:04.110> onto<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.440> dry<00:03:04.770> part<00:03:05.070> of<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.340> sandpaper

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
over onto the dry part of the sandpaper

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.970 
over onto the dry part of the sandpaper
make<00:03:08.310> up<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.670> slurry<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.300> that<00:03:10.290> slurry<00:03:10.680> is

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
going to be ground down into the holes

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.900 
going to be ground down into the holes
in<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.170> ward<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.740> act<00:03:13.980> as<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> green<00:03:14.550> filler

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
in the ward and act as a green filler

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.420 
in the ward and act as a green filler
you<00:03:15.750> know<00:03:15.900> under<00:03:16.080> some<00:03:16.260> stress<00:03:16.620> sandpaper

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
you know under some stress sandpaper

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.050 
you know under some stress sandpaper
again<00:03:17.990> I'm<00:03:18.990> using<00:03:19.100> 150<00:03:20.100> for<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.490> because<00:03:20.700> it

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
again I'm using 150 for this because it

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.080 
again I'm using 150 for this because it
generates<00:03:21.240> a<00:03:21.720> lot<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:22.040> sanding<00:03:23.040> dust<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.730> I

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
generates a lot of sanding dust and I

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.000 
generates a lot of sanding dust and I
want<00:03:24.330> that<00:03:24.480> sanding<00:03:25.050> dust<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.440> get<00:03:25.650> into<00:03:25.890> the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
want that sanding dust to get into the

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.620 
want that sanding dust to get into the
wood<00:03:28.340> then<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.460> can<00:03:29.640> take<00:03:29.820> my<00:03:30.000> paper<00:03:30.270> towel<00:03:30.600> and

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
wood then I can take my paper towel and

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.560 
wood then I can take my paper towel and
wipe<00:03:31.080> off<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.560> excess<00:03:32.030> only<00:03:33.030> reason<00:03:33.420> I'm

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
wipe off the excess only reason I'm

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.600 
wipe off the excess only reason I'm
doing<00:03:33.750> that<00:03:33.960> is<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.530> kind<00:03:34.770> of<00:03:34.830> cut<00:03:35.070> down<00:03:35.280> on<00:03:35.490> the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
doing that is to kind of cut down on the

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.210 
doing that is to kind of cut down on the
amount<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.940> sanding<00:03:36.420> required<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.200> it<00:03:38.010> does

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
amount of sanding required and it does

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.360 
amount of sanding required and it does
act<00:03:38.490> as<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.820> accelerator<00:03:39.830> now<00:03:40.830> I<00:03:40.860> said<00:03:41.190> don't

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
act as the accelerator now I said don't

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.240 
act as the accelerator now I said don't
use<00:03:41.670> an<00:03:41.850> accelerator<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:43.200> can<00:03:43.470> after<00:03:43.770> a<00:03:43.950> time

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
use an accelerator you can after a time

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.220 
use an accelerator you can after a time
is<00:03:44.490> gone<00:03:44.700> by<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.240> glue<00:03:45.450> has<00:03:45.660> started<00:03:46.110> to

is gone by and the glue has started to

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.280 
is gone by and the glue has started to
set<00:03:46.470> up<00:03:46.650> by<00:03:46.800> itself<00:03:47.190> now<00:03:47.940> i'm<00:03:48.209> using

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
set up by itself now i'm using

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.580 
set up by itself now i'm using
accelerator<00:03:49.290> just<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.740> pick<00:03:49.980> up<00:03:50.010> any<00:03:50.370> loose

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
accelerator just to pick up any loose

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.020 
accelerator just to pick up any loose
deposits<00:03:52.590> of<00:03:52.770> glue<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.340> they<00:03:53.400> have<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.700> pretty

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
deposits of glue that they have a pretty

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.910 
deposits of glue that they have a pretty
rough<00:03:54.270> surface<00:03:54.840> on<00:03:55.050> this<00:03:55.260> so<00:03:55.500> i'm<00:03:55.620> going<00:03:55.830> to

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
rough surface on this so i'm going to

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.360 
rough surface on this so i'm going to
pick<00:03:56.070> up<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.780> 150<00:03:57.780> grit<00:03:57.990> again<00:03:58.380> and<00:03:58.680> smooth

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
pick up the 150 grit again and smooth

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.300 
pick up the 150 grit again and smooth
that<00:03:59.640> down<00:03:59.670> you<00:04:00.380> don't<00:04:01.380> like<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.800> do<00:04:01.950> it<00:04:01.980> by<00:04:02.250> the

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
that down you don't like to do it by the

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.540 
that down you don't like to do it by the
wraparound<00:04:02.790> method<00:04:03.390> you<00:04:03.510> can<00:04:03.690> do<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:03.989> this<00:04:04.140> way

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
wraparound method you can do it this way

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.060 
wraparound method you can do it this way
and<00:04:05.550> now<00:04:06.060> we<00:04:06.120> have<00:04:06.570> a<00:04:06.810> piece<00:04:07.200> of<00:04:07.230> wood<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.650> has
