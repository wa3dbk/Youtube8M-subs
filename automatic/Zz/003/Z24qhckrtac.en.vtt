00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
users protect on the first turn and you

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.830

thought that he was going to do that so

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.889 
thought that he was going to do that so
that's<00:01:40.030> why<00:01:40.180> I<00:01:40.240> went<00:01:40.360> to<00:01:40.540> make<00:01:40.689> out<00:01:40.810> an

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
that's why I went to make out an

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.330 
that's why I went to make out an
