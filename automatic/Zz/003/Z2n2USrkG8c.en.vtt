image if you want to change the layering
effect<00:07:06.770> you<00:07:07.640> can<00:07:07.880> move<00:07:08.150> a<00:07:08.540> balloon<00:07:09.410> from<00:07:09.800> one

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.250 
effect you can move a balloon from one

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.570 
effect you can move a balloon from one
layer<00:07:10.520> to<00:07:11.140> another<00:07:12.140> layer<00:07:12.650> to<00:07:12.680> change<00:07:13.400> its

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:13.580 
layer to another layer to change its

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.510 
layer to another layer to change its
position<00:07:13.790> in<00:07:14.240> the<00:07:14.360> layer<00:07:14.540> panel<00:07:14.900> and<00:07:15.520> then

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 
position in the layer panel and then

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.950 
position in the layer panel and then
come<00:07:17.420> up<00:07:17.570> with<00:07:17.780> a<00:07:17.810> very<00:07:18.110> nice<00:07:18.430> composite<00:07:19.430> image

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960 
come up with a very nice composite image

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.630 
come up with a very nice composite image
this<00:07:20.960> is<00:07:21.170> a<00:07:21.200> technique<00:07:21.710> that<00:07:21.770> you<00:07:22.070> can<00:07:22.310> use

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:22.640 
this is a technique that you can use

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.870 
this is a technique that you can use
with<00:07:22.970> any<00:07:23.480> object<00:07:24.350> and<00:07:24.620> with<00:07:25.130> people<00:07:25.580> if<00:07:25.730> you

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:25.880 
with any object and with people if you

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.050 
with any object and with people if you
want<00:07:26.120> to<00:07:26.240> compose<00:07:26.630> an<00:07:26.870> image<00:07:27.320> that<00:07:27.620> shows<00:07:28.100> five

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:29.060 
want to compose an image that shows five

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.540 
want to compose an image that shows five
people<00:07:29.570> that<00:07:29.870> were<00:07:30.140> in<00:07:30.410> separate<00:07:30.770> photos<00:07:31.190> all

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:31.550 
people that were in separate photos all

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.090 
people that were in separate photos all
in<00:07:31.730> one<00:07:31.940> place<00:07:32.120> you<00:07:32.900> can<00:07:33.140> do<00:07:33.320> that<00:07:33.530> using<00:07:33.770> this

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:34.100 
in one place you can do that using this

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.640 
in one place you can do that using this
technique
