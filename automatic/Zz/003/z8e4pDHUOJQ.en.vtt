00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.420 
because it was picked up for seven book
series<00:02:04.080> publishing<00:02:05.080> situation<00:02:05.890> just<00:02:06.399> like

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
series publishing situation just like

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.609 
series publishing situation just like
harry<00:02:06.700> potter<00:02:06.940> was<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:07.660> I<00:02:08.200> think<00:02:08.440> it<00:02:08.530> has

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
harry potter was and I think it has

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.199 
harry potter was and I think it has
magic<00:02:09.070> in<00:02:09.160> it<00:02:09.250> so<00:02:09.489> this<00:02:09.640> book<00:02:09.850> is<00:02:09.940> set<00:02:10.119> in<00:02:10.179> the

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
magic in it so this book is set in the

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.180 
magic in it so this book is set in the
future<00:02:10.510> where<00:02:10.690> supernatural<00:02:11.019> abilities<00:02:11.890> are

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
future where supernatural abilities are

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.560 
future where supernatural abilities are
a<00:02:12.220> thing<00:02:13.000> in<00:02:13.299> people<00:02:13.720> but<00:02:14.070> they<00:02:15.070> are<00:02:15.570> illegal

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
a thing in people but they are illegal

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.509 
a thing in people but they are illegal
so<00:02:16.930> he<00:02:17.049> may<00:02:17.200> have<00:02:17.230> supernatural<00:02:17.590> abilities<00:02:17.920> is

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
so he may have supernatural abilities is

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.210 
so he may have supernatural abilities is
gonna<00:02:18.730> die<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.540> think<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:19.989> follows<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.860> girl

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
gonna die I think this follows a girl

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.940 
gonna die I think this follows a girl
who<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.820> clairvoyant<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.810> she's<00:02:23.799> doing
