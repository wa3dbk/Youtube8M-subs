this<00:00:54.329> cell<00:00:54.539> I'll<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.780> folding<00:00:55.379> together<00:00:56.250> there

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
this cell I'll be folding together there

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.470 
this cell I'll be folding together there
and<00:00:56.969> then<00:00:57.449> put<00:00:57.780> into<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.050> pastry<00:00:58.350> bag<00:00:59.210> for<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
and then put into a pastry bag for the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.429 
and then put into a pastry bag for the
assembly<00:01:00.960> then<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.750> raviolis<00:01:03.750> there's

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
assembly then of the raviolis there's

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.850 
assembly then of the raviolis there's
the<00:01:04.680> two<00:01:04.830> dies<00:01:05.040> ten<00:01:05.549> ten<00:01:06.000> each<00:01:06.320> in<00:01:07.320> there

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the two dies ten ten each in there

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.250 
the two dies ten ten each in there
pastas<00:01:08.340> cut<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.090> now<00:01:09.330> cheated<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> pasta

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
pastas cut and now cheated on a pasta

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.700 
pastas cut and now cheated on a pasta
sheet<00:01:10.560> er<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> fairly<00:01:12.150> exacting<00:01:12.630> size<00:01:12.869> and

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
sheet er to a fairly exacting size and

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.280 
sheet er to a fairly exacting size and
thickness<00:01:14.390> we're<00:01:15.390> trying<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> get<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.900> as<00:01:16.020> thin

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
thickness we're trying to get it as thin

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.640 
thickness we're trying to get it as thin
as<00:01:16.409> possible<00:01:16.950> without<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:18.320> being<00:01:19.320> over

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
as possible without it being over

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.109 
as possible without it being over
breaking<00:01:19.920> when<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> pasta<00:01:20.640> goes<00:01:20.790> into<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
breaking when the pasta goes into the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.840 
breaking when the pasta goes into the
water<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.680> nice<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.189> thin<00:01:23.430> probably

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
water so it it's nice and thin probably

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.370 
water so it it's nice and thin probably
goes<00:01:23.970> through<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.390> pasta<00:01:24.930> sheet<00:01:25.140> or<00:01:25.259> at

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
goes through that pasta sheet or at

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:39.380 
goes through that pasta sheet or at
least<00:01:25.590> eight<00:01:26.250> times<00:01:26.930> maybe<00:01:27.930> ten<00:01:28.229> times

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.870 

as<00:01:40.390> you<00:01:40.570> see<00:01:40.750> this<00:01:40.990> is<00:01:41.200> even<00:01:41.920> though<00:01:42.220> it's<00:01:42.400> sped

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
as you see this is even though it's sped

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.270 
as you see this is even though it's sped
up<00:01:43.060> this<00:01:43.750> is<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.230> process<00:01:44.740> that<00:01:44.920> takes<00:01:45.070> as

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
up this is the process that takes as

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.040 
up this is the process that takes as
long<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.790> is<00:01:46.030> probably<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.450> most<00:01:46.540> technical

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
long and is probably the most technical

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.200 
long and is probably the most technical
part<00:01:47.080> of<00:01:47.320> it<00:01:47.440> to<00:01:47.560> know<00:01:47.710> how<00:01:48.130> thin<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.940> get<00:01:49.090> the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
part of it to know how thin to get the

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.900 
part of it to know how thin to get the
pasta<00:01:49.620> because<00:01:50.620> too<00:01:50.920> thin<00:01:51.130> is<00:01:51.310> not<00:01:51.460> good<00:01:51.700> but

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
pasta because too thin is not good but

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.320 
pasta because too thin is not good but
too<00:01:52.090> thick<00:01:52.330> creates<00:01:52.780> a<00:01:52.900> kind<00:01:53.260> of<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:53.470> too<00:01:53.650> doughy

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
too thick creates a kind of a too doughy

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.140 
too thick creates a kind of a too doughy
ravioli<00:01:55.330> so<00:01:55.590> it's<00:01:56.590> important<00:01:57.160> that<00:01:57.220> you<00:01:57.760> just

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
ravioli so it's important that you just

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.700 
ravioli so it's important that you just
touch<00:01:58.330> it<00:01:58.360> you<00:01:58.750> have<00:01:58.930> to<00:01:59.050> feel<00:01:59.230> it<00:01:59.440> it's<00:01:59.590> the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
touch it you have to feel it it's the

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.600 
touch it you have to feel it it's the
only<00:01:59.830> way<00:02:00.070> you'll<00:02:00.250> know<00:02:01.260> if<00:02:02.260> the<00:02:02.770> thickness<00:02:03.430> is

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
only way you'll know if the thickness is

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.969 
only way you'll know if the thickness is
right<00:02:03.790> there's<00:02:04.240> no<00:02:04.300> exact<00:02:04.840> setting<00:02:05.290> it<00:02:05.470> varies

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
right there's no exact setting it varies

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.910 
right there's no exact setting it varies
at<00:02:06.130> times<00:02:06.400> even<00:02:07.270> depending<00:02:08.260> on<00:02:08.410> weather<00:02:08.649> in

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
at times even depending on weather in

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.350 
at times even depending on weather in
the<00:02:09.130> kitchen<00:02:09.459> and<00:02:09.550> how<00:02:09.670> hot<00:02:09.910> or<00:02:09.940> cold<00:02:10.090> the

sheet tray and then they'll be oiled on
the<00:02:28.300> top<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.780> quickly<00:02:29.440> frozen<00:02:30.270> pasta<00:02:31.270> has<00:02:31.570> to

the top and quickly frozen pasta has to
either<00:02:32.140> be<00:02:32.350> used<00:02:32.709> immediately<00:02:33.370> or<00:02:33.520> it<00:02:33.640> has<00:02:33.790> to

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
either be used immediately or it has to

either be used immediately or it has to

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
be preserved by freezing it if you don't

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.720 
be preserved by freezing it if you don't
freeze<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.840> or<00:02:37.930> don't<00:02:38.110> use<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.350> immediately

freeze it or don't use it immediately

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.690 
freeze it or don't use it immediately
the<00:02:39.730> moisture<00:02:40.120> in<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.420> filling<00:02:40.870> will

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
the moisture in the filling will

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.430 
the moisture in the filling will
compromise<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.820> pasta<00:02:43.360> and<00:02:43.570> we'll<00:02:44.170> start

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
compromise the pasta and we'll start

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.350 
compromise the pasta and we'll start
leaching<00:02:44.800> through<00:02:45.070> and<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.730> raviolis<00:02:46.239> will

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
leaching through and the raviolis will

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.120 
leaching through and the raviolis will
pop<00:02:46.540> open<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:47.350> they<00:02:47.470> either<00:02:47.560> have<00:02:47.769> to<00:02:47.830> be<00:02:47.950> used

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
pop open so they either have to be used

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.520 
pop open so they either have to be used
immediately<00:02:48.370> or<00:02:48.970> frozen<00:02:49.269> so<00:02:50.200> we'll<00:02:50.350> put<00:02:50.470> them

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
immediately or frozen so we'll put them

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.880 
immediately or frozen so we'll put them
onto<00:02:50.650> these<00:02:50.830> sheet<00:02:51.040> trays<00:02:51.310> we<00:02:51.550> get<00:02:51.670> about

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
onto these sheet trays we get about

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.890 
onto these sheet trays we get about
seven<00:02:53.890> or<00:02:54.010> eight<00:02:54.070> orders<00:02:54.489> per<00:02:54.850> sheet<00:02:55.660> tray
