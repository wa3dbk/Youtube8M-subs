00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
make it a little bit closer to the same

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.980 
make it a little bit closer to the same
size<00:02:46.740> as<00:02:47.130> our<00:02:47.250> text<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.510> way<00:02:48.660> if<00:02:48.780> we<00:02:48.870> want

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
size as our text and that way if we want

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.840 
size as our text and that way if we want
to<00:02:49.110> move<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.530> text<00:02:49.740> around<00:02:49.950> on<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.340> screen<00:02:50.490> we

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
to move the text around on the screen we

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.370 
to move the text around on the screen we
can<00:02:50.880> move<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.240> wherever<00:02:51.420> we<00:02:51.600> want<00:02:51.990> without<00:02:52.200> the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
can move it wherever we want without the

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.020 
can move it wherever we want without the
text<00:02:52.830> box<00:02:53.100> itself<00:02:53.520> getting<00:02:53.730> in<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:53.940> way

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
text box itself getting in the way

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.930 
text box itself getting in the way
because<00:02:54.209> if<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:54.780> was<00:02:54.900> big<00:02:55.620> like<00:02:55.800> this<00:02:56.130> then

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
because if it was big like this then

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.670 
because if it was big like this then
when<00:02:57.090> we<00:02:57.240> move<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.720> we<00:02:57.870> can<00:02:57.990> only<00:02:58.020> move<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.500> down

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
when we move it we can only move it down

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.080 
when we move it we can only move it down
this<00:02:58.980> far<00:03:00.260> whereas<00:03:01.260> if<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:01.980> drag<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:02.700> in<00:03:02.910> with

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
this far whereas if I drag it in with

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.820 
this far whereas if I drag it in with
the<00:03:03.239> diagonal<00:03:03.810> drag<00:03:04.050> tool<00:03:04.320> see<00:03:04.530> how<00:03:04.620> when<00:03:04.800> I

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
the diagonal drag tool see how when I

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
the diagonal drag tool see how when I
put<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.430> mouse<00:03:06.360> cursor<00:03:06.600> on<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.989> corner<00:03:07.560> of

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
put the mouse cursor on the corner of

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.420 
put the mouse cursor on the corner of
the<00:03:08.850> text<00:03:09.090> box<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.690> turns<00:03:09.870> into<00:03:10.050> a<00:03:10.170> two<00:03:11.070> arrow

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
the text box it turns into a two arrow

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.880 
the text box it turns into a two arrow
slant<00:03:12.000> or<00:03:12.239> a<00:03:12.300> two<00:03:12.480> arrow<00:03:12.690> diagonal<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:13.470> means

slant or a two arrow diagonal that means

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.800 
slant or a two arrow diagonal that means
that<00:03:14.040> we<00:03:14.100> can<00:03:14.220> change<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.790> size<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.570> box

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
that we can change the size of the box

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.120 
that we can change the size of the box
we're<00:03:16.080> going<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.260> change<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.620> size<00:03:16.860> of<00:03:17.070> the

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
box and make it closer to the same size

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.540 
box and make it closer to the same size
as<00:03:20.880> this<00:03:21.030> text<00:03:21.390> that<00:03:21.420> we<00:03:21.600> typed<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.340> then<00:03:23.340> if<00:03:23.430> I

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
as this text that we typed and then if I

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.460 
as this text that we typed and then if I
hover<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.880> mouse<00:03:24.000> cursor<00:03:24.630> over<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:25.080> different

hover the mouse cursor over a different

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.390 
hover the mouse cursor over a different
spot<00:03:25.860> I<00:03:26.190> get<00:03:26.850> a<00:03:26.880> four<00:03:27.360> arrow<00:03:27.630> cross<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:29.310> the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
spot I get a four arrow cross and the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.000 
spot I get a four arrow cross and the
for<00:03:29.640> our<00:03:29.670> cross<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.269> move<00:03:30.630> tool<00:03:31.019> so<00:03:31.860> what<00:03:31.980> I

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
for our cross is the move tool so what I

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.880 
for our cross is the move tool so what I
move<00:03:32.370> that<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:33.600> now<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:33.750> can<00:03:33.989> move<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.290> clear<00:03:34.680> down

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
move that so now I can move a clear down

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.380 
move that so now I can move a clear down
to<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.160> bottom<00:03:35.549> whereas<00:03:35.760> before<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.060> was<00:03:36.180> kind

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
to the bottom whereas before I was kind

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.150 
to the bottom whereas before I was kind
of<00:03:36.450> stuck<00:03:36.660> up<00:03:36.690> here<00:03:36.989> at<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.170> top<00:03:37.410> so<00:03:38.070> the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
of stuck up here at the top so the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.370 
of stuck up here at the top so the
closer<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.549> make<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:39.000> box<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.690> size<00:03:40.019> of

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
closer you make the box to the size of

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.220 
closer you make the box to the size of
your<00:03:40.950> text<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:42.390> easier<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.840> is<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:42.959> move

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
your text the easier it is to move

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.170 
your text the easier it is to move
around<00:03:43.400> so<00:03:44.400> I'm<00:03:44.549> going<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:44.790> go<00:03:44.850> ahead<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.090> move

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180
