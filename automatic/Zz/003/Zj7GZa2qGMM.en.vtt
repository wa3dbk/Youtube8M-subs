00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 now is the time to meet the new 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.859
 chevrolet prisma is with you one more time 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.859
 and corn 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.269
 gm does not even want to give 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.850
 competitors neither new nor old 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.369
 now wants to attack and take the lead of 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.939
 segment of the compact sedans with the new 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.570
 prism that by the way guns for that he 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.500
 has 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.320
 Just look at it but a few weeks. 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.329
 in fact neither the sedan version of the onyx but 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.510
 replaced the prism already well 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.520
 known segment in which what fell 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.640
 more attention is the style that the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.890
 factory sets as sports sedan 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.440
 mainly the rear has solved 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.510
 integrated into the rest of the car 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.890
 still a trunk with a capacity of 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.140
 500 liters 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.170
 ideal for those who need a car 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.469
 family type eternally do not exist 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.739
 differences from the hatch model 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.120
 panel instrument panel and 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.970
 coatings are the same 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.700
 the equipment also interesting 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.689
 multimedia system that controls the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.540
 a cell phone that produces 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.490
 interacts with smartphone and can even 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.130
 download the gps program 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.159
 the inner space is one of the cool things 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.740
 the new prisoner at a good distance between 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.240
 axes have room for five people 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.420
 just who goes in the middle of the back seat 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.950
 suffers slightly the new prism is offered 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.380
 in three basic versions you are given 80 with 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.799
 1.4 and 1.4 1.4 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.530
 in the latter the 106 horses with ethanol and 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.950
 98 in gasoline proved sufficient 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.990
 to enable interesting performance 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.630
 both on the road keeping the speeds 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.740
 allowed without difficulty as in the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.390
 City 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.759
 the impacts of the five-speed gearbox 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.670
 have agility to the sedan 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.509
 even with 1.0 engine the new price commands 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.720
 good 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.270
 The secret is in weight only 12 pounds 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.030
 more than the hatch version which allowed 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.700
 that maintained the same mechanical assembly 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.319
 without altering the performance practically 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.450
 an announced novelty is that until the 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.640
 second half of this year will also have 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.569
 an automatic six- speed version 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.420
 marches 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.250
 the new prism is already on sale at 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.260
