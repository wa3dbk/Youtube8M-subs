then you'll end up with two pieces that

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.160 
then you'll end up with two pieces that
look<00:01:13.880> like<00:01:13.940> this<00:01:16.630> then<00:01:17.630> you<00:01:17.810> want<00:01:17.960> to<00:01:17.990> glue

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
look like this then you want to glue

with the fabric glue

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.860 
with the fabric glue
we<00:01:22.160> found<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:22.490> easiest<00:01:22.640> way<00:01:23.030> was<00:01:23.300> to<00:01:23.479> use<00:01:23.600> the

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
we found the easiest way was to use the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.620 
we found the easiest way was to use the
bottle<00:01:24.229> directly<00:01:24.620> and<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:25.850> move<00:01:26.420> it<00:01:26.540> across

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
bottle directly and to move it across

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.410 
bottle directly and to move it across
the<00:01:27.350> fabric<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:27.890> kind<00:01:28.520> of<00:01:28.610> zigzag<00:01:28.910> it<00:01:29.240> here

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
the fabric and kind of zigzag it here

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.480 
the fabric and kind of zigzag it here
and<00:01:29.510> there<00:01:29.660> after<00:01:30.619> you<00:01:30.740> glue<00:01:30.860> it<00:01:30.920> on<00:01:31.160> just

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
and there after you glue it on just

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.300 
and there after you glue it on just
press<00:01:31.790> it<00:01:31.940> down<00:01:32.150> carefully<00:01:32.630> and<00:01:33.170> let<00:01:34.040> it<00:01:34.160> dry

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
press it down carefully and let it dry

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:44.810 
press it down carefully and let it dry
for<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:34.550> little<00:01:34.640> bit

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.190 

then<00:01:45.820> you<00:01:45.970> want<00:01:46.119> to<00:01:46.180> trim<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.570> edges<00:01:46.750> of<00:01:47.079> the

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
then you want to trim the edges of the

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.740 
then you want to trim the edges of the
square<00:01:47.530> so<00:01:48.189> that<00:01:48.460> you<00:01:48.729> can<00:01:49.060> even<00:01:49.420> out<00:01:49.509> all<00:01:49.570> the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
square so that you can even out all the

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.600 
square so that you can even out all the
edges

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.090 

and<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:53.630> want<00:01:53.780> to<00:01:53.840> turn<00:01:54.050> your<00:01:54.170> fabric<00:01:54.350> over<00:01:54.650> so

and you want to turn your fabric over so

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.940 
and you want to turn your fabric over so
the<00:01:55.250> lining<00:01:55.640> is<00:01:55.760> facing<00:01:56.180> upwards<00:01:56.660> put<00:01:57.650> a<00:01:57.680> thin

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
the lining is facing upwards put a thin

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.550 
the lining is facing upwards put a thin
strip<00:01:58.250> of<00:01:58.370> glue<00:01:58.580> along<00:01:59.480> the<00:01:59.540> edge<00:01:59.870> of<00:02:00.230> the

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
strip of glue along the edge of the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:11.330 
strip of glue along the edge of the
fabric<00:02:01.040> and<00:02:01.220> fold<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.880> side<00:02:02.120> over

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.680 

then<00:02:12.340> you<00:02:12.460> want<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.670> repeat<00:02:12.940> this<00:02:13.120> step<00:02:13.240> on<00:02:13.540> the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
then you want to repeat this step on the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.050 
then you want to repeat this step on the
other<00:02:13.840> side<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.350> fabric<00:02:14.740> as<00:02:14.890> well

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.400 

you'll<00:02:19.060> turn<00:02:19.270> out<00:02:19.420> with<00:02:19.599> something<00:02:19.870> like<00:02:20.050> this

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
you'll turn out with something like this

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.280 
you'll turn out with something like this
and<00:02:20.680> then<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.280> want<00:02:21.459> to<00:02:21.550> glue<00:02:21.790> along<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.330> side

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
and then you want to glue along the side

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.699 
and then you want to glue along the side
that<00:02:23.530> we<00:02:23.800> just<00:02:24.160> turn<00:02:24.730> down<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.330> glue<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.319> to

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
that we just turn down and glue that to

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.530 
that we just turn down and glue that to
the<00:02:26.739> zipper

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.670 

you<00:02:31.540> can<00:02:31.690> repeat<00:02:31.960> this<00:02:32.110> step<00:02:32.380> on<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.650> other

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
you can repeat this step on the other

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.199 
you can repeat this step on the other
side<00:02:33.130> as<00:02:33.280> well

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.729 

then<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.330> want<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.480> make<00:02:39.599> sure<00:02:39.659> each<00:02:40.200> side<00:02:40.560> is

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
then you want to make sure each side is

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.350 
then you want to make sure each side is
glued<00:02:40.980> down<00:02:41.010> carefully<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.849> just<00:02:42.030> spread<00:02:42.239> it

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
glued down carefully and just spread it

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.449 
glued down carefully and just spread it
out<00:02:42.420> with<00:02:42.599> your<00:02:42.720> fingers<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.319> make<00:02:43.379> sure<00:02:44.220> it's

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
out with your fingers and make sure it's

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.960 
out with your fingers and make sure it's
glued<00:02:44.700> down<00:02:45.890> you<00:02:46.890> can<00:02:47.069> let<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.250> dry<00:02:47.489> for<00:02:47.610> about

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
glued down you can let it dry for about

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.210 
glued down you can let it dry for about
half<00:02:48.420> an<00:02:48.569> hour<00:02:48.659> and<00:02:48.959> then<00:02:49.439> you<00:02:49.470> want<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.709> unzip

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
half an hour and then you want to unzip

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:59.640 
half an hour and then you want to unzip
it<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.579> turn<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.180> inside<00:02:51.329> out

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.530 

then<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:00.769> can<00:03:00.950> zip<00:03:01.189> the<00:03:01.340> bag<00:03:01.549> as<00:03:01.790> it<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.209> inside

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
then you can zip the bag as it is inside

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.339 
then you can zip the bag as it is inside
out

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.229 

then<00:03:07.349> trim<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.890> fabric<00:03:08.099> up<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.760> zipper<00:03:09.090> on

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
then trim the fabric up to the zipper on

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:19.100 
then trim the fabric up to the zipper on
both<00:03:09.299> sides

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.390 

next<00:03:20.110> you<00:03:20.230> have<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.380> choice<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.860> make<00:03:21.040> you<00:03:21.250> can

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
it's going to take some messing around

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.089 
it's going to take some messing around
