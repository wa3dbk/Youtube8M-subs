00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.840
 nearest metro station to the stadium 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:11.789
 tutankhamen called seven sisters 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.529
 nothing to do with the name itself 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:15.660
 football team and all because 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:19.699
 sometime to pave this road 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.699
 I had to cut down 7 old trees 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.290
 this overcoming event which 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.360
 poetry and eventually called the terrain 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.640
 and then the metro station is not 7 trees 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.640
 how would it be logical for the seven sisters 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.470
 all countries 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.710
 and here is a street called semen sisters 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.780
 here goes into the street that on high road 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.159
 which leads us to the football stadium 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.960
 usually on match day fans 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.119
 deny yourself the pleasure 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.979
 20-minute walk, but we 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.399
 let's go and find out that they are not quite 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.399
 are right 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.780
 lack of interest in the area for those who 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.820
 comes to football of course explainable 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.009
 there is no particular architecture here 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.100
 in general, the area of hundreds of kilometers is notorious 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.950
 it was from here in August 11 began 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.110
 great london riots over 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.000
 months after the glass here in these houses 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.979
 remained knocked out well because 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.789
 there was no local immigrant population 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.789
 money to replace 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.610
 generally over the past 100 years 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.680
 it is immigrants who make up the main 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.630
 part of the population of the area that he though not 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.750
 always they lived by the law for example 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.570
 known case from 1909 when here 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.430
 on this quiet street honestly throat 2 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.450
 people from Russia robbed a cashier and 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.450
 ran towards the river 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.439
 the chase was long and bloody robbers 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.209
 killed two people injured another 14 in 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:37.909
 eventually killed themselves about here on this 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.409
 place at the end honestly throat that case in 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.999
 Chronicle of the area who became Tantk 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.079
 starting point to not calm 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:44.079
 behavior of visitors 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.000
 but not everything is so gloomy in that alchemist 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.490
 sometime in these places the English monarchs 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.770
 came hunting at that time 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.990
 here arose the handsome bruise sl. 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.870
 You know who was the first owner of the Spill 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.480
 colton he followed the portable toilet 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.280
 King of England Heinrich 3 but where else 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:15.800
 live to the person who occupied such 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:18.170
 an important position but not even then 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.600
 no gloomy events in the 17th century wife 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.720
 the new owner of the castle is a constant having learned 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.370
 about cheating husband jumped out of the window 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.600
 they say that every year on the day of her death 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.430
 the rooms of the castle 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.860
 a strange sound is heard that resembles 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.870
 female voice check we can not but 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.870
 what kind of english castle without cast 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:52.090
 in September 1882 the life of the district 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.280
 changed forever ended cricket 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.409
 season a few guys did not know what 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.219
 take yourself for six shillings 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:03.090
 they bought the ball and played football right 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:03.090
 under this pillar 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.980
 so there was a club that he is ham hotspur 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.750
 twenty years later 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.239
 at this intersection where once 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.860
 the boys were chasing the ball was built 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.959
 white hart lane stadium he still 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.620
 serves totenhem'a home arena already 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.620
 more than a hundred years 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.000
 History is considered to be a bad thing 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.040
 Jewish team because Jewish 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.410
 the community was once the most influential in 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.750
 the neighborhood now is no longer the habit 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.700
 remained and sores totenhem'a still 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.030
 practicing shouted komi on his 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.030
 of origin 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.769
 much more interesting than the Jewish track 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:59.589
 relationship totenhem'a with his 

00:04:56.769 --> 00:05:01.179
 geographic neighbor arsenal here 

00:04:59.589 --> 00:05:04.269
 stadium to white hart lane 

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:11.919
 emirates well, literally eight stops 

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:14.949
 on the bus and the question is not at all in geography 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.839
 and the fact is that in 1919 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:19.029
 there was a reform of higher english 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:21.789
 division and through their connections 

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:24.429
 football federation arsenal ranked 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:26.679
 totenhem'a since a sworn 

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:29.429
 the enemy for who he is and by what the arsenal is not 

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:29.429
 exists 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.020
 but 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.760
 You see, seemingly nothing 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.180
 remarkable area but at 20 minutes 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:48.860
 walks fit 130 years of history this 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.860
 england and english football
