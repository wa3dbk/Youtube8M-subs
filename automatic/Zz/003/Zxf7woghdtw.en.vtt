00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.789
 and in this episode we will tell you about 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:34.330
 differences between rabbits toys and 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.949
 super toys that really do not lie at all 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.760
 more than in weight 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:41.940
 The toy rabbit is a rabbit 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.280
 approximately one kilo 300 grams 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.559
 while the toy rabbit in its stadium 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.079
 as an adult, the 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.269
 kilo 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.199
 and how you better understand it is 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.469
 comparing one with the other here the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.469
 you have 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.690
 we have a rabbit I'm in my hand 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.850
 left with ears already short but 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.270
 here however you see the super rabbit 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.320
 toy with extremely short ears 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.509
 and the extremely compact body 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.950
 we will say that the super toy rabbit is the 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.070
 smaller than you can get to have 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.760
 and is the champion of champions among 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.960
 dwarves is the dwarf of the dwarves 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.229
 you have seen that different are 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:34.130
 well, these differences have a lot 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.560
 work behind the rabbits are divided into 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.170
 a lot of different races 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.030
 that we are going to explain to you in a series of 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.810
 videos but I do want you to have 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.000
 a notion of how these races arise and 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.460
 why these races arise behind 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.820
 all this is a complex group a 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.689
 important human team that we work 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.450
 in improving in selecting and purifying 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:03.140
 the breeds that best adapt as 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.350
 pets to have inside the houses 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.380
 How do we work? What do we do? 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.580
 we basically do is select 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.760
 When a rabbit comes out with the ear 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.319
 shorter we set it aside and select 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.300
 bunnies with the shortest ear when 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.700
 we get a very quiet rabbit what 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.130
 we separate and select rabbits more 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.380
 calm and so we work and 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.560
 to reproduce the characters 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.200
 we are interested to have them as 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.700
 pets and we have done well then 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.910
 select quiet animals 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.400
 select tiny animals to 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.150
 have them more easily at home animals 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.730
 besides that in addition to their stools and their 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.160
 stools and their droppings are more 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.560
 little ones that have the little ear too short 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.959
 because it makes her face more than teddy bear 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.620
 more beautiful face with here for example 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.049
 Well with the roundest little ear 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.390
 with a kind a variety of colors very 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:02.730
 different that suit the tastes of 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:06.200
 each person and finally work because 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.549
 the animals are raised as pets and 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.090
 leave the animals of the 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.849
 field my name is antonio 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.920
 I am a veterinarian responsible for the center 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.620
 largest breeding in Europe that 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.069
 called coy ipyc and that is in the 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.280
 wounded and good I set with a team 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.890
 of geneticists and people in charge 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.200
 of reproduction because we work at 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.019
 daily because you have at home these 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.610
 wonderful pets and also 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.819
 we work also because you have the 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.910
 better foods to feed these 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.799
 precious animals in countries like the USA or 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.620
 Japan have become one of the 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:49.530
 most numerous pets for their ease 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.629
 to have at home because of its little smell and 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.769
 especially their ease of having them and 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.769
 take care of them as pets
