00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.980
 and greetings to all the friends a long time since we have with 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.369
 You did not have a review of such a gadget 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.000
 wanted to say Chinese Mivina food on 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.940
 this time we will have with you 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.090
 beef seasoned with different spices and 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.750
 red pepper on the idea should this one 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.930
 portion to be super mega powerfully sharp here 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.390
 so a little bit we seasoning which with 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.940
 pepper less put as a Ukrainian 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.290
 don't eat so much with spices and of course 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.070
 in the background the moose will swim 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.820
 macaroons 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.710
 what to say the percentage of the package itself passed it 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.770
 certification ie it is for sale or 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.210
 you can use it to fly 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:05.040
 he made September 3, 2014 to me 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.190
 it seems that such a package is already 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.300
 more than six months have passed 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.180
 made well it does not seem these all packages 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.430
 or lie and more than a year led deadline 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.000
 before nasti they can eat i think 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.660
 calmly 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 I have already prepared everything , but now we are with 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:26.209
 you all quickly for sausage and 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.929
 try it will be such a breakfast from me 

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:35.970
 I already have my stomach and I train him 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:39.840
 so as not to spoil all our seasoning 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:44.369
 Now let's look at our own 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.020
 syrup that's such a macaroni nightmare 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.009
 principle like ours to taste if 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.450
 eat it dry and generally 11 just one 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.429
 in one 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.640
 let's go means we see you dry 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.640
 seasonings 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:05.090
 there you are see take a fork 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:08.899
 eat egg yolk dried peas 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.180
 red pepper greens and onions probably 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.780
 a little cabbage is this meat 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.080
 brown pieces here are 4 3 pieces of meat you 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.620
 all principle cabbage pepper and egg greens 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.569
 onions and meat and peas standing as needed 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.700
 once the whole set which is drawn on 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.700
 most pictures of the meat are certainly not 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.790
 as powerful as 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.989
 as drawn but they seem to be here 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.650
 here we are 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:41.160
 add on top after that we 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.340
 add supercool seasoning which 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.890
 written premium quality super type 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:52.019
 you'd better not find that by smell 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:58.799
 and you smell like red pepper yourself 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:03:02.630
 and of course our sauce or broth 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:06.060
 the so-called for which it is attached 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.410
 more satiety more fat 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.310
 we get this here 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.920
 starter course of course looking but not really 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.040
 Tomatoes are also present here at 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.930
 This dressing contains tomatoes but also 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:33.139
 every steel crap so went 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:35.480
 let's fill it up now with some water 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:39.480
 take a fork 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.180
 damn reading along propupil and took 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.389
 small plate yes you can still on 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:55.109
 water add now we are the crown on i still 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:57.660
 add give it to the eyeballs all right now 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.170
 it will be clearly clearly articulate of course yes 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.900
 I blunted the arrows 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.680
 it was necessary to take more 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.480
 already done done all friends i ran for 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.720
 the lid is covered we will all be with you 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.270
 continue after three minutes and so 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.850
 friends passed in me it seems to three 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.310
 minutes or about three minutes so our 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.430
 nice with you sort of fell apart need 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.860
 now do it all beautifully mix 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.500
 why do you see all the peas falling apart 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.930
 a little egg meat fell apart 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.210
 increased to such well more to 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.710
 it is of course dried at all 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.380
 has no view, but now we are more or less 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.750
 It looks like you need to mix it all up to 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.710
 she was in one can sing consistency 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.240
 lest know here 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:54.160
 the feast is black there is no taste at all and so 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:56.410
 further so the meat as you see i mixed 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.570
 and in theory the pursuers know how I am 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.840
 did the next video I probably all 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.660
 Here it is here I will pour on all the seasonings but 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.120
 condiments which we have goat meat 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.900
 here's the greens pour out the top like it 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:15.460
 shown judging by the picture here shown 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:18.789
 above means we will add above and also 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.200
 she urinates on our little moisture on 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.789
 feeds anyway shorter ok be 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.510
 we will try to experiment 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:31.479
 so friends, let's go eat a piece of meat 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:35.169
 first up to that bit of meat I'll be all 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:38.020
 try to tell a little later so 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.570
 friends will now make a verdict 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.880
 look like this 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.710
 like borscht with only pasta 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.660
 what is missing 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:49.479
 potatoes here we still have an egg floating egg 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.160
 I no longer want to eat because this one 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.919
 here's the thing so badly I already 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.139
 tears flow nose punched them bake 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.780
 so on the chinese never get sick 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.760
 because they robe all keen in them 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.380
 all right know straight cleaned in 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.450
 body and sound 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.190
 how our Russians will drink 100 grams of vodka 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.930
 go to sleep then the Chinese will eat 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.360
 Chinese Mivin and go to bed and 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.320
 the next morning cucumbers like that in principle 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.730
 In general, everything was delicious I liked 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.280
 really i'm already a little undernourished because 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:20.080
 that cabbage here we still swim well 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.270
 Cabbage generally no varina 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.580
 no damage at all dried cabbage 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.890
 was now she soaked she just like 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.560
 some leaf just plucked from the tree 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:32.350
 Sheets Hawa here at all nonsense and so in 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.360
 In general, everything is not bad for a disposable 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.980
 eat all friends participate in contests 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.790
 put huskies and all good mood 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.790
 bye Bye
