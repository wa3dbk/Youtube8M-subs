00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
worst I've seen in a game in a very long

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.780 
worst I've seen in a game in a very long
time<00:02:21.239> you<00:02:21.540> know<00:02:21.989> it's<00:02:22.319> just<00:02:22.500> like<00:02:22.620> why<00:02:23.550> can't

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
time you know it's just like why can't

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.759 
time you know it's just like why can't
they<00:02:23.879> make<00:02:24.030> graphics<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.540> look<00:02:24.750> good<00:02:25.019> you

know<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:26.129> is<00:02:27.019> 2015<00:02:28.019> now<00:02:28.410> so<00:02:29.099> you<00:02:29.879> think<00:02:30.120> the

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
know this is 2015 now so you think the

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.789 
know this is 2015 now so you think the
graphics<00:02:30.360> could<00:02:30.660> be<00:02:30.750> more<00:02:30.989> realistic<00:02:31.170> but

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
graphics could be more realistic but

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.229 
graphics could be more realistic but
they<00:02:31.890> just<00:02:32.099> so<00:02:32.370> fake<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:32.640> there's<00:02:32.940> blocky
