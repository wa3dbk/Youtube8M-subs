too<00:02:37.500> far<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:37.920> all<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.430> water<00:02:38.610> is<00:02:38.790> pushing

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
too far and all that water is pushing

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.840 
too far and all that water is pushing
around<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.630> point<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.200> actually<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:41.070> wants

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
around the point so it actually it wants

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.550 
around the point so it actually it wants
to<00:02:41.880> push<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.330> around<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.690> corner<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:43.110> it<00:02:43.290> all

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
to push you around the corner in it all

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.110 
to push you around the corner in it all
that<00:02:43.800> water<00:02:43.920> wants<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.250> flush<00:02:44.520> into<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:44.910> base

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
that water wants to flush into the base

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.260 
that water wants to flush into the base
so<00:02:45.450> usually<00:02:46.200> just<00:02:46.709> miss<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.220> rocks<00:02:47.459> looks

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270
