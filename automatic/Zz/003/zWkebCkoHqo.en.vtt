00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.109
 funny 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.570
 You already know which Pokemon I 'm going to 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.050
 find in this video because the image 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.269
 in the title but I do not know then to 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.970
 capture it is the following you need 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.710
 quite the work that is because ball 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.500
 but football and a flyball pokémon 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.360
 waterfall dive and I think in the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.680
 extreme occasions that's all it's going to 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.960
 need 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.550
 So I'll get the honey here that has the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.520
 dive 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.750
 Ok I just make sure that she really 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.390
 have a dive attack yes dive beauty 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.760
 made it come to fort pierce ti 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.980
 this one is unmistakable right 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.309
 come to the left that you will see 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.329
 How do you go after these pokémons? 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.559
 remembering that they may appear 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.530
 randomly 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.729
 You have to come here at the observatory. 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.310
 come on here come on up 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.100
 with the scientist who has here I do not know 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.229
 that he is going to tell us that he is monitoring 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.600
 the weather patterns here are bad 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.799
 currently dry on the route 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.930
 116 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.040
 I can say somewhere near the route 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.950
 116 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.659
 Good if he said dry means the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.520
 sun cracking right 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.659
 then probably the bruno for us 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.979
 will end up finding it and it's the following 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:42.530
 he said route 116 the first find route 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.479
 116 here 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.189
 let me see where she stands because she 's a 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.320
 business that is not as simple as 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.840
 seems not to have the number of steps 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.780
 We can take for example the people I 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.759
 I came here to Route 116 and did not find a cave. 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.159
 and took many steps 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.250
 I just missed the opportunity to 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.000
 catch him so let's go after the degree 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.000
 from one probably 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.280
 beauty route 116 let's see if we 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.220
 find here people look here is the 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.160
 dem degree cave other on the right 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.989
 also funny beauty does not come 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.610
 here is the case here is this one is here 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.390
 even though we will find the degree of 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.620
 that I'm going to use the max paper here 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.670
 They went the way I did is well 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.680
 simple 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.260
 I'm just not going to play when the 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.950
 Scientist talk because if it did not give much 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.830
 old step was already was let's use the 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.410
 max eberl here and we are behind the goal 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.470
 rolled save my game here is going to 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:07.280
 give some shit right 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.380
 look at the magnificent environment and I think 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.470
 what are we going to find in java 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.120
 We found him here, just let me see and I think. 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.420
 I 'm going to use a pouch I do not know 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.950
 will be very useful in the sense of taking 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.410
 slightly the withdrawal of their year 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.329
 kill right 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:29.950
 Come on, people, look who out. 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.950
 oh this is going to be good here 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.490
 Good now that he slept for himself 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.610
 to recover hb and his life is almost 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.370
 at least is the right time to launch because 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.920
 ball as I said you recommend the 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.460
 all who use the good one because it gives good 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.460
 less work 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.450
 now 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:23.120
 Until finally, here's a hand. 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.450
 Time the guys are going to be caught. 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.630
 with the little ball I could stop for today 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:33.140
 come back tomorrow, my God. 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:37.640
 the boring bug to catch old then 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:41.000
 goes from another bomb even to think that 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.520
 I captured and the lattes that flees first 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.360
 without taking any damage from him with the few 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.330
 ball 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:52.180
 the king thing with the little ball but the 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:55.610
 damn grade of 11 thousand and with a 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.950

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.320

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:09.260
