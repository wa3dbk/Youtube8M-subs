I<00:00:00.060> call<00:00:00.390> it<00:00:00.420> a<00:00:00.599> bug<00:00:00.810> an<00:00:01.050> oversight<00:00:01.380> on<00:00:01.860> Capcom's

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
I call it a bug an oversight on Capcom's

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.110 
I call it a bug an oversight on Capcom's
part<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:03.060> glitch<00:00:03.389> that<00:00:04.380> what<00:00:05.370> happens<00:00:05.819> in<00:00:06.000> this

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
part a glitch that what happens in this

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.890 
part a glitch that what happens in this
game<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.859> that<00:00:08.090> when<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.210> get<00:00:09.389> up<00:00:09.599> certain

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
game is that when you get up certain

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.509 
game is that when you get up certain
characters<00:00:10.469> when<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:10.769> get<00:00:10.980> up<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.309> hold

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
characters when you get up and hold

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.810 
characters when you get up and hold
straight<00:00:11.880> back<00:00:12.620> you're<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:14.070> actually<00:00:14.639> are

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
straight back you're you actually are

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.000 
straight back you're you actually are
slightly<00:00:15.360> standing<00:00:16.020> farther<00:00:16.379> forward<00:00:16.800> than

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
slightly standing farther forward than

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.769 
slightly standing farther forward than
if<00:00:17.670> you're<00:00:17.820> holding<00:00:18.150> forward<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.660> the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
if you're holding forward on the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.380 
if you're holding forward on the
controller<00:00:19.250> so<00:00:20.250> what<00:00:20.580> happens<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.119> is

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
controller so what happens with that is

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.939 
controller so what happens with that is
if<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.600> cross<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.080> off<00:00:22.140> at<00:00:22.350> just<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.800> right

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
if you cross it off at just the right

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.759 
if you cross it off at just the right
distance<00:00:23.189> if<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.000> hold<00:00:24.300> back<00:00:24.420> your<00:00:24.930> character

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
distance if you hold back your character

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.650 
distance if you hold back your character
shifts<00:00:26.220> forward<00:00:26.460> ever<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.060> slightly<00:00:27.449> so

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
shifts forward ever so slightly so

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.179 
shifts forward ever so slightly so
that's<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.199> jump<00:00:28.439> attack<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.859> comes<00:00:29.070> across

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
that's the jump attack that comes across

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.420 
that's the jump attack that comes across
up<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.080> if<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.199> hold<00:00:31.529> forward<00:00:32.189> on<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
up and if you hold forward on the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.150 
up and if you hold forward on the
controller<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.540> shift<00:00:33.899> backwards<00:00:34.290> just

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
controller you shift backwards just

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.639 
controller you shift backwards just
enough<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.090> jump<00:00:36.329> attack<00:00:36.450> isn't<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
enough so that the jump attack isn't a

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.670 
enough so that the jump attack isn't a
cross<00:00:37.890> up<00:00:38.129> anymore<00:00:38.690> so<00:00:39.690> if<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.020> hold<00:00:40.230> forward

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
cross up anymore so if you hold forward

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.260 
cross up anymore so if you hold forward
you<00:00:40.829> get<00:00:41.010> hit<00:00:41.219> from<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.430> front<00:00:41.550> if<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.090> hold

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
you get hit from the front if you hold

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.540 
you get hit from the front if you hold
that<00:00:42.450> weight<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.530> hold<00:00:43.739> forward<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.340> get

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
that weight if you hold forward you get

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.790 
that weight if you hold forward you get
hit<00:00:44.850> from<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> front<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.840> if<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.500> hold<00:00:46.739> back

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
hit from the front and if you hold back

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.860 
hit from the front and if you hold back
you<00:00:47.280> get<00:00:47.489> hit<00:00:47.789> from<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> back<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.539> turns<00:00:48.750> into

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
you get hit from the back it turns into

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.680 
you get hit from the back it turns into
a<00:00:48.989> cross<00:00:49.260> up<00:00:49.530> basically<00:00:50.010> ridiculous<00:00:50.820> yeah<00:00:51.300> and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
a cross up basically ridiculous yeah and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.049 
a cross up basically ridiculous yeah and
I<00:00:51.930> don't<00:00:52.199> think<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:52.649> kamii<00:00:53.160> exclusive<00:00:53.879> like

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
I don't think it's kamii exclusive like

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.810 
I don't think it's kamii exclusive like
I<00:00:54.149> said<00:00:54.329> China<00:00:54.570> ever<00:00:54.809> set<00:00:55.140> up<00:00:55.170> Viper<00:00:56.160> has<00:00:56.550> one

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
I said China ever set up Viper has one

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.430 
I said China ever set up Viper has one
you<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.539> find<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.930> right<00:00:57.960> dis<00:00:58.289> I

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
you just have to find the right dis I

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.930 
you just have to find the right dis I
think<00:00:58.590> even<00:00:58.710> guy<00:00:58.980> has<00:00:59.280> one<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.699> some

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
think even guy has one on some

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.990 
think even guy has one on some
characters<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:01.160> you<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.340> have<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.579> find<00:01:02.760> that

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
characters to you just have to find that

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.630 
characters to you just have to find that
magical<00:01:03.510> distance<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.170> timing<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.430> guy

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
magical distance and timing and the guy

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.920 
magical distance and timing and the guy
just<00:01:05.670> happens<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.240> have<00:01:06.270> when<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.600> think<00:01:06.810> it's

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
just happens to have when I think it's

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.810 
just happens to have when I think it's
like<00:01:07.049> off<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.229> throwing<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.010> jump<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.549> jump

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
like off of throwing to jump and jump

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.270 
like off of throwing to jump and jump
again<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.450> jumping<00:01:09.780> forward<00:01:10.049> right<00:01:10.920> certain

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
again and jumping forward right certain

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.340 
again and jumping forward right certain

like<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:13.830> block<00:01:14.070> sure<00:01:15.320> well<00:01:16.320> language

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
like it's on block sure well language

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.890 
like it's on block sure well language
aims<00:01:16.830> for<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:16.979> escalation<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:18.600> looks<00:01:18.840> like

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
aims for the escalation it looks like

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.320 
aims for the escalation it looks like
xrs<00:01:19.590> samurais<00:01:20.040> right<00:01:20.369> back<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.850> there<00:01:21.000> going

xrs samurais right back in there going

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.660 
xrs samurais right back in there going
up<00:01:21.450> against<00:01:21.750> marne<00:01:22.110> yeah<00:01:22.560> well<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.070> know<00:01:23.189> what

up against marne yeah well you know what
do<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.790> think<00:01:23.970> about<00:01:24.500> taking<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.710> break<00:01:25.950> after

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
do you think about taking a break after

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.990 
do you think about taking a break after
your<00:01:26.729> your<00:01:27.360> tournament<00:01:27.689> wins<00:01:28.049> or<00:01:28.880> you<00:01:29.880> know

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
your your tournament wins or you know

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
like you

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.830 
like you
you<00:01:30.890> should<00:01:31.070> have<00:01:31.159> waited<00:01:32.060> a<00:01:32.329> second<00:01:32.689> maybe

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
you should have waited a second maybe

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.840 
you should have waited a second maybe
taking<00:01:33.200> a<00:01:33.259> breather<00:01:33.470> I<00:01:33.590> mean<00:01:33.890> going<00:01:34.460> from

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
taking a breather I mean going from

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.469 
taking a breather I mean going from
killa<00:01:35.390> cam<00:01:35.630> all<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.500> way<00:01:36.590> up<00:01:36.770> to<00:01:37.180> two<00:01:38.180> going<00:01:38.390> up

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
killa cam all the way up to two going up

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.870 
killa cam all the way up to two going up
against<00:01:38.750> marne<00:01:39.020> I<00:01:39.320> mean<00:01:39.920> maybe<00:01:40.549> might<00:01:40.850> have

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
against marne I mean maybe might have

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.910 
against marne I mean maybe might have
been<00:01:41.030> better<00:01:41.149> to<00:01:41.390> sit<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:41.840> regroup<00:01:42.680> for<00:01:42.860> a

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
been better to sit and regroup for a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.249 
been better to sit and regroup for a
second<00:01:43.310> I<00:01:43.520> actually<00:01:44.210> agree<00:01:44.659> with<00:01:44.689> that<00:01:44.840> but

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
second I actually agree with that but

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.350 
second I actually agree with that but
sometimes<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:46.100> know<00:01:46.250> you're<00:01:46.850> just<00:01:47.000> kind<00:01:47.270> of

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
sometimes you know you're just kind of
