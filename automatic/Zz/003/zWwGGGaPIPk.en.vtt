00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.679
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:32.750
 Speaking of the crown attached, anyone who is not familiar with the car already knows 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.750
 It is a representative of the Japanese sedan society 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:42.800
 December 25, 2012 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:47.700
 The crown has evolved to the 14th generation in response to a full model change 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:51.600
 58 years counted from the first appeared in 1955 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.079
 It has continued for a long time with the same name after Land Cruiser 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.850
 Very good 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:04.250
 As you can see and understand that it is a sunny sedan , this face is 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:10.820
 Unlike has changed dramatically Sele will soon be seen Hao that's more the new crown 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:14.149
 Speaking of the crown until better four patrol the whole of unity or rather February meek rice planting 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.840
 Though it was characterized by luxurious design in 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:25.109
 It looks like you're going to do something a little 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:28.710
 The so-called royal series of a normal system and one little from the front of the zero crown 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:34.480
 There were two series of sporty athletes series 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:38.950
 Today I would like to introduce this basic Royal series . 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:42.690
 It's a modern car , so I can go back and look inside the hood like this for the engine itself 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:49.170
 I can not see well though it has a plastic cover 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:50.340
 It is 2.5 liters of v type 6 in the case of this Crown Royal series to be hidden under this 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.490
 It is a cylinder engine 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:59.450
 Well downsize that even a little 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:02.780
 They say that reducing the emissions of co2 to improve the fuel economy 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.380
 It is a form that follows the global trend 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.410
 The engine itself basically remains the same 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.819
 The figure of 203 horsepower does not change either 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.660
 Besides 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.890
 More example 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:22.980
 Powerful 3.5 liter v6 loaded with 315 hp 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:26.360
 Well athlete-based supermodel There is also one company award, but it as a bright talk to technology 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.260
 Here 's this 2.5 liter v6 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.319
 I would like to get on 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:36.790
 New crown put dashboard 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:42.190
 It looks very different so far The appearance is very refreshing . 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:47.920
 Even if it said that it was clean, it did not mean that we reduced various equipment 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.790
 It is very integrated to look at the main information needed for driving 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.690
 Meter 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:03:00.140
 The other has been aggregated here all then here 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:02.990
 Well car navigation systems and air conditioners are very easy to understand intensively using a lot of head 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.050
 Well, I can operate quickly intuitively 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:10.010
 This is the goodness of a traditional crown 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:13.680
 By the way, I sit here and I can not see it on the screen 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:18.000
 In fact, this new crown has four important features 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:24.120
 One is intelligent clearance such 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.920
 Well this is an ultrasonic wave that detects obstacles and warns you when it approaches 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:32.380
 There is also Japanese called ruto 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:35.110
 The power of good engine in the case still the driver did not body not stick cares 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.510
 Squeeze a warning to the driver 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.660
 Well, it's also very useful at the time of injection and then one more 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.750
 Pre-crash safety 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.910
 This has also been in the language for a long time, but the light sweet suite in urban areas is actually 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.880
 Execution 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:59.750
 Is that car that was almost hit by inadvertently in the order that the majority of accidents 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:01.130
 The radar detects the former and this is urgent if it is determined that the car is unlikely to avoid an accident 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:06.650
 Braked 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.930
 Equipment to prevent one or even to reduce the damage even if the worst 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.300
 is 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.710
 Now behind 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:19.239
 I 'm sitting as a husband, but the rear seat is very cozy 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:24.819
 In particular fact rear though workers are five people in the case of this new model 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:30.580
 It is quite a powerful design on the premise of two people as four clerks 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:31.240
 So , for example, in this seat area, we will subtly mix such a ban 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.720
 Or 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:38.139
 Well it is my eye panel of the tone like that 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.230
 Then the lining that made this stitch very distinctive 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.639
 Rear seat 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:47.050
 Well for one of the hospitality 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:50.949
 Far into the mind from the rear seat beyond the looks promise the front passenger seat 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:55.659
 You can take out the front and earn space in front of your knees 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:57.529
 If you want to relax further, take this center armrest and it's about here 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:01.310
 There is a button 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:04.850
 Now defeat the backrest 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:09.920
 You can limit the movement while sleeping 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:14.570
 Then naturally to prevent direct sunlight from this rear window 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:16.289
 The sunshade is electrically operated and then the hot water sunshade 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:21.899
 It goes out here 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:22.710
 I think that such a direction as a Japanese luxury car is firmly holding points 

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:27.229
 I will 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.229
 Let's go looking forward to the taste of the saas run 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:38.370
 Went changed if entered To Sutsu raining put a so-called game to another country 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:38.370
 I think that the lack of this break very well shows the goodness of the round finish
