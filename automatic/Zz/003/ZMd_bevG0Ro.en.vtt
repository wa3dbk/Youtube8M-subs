weary of buying a KO simply because of

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.099 
weary of buying a KO simply because of
the<00:00:25.109> build<00:00:25.380> quality<00:00:25.699> but<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.789> problem<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.420> is

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
the build quality but the problem is is

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.689 
the build quality but the problem is is
that<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.529> Hank<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.949> version<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.400> fund<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
that the Hank a version to fund the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.430 
that the Hank a version to fund the
cracker<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:31.160> first<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.399> very<00:00:32.430> expensive

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
cracker is a first it's very expensive

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.900 
cracker is a first it's very expensive
secondly<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.590> build<00:00:34.800> quality<00:00:35.010> from<00:00:35.610> that

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
secondly the build quality from that

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.319 
secondly the build quality from that
wasn't<00:00:36.360> great<00:00:37.260> apparently<00:00:38.129> I'm<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.760> paint

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
wasn't great apparently I'm the paint

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.569 
wasn't great apparently I'm the paint
apps<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.969> lot<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:43.250> missiles<00:00:44.250> will

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
apps and a lot of the missiles will

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.299 
apps and a lot of the missiles will
loose<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.360> bull<00:00:45.899> no<00:00:46.230> just<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> joints<00:00:47.129> and

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309

loose and bull no just the joints and
all<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.579> because<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:48.030> mold<00:00:48.329> has<00:00:48.629> been<00:00:48.899> used

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
all that because this mold has been used

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.189 
all that because this mold has been used
quite<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.950> bit<00:00:50.219> over<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.120> past<00:00:51.390> few<00:00:51.629> years<00:00:51.989> you

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.690 
this you can make your own mind up so
anyway<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.310> bought<00:01:23.310> him<00:01:23.490> loose<00:01:23.790> from<00:01:24.030> Kyoto<00:01:24.750> is

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
anyway I bought him loose from Kyoto is

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.550 
anyway I bought him loose from Kyoto is
there<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.180> options<00:01:27.540> by<00:01:27.780> package<00:01:28.290> version

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
there is the options by package version

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.149 
there is the options by package version
but<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.189> one<00:01:29.430> that's<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.689> come<00:01:30.990> Lucia's<00:01:31.829> in

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
but it's one that's that come Lucia's in

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.130 
but it's one that's that come Lucia's in
alt<00:01:33.119> mode<00:01:33.360> more<00:01:34.079> or<00:01:34.229> less<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:35.900> slightly<00:01:36.900> miss

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
alt mode more or less the slightly miss

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.679 
alt mode more or less the slightly miss
transformed<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.890> think<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.549> was<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:39.090> stop<00:01:39.570> it

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
transformed I think that was to stop it

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.569 
transformed I think that was to stop it
from<00:01:39.810> getting<00:01:40.020> damaged<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.920> box<00:01:41.340> there

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
from getting damaged in the box there

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.550 
from getting damaged in the box there

was in comes with this piece of card and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.190 
was in comes with this piece of card and
just<00:01:46.560> move<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> camera<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:50.750> I'm<00:01:51.750> not<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.170> sure

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
just move the camera so I'm not so sure

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.889 
just move the camera so I'm not so sure
i<00:01:52.380> lookin<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:52.979> camera<00:01:53.430> butter<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> your

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
i lookin on camera butter to the your

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.469 
i lookin on camera butter to the your
app<00:01:55.079> it's<00:01:55.770> pretty<00:01:55.950> obvious<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.969> copy<00:01:57.240> to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
app it's pretty obvious it's a copy to

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
actually even be for acid stone but

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.059 
actually even be for acid stone but
again<00:02:18.549> you<00:02:19.180> know<00:02:19.329> is<00:02:19.599> clear<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.439> me<00:02:20.650> that<00:02:20.680> it's

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
went to transform him I'm notice that

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.550 
went to transform him I'm notice that
these<00:03:19.449> clips<00:03:19.930> here<00:03:21.510> basically<00:03:22.510> ran<00:03:23.199> the<00:03:23.410> wrong

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
these clips here basically ran the wrong

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.030 
these clips here basically ran the wrong
way<00:03:23.859> so<00:03:24.609> when<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.269> try<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:26.099> fold<00:03:27.099> the<00:03:27.370> wings

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
way so when you try to fold the wings

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.610 
way so when you try to fold the wings
that<00:03:30.040> should<00:03:30.340> go<00:03:30.519> pretty<00:03:30.790> easy<00:03:31.230> but<00:03:32.230> you<00:03:32.290> will

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
that should go pretty easy but you will

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.369 
that should go pretty easy but you will
see<00:03:33.069> that<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.669> crease<00:03:34.090> is<00:03:34.840> actually<00:03:35.970> here

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
see that the crease is actually here

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.170 
see that the crease is actually here
that's<00:03:38.379> the<00:03:38.560> same<00:03:38.829> on<00:03:39.010> this<00:03:39.159> one<00:03:39.400> as<00:03:39.519> well<00:03:39.549> and

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
that's the same on this one as well and

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.780 
that's the same on this one as well and
has<00:03:40.419> underneath<00:03:40.930> that<00:03:41.829> the<00:03:41.949> wings<00:03:42.190> needs<00:03:42.549> that

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
has underneath that the wings needs that

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.990 
has underneath that the wings needs that
actually<00:03:43.239> fold<00:03:43.540> upwards<00:03:43.870> I<00:03:44.760> was<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.790> bit

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
actually fold upwards I was a bit

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.710 
actually fold upwards I was a bit
hesitant<00:03:47.190> trying<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.459> transform<00:03:48.970> him<00:03:49.150> justly

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
hesitant trying to transform him justly

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.129 
hesitant trying to transform him justly

c-calm down and they're both very so I

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.540 
c-calm down and they're both very so I
really<00:05:29.740> probably<00:05:30.520> more<00:05:30.820> so<00:05:31.060> than<00:05:32.190> some<00:05:33.190> of<00:05:33.370> the

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
really probably more so than some of the

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:40.710 
really probably more so than some of the
original<00:05:33.640> to<00:05:34.150> our<00:05:34.300> thought<00:05:37.140> chemistry<00:05:39.720> so

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
original to our thought chemistry so

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.550 
original to our thought chemistry so
yeah<00:05:42.210> say<00:05:43.210> other<00:05:43.510> than<00:05:43.660> those<00:05:43.840> clips<00:05:44.230> on<00:05:44.440> the

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
yeah say other than those clips on the

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.730 
yeah say other than those clips on the
wings<00:05:45.270> on<00:05:46.270> the<00:05:46.420> back<00:05:46.600> there<00:05:46.870> you<00:05:47.320> can<00:05:47.500> probably

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
wings on the back there you can probably

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.900 
wings on the back there you can probably
see<00:05:47.890> it<00:05:48.160> more<00:05:48.460> actually<00:05:48.940> i'll<00:05:49.690> show<00:05:49.960> you<00:05:50.910> slob
