puzzle<00:00:20.369> let's<00:00:20.760> do<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:23.840> okay<00:00:29.510> clearly<00:00:30.510> we<00:00:31.289> have

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
puzzle let's do it okay clearly we have

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.200 
puzzle let's do it okay clearly we have
a<00:00:31.560> meeting<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.130> on<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> light<00:00:32.550> squares<00:00:32.880> and

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
a meeting it on the light squares and

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.299 
a meeting it on the light squares and
Bishop<00:00:34.140> takes<00:00:34.320> won't<00:00:34.559> work<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.040> Queen's

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.040 
Bishop takes won't work the Queen's
under<00:00:35.520> fire<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.270> obviously<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.870> answer

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
under fire this is obviously the answer

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.250 
under fire this is obviously the answer
and<00:00:38.030> I've<00:00:39.030> calculated<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:39.780> take<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.230> have

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
and I've calculated that we take we have

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.510 
and I've calculated that we take we have
checked<00:00:40.530> with<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.680> night<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:41.100> take<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.430> their

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
checked with the night we take on their

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.610 
checked with the night we take on their
fate<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:42.570> can<00:00:42.719> give<00:00:42.840> discovered<00:00:43.350> checks

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
fate we can give discovered checks

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.229 
fate we can give discovered checks
forever<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.160> take<00:00:44.340> pieces<00:00:44.579> or<00:00:45.000> there's

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
forever and take pieces or there's

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.700 
forever and take pieces or there's
likely<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.750> mate<00:00:46.640> likely<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> mate<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.329> f7<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.410> see

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
likely a mate likely a mate on f7 I see

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:59.270 
likely a mate likely a mate on f7 I see

right well um that's a that's a pattern

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.010 
right well um that's a that's a pattern
obviously<00:01:04.519> it's<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:05.880> what<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:06.510> refer<00:01:06.990> to

have 96 check and taking the rook

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.020 
have 96 check and taking the rook
there's<00:01:34.350> really<00:01:34.619> like<00:01:34.979> not<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> second<00:01:35.939> to

waste because there aren't any other
obvious<00:01:38.250> tempo<00:01:38.670> moves<00:01:38.909> here<00:01:39.259> as<00:01:40.259> far<00:01:40.409> as

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
obvious tempo moves here as far as

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.440 
obvious tempo moves here as far as
checks<00:01:40.829> or<00:01:40.979> captures<00:01:41.400> or<00:01:41.610> obviously<00:01:42.030> awkward

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
checks or captures or obviously awkward

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.359 
checks or captures or obviously awkward
or<00:01:42.630> unprotected<00:01:42.899> pieces<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:44.159> know<00:01:44.250> you

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
or unprotected pieces you know you

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.810 
or unprotected pieces you know you
quickly<00:01:44.610> assess<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.820> calculated

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
quickly assess that and so I calculated

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.679 
quickly assess that and so I calculated
all<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.149> way<00:01:48.420> till<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:49.790> and<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:51.240> seeing<00:01:51.600> that

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
all the way till this and in seeing that

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.210 
all the way till this and in seeing that
I<00:01:51.840> already<00:01:52.079> know<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.770> give<00:01:52.890> discover

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
I already know that I can give discover

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.770 
I already know that I can give discover
check<00:01:53.430> four<00:01:53.579> days<00:01:53.700> before<00:01:53.729> even<00:01:54.210> before<00:01:54.570> I

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
check four days before even before I

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.440 
check four days before even before I
even<00:01:54.899> sacked<00:01:55.549> and<00:01:56.549> then<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.880> course<00:01:56.939> taking<00:01:57.390> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
even sacked and then of course taking a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.580 
even sacked and then of course taking a
little<00:01:57.540> more<00:01:57.750> time<00:01:57.930> once<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.200> got<00:01:58.290> here<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.530> saw

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
little more time once I got here I saw

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.560 
little more time once I got here I saw
this<00:01:58.890> relocation<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.610> night<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.939> f7<00:02:00.240> of

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
this relocation of the night to f7 of

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.359 
this relocation of the night to f7 of
course<00:02:01.200> as<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.409> said<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.829> could<00:02:01.950> probably<00:02:02.159> give

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
course as I said you could probably give

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.069 
course as I said you could probably give
discovered<00:02:02.850> checks<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.270> take<00:02:03.420> pieces<00:02:03.659> and

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
discovered checks and take pieces and

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.380 
discovered checks and take pieces and
likely<00:02:04.649> white<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.310> winning<00:02:05.729> there<00:02:05.880> with<00:02:06.119> a

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
likely white is is winning there with a

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.889 
likely white is is winning there with a
lot<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:06.960> material<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.799> pawns<00:02:08.629> but<00:02:09.629> it's<00:02:09.750> messy

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
lot of material and pawns but it's messy

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.960 
lot of material and pawns but it's messy
so<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.410> know<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:10.890> plus<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.700> daily

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
so you know you can plus in a daily

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.260 
so you know you can plus in a daily
puzzle<00:02:12.300> setting<00:02:12.599> you're<00:02:12.720> pretty<00:02:12.930> sure
