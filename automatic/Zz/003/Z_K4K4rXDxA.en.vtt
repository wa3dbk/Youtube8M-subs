next<00:00:07.440> we<00:00:07.589> have<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:08.160> multiple<00:00:08.639> bounce<00:00:08.849> roll

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
next we have the multiple bounce roll

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.749 
next we have the multiple bounce roll
for<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.380> you<00:00:10.980> want<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.250> be<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.460> proper

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
for this you want to be in proper

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.730 
for this you want to be in proper
position<00:00:12.330> than<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.599> stick<00:00:12.870> remember<00:00:13.559> how<00:00:13.679> we

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
position than the stick remember how we

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.650 
position than the stick remember how we
talked<00:00:14.040> about<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.309> balance<00:00:14.610> point<00:00:15.089> which<00:00:15.480> is

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
talked about the balance point which is

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.660 
talked about the balance point which is
right<00:00:15.780> there<00:00:16.049> this<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.859> where<00:00:17.220> your<00:00:17.369> stick

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
right there this is where your stick

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.980 
right there this is where your stick
will<00:00:18.090> bounce<00:00:18.300> as<00:00:18.630> much<00:00:19.320> as<00:00:19.500> possible<00:00:20.750> now<00:00:21.750> in

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
will bounce as much as possible now in

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.150 
will bounce as much as possible now in
bouncing<00:00:22.500> your<00:00:22.619> stick

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
bouncing your stick

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.970 
bouncing your stick
you<00:00:23.430> want<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.789> make<00:00:23.880> sure<00:00:23.910> their<00:00:24.269> year<00:00:24.480> is

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
you want to make sure their year is

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.859 
you want to make sure their year is
horizontal<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.550> head<00:00:26.760> as<00:00:27.000> possible<00:00:27.090> if

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
horizontal to the head as possible if

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.750 
horizontal to the head as possible if
you<00:00:27.930> come<00:00:28.170> up<00:00:28.199> here<00:00:28.529> at<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.800> angle<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.609> not

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
you come up here at this angle it's not

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.640 
you come up here at this angle it's not
going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.970> bounce<00:00:30.090> as<00:00:30.330> much<00:00:30.510> not<00:00:31.199> just<00:00:31.380> most

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
going to bounce as much not just most

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.860 
going to bounce as much not just most
responds<00:00:32.160> if<00:00:32.279> you're<00:00:32.399> down<00:00:32.550> here<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.420> bounces

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
responds if you're down here it bounces

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.530 
responds if you're down here it bounces
more<00:00:34.460> so<00:00:35.460> we're<00:00:35.640> not<00:00:35.760> worried<00:00:36.149> about<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
more so we're not worried about the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.420 
more so we're not worried about the
finesse<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.079> fingers<00:00:37.530> we're<00:00:37.800> not<00:00:37.950> too<00:00:38.100> worried

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
finesse of fingers we're not too worried

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.400 
finesse of fingers we're not too worried
about<00:00:38.520> complicated<00:00:39.300> hand<00:00:39.750> angles<00:00:40.290> or

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
about complicated hand angles or

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.200 
about complicated hand angles or
anything<00:00:40.710> we'll<00:00:41.399> get<00:00:41.520> into<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.760> finesse

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
anything we'll get into that finesse

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.389 
anything we'll get into that finesse
later<00:00:42.739> right<00:00:43.739> now<00:00:43.770> what<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.190> do<00:00:44.370> is

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
later right now what you do is

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.940 
later right now what you do is
concentrate<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.020> pressure<00:00:46.260> point<00:00:46.620> being

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
concentrate on the pressure point being

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.180 
concentrate on the pressure point being
between<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> thumb<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.329> forefinger<00:00:49.190> and

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
between the thumb and the forefinger and

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.729 
between the thumb and the forefinger and
just<00:00:50.969> pushing<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.360> down<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.559> get

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
just pushing it down like that to get

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.029 
just pushing it down like that to get
more<00:00:52.980> bounce<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.789> apply<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> bit<00:00:54.390> pressure

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
more bounce you apply a bit pressure

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.360 
more bounce you apply a bit pressure
forward<00:00:56.039> on<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.149> thumb<00:00:58.160> because<00:00:59.160> if<00:00:59.280> you

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
forward on the thumb because if you

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.950 
forward on the thumb because if you
provide<00:00:59.640> too<00:01:00.059> much<00:01:00.090> back<00:01:00.420> here<00:01:00.719> you're<00:01:00.870> not

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
provide too much back here you're not

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.029 
provide too much back here you're not
going<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.170> have<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.410> action<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.980> need

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
going to have the action that you need

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.359 
going to have the action that you need
to<00:01:02.309> guide<00:01:02.430> push<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.850> kind<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.390> into<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> head

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
to guide push it kind of into the head

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.980 
to guide push it kind of into the head
but<00:01:05.369> be<00:01:05.760> relaxed<00:01:06.270> if<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.479> squeeze<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.869> too

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
but be relaxed if you squeeze it too

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.250 
but be relaxed if you squeeze it too
hard<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:07.890> going<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.159> kill<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.729> now<00:01:09.260> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
hard it's just going to kill it now the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.539 
hard it's just going to kill it now the
roll<00:01:10.530> itself<00:01:10.979> sounds<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:11.700> this

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.899 

but<00:01:15.850> if<00:01:16.060> you<00:01:16.780> break<00:01:17.049> that<00:01:17.290> down<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:18.280> basis<00:01:18.729> of

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
but if you break that down the basis of

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.370 
but if you break that down the basis of
it<00:01:19.030> is<00:01:19.150> a<00:01:19.360> single<00:01:19.750> stroke<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:22.030> for<00:01:22.630> it<00:01:22.900> to<00:01:23.110> close

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
it is a single stroke so for it to close

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.429 
it is a single stroke so for it to close
up<00:01:23.680> your<00:01:24.189> singles<00:01:24.729> need<00:01:25.270> to<00:01:25.450> be<00:01:25.630> at<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.170> certain

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
up your singles need to be at a certain

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.560 
up your singles need to be at a certain
speed<00:01:26.799> so<00:01:27.700> don't<00:01:27.939> worry<00:01:28.060> about<00:01:28.149> going<00:01:28.330> that

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
speed so don't worry about going that

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.230 
speed so don't worry about going that
fast<00:01:28.780> at<00:01:29.110> all<00:01:29.259> yet<00:01:30.250> what<00:01:30.490> you<00:01:30.610> want<00:01:30.820> to<00:01:30.880> do<00:01:31.060> is

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
fast at all yet what you want to do is

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.990 
fast at all yet what you want to do is
get<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.600> bounce<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.310> alternate<00:01:33.310> so<00:01:33.729> you<00:01:33.850> go

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
get the bounce and alternate so you go

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.550 
get the bounce and alternate so you go
like<00:01:34.180> this<00:01:34.390> just<00:01:36.930> nice<00:01:37.930> and<00:01:37.960> slow

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
like this just nice and slow

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.340 
like this just nice and slow
the<00:01:38.890> main<00:01:39.159> objective<00:01:39.880> here<00:01:39.909> is<00:01:40.299> to<00:01:40.960> get<00:01:41.229> the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
the main objective here is to get the

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.380 
the main objective here is to get the
stick<00:01:41.560> bouncing<00:01:42.039> as<00:01:42.939> you<00:01:43.119> get<00:01:43.270> more

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
stick bouncing as you get more

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.870 
stick bouncing as you get more
comfortable<00:01:43.600> with<00:01:44.049> it<00:01:44.229> you<00:01:44.950> get<00:01:45.100> faster<00:01:45.640> and

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
comfortable with it you get faster and

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.050 
comfortable with it you get faster and
the<00:01:46.360> alternating<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:50.520> then<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:51.670> don't<00:01:51.880> want

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
the alternating and then you don't want

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.770 
the alternating and then you don't want
to<00:01:52.119> be<00:01:52.210> going<00:01:52.420> off<00:01:52.659> like<00:01:54.420> skipping<00:01:55.420> down<00:01:55.630> the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
to be going off like skipping down the

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.639 
to be going off like skipping down the
road<00:01:55.929> or<00:01:56.049> something<00:01:56.080> you<00:01:56.350> want<00:01:56.409> to<00:01:56.530> make<00:01:56.619> sure

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
road or something you want to make sure

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.980 
road or something you want to make sure
nice<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:57.880> even<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.390> if<00:01:58.509> you<00:01:58.600> start<00:01:58.869> in<00:01:58.929> the

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
nice and even and if you start in the

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.770 
nice and even and if you start in the
skip<00:01:59.229> go<00:01:59.649> a<00:01:59.679> little<00:01:59.979> bit<00:02:00.159> slower<00:02:00.399> get<00:02:01.240> it<00:02:01.360> even

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
skip go a little bit slower get it even

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.840 
skip go a little bit slower get it even
get<00:02:01.959> those<00:02:02.140> muscles<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.709> memorize<00:02:03.130> it<00:02:03.340> evenly

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
get those muscles to memorize it evenly
