00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.620
 knitting buttons on Bourdon Burdonov 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.740
 called 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.680
 rope or thread folded in several 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.680
 just to be more convenient to do 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:26.500
 bourdon I will use a small 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:29.740
 strip the cardboard and cut off slightly the edges with 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.039
 one side of this strip and to 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.370
 fasten the tip of the thread make an incision with 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:43.510
 the other side now put the end 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:46.620
 thread notch and wind the thread with another 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.620
 hand cardboard 

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:53.139
 reel 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:55.449
 her as many times as we need 

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:57.989
 in order to make burton you can 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.760
 make it thicker you can make it and 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.039
 thinner 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.850
 Here I will be thick enough 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.710
 now slightly push the edge of the thread for 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.470
 to make it better 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.850
 undergirding the drone can even bend 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:23.100
 a little bit now carton for it to be 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:23.100
 easier to make the hook is threading under the thread 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:33.120
 then grab the working thread and 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:36.790
 we drag it under the thread further 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:41.670
 grab the working thread and drag 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:44.340
 through the loop and now we will tie 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.130
 bourdon with single crochets 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:52.990
 will repeat the same hook 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:56.640
 dress under the threads bourdon seize 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.640
 then working thread 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.500
 we drag it through the drone and here on 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.880
 hook two loops now again 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.810
 grab a thread and two loops 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:16.020
 tying together in this way will 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:20.730
 crocheted without crochet and further 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:24.000
 we repeat the same way 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.980
 repeat several times before 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.940
 take off 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:37.280
 Threads from our carton 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.620
 partially tied with a boorhead and now thread 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.010
 it is necessary to remove the carton is no longer 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.010
 would need 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:55.560
 neatly carefully remove the cardboard box and 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:03:00.239
 We will continue to tie our bourdon already 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:06.170
 without cardboard we tie it with columns 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:10.620
 nakida hook to drive into the center 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:17.570
 grab the thread and knit together 2 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.570
 loop so completely tied a circle 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:29.100
 in single crochets in this way 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.319
 it turned out the ring on the wrong side 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:37.850
 she looks more convex and now 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:41.040
 tying the very first loop 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:45.390
 connecting loop and connect the first 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:52.970
 and last loops together now thread 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:58.160
 can be cut off and we see what's inside 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:00.239
 this ring is pretty big hole 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:07.970
 to reduce it 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:16.190
 just pull the string and then stretches 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:19.859
 This is a hole and her glasses will not be Windows 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:24.020
 this element can be used as 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:28.280
 button or decorate them with flowers and 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:32.070
 Irish motives are good people 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:35.870
 put likes and how do we know that 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.610
 did not work in vain for new lessons 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.820
 Subscribe and then miss the thing 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.820
 interesting
