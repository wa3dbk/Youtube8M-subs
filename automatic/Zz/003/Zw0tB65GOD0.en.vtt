00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
Sly Cooper c.r.e.a.m trailers there's

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.859 
Sly Cooper c.r.e.a.m trailers there's
always<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.640> Eiffel<00:01:48.970> Tower<00:01:49.000> and<00:01:49.570> there's

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
probably be expecting france as a map

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.999 
probably be expecting france as a map
somewhere<00:01:54.610> in<00:01:54.820> France<00:01:55.090> because<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:56.590> I<00:01:56.770> believe

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
somewhere in France because if I believe

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.350 
somewhere in France because if I believe
correctly<00:01:57.310> haven't<00:01:57.820> played<00:01:58.000> them<00:01:58.179> in<00:01:58.210> a

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
correctly haven't played them in a

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.090 
correctly haven't played them in a
really<00:01:58.660> long<00:01:58.690> time<00:01:58.840> ever<00:01:59.289> since<00:01:59.410> I<00:01:59.710> had<00:01:59.890> them

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
really long time ever since I had them

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.340 
really long time ever since I had them
for<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.340> ps2<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:00.789> I<00:02:00.970> still<00:02:01.179> do<00:02:01.390> but<00:02:01.690> I<00:02:02.140> think

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
for the ps2 and I still do but I think

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.669 
for the ps2 and I still do but I think
there<00:02:02.860> I<00:02:03.280> think<00:02:03.880> Dimitri's<00:02:04.450> map<00:02:05.229> which<00:02:05.500> was

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
there I think Dimitri's map which was

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.449 
there I think Dimitri's map which was
the<00:02:05.830> first<00:02:06.070> one<00:02:06.280> in<00:02:06.490> slide<00:02:07.360> 2<00:02:07.720> was<00:02:08.259> in<00:02:08.619> France<00:02:09.039> I

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459

finish this training with the Guru so we
know<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:08.440> um<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:11.380> I<00:03:11.440> is<00:03:11.590> definitely<00:03:12.010> gonna<00:03:12.100> be

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
know that um so I is definitely gonna be

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.240 
know that um so I is definitely gonna be
back<00:03:12.430> in<00:03:12.579> the<00:03:12.640> game<00:03:12.820> so<00:03:13.480> if<00:03:13.930> Murr<00:03:14.709> is<00:03:14.890> not<00:03:15.070> in

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
back in the game so if Murr is not in

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.789 
back in the game so if Murr is not in
this<00:03:15.459> it's<00:03:15.820> just<00:03:16.090> gonna<00:03:16.480> be<00:03:16.540> badly<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.380> made

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
this it's just gonna be badly and made

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.860 
this it's just gonna be badly and made
through<00:03:18.040> baby<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:18.880> have<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.359> get<00:03:19.540> sliced

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
through baby that have to get sliced

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.270 
through baby that have to get sliced
memory<00:03:20.440> back<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.829> I'm<00:03:20.890> not<00:03:21.040> even<00:03:21.070> sure

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
memory back and I'm not even sure

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.550 
memory back and I'm not even sure
they're<00:03:21.609> going<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.790> do<00:03:21.910> that<00:03:22.090> um<00:03:22.329> so<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.290> story

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
they're going to do that um so the story

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.590 
they're going to do that um so the story
might<00:03:23.890> be<00:03:24.100> a<00:03:24.130> little<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.730> storyline<00:03:25.239> might<00:03:25.450> be

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
might be a little the storyline might be

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.849 
might be a little the storyline might be
a<00:03:25.630> little<00:03:25.750> shaky<00:03:26.200> which<00:03:26.410> is<00:03:26.560> kind<00:03:26.799> of

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
a little shaky which is kind of

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.970 
a little shaky which is kind of
unfortunate<00:03:27.010> um<00:03:28.199> so<00:03:29.199> we<00:03:29.380> definitely<00:03:29.590> have

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
unfortunate um so we definitely have

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.630 
unfortunate um so we definitely have
safe<00:03:30.250> houses<00:03:30.459> again

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
safe houses again

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.050 
safe houses again
I think<00:03:31.910> it's<00:03:32.030> basically<00:03:32.569> going<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.900> be<00:03:32.960> just

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
I think it's basically going to be just

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.160 
I think it's basically going to be just
anything<00:03:35.060> i'm<00:03:35.270> gonna<00:03:35.510> be<00:03:35.660> like<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.959> same

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
anything i'm gonna be like the same

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.960 
anything i'm gonna be like the same
format<00:03:36.560> so<00:03:36.770> i<00:03:36.800> three<00:03:37.130> just<00:03:37.340> little<00:03:37.610> remastered

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
format so i three just little remastered

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.370 
format so i three just little remastered
with<00:03:38.530> better<00:03:39.530> graphics<00:03:39.800> um<00:03:40.900> but<00:03:41.900> hopefully

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
with better graphics um but hopefully

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.350 
with better graphics um but hopefully
they<00:03:42.590> continue<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.370> money<00:03:43.550> system<00:03:43.880> because<00:03:44.330> i

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
they continue the money system because i

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.890 
they continue the money system because i
like<00:03:44.630> that<00:03:44.920> um<00:03:45.920> so<00:03:46.850> this<00:03:47.030> video<00:03:47.390> footage<00:03:47.600> isn't

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
like that um so this video footage isn't

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.810 
like that um so this video footage isn't
mine<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:48.170> couldn't<00:03:48.620> import<00:03:49.070> it<00:03:49.250> cuz<00:03:49.430> of<00:03:49.550> me<00:03:49.640> on
