a<00:00:16.410> sphere<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:17.420> pre<00:00:18.420> set<00:00:18.660> these<00:00:18.840> up<00:00:18.869> because<00:00:19.350> I

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
a sphere I pre set these up because I

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.410 
a sphere I pre set these up because I
can't<00:00:19.770> get<00:00:19.949> on<00:00:20.100> camera<00:00:20.400> I'm<00:00:20.580> using<00:00:20.820> my<00:00:21.470> phone

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
but you just get these triangles and you

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.319 
but you just get these triangles and you
get<00:00:31.920> four<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.189> them<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.640> line<00:00:32.850> them<00:00:33.000> up<00:00:33.120> in

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
get four of them and line them up in

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.830 
get four of them and line them up in
line<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.840> keep<00:00:33.989> doing<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.350> he<00:00:35.130> uses<00:00:35.340> all<00:00:35.840> 216

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
if you're good at making the triangles

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.380 
if you're good at making the triangles
in<00:00:45.120> any<00:00:45.270> way<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:46.079> want<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.379> set<00:00:46.559> them<00:00:46.710> up<00:00:46.860> so

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
in any way you want to set them up so

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.260 
in any way you want to set them up so
yeah<00:00:48.980> let<00:00:49.980> me<00:00:50.100> put<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.700> side<00:00:50.789> while<00:00:51.210> I

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
yeah let me put this to the side while I

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.760 
yeah let me put this to the side while I
do<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.989> make<00:00:52.199> sure<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.350> don't<00:00:52.469> mess

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
do that just to make sure I don't mess

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:01.970 
do that just to make sure I don't mess
up<00:00:53.899> keep<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.079> all<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.469> view<00:00:58.039> okay<00:01:00.620> so<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.680> just

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
up keep it all in view okay so you just

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.820 
up keep it all in view okay so you just
do<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.989> do<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:05.420> do<00:01:06.420> that

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
do that do that do that

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.150 
do that do that do that
do<00:01:08.790> that

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.440 

then<00:01:14.160> it<00:01:14.340> will<00:01:14.460> look<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.120> I'll<00:01:15.240> have

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
then it will look like that I'll have

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.300 
then it will look like that I'll have
five<00:01:15.690> points<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.200> top<00:01:16.380> one<00:01:16.560> two<00:01:16.740> three<00:01:17.100> four

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
five points on top one two three four

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.880 
five points on top one two three four
five<00:01:17.340> if<00:01:18.120> I<00:01:18.510> point<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> bottom<00:01:19.230> one<00:01:19.380> two<00:01:19.560> three

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
five if I point to bottom one two three

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.400 
five if I point to bottom one two three
four<00:01:20.130> five<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.790> they'll<00:01:21.660> have<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.870> strip<00:01:22.260> in

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
four five and they'll have a strip in

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.980 
four five and they'll have a strip in
the<00:01:22.440> middle<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:23.100> will<00:01:23.250> look<00:01:23.400> like<00:01:23.610> one<00:01:24.270> facing

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the middle it will look like one facing

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.470 
the middle it will look like one facing
that<00:01:25.140> way<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.550> other<00:01:26.580> rocks<00:01:26.940> are<00:01:27.150> facing

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
that way and the other rocks are facing

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.110 
that way and the other rocks are facing
that<00:01:27.630> way<00:01:27.690> so<00:01:27.840> when<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.290> connect<00:01:28.680> together

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
that way so when they connect together

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.060 
that way so when they connect together
there<00:01:30.120> would<00:01:30.210> be<00:01:30.240> an<00:01:30.450> issue<00:01:30.600> anyway<00:01:31.500> I'm<00:01:31.770> going

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
there would be an issue anyway I'm going

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.000 
there would be an issue anyway I'm going
to<00:01:32.130> connect<00:01:32.460> these<00:01:32.610> together<00:01:32.850> now<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:34.170> give<00:01:34.980> me

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
to connect these together now so give me

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.500 
to connect these together now so give me
another<00:01:35.340> moment<00:01:35.550> put<00:01:36.120> them<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.330> my<00:01:36.360> hand<00:01:36.690> I

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
another moment put them in my hand I

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.240 
another moment put them in my hand I
guess<00:01:39.510> you<00:01:39.660> can<00:01:39.810> watch<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.320> too<00:01:40.590> footwear

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
guess you can watch that too footwear

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.040 
guess you can watch that too footwear
don't<00:01:41.460> mess<00:01:41.640> up<00:01:42.530> because<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.710> would<00:01:43.950> suck

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
don't mess up because that would suck

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:54.500 
don't mess up because that would suck
okay<00:01:46.050> got<00:01:46.830> it<00:01:47.690> so<00:01:50.390> one<00:01:51.390> sec<00:01:51.830> just<00:01:53.510> getting

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
okay got it so one sec just getting

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.980 
okay got it so one sec just getting
worked<00:01:54.960> up<00:01:55.340> okay<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.390> like<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.720> in<00:01:57.900> your

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
worked up okay so it's like this in your

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.800 
worked up okay so it's like this in your
hand<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.880> just<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:01.970> mean<00:02:02.970> you<00:02:03.330> can<00:02:03.480> do<00:02:03.660> this

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
hand and just I mean you can do this

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.250 
hand and just I mean you can do this
faster<00:02:04.470> but<00:02:05.090> just<00:02:06.090> for<00:02:06.300> the<00:02:06.330> sake<00:02:06.570> for<00:02:06.900> I<00:02:07.020> did

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
faster but just for the sake for I did

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.960 
faster but just for the sake for I did
it<00:02:07.380> slow<00:02:07.650> so<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:07.950> could<00:02:08.220> see<00:02:08.399> what<00:02:08.550> happens

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
it slow so you could see what happens

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:16.760 
it slow so you could see what happens
and<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.929> makes<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.200> ball<00:02:10.880> so<00:02:12.050> that's<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:15.020> I<00:02:16.020> think

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
and it makes a ball so that's it I think

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.229 
and it makes a ball so that's it I think
it's<00:02:16.920> pretty<00:02:17.100> neat<00:02:17.510> pretty<00:02:18.510> cool<00:02:18.840> trick<00:02:20.239> good

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
it's pretty neat pretty cool trick good

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.710 
it's pretty neat pretty cool trick good
