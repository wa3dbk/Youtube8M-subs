have<00:03:42.329> skyrocketed<00:03:43.199> over<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.440> years<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.739> mean

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
have skyrocketed over the years I mean

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.610 
have skyrocketed over the years I mean
just<00:03:44.069> exploded<00:03:44.909> to<00:03:45.419> outrageous<00:03:46.229> amounts<00:03:46.560> of

just exploded to outrageous amounts of

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.589 
just exploded to outrageous amounts of
money<00:03:46.739> right<00:03:46.979> now<00:03:47.129> and<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:48.299> Raleigh

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
money right now and the Raleigh

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.080 
money right now and the Raleigh
community<00:03:49.169> offers<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.769> much<00:03:50.099> lower<00:03:50.370> cost<00:03:50.790> of

community offers a much lower cost of
living<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.810> therefore<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:53.220> cost<00:03:53.549> of<00:03:53.760> making

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:58.229 
much lower than it is in California that

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:59.659
