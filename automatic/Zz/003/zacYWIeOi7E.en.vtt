00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
of the minifigure is is good and it's a

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:50.160 
of the minifigure is is good and it's a
good<00:01:40.660> buy<00:01:40.900> for<00:01:43.020> only<00:01:44.020> about<00:01:44.470> a<00:01:44.860> dollar<00:01:49.170> it's

good buy for only about a dollar it's

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.960 
good buy for only about a dollar it's
just<00:01:50.530> that<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.890> plastic<00:01:51.370> on<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:51.850> weapon<00:01:52.690> is

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
just that the plastic on the weapon is

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.950 
just that the plastic on the weapon is
not<00:01:54.970> as<00:01:55.180> shiny<00:01:55.570> I<00:01:55.869> think<00:01:56.170> as<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.650> real<00:01:56.830> Lego

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
not as shiny I think as the real Lego

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.840 
not as shiny I think as the real Lego
but<00:01:59.160> it's<00:02:00.160> playable<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:02.460> still<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.610> same<00:02:03.820> so

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
but it's playable and still the same so

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.300 
but it's playable and still the same so
I<00:02:04.600> would<00:02:04.930> have<00:02:05.140> you<00:02:05.350> recommend<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:05.979> booster

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
I would have you recommend the booster

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.680 
I would have you recommend the booster
packs<00:02:06.580> of<00:02:06.820> ninja<00:02:07.149> Bella<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.940> that's<00:02:10.209> it<00:02:10.420> and
