he<00:04:48.300> ate<00:04:48.390> that<00:04:49.050> you<00:04:49.350> know<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.590> first<00:04:49.770> day<00:04:49.920> he

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
he ate that you know the first day he

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.770 
he ate that you know the first day he
was<00:04:50.190> on<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.280> plan<00:04:50.550> and<00:04:50.580> he<00:04:50.820> was<00:04:50.970> eating<00:04:51.180> salad

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
was on the plan and he was eating salad

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.550 
was on the plan and he was eating salad
he<00:04:52.410> was<00:04:52.760> gagging<00:04:53.760> over<00:04:54.450> salad<00:04:54.960> over<00:04:55.380> just

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
he was gagging over salad over just

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.810 
he was gagging over salad over just
lettuce<00:04:55.890> and<00:04:57.110> so<00:04:58.110> I<00:04:58.190> feared<00:04:59.190> that<00:04:59.310> when<00:04:59.610> he

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
lettuce and so I feared that when he

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.300 
lettuce and so I feared that when he
gets<00:05:00.000> off<00:05:00.150> the<00:05:00.330> plan<00:05:00.540> he<00:05:00.780> too<00:05:00.990> will<00:05:01.200> have<00:05:01.310> you

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
gets off the plan he too will have you

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.800 
gets off the plan he too will have you
know<00:05:02.370> relapse<00:05:02.940> or<00:05:03.180> whatever<00:05:03.450> they<00:05:03.570> want<00:05:03.750> to

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
know relapse or whatever they want to

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.440 
know relapse or whatever they want to
call<00:05:03.960> it<00:05:04.250> where<00:05:05.250> he'll<00:05:05.430> start<00:05:05.730> eating<00:05:06.120> all
