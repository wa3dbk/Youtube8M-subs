00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
so you can click on people's like this

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.770 
so you can click on people's like this
one<00:00:23.279> see<00:00:24.279> where<00:00:24.400> they're<00:00:24.580> going

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:25.780 
one see where they're going

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.740 
one see where they're going
with<00:00:25.900> the<00:00:26.110> hat

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
with the hat

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.450 
with the hat
Yeah<00:00:27.929> right<00:00:28.109> buy<00:00:28.590> something

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.790 

so<00:00:31.699> the<00:00:31.789> game<00:00:32.000> is<00:00:32.029> actually<00:00:32.599> not<00:00:32.750> designed<00:00:33.290> to

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
so the game is actually not designed to

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.420 
so the game is actually not designed to
support<00:00:34.130> this<00:00:34.340> view<00:00:34.700> so<00:00:35.360> occasionally

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
support this view so occasionally

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.799 
support this view so occasionally
pictures<00:00:37.430> with<00:00:37.579> the<00:00:37.700> graphics<00:00:38.150> but<00:00:38.450> it's<00:00:38.720> a

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
pictures with the graphics but it's a

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:46.709 
pictures with the graphics but it's a
lot<00:00:38.989> more<00:00:39.170> fun<00:00:39.440> getting<00:00:39.829> a<00:00:40.010> street-level

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.069 

dude<00:00:47.940> vehicle<00:00:48.940> and<00:00:49.239> they<00:00:49.359> pull<00:00:49.719> into<00:00:49.870> their

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
dude vehicle and they pull into their

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.189 
dude vehicle and they pull into their
residents<00:00:50.559> here

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
residents here

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.049 
residents here
so<00:00:52.559> then<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> pedestrian<00:00:53.699> account

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
so then you have the pedestrian account

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.700 
so then you have the pedestrian account
the<00:00:54.179> cars<00:00:54.359> just<00:00:54.510> going<00:00:54.929> disappear

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.880

stations<00:02:16.430> normally<00:02:16.849> because<00:02:17.060> normally<00:02:17.360> you

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
stations normally because normally you

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.140

only have a faraway bird's-eye view so

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.640 
only have a faraway bird's-eye view so
as<00:02:20.239> we<00:02:20.360> get<00:02:20.510> down<00:02:20.720> here<00:02:21.020> you'll<00:02:21.170> see<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.410> bunch

as we get down here you'll see a bunch

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.479 
as we get down here you'll see a bunch
of<00:02:21.970> graphics<00:02:22.970> connections<00:02:23.599> but<00:02:23.900> just<00:02:24.620> harder

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
of graphics connections but just harder

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.340 
of graphics connections but just harder
than<00:02:25.580> that

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.699 

this<00:03:02.730> one's<00:03:02.970> obviously<00:03:03.390> not<00:03:03.600> on<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:04.470> line

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
this one's obviously not on that line

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.270 
this one's obviously not on that line
and<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.940> it's<00:03:06.150> gotta<00:03:06.630> wait<00:03:06.840> till<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:08.040> next

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
so the metro pulls up but our passenger

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:59.230 
so the metro pulls up but our passenger
stays<00:03:52.030> on<00:03:52.240> board

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.240 

let's<00:03:59.480> speed<00:03:59.840> that<00:04:00.020> up<00:04:00.050> a<00:04:00.230> bit<00:04:00.620> there<00:04:01.010> we<00:04:01.100> go

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
let's speed that up a bit there we go

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.150 
let's speed that up a bit there we go
off<00:04:01.430> we<00:04:01.610> go<00:04:01.760> again<00:04:02.110> we<00:04:03.110> can<00:04:03.260> see<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.590> cross<00:04:03.830> on

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
off we go again we can see the cross on

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.690 
off we go again we can see the cross on
that<00:04:04.190> tree<00:04:04.610> line<00:04:04.790> there<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:10.280> so<00:04:10.490> we're

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
that tree line there and so we're

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.750 
that tree line there and so we're
pulling<00:04:11.060> into<00:04:11.210> a<00:04:11.500> double<00:04:12.500> level<00:04:12.760> metro

this<00:06:26.150> bus<00:06:26.450> stop<00:06:26.750> which<00:06:27.290> is<00:06:27.320> a<00:06:27.440> good<00:06:27.650> strategy

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
this bus stop which is a good strategy

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.870 
this bus stop which is a good strategy
it<00:06:28.430> means<00:06:28.790> that<00:06:29.090> people<00:06:30.040> can<00:06:31.040> get<00:06:31.400> around<00:06:31.520> more

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
it means that people can get around more

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.080 
it means that people can get around more
easily<00:06:32.590> by<00:06:33.590> swapping<00:06:34.220> from<00:06:34.520> one<00:06:34.700> line<00:06:34.910> to

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
easily by swapping from one line to

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.140 
easily by swapping from one line to
another<00:06:35.120> without<00:06:35.810> having<00:06:36.140> to<00:06:36.230> walk<00:06:36.440> between

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
another without having to walk between

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
another without having to walk between
non-shared<00:06:38.150> bus<00:06:38.390> stations<00:06:40.870> we're<00:06:41.870> getting<00:06:42.080> on

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.170 
non-shared bus stations we're getting on

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:48.490 
non-shared bus stations we're getting on
this<00:06:42.320> bus<00:06:42.620> yeah<00:06:43.610> so<00:06:44.500> person<00:06:45.500> is<00:06:45.620> moving<00:06:47.500> time

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
this bus yeah so person is moving time

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:54.820 
this bus yeah so person is moving time
to<00:06:48.680> get<00:06:48.800> on<00:06:48.890> board

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:00.400 

say<00:06:55.610> off<00:06:56.120> we<00:06:56.390> go<00:06:57.700> pass<00:06:58.700> an<00:06:58.940> ice<00:06:59.060> pack<00:06:59.540> I<00:06:59.900> do<00:07:00.110> like

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.410 
say off we go pass an ice pack I do like

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.490 
say off we go pass an ice pack I do like
the<00:07:00.530> views<00:07:00.830> you<00:07:00.860> can<00:07:01.010> get<00:07:01.310> from<00:07:01.490> this

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
the views you can get from this

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.670 
the views you can get from this
street-level<00:07:03.500> camera<00:07:05.200> this<00:07:06.200> is<00:07:06.380> not<00:07:06.530> our

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 
street-level camera this is not our

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.440 
street-level camera this is not our
stuff<00:07:06.920> though<00:07:07.190> so<00:07:09.640> having<00:07:10.640> multiple<00:07:11.150> stops

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:11.450 
stuff though so having multiple stops

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.110 
stuff though so having multiple stops
along<00:07:11.750> a<00:07:11.810> line<00:07:12.190> you<00:07:13.190> know<00:07:13.310> is<00:07:13.460> efficient<00:07:14.060> for

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 
along a line you know is efficient for

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.000 
along a line you know is efficient for
having<00:07:14.480> less<00:07:14.720> buy<00:07:14.960> less<00:07:15.200> buses<00:07:15.680> but<00:07:15.890> it

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.010 
having less buy less buses but it

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.120 
having less buy less buses but it
certainly<00:07:16.280> slows<00:07:16.760> down<00:07:17.030> the<00:07:17.180> bus<00:07:17.330> service<00:07:17.630> I

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.130 
certainly slows down the bus service I

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.760 
certainly slows down the bus service I
found<00:07:19.130> there's<00:07:19.310> a<00:07:19.370> lot<00:07:19.490> of<00:07:19.610> value<00:07:19.940> in<00:07:20.210> having

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:20.770 
found there's a lot of value in having

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.640 
found there's a lot of value in having
express<00:07:21.770> buses<00:07:22.100> which<00:07:22.870> only<00:07:23.870> start<00:07:24.290> and<00:07:24.440> stop

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:24.650 
express buses which only start and stop

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:31.000 
express buses which only start and stop
at<00:07:24.830> a<00:07:24.860> few<00:07:25.280> of<00:07:25.580> them<00:07:25.850> most<00:07:26.770> commonly<00:07:27.770> used

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.010 

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.180 

yeah<00:07:31.430> bus<00:07:31.640> stops<00:07:32.500> okay<00:07:33.500> and<00:07:33.710> then<00:07:33.800> we<00:07:33.890> have<00:07:34.040> to

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:34.190 
yeah bus stops okay and then we have to

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:43.780 
yeah bus stops okay and then we have to
walk<00:07:34.370> the<00:07:34.430> rest<00:07:34.700> of<00:07:34.940> the<00:07:35.030> way<00:07:35.150> home<00:07:42.400> and<00:07:43.400> we

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:43.790 
walk the rest of the way home and we

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:48.160 
walk the rest of the way home and we
walk<00:07:43.970> up<00:07:44.150> to<00:07:44.300> the<00:07:44.390> apartment<00:07:44.720> and<00:07:45.760> in<00:07:46.760> we<00:07:46.940> go<00:07:47.170> so

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:48.170 
walk up to the apartment and in we go so

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.860 
walk up to the apartment and in we go so
how<00:07:48.530> long<00:07:48.830> has<00:07:49.160> a<00:07:49.190> trip<00:07:49.880> taken<00:07:50.330> you<00:07:50.540> can<00:07:50.690> kind

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:50.870 
how long has a trip taken you can kind

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.750 
how long has a trip taken you can kind
of<00:07:50.900> look<00:07:51.020> at<00:07:51.140> the<00:07:51.320> days<00:07:51.680> at<00:07:52.220> the<00:07:52.340> bottom<00:07:52.670> I

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:52.760 
of look at the days at the bottom I

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.830 
of look at the days at the bottom I
don't<00:07:52.820> know<00:07:52.970> if<00:07:53.060> you<00:07:53.150> can<00:07:53.330> see<00:07:53.570> it<00:07:53.660> on<00:07:53.750> the

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 
don't know if you can see it on the

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.090 
don't know if you can see it on the
resolution<00:07:54.410> of<00:07:54.500> the<00:07:54.590> screen<00:07:56.650> that's<00:07:57.650> where<00:07:57.980> we

resolution of the screen that's where we
