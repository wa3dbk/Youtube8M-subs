00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
could say spawn cool things like

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.920 
could say spawn cool things like
technically<00:00:17.520> you're<00:00:17.670> not<00:00:17.699> spawning<00:00:18.510> anything

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
technically you're not spawning anything

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.689 
technically you're not spawning anything
but<00:00:19.590> you're<00:00:19.740> actually<00:00:20.070> using<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.369> different

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
demand but you still end up technically

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:45.860 
demand but you still end up technically

pretty much any type of spawn so that
further<00:01:19.590> ado<00:01:19.860> let's<00:01:20.070> begin

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
further ado let's begin

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.030 
further ado let's begin
so<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.659> community<00:01:22.020> needs<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:23.330> /set<00:01:24.330> set<00:01:25.040> block

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
so the community needs a /set set block

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.149 
so the community needs a /set set block

learned that these things are actually
called<00:02:04.040> squiggly<00:02:04.640> brackets<00:02:05.200> kind<00:02:06.200> of<00:02:06.289> weird

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
called squiggly brackets kind of weird

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.090 
called squiggly brackets kind of weird
look<00:02:06.740> I<00:02:06.920> guess<00:02:07.100> that's<00:02:07.280> what<00:02:07.399> your<00:02:07.520> name<00:02:07.729> is

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
look I guess that's what your name is

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.009 
look I guess that's what your name is
so<00:02:10.100> I<00:02:10.340> guess<00:02:10.519> the<00:02:10.640> trash<00:02:10.940> is<00:02:11.090> our<00:02:11.420> elemental

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
so I guess the trash is our elemental

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:20.770 
so I guess the trash is our elemental

you and tip G yeah this capital e no
space<00:02:21.080> at<00:02:21.410> all<00:02:21.440> i<00:02:21.800> deep<00:02:22.670> into<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.300> I<00:02:23.330> D<00:02:23.510> :

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
space at all i deep into the I D :

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.270 
space at all i deep into the I D :
the<00:02:25.700> new<00:02:25.850> space<00:02:26.209> then<00:02:27.200> let's<00:02:27.470> say<00:02:27.769> you<00:02:27.800> want<00:02:28.220> to

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
the new space then let's say you want to

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.170 
the new space then let's say you want to
do<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.840> repost<00:02:29.840> phone<00:02:31.540> then<00:02:32.540> BOOM<00:02:33.380> yeah<00:02:34.180> smaller

that s creepers and I'm going to slash

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.040 
that s creepers and I'm going to slash
time<00:02:42.620> set

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:55.290 

and<00:02:49.500> 15,000<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:51.190> know<00:02:51.340> that<00:02:51.520> tonight<00:02:54.300> then

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
and 15,000 and know that tonight then

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.730 
and 15,000 and know that tonight then
you<00:02:55.720> can<00:02:55.870> see<00:02:56.050> this<00:02:56.230> doll<00:02:56.770> spawn<00:02:57.220> occurs

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
you can see this doll spawn occurs

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.180 
you can see this doll spawn occurs
pretty<00:02:59.740> cool<00:03:00.040> now<00:03:00.700> we<00:03:00.760> can<00:03:01.030> do<00:03:01.150> none<00:03:01.510> of<00:03:01.540> them

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
pretty cool now we can do none of them

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.730 
pretty cool now we can do none of them
let's<00:03:03.190> do<00:03:03.600> anger<00:03:04.600> oh<00:03:07.320> then<00:03:08.320> you<00:03:08.410> get<00:03:08.590> an

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
let's do anger oh then you get an

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.620 
let's do anger oh then you get an
interval<00:03:09.010> smaller<00:03:09.190> that<00:03:09.520> spawns<00:03:10.000> under<00:03:10.450> honey

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
interval smaller that spawns under honey

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:17.830 
interval smaller that spawns under honey
trap

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.300 

now<00:03:19.090> now<00:03:20.090> not<00:03:20.930> only<00:03:21.110> that<00:03:21.349> this<00:03:21.500> spawner<00:03:21.980> work

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
now now not only that this spawner work

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.460 
now now not only that this spawner work
with<00:03:22.580> logs<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.420> also<00:03:23.599> works<00:03:23.900> at<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.200> things

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
with logs it also works at the things

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.320 
with logs it also works at the things
that<00:03:24.890> you<00:03:25.310> can<00:03:25.459> summon<00:03:25.730> as<00:03:25.880> long<00:03:26.060> as<00:03:26.180> it's

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
that you can summon as long as it's

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.080 
that you can summon as long as it's
summonable<00:03:27.190> with<00:03:28.190> a<00:03:28.220> slash<00:03:28.520> summon<00:03:28.910> command

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
summonable with a slash summon command

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.030 
summonable with a slash summon command
and<00:03:29.569> put<00:03:30.410> it<00:03:30.500> in<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.650> smaller<00:03:30.950> light<00:03:33.040> under

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
and put it in a smaller light under

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.780 
and put it in a smaller light under
crystal<00:03:38.050> then<00:03:39.050> it<00:03:39.470> won't<00:03:39.650> spawn<00:03:40.099> anything<00:03:40.580> but

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
crystal then it won't spawn anything but

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.930 
crystal then it won't spawn anything but
it<00:03:40.910> still<00:03:41.239> looks<00:03:41.390> pretty<00:03:41.540> cool<00:03:42.700> little<00:03:43.700> spin

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
it still looks pretty cool little spin
