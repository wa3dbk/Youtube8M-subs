hello I mean on we are going to attempt

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.900 
hello I mean on we are going to attempt
to<00:00:03.090> make<00:00:03.240> cobalt<00:00:03.570> at<00:00:03.720> work<00:00:04.220> for<00:00:05.220> this<00:00:05.400> we<00:00:05.879> have

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
to make cobalt at work for this we have

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.290 
to make cobalt at work for this we have
the<00:00:06.509> following<00:00:06.660> set<00:00:07.080> up<00:00:07.259> we<00:00:07.710> have<00:00:08.010> our<00:00:08.370> mock-up

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
the following set up we have our mock-up

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.900 
the following set up we have our mock-up
of<00:00:09.510> meatballs<00:00:10.410> which<00:00:10.920> are<00:00:11.160> basically<00:00:11.429> just

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
of meatballs which are basically just

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.510 
of meatballs which are basically just
smashed<00:00:12.240> up<00:00:12.389> raisins<00:00:13.400> note<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.880> size<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.540> them

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
smashed up raisins note the size of them

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.920 
smashed up raisins note the size of them
compared<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.640> my<00:00:17.789> moderately<00:00:18.420> sized<00:00:18.600> finger

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
compared to my moderately sized finger

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.340 
compared to my moderately sized finger
they<00:00:19.500> are<00:00:19.619> small<00:00:19.949> we<00:00:20.670> also<00:00:20.850> have<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.510> bowl<00:00:21.900> with

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
they are small we also have a bowl with

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.929 
they are small we also have a bowl with
some<00:00:22.769> solid<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.850> some<00:00:24.750> salt<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.439> give<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.580> an

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
some solid and some salt to give you an

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.060 
some solid and some salt to give you an
approximation<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.840> sizes<00:00:28.380> here<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.619> cannot

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
approximation of the sizes here I cannot

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.970 
approximation of the sizes here I cannot
because<00:00:29.670> we're<00:00:30.000> just<00:00:30.240> doing<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.510> for<00:00:30.980> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
because we're just doing this for the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.440 
because we're just doing this for the
consistency<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> dough<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.300> need

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
consistency of the dough that you need

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.580 
consistency of the dough that you need
to<00:00:33.600> get<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:34.460> what<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:35.640> do<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.530> we<00:00:37.530> take<00:00:37.739> some

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
to get to what we do is we take some

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.990 
to get to what we do is we take some
room-temperature<00:00:40.590> water<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:43.100> slowly<00:00:44.100> add<00:00:44.789> it

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
room-temperature water and slowly add it

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.040 
room-temperature water and slowly add it
to<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> solid<00:00:46.160> well<00:00:47.160> mixing<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:48.390> becomes

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
to the solid well mixing this becomes

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.959 
to the solid well mixing this becomes
sticky<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> beginning<00:00:52.280> and<00:00:53.280> then<00:00:53.520> as<00:00:53.910> you

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
sticky in the beginning and then as you

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.920 
sticky in the beginning and then as you
can<00:00:54.120> see<00:00:54.329> becomes<00:00:54.629> smallish<00:00:55.530> bundles<00:00:56.930> don't

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
can see becomes smallish bundles don't

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.119 
can see becomes smallish bundles don't
add<00:00:58.170> all<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.680> water<00:00:58.890> at<00:00:59.160> once<00:01:04.129> eventually

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
add all the water at once eventually

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.330 
add all the water at once eventually
what<00:01:05.339> you'll<00:01:05.460> get<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.180> sticky<00:01:06.920> ball<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
what you'll get is this sticky ball the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.120 
what you'll get is this sticky ball the
kind<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.640> saints<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.240> itself<00:01:09.770> that<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
kind of saints to itself that is the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.539 
kind of saints to itself that is the
correct<00:01:11.430> consistency<00:01:12.950> when<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.070> get<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.430> that

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
correct consistency when you get to that

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.539 
correct consistency when you get to that
consistency<00:01:15.180> you're<00:01:16.110> supposed<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.560> let<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
consistency you're supposed to let the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.340 
consistency you're supposed to let the
entire<00:01:17.820> thing<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.420> sit<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.869> about<00:01:18.960> 10

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
entire thing just sit for about 10

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.850 
entire thing just sit for about 10
minutes<00:01:20.810> cover<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.960> with<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.140> light<00:01:22.350> cloth<00:01:22.680> if

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
minutes cover it with a light cloth if

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.380 
minutes cover it with a light cloth if
you<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.159> my<00:01:24.000> grandmother<00:01:24.420> does<00:01:26.150> near<00:01:27.150> that

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
you like my grandmother does near that

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.880 
you like my grandmother does near that
looks<00:01:27.630> me<00:01:27.930> about<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.009> right<00:01:29.159> amount<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.490> water

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
looks me about the right amount of water

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.830 
looks me about the right amount of water
so<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.070> kind<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.000> stinky<00:01:33.329> ball<00:01:33.540> doesn't

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
so this kind of stinky ball doesn't

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.360 
so this kind of stinky ball doesn't
stick<00:01:34.140> too<00:01:34.290> hard

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.850 

by<00:01:39.370> letting<00:01:39.880> it<00:01:40.180> sit<00:01:40.660> what<00:01:41.140> we're<00:01:41.350> doing<00:01:41.680> is

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
by letting it sit what we're doing is

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.770 
by letting it sit what we're doing is
we're<00:01:42.070> allowing<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.610> Sola<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.300> suck<00:01:43.540> up<00:01:43.660> all

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
we're allowing the Sola to suck up all

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.900 
we're allowing the Sola to suck up all
the<00:01:43.960> water<00:01:44.050> it<00:01:44.920> will<00:01:45.070> become<00:01:45.370> a<00:01:45.520> little<00:01:45.850> bit

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
the water it will become a little bit

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.570 
the water it will become a little bit
less<00:01:46.150> sticky<00:01:46.390> more<00:01:46.780> hard<00:01:47.050> and<00:01:47.320> more<00:01:48.160> workable

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
less sticky more hard and more workable

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.610 
less sticky more hard and more workable
at<00:01:49.210> that<00:01:49.420> face<00:01:50.370> so<00:01:52.230> this<00:01:53.230> is<00:01:53.260> how<00:01:53.440> it<00:01:53.560> looks

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
at that face so this is how it looks

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.970 
at that face so this is how it looks
right<00:01:53.830> now<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:58.260> we'll<00:01:59.260> meet<00:01:59.500> again<00:01:59.620> in<00:01:59.770> about

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
right now and we'll meet again in about

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.380 
right now and we'll meet again in about
10<00:02:00.250> minutes

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.330 

okay<00:02:05.200> so<00:02:05.830> it<00:02:06.070> has<00:02:06.250> been<00:02:06.280> 10<00:02:06.790> minutes<00:02:08.069> this<00:02:09.069> is

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
okay so it has been 10 minutes this is

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.390 
okay so it has been 10 minutes this is
how<00:02:09.550> our<00:02:09.580> dough<00:02:10.149> looks<00:02:10.420> like<00:02:10.690> now<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:11.500> is<00:02:12.100> not

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
how our dough looks like now it is not

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.360 
how our dough looks like now it is not
as<00:02:12.640> watery<00:02:13.120> when<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:13.810> touch<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.250> doesn't<00:02:15.250> come

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
as watery when I touch it doesn't come

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.900 
as watery when I touch it doesn't come
off<00:02:15.400> it's<00:02:15.880> one<00:02:16.450> ball<00:02:17.160> slightly<00:02:18.160> moist<00:02:18.640> still

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
off it's one ball slightly moist still

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.290 
off it's one ball slightly moist still
in<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.150> bottom<00:02:19.510> nice<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.500> dry<00:02:20.620> on<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.830> top

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
in the bottom nice and dry on the top

it into a nice roll and then we pinch
this<00:02:33.190> is<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.670> size<00:02:33.880> of<00:02:34.150> dough<00:02:34.300> that<00:02:34.510> we<00:02:34.660> use

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
this is the size of dough that we use

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.590

while we're flattening it out we slowly
make<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.310> crevice<00:03:05.850> in<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.840> middle<00:03:07.140> make<00:03:07.350> it

make a crevice in the middle make it

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.960 
make a crevice in the middle make it
into<00:03:07.860> small<00:03:08.400> sort<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.120> both<00:03:10.370> if<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.730> heard

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
meatball put it in the middle and slowly

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:29.450 
meatball put it in the middle and slowly
while<00:03:22.260> pushing<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.770> down<00:03:23.180> we<00:03:24.180> close<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:29.280> dough
