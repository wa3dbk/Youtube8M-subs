the apprenticeship which i think is such

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.900 
the apprenticeship which i think is such
an<00:01:16.590> oxymoron<00:01:17.160> because<00:01:17.310> copied<00:01:17.820> you

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
an oxymoron because copied you

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.010 
an oxymoron because copied you
apprentice<00:01:18.360> for<00:01:18.480> the<00:01:18.660> private<00:01:18.900> investigator

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
without ruining all of that yep so you

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.970

may<00:01:22.800> benefit<00:01:23.160> of<00:01:23.280> all<00:01:23.370> exactly<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.860> but<00:01:25.860> we

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
may benefit of all exactly so but we

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.930 
may benefit of all exactly so but we
just<00:01:26.160> thought<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.520> would<00:01:26.640> be<00:01:26.760> such<00:01:26.910> a

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940
