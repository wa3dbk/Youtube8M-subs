featured as my office but this is

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.499

probably<00:02:08.890> good<00:02:09.039> enough<00:02:09.190> for<00:02:09.250> most<00:02:09.369> people<00:02:09.519> and

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
probably good enough for most people and

I've<00:02:43.900> only<00:02:44.170> installed<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.590> couple<00:02:44.830> of<00:02:44.920> programs

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
I've only installed a couple of programs

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.970 
I've only installed a couple of programs
one<00:02:45.909> of<00:02:46.000> them<00:02:46.120> is<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.690> Firefox<00:02:47.319> browser<00:02:47.440> because

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
one of them is a Firefox browser because

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.260 
one of them is a Firefox browser because
quite<00:02:48.310> frankly<00:02:48.370> I<00:02:48.760> hate

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
quite frankly I hate

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.270 
quite frankly I hate
Internet<00:02:49.720> Explorer<00:02:50.320> I<00:02:50.350> think<00:02:50.830> it's<00:02:50.950> slow<00:02:51.130> and

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
Internet Explorer I think it's slow and

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.760 
Internet Explorer I think it's slow and
pokey<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:51.850> Firefox<00:02:52.390> is<00:02:52.570> much<00:02:52.750> faster<00:02:53.260> but

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
pokey and Firefox is much faster but

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.020 
pokey and Firefox is much faster but
that's<00:02:53.950> just<00:02:54.070> my<00:02:54.250> opinion<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:54.670> might<00:02:54.790> feel

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
that's just my opinion you might feel

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.240 
that's just my opinion you might feel
differently<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:56.110> I've<00:02:56.350> also<00:02:56.500> installed<00:02:56.770> the
