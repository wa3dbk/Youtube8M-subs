00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.970
 of pay so I wait for the company 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:33.420
 rockstar games the creator of this game 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.040
 do not get mad for the rights of 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.510
 author since he had had another video of 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.370
 a claim but good in the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.470
 description of the video will be for you 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.150
 you can download it totally free 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.580
 will be on the mega server so that 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.290
 have no problem downloading it 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.839
 will be what are the archives 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.180
 necessary that are the archives or bb and 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:54.420
 the apk file with version 1.0 point 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.360
 7 what we have to do is how you see 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.460
 starts almost 2.41 gigabytes almost 3 and 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.769
 good this folder that are the data the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.220
 we have to copy and paste it in the 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:08.220
 Android device so we can 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.170
 connect to the computer and let's go to 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.260
 look for the device as you see here is 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.890
 and let's put it on it 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.690
 internal storage but good in 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.230
 this device that is the huawei makes 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.120
 between 610 has a one mode 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.220
 default storage as the 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.410
 sd card with which all the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.240
 applications and all the games are going to 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.370
 the micro sd so in this case I'm going to 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.290
 put it on the sd card but you what 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.990
 you have to put in storage 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.630
 internally forcibly so good there will be 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.360
 micro sd today in the android folder and to 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.620
 the route or bb if you do not have the folder 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.590
 so you think we're going to stick here in the 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.270
 Game data weighing 2.41 gigs 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.970
 so it's a matter of waiting for 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.550
 is the necessary files in the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.180
 good android I will make a small 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.550
 pause so he came back good friends like 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.770
 we see we are about to copy it from 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.520
 archives and as you see already paste what 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.010
 they are archives 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.320
 vb now what we have to do is 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.420
 copy the file to sin with the version 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.730
 1.0 7 as I say is the most 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.980
 updated in this month of January 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.780
 of the year 2015 so they will not have 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.360
 no problem when playing this 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.610
 device is great game then 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.069
 positive anne drake after the file 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.110
 here we are going to stick it where you want in 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.540
 this case we are going to paste it in the root 0 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.459
 sd to find it more quickly a 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.670
 hitter that are the files about and the 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.010
 file here we are going to close this 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.989
 window and masters you serve with the device 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.459
 you have to have downloaded a 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.310
 file manager so that this 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.349
 process works quite well so 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.769
 let's go to the administrator 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:53.069
 files in this case the style explorer 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.970
 so we look for it where we have it 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.970
 the administrator 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.980
 I can not find it, let me know 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.140
 and as you can see, all the 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.600
 folders and how I have passed the file 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.570
 apk of the serantes to the root we are going to 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.850
 install the game quickly will 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.000
 give next following and install the 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.000
 game 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.120
 and we are going to install it in our 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.510
 Android device is recommended 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:32.680
 let this game use it with at least 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.349
 a dual- core processor and a gb in 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.040
 ram so you do not get stuck what it is 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.840
 this game so well let's go to once 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.060
 installed the game let's look it up in 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.330
 the application drawer and we're going to open 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.950
 the game I do not know if it will look good on 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.489
 the video here recording with this 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.769
 application if not then I'll leave a play that 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.200
 I recorded that I'm going to record with the application 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.549
 of screen cast so that they can see 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.540
 more or less now let's give it where 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.540
 says offline 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.940
 and as you see, we get the game for 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.300
 be able to play let's give it start new 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.460
 departure 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.460
 or leave the volume a little 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.090
 and good with the truth the game works 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.260
 pretty good and as I say it is 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.530
 recommended that you play it without 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.270
 devices with 1 gb of ram and a 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.790
 dual-core processor although it has 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.740
 in mind that you may be 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.730
 working with those characteristics like this 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:39.080
 that's good if you have a device I do not know 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.990
 an engine and even in the engine you see it 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.430
 see some slab of when playing but good 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.050
 in this device that is the game already 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.000
 hundreds and hundreds of the truth runs it 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.970
 I do not know if the video is 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.740
 go to see the same as on the device 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.840
 but I hope and it looks good so 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.390

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.880

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.460

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.670
 mission and let's skip it I'm here and 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:08.300
 this everyone already knows and how they see if 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.820
 we can play correctly but 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.980
 that the video does not look so tight and 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.620
