lift up and back down whatever so ya see
this<00:02:30.250> load<00:02:30.610> up<00:02:30.820> tap<00:02:31.180> back<00:02:32.020> down<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.920> then<00:02:33.070> that

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
this load up tap back down and then that

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.730 
this load up tap back down and then that
can<00:02:33.430> turn<00:02:33.640> into<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.090> slide<00:02:34.330> as<00:02:34.690> well<00:02:34.930> that's<00:02:35.620> why

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
can turn into a slide as well that's why

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.300 
can turn into a slide as well that's why
score<00:02:36.180> just<00:02:37.180> pretty<00:02:37.480> much<00:02:37.600> do<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.840> same<00:02:37.900> thing

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
score just pretty much do the same thing

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.530 
score just pretty much do the same thing
next<00:02:39.310> what<00:02:39.490> we're<00:02:39.640> gonna<00:02:39.760> learn<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.270> blunt

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
next what we're gonna learn is the blunt

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
and then we'll go onto the pin slide so

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.780 
and then we'll go onto the pin slide so
um<00:02:42.450> this<00:02:43.450> way<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.720> lift<00:02:44.110> up<00:02:44.490> and<00:02:45.490> your<00:02:45.640> back

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
nose run you you ride up turn lock on

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.060 
nose run you you ride up turn lock on
and<00:04:30.190> then<00:04:30.340> you<00:04:30.490> go<00:04:30.700> up<00:04:31.169> and<00:04:32.169> then<00:04:32.530> for<00:04:32.710> normal

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
and then you go up and then for normal

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:44.010 
and then you go up and then for normal
manual<00:04:33.300> you'll<00:04:34.300> come<00:04:34.540> up<00:04:34.570> to<00:04:35.880> bat<00:04:36.880> and<00:04:43.020> then

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
manual you'll come up to bat and then

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.909 
manual you'll come up to bat and then
Ollie<00:04:44.620> onto<00:04:45.400> there<00:04:48.900> might<00:04:49.900> want<00:04:50.140> to<00:04:50.320> be<00:04:50.830> up
