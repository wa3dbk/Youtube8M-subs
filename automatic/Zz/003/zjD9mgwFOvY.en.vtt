00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.410
 three more games to go and then to sit the first season of young Ajax 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.100
 in the jupiler league there again on Friday evening the promises play at home 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.790
 against excelsior but the last three league games went for the 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.970
 team of fons groenendijk all lost and that while ajax in the weeks 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.869
 was on the right track before that who could conclude that we did 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.220
 very difficult the last few weeks 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.880
 but that is not easy in principle 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.570
 had a big loss against Willem 2 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.500
 that of course it was not good the other two games eindhoven and the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.980
 also volendam 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.990
 yes actually concurrent games were winning more in when 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.290
 the net effe better in the front also the possibilities that have 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.010
 had 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.170
 but a yes that were competitions that had something in it and in which we certainly didn't 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.630
 were fewer with a fairly young group 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.880
 ajax is no longer a candidate due to the defeats of recent weeks 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.910
 for the fourth period title 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.240
 nevertheless there is still plenty to play for, most of them get the playing time and so that 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.280
 also means 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.600
 that you yourself 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.320
 can show to the staff also of the first team yes and tip example is again 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.260
 completely off again kenny tete not the training to that means what he does 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.050
 also trained with the first team again today 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.890
 So yes you can take those steps if you perform well and you do well 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.740
 trains 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.440
 well then you end up eligible 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.890
 I don't have an expiring contract 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.860
 year of course again very happy to stay with ajax and the last three 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.940
 matches 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.500
 I just want to play the viewer so that I can play at the site next season 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.090
 matches the a selection 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.070
 that's why they do it now 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.420
 You know you don't like it 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.570
 tokyo used to be proven to the point 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.450
 fernandez matches in young that i almost have domo scholarship year you only i find 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.390
 that I myself 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.000
 more than scoring manchester must give and maria that happens and 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.540
 they can come along 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.290
 after Friday's game against excelsior, young ajax pol is still playing 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.030
 twice 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.159
 Monday helmond sport awaits and four days later the season ends 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.920
 in the gem against the county does that his team who very much like the playoffs we 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.949
 play 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:14.599
 we ourselves are only a few dots behind the door, the number five or six 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:15.629
 for that matter 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.629
 m the differences are very small there is a large average 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.589
 year we would also like to go to the left row 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:26.949
 I am the car too optimistic and where I also just very curious how 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:29.429

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.329
