00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
weak and fragile hair so if that's you I

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.440 
weak and fragile hair so if that's you I
highly<00:00:37.980> recommend<00:00:38.489> looking<00:00:38.579> into<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.180> and

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
highly recommend looking into this and

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.880 
highly recommend looking into this and
then<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.140> also<00:00:40.290> has<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.100> conditioner<00:00:41.730> as<00:00:41.910> well

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
then it also has the conditioner as well

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.860 
then it also has the conditioner as well
again<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.160> just<00:00:44.430> really<00:00:44.850> really<00:00:45.149> absorbs<00:00:45.719> into

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
again it just really really absorbs into

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.690 
again it just really really absorbs into
the<00:00:46.020> hair<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.590> recommend<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.340> leave<00:00:47.520> this

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the hair I recommend that you leave this

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.520

on<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.090> at<00:00:48.149> least<00:00:48.270> 1<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.690> 3<00:00:48.870> minutes<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.320> then

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
on for at least 1 to 3 minutes and then

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.600 
on for at least 1 to 3 minutes and then
rinse<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.370> out<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.770> then<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.980> have<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.399> new

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
rinse it out and then you have this new
