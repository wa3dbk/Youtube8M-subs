00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.679 

just<00:00:29.960> regular<00:00:30.820> arpeggiated<00:00:31.820> pluck<00:00:32.119> something

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689

I<00:00:32.840> normally<00:00:33.380> do<00:00:33.500> when<00:00:33.680> I<00:00:33.710> play<00:00:33.950> the<00:00:34.040> guitar

this<00:00:35.750> is<00:00:35.900> my<00:00:35.989> EQ<00:00:36.380> for<00:00:36.590> it

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
this is my EQ for it

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.400 
this is my EQ for it
you're<00:00:37.880> probably<00:00:38.059> wondering<00:00:38.450> why<00:00:39.140> there's<00:00:39.350> a

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
you're probably wondering why there's a

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.940 
you're probably wondering why there's a
dip<00:00:39.620> in<00:00:39.860> the<00:00:39.950> EQ<00:00:40.309> and

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
dip in the EQ and

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.070 
dip in the EQ and
this<00:00:42.550> probably<00:00:43.030> sounds<00:00:43.150> a<00:00:43.270> lot<00:00:43.390> better<00:00:43.600> to<00:00:43.960> you

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
this probably sounds a lot better to you

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.800 
this probably sounds a lot better to you
but<00:00:44.860> in<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.100> mix<00:00:45.280> it<00:00:45.480> sounds<00:00:46.480> better<00:00:46.600> with<00:00:46.780> a

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:46.810 
but in the mix it sounds better with a

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.470 
but in the mix it sounds better with a
dip<00:00:47.050> so<00:00:47.710> that<00:00:47.830> the<00:00:47.950> vocals<00:00:48.340> don't<00:00:49.090> clash<00:00:49.300> with

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
dip so that the vocals don't clash with

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.320 
dip so that the vocals don't clash with

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
and depending on the velocity I hit it

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.930 
and depending on the velocity I hit it
at<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.470> Tambor<00:02:14.470> changes<00:02:17.640> well<00:02:18.640> not<00:02:18.819> really

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
at the Tambor changes well not really

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.400 
at the Tambor changes well not really
the<00:02:19.150> Tambor<00:02:19.450> because<00:02:20.310> it's<00:02:21.310> actually<00:02:21.520> a<00:02:22.000> mute

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.830

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
so as I play low notes low velocity

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
so as I play low notes low velocity
notes<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.349> plays<00:02:29.590> bridge<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.490> mute

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
notes it plays bridge to mute

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.370 

here's<00:02:59.400> my<00:02:59.610> EQ<00:03:00.030> for<00:03:00.330> it

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.280 

here<00:03:11.860> I<00:03:11.890> just<00:03:12.430> also<00:03:12.610> added<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.150> stereo<00:03:13.599> shaper

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
here I just also added a stereo shaper

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.150 
here I just also added a stereo shaper
to<00:03:15.010> give<00:03:15.190> that<00:03:15.459> ear<00:03:15.700> candy<00:03:16.150> effect<00:03:16.450> as<00:03:17.140> well<00:03:18.040> as

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
to give that ear candy effect as well as

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:29.610 
to give that ear candy effect as well as
a<00:03:18.190> delay

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.500 

here<00:03:30.549> in<00:03:30.670> my<00:03:30.790> settings<00:03:31.150> for<00:03:31.330> my<00:03:31.480> delay<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:34.180> I

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
here in my settings for my delay and I

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.880 
here in my settings for my delay and I
got<00:03:34.659> some<00:03:34.780> reverb<00:03:35.049> here<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:36.250> further

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
got some reverb here to further

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:52.009 
got some reverb here to further
emphasize<00:03:38.890> this<00:03:39.580> ear<00:03:39.879> candy

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.179 

now<00:03:53.019> you're<00:03:53.140> probably<00:03:53.230> wondering<00:03:53.739> it's<00:03:53.950> out

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:54.189 
now you're probably wondering it's out

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.690 
now you're probably wondering it's out
of<00:03:54.219> tune<00:03:54.629> but<00:03:55.629> it's<00:03:55.989> pretty<00:03:56.890> on<00:03:57.099> point<00:03:57.310> in<00:03:57.549> the

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
of tune but it's pretty on point in the

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.089 
of tune but it's pretty on point in the
track<00:03:57.989> just<00:03:58.989> due<00:03:59.170> to<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.439> automation<00:03:59.829> and

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
track just due to the automation and

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.309 
track just due to the automation and
stuff<00:04:01.200> anyways<00:04:02.310> this<00:04:03.310> is<00:04:03.430> my<00:04:03.549> base<00:04:03.849> you're

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
stuff anyways this is my base you're

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.649 
stuff anyways this is my base you're
probably<00:04:05.319> like<00:04:05.530> this<00:04:05.799> is<00:04:05.890> not<00:04:05.980> a<00:04:06.010> base<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:07.480> will

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
probably like this is not a base it will

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.619 
probably like this is not a base it will
be<00:04:07.870> just<00:04:08.620> wait<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:10.510> I<00:04:10.750> have<00:04:11.170> my<00:04:11.409> pattern<00:04:11.859> here

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
be just wait so I have my pattern here

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.920 
be just wait so I have my pattern here
and<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:15.220> get<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.269> base<00:04:16.479> sound<00:04:16.720> I'm<00:04:16.840> gonna

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
and to get the base sound I'm gonna

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.949 
and to get the base sound I'm gonna
change<00:04:17.199> the<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.919> tune<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:18.820> put<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.720> course

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
change the the tune and put the course

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.850 
change the the tune and put the course
all<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.229> way<00:04:20.320> down<00:04:21.690> so<00:04:22.690> now<00:04:22.840> we<00:04:22.900> have<00:04:23.169> a<00:04:23.440> bit<00:04:23.770> of

all the way down so now we have a bit of

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.210
