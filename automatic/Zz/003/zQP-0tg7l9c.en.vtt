Tim<00:00:46.520> Tebow<00:00:47.079> isn't<00:00:48.079> a<00:00:48.230> great<00:00:48.530> quarterback<00:00:48.980> but

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
Tim Tebow isn't a great quarterback but

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.420 
Tim Tebow isn't a great quarterback but
he<00:00:50.480> definitely<00:00:50.720> has<00:00:51.020> high<00:00:51.260> potential<00:00:51.800> and<00:00:52.280> his

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
he definitely has high potential and his

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.740 
he definitely has high potential and his
worth<00:00:52.730> ethic<00:00:52.970> is<00:00:53.329> just<00:00:53.690> amazing<00:00:54.110> um<00:00:55.510> if<00:00:56.510> the

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
worth ethic is just amazing um if the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.840 
worth ethic is just amazing um if the
Jets<00:00:57.050> wanted<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:57.710> I<00:00:57.739> believe<00:00:58.250> they<00:00:58.399> could<00:00:58.460> move

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
Jets wanted to I believe they could move

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.000 
Jets wanted to I believe they could move
into<00:00:59.000> position<00:00:59.149> like<00:00:59.840> fullback<00:01:00.380> or<00:01:00.410> something

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
into position like fullback or something

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.590 
into position like fullback or something
but<00:01:02.000> I<00:01:02.239> mean<00:01:02.510> that<00:01:02.720> starts<00:01:03.230> unlikely<00:01:04.210> he<00:01:05.210> he

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
but I mean that starts unlikely he he

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.719 
but I mean that starts unlikely he he
could<00:01:05.810> just<00:01:06.079> be<00:01:06.290> someone<00:01:06.920> to<00:01:07.220> motivate

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
could just be someone to motivate

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.669 
could just be someone to motivate
Sanchez<00:01:08.210> to<00:01:08.420> do<00:01:08.509> even<00:01:08.810> better<00:01:08.960> knowing<00:01:09.469> that

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:09.679 
Sanchez to do even better knowing that

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:12.370 
Sanchez to do even better knowing that
Tim<00:01:10.219> Tebow<00:01:10.670> is<00:01:10.700> right<00:01:11.539> behind<00:01:11.719> his<00:01:12.049> back<00:01:12.319> and

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
Tim Tebow is right behind his back and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.349 
Tim Tebow is right behind his back and
if<00:01:12.770> he<00:01:13.219> up<00:01:13.659> Sanchez<00:01:16.060> Sanchez<00:01:17.060> could<00:01:17.240> be

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:17.359 
if he up Sanchez Sanchez could be

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:22.179 
if he up Sanchez Sanchez could be
the<00:01:17.479> bench<00:01:17.689> so<00:01:18.439> uh<00:01:18.909> the<00:01:19.909> Jets<00:01:20.530> not<00:01:21.530> not<00:01:21.829> a<00:01:21.859> big

that<00:01:41.889> their<00:01:42.889> offense<00:01:43.490> could<00:01:44.209> use<00:01:44.420> some<00:01:44.659> work

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
that their offense could use some work

in a row well not this past year but two

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.300 
in a row well not this past year but two
years<00:01:59.479> before<00:01:59.840> that<00:02:00.020> they<00:02:00.829> made<00:02:01.009> it<00:02:01.099> to<00:02:01.130> the

AFC championship two years in a row and
Plaxico<00:02:05.959> Burress<00:02:06.229> I<00:02:06.529> believe<00:02:06.859> isn't<00:02:07.099> he<00:02:07.249> it's

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
Plaxico Burress I believe isn't he it's

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:11.559 
Plaxico Burress I believe isn't he it's
a<00:02:07.909> free<00:02:08.119> agent<00:02:08.509> I<00:02:08.690> think<00:02:09.289> so<00:02:09.789> so<00:02:10.789> they'll<00:02:11.330> lose

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
a free agent I think so so they'll lose

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.660 
a free agent I think so so they'll lose
a<00:02:11.599> big<00:02:12.049> deep<00:02:12.590> threat<00:02:12.920> there

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
a big deep threat there

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.809 
a big deep threat there
big<00:02:14.360> tall<00:02:14.599> receiver<00:02:15.010> they<00:02:16.010> do<00:02:16.160> have<00:02:16.250> Santonio

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
big tall receiver they do have Santonio

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.089 
big tall receiver they do have Santonio
Holmes<00:02:17.060> was<00:02:17.450> one<00:02:17.630> of<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.170> elite<00:02:18.440> receivers<00:02:18.980> in

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
Holmes was one of the elite receivers in

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.610 
Holmes was one of the elite receivers in
the<00:02:19.130> NFL<00:02:19.220> um<00:02:21.370> Sean<00:02:22.370> green<00:02:22.840> lt's<00:02:23.840> a<00:02:23.870> free<00:02:24.200> agent

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
the NFL um Sean green lt's a free agent

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.979 
the NFL um Sean green lt's a free agent
so<00:02:25.459> they<00:02:25.610> won't<00:02:25.790> be<00:02:25.849> getting<00:02:26.150> him<00:02:26.300> back<00:02:26.480> Dustin

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
so they won't be getting him back Dustin

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.340 
so they won't be getting him back Dustin
Keller<00:02:27.200> he's<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.500> great<00:02:27.830> tight<00:02:28.069> end<00:02:28.310> um<00:02:29.350> so

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
Keller he's a great tight end um so

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.710 
Keller he's a great tight end um so
often<00:02:30.890> snot<00:02:31.220> too<00:02:31.550> bad<00:02:31.819> but<00:02:32.270> it<00:02:32.660> could

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
often snot too bad but it could

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.140 
often snot too bad but it could
definitely<00:02:33.200> use<00:02:33.500> some<00:02:33.650> improvement<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:34.760> with

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
definitely use some improvement and with

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.260 
definitely use some improvement and with
Tebow<00:02:35.510> they're<00:02:35.780> getting<00:02:36.260> them<00:02:36.350> in<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.800> bit

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
Tebow they're getting them in a bit

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.900 
Tebow they're getting them in a bit
another<00:02:38.270> great<00:02:38.600> catch<00:02:38.870> there<00:02:39.170> by<00:02:39.200> Sean<00:02:39.560> green

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
another great catch there by Sean green

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.280 
another great catch there by Sean green
but<00:02:40.910> yeah<00:02:41.090> with<00:02:41.300> Tebow<00:02:41.660> they're<00:02:41.840> getting<00:02:42.200> a

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
but yeah with Tebow they're getting a

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.540 
but yeah with Tebow they're getting a
min<00:02:42.530> um<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.720> could<00:02:44.720> see<00:02:44.870> happening<00:02:45.380> if<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.280> Jets

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
min um I could see happening if the Jets

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.720 
min um I could see happening if the Jets
start<00:02:46.819> to<00:02:47.000> lose<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.569> could<00:02:47.840> see<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.590> Jets<00:02:49.400> fans

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
start to lose I could see the Jets fans

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.259 
start to lose I could see the Jets fans
chanting<00:02:50.360> for<00:02:50.540> Tebow<00:02:50.959> just<00:02:51.560> like<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:52.880> Denver

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
chanting for Tebow just like the Denver

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.570 
chanting for Tebow just like the Denver
fans<00:02:53.510> did<00:02:53.810> last<00:02:54.110> year<00:02:54.260> when<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.799> Broncos<00:02:55.280> were

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
fans did last year when the Broncos were

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.600 
fans did last year when the Broncos were
struggling<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.319> they<00:02:57.319> ended<00:02:57.590> up<00:02:57.739> going<00:02:58.489> to

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
struggling and they ended up going to

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.520 
struggling and they ended up going to
the<00:02:58.700> playoffs<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.360> making<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.989> divisional

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
the playoffs and making the divisional

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.120 
the playoffs and making the divisional
round<00:03:00.680> so<00:03:01.810> never<00:03:02.810> know<00:03:03.019> Tebow's<00:03:03.470> future<00:03:04.010> on

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
round so never know Tebow's future on

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.720 
round so never know Tebow's future on
the<00:03:04.280> Jets<00:03:04.610> um<00:03:06.010> but<00:03:08.980> no<00:03:09.980> one<00:03:10.130> ever<00:03:10.160> knows<00:03:10.549> I
