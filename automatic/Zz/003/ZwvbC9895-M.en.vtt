just I just feel blah and so when that

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.679 
just I just feel blah and so when that
happens<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.820> consider<00:01:51.210> looking<00:01:51.479> at

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
happens I consider looking at

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.999 
happens I consider looking at
supplements<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.320> help<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.710> little<00:01:52.890> while

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
supplements to help for a little while

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.490 
supplements to help for a little while
typically<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.090> do<00:01:54.270> not<00:01:54.600> preach<00:01:55.110> using

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
typically I do not preach using

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.080 
typically I do not preach using
supplements<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.280> main<00:01:56.460> reason<00:01:56.759> Florida's

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
supplements the main reason Florida's

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.490 
supplements the main reason Florida's
because<00:01:57.450> they<00:01:57.600> are<00:01:57.689> not<00:01:57.869> regulated<00:01:58.170> by<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
because they are not regulated by the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.530 
because they are not regulated by the
Food<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.799> Drug<00:01:58.829> Administration<00:01:59.579> what<00:02:00.270> are

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
Food and Drug Administration what are

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.690 
Food and Drug Administration what are
their<00:02:01.170> sole<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.680> shelf<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.130> cosmetic

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
their sole on the shelf is a cosmetic

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.910 
their sole on the shelf is a cosmetic
and<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.360> what's<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.960> label<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.829> that

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
and so what's on the label is that

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.110 
and so what's on the label is that
really<00:02:05.310> what's<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.759> who<00:02:06.299> knows<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.810> that

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
really what's in it who knows is that

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.120 
really what's in it who knows is that
now<00:02:07.360> that's<00:02:07.570> in<00:02:07.660> it<00:02:07.780> who<00:02:08.170> knows<00:02:08.440> what<00:02:08.830> else<00:02:08.950> is

digestion<00:02:15.460> all<00:02:15.880> that<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:17.350> then<00:02:17.530> there's<00:02:17.710> any

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
digestion all that and then there's any

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.280 
digestion all that and then there's any
really<00:02:18.610> long-term<00:02:19.030> Studies<00:02:19.360> on<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.540> so<00:02:19.840> if<00:02:20.170> you

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
really long-term Studies on it so if you

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.140 
really long-term Studies on it so if you
continually<00:02:20.740> use<00:02:21.160> it<00:02:21.430> that<00:02:21.730> could<00:02:21.970> cause

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
continually use it that could cause

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.030 
continually use it that could cause
problems<00:02:22.360> too<00:02:22.630> in<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.750> future<00:02:23.020> when<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:23.800> use

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
problems too in the future when I use

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.130 
problems too in the future when I use
supplements<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.610> use<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.120> for<00:02:25.360> about<00:02:25.450> two<00:02:25.900> weeks

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
supplements I use it for about two weeks

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.390 
supplements I use it for about two weeks
and<00:02:26.290> then<00:02:26.350> I<00:02:26.470> get<00:02:26.620> imported<00:02:26.920> with<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.160> so<00:02:27.280> it's

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
and then I get imported with it so it's

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.850 
and then I get imported with it so it's
actually<00:02:27.520> kind<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:27.910> wasting<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.240> money<00:02:28.860> but

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
actually kind of wasting the money but

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.800 
actually kind of wasting the money but
this<00:02:29.980> time<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.280> decided<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.850> try<00:02:31.090> something<00:02:31.120> and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
this time I decided to try something and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.110 
this time I decided to try something and
again<00:02:32.410> we'll<00:02:33.280> see<00:02:33.370> what<00:02:33.520> happens

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
again we'll see what happens

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.110 
again we'll see what happens
it's<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.480> creatine<00:02:34.870> called<00:02:35.650> creatine<00:02:36.700> it's

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
it's a creatine called creatine it's

it's a creatine called creatine it's
creatine<00:02:37.570> monohydrate<00:02:37.960> and<00:02:38.650> usually<00:02:39.640> when<00:02:39.760> I

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
creatine monohydrate and usually when I

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.490
