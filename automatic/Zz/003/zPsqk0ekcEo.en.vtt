out<00:01:40.320> if<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:40.950> not<00:01:41.100> like<00:01:41.400> things<00:01:42.119> spicy<00:01:42.270> at

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
out if you do not like things spicy at

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.630 
out if you do not like things spicy at
all<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:43.079> doesn't<00:01:43.350> make<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.710> too<00:01:44.040> spicy<00:01:44.490> but<00:01:44.520> I

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
all it doesn't make it too spicy but I

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.340 
all it doesn't make it too spicy but I
think<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.000> gives<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.509> really<00:01:45.720> good<00:01:45.990> flavor

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
think it gives it a really good flavor

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.050 
think it gives it a really good flavor
but<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> said<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.399> definitely<00:01:47.520> leave

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
that out you will also need a couple

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.580 
that out you will also need a couple
tablespoons<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:51.149> oil<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.869> am<00:01:51.990> going<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.380> use

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
tablespoons of oil I am going to use

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.800 
tablespoons of oil I am going to use
rice<00:01:52.979> bran<00:01:53.280> oil<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.970> little<00:01:54.299> bit<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.659> a

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
rice bran oil it's a little bit of a

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.560 
rice bran oil it's a little bit of a
healthier<00:01:55.259> oil<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.490> very<00:01:56.939> high<00:01:57.270> heat

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
healthier oil and it is a very high heat

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.300 
healthier oil and it is a very high heat
oil<00:01:57.780> which<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.079> nice<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:59.070> use

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
oil which is nice so you can use

with high heat and you're going to need

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.819 
with high heat and you're going to need
about<00:02:04.799> two<00:02:05.219> tablespoons

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
about two tablespoons

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
rice so I usually do the two to one

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.110 
rice so I usually do the two to one
ratio<00:02:12.270> when<00:02:12.840> I

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
ratio when I

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.809 
ratio when I
cooking<00:02:13.540> rice<00:02:13.810> though<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.500> have<00:02:14.799> my<00:02:14.980> four<00:02:15.549> cups
