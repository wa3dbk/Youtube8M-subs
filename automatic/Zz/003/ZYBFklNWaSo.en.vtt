00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.980
 or we will see in this video how 

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:10.380
 see how an osteoarthritis of the 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.050
 thumb also known as rick 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.050
 arthrosis in a radiological study 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.770
 we go for that to support us of some 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.630
 biographies that I will be going but 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.099
 initially we are going to simply do 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:33.790
 a comparison between what is the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.760
 normal radiology and this skeleton is 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.220
 hand that I have here for a little 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.110
 show you where the osteoarthritis of the 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.910
 thumb where the osteoarthritis laugh 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.800
 we start with this image 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:52.190
 in which you see the bone here 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:55.700
 metacarpal which is this here and here 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.150
 the trapezoid trapezoid trapezoid bone 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.930
 this articulation here is healthy 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.660
 let's say is the articulation that 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.290
 affects in the case of laughing arthritis the 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:12.380
 metacarpal trapezius joint if 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.710
 we compare now with the skeleton what 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:21.350
 we see in the skeleton we see that this is 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:25.610
 the thumb first finger of the hand 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:29.240
 this here is the trapezoid bone and 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.479
 this is the trapeze joint 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.860
 metacarpal if we turn you can see there 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.860
 the joint 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.020
 ahead 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.360
 you can also see the joint there 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.930
 is a very important joint has 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.320
 a lot of mobility 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.790
 but that's why he suffers a lot of wear 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.210
 in the body things the more 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.810
 mobility they have most likely is that 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.660
 wear when there is osteoarthritis of the 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.420
 thumb or a laughing arthrosis is this 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.170
 joint 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.509
 the space is made smaller 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.130
 the space there becomes smaller 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.709
 appear proliferations are you 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.140
 small little pits that appear here that 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.800
 appear here in the trapeze in the 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.360
 metacarpal we are going to see it in a 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.670
 bone scan 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.069
 there you have first one more image 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.950
 close to normal radiology 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.989
 it is not seen in whitish areas or 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.840
 proliferations or is included more or 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.480
 unless there is a good space between 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.150
 trapezius and the metacarpal would be a 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.910
 more or less normal x-ray of a 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.780
 healthy person 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.120
 but here we have an X-ray of 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.800
 a person with arthrosis of the thumb 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.800
 we can see on one side this 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.239
 this blanc growth from here that 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.239
 we can also find here 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.959
 it is a thickening of 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.060
 the surface of the bone because the 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.760
 cartilage has already worn out it has 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.150
 lost the cartilage it is seen that there is no 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.440
 space between both bones yes and the bone 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.989
 is beginning to swell 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.239
 harden to defend against this 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.420
 wear also appear here 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.780
 these bony proliferations this peak yes 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.940
 that somehow, to say the least 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.540
 so you can also appear here 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.549
 small piquitos proliferations here 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.060
 it is intuited that it is also forming 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:40.560
 an osteophytes if we can already see 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.830
 below also 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.360
 signs of arthrosis wear we are going to 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:51.860
 see one more image 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:56.090
 you see here this bone proliferation 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:59.210
 and you see here also the loss of the 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.320
 space between the two bones the loss 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:05.990
 of the joint surface and again 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:09.070
 this thickening that looks like more 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:13.070
 white increases bone density and 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:16.359
 I insist again as a defense against 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.980
 this wear is one of the signs 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.910
 fundamental that there is already a rita 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:26.560
 arthrosis disease that by the way 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.389
 greatly affects physiotherapists 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.900
 this is more or less all that 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:34.750
 want to tell about osteoarthritis laughter 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.060
 I hope the video has worked for you 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.610
 useful already know that you can find in 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.160
 this portal a lot of videos about 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.639
 of the radiological signs of the 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.560
 different radiological tests and many 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.470
 other videos of other themes all 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.120
 this here in this our portal 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.120
