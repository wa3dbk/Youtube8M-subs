so<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.560> know<00:03:34.710> that<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.460> juice<00:03:35.700> hasn't<00:03:36.030> gone<00:03:36.090> bad

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
so I know that the juice hasn't gone bad

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.290 
so I know that the juice hasn't gone bad
or<00:03:36.360> it's<00:03:36.810> not<00:03:36.930> fake<00:03:37.260> juice<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:38.460> that<00:03:38.490> I<00:03:38.910> don't

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
or it's not fake juice so that I don't

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.030 
or it's not fake juice so that I don't
know<00:03:39.390> why<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.660> does<00:03:40.050> it<00:03:40.260> but<00:03:40.380> that's<00:03:40.709> really

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
know why it does it but that's really

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.640 
know why it does it but that's really
weird<00:03:41.220> but<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.520> guess<00:03:41.700> in<00:03:41.940> general<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.650> couldn't

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
weird but I guess in general I couldn't

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.590 
weird but I guess in general I couldn't
really<00:03:43.860> see<00:03:44.160> myself<00:03:44.370> wearing<00:03:44.910> this<00:03:45.090> during
