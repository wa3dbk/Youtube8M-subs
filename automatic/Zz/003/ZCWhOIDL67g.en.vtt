00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
as well so we have that moon in cancer

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.459 
as well so we have that moon in cancer
at<00:00:44.190> home<00:00:44.550> wanting<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.480> feel<00:00:45.719> nurtured<00:00:46.020> and

at home wanting to feel nurtured and
nurturing<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.340> safe<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.500> yet<00:00:49.500> later<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.129> the

nurturing and safe and yet later in the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.020 
nurturing and safe and yet later in the
day<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:51.059> moon<00:00:51.270> forms<00:00:51.989> hard<00:00:52.559> aspects<00:00:53.520> with

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
day the moon forms hard aspects with

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.790 
day the moon forms hard aspects with
uranus<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:54.989> pluto<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.430> an<00:00:57.239> easy<00:00:57.690> aspect<00:00:58.500> with

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
uranus and pluto and an easy aspect with

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.490 
uranus and pluto and an easy aspect with
hard<00:00:59.250> saturn<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.780> other<00:01:00.870> words<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.289> all

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
hard saturn so in other words it's all

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.290 
hard saturn so in other words it's all
hard<00:01:01.800> even<00:01:01.980> if<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.309> some<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.760> aspects<00:01:03.120> are

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
hard even if the some of the aspects are

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.820 
hard even if the some of the aspects are
soft<00:01:03.539> well<00:01:03.780> that's<00:01:03.989> where<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.589> differ

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
soft well that's where you and I differ

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.440 
soft well that's where you and I differ
a<00:01:05.040> little<00:01:05.250> bit<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.850> terms<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.299> our

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
a little bit in terms of our

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.789 
a little bit in terms of our
interpretation<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.380> an<00:01:07.530> ongoing

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
interpretation it's an ongoing

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.300 
interpretation it's an ongoing
discussion<00:01:08.610> we<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.299> about<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.650> kind<00:01:11.040> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
discussion we have about the kind of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.700 
discussion we have about the kind of
aspect<00:01:11.700> or<00:01:12.030> angle<00:01:12.510> whether<00:01:12.780> that's<00:01:13.080> hard<00:01:13.470> or

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
aspect or angle whether that's hard or

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.039 
aspect or angle whether that's hard or
soft<00:01:14.030> depending<00:01:15.030> upon<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.360> planets<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.990> are

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
soft depending upon the planets that are

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.230 
soft depending upon the planets that are
involved<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> moon<00:01:17.040> does<00:01:17.280> form<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.880> soft

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
involved in the moon does form a soft

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.140 
involved in the moon does form a soft
harmonious<00:01:18.900> aspect<00:01:19.439> with<00:01:19.890> hard<00:01:20.310> Saturn<00:01:20.909> my

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
harmonious aspect with hard Saturn my

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.539 
harmonious aspect with hard Saturn my
interpretation<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.860> provides<00:01:23.009> a

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
interpretation is that it provides a

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.359 
interpretation is that it provides a
solid<00:01:23.820> foundation<00:01:24.350> before<00:01:25.350> we<00:01:25.680> go<00:01:25.860> off<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
solid foundation before we go off on the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.789 
solid foundation before we go off on the
rocket<00:01:26.759> ship<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.180> weirdness<00:01:27.720> later<00:01:28.259> tonight

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
rocket ship of weirdness later tonight

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.679 
rocket ship of weirdness later tonight
and<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.430> i<00:01:29.520> think<00:01:29.549> you're<00:01:29.939> right<00:01:30.090> i<00:01:30.150> think<00:01:30.360> it

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
and and i think you're right i think it

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.710 
and and i think you're right i think it
does<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.170> but<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.530> still<00:01:31.920> form<00:01:32.909> some<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.420> mean

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
does that but it still form some I mean

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.149 
does that but it still form some I mean
the<00:01:33.840> cancer<00:01:34.229> moon<00:01:34.380> doesn't<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:34.829> anything

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the cancer moon doesn't have anything

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.179 
the cancer moon doesn't have anything
Salla<00:01:35.640> solid<00:01:36.270> there's<00:01:36.689> no<00:01:36.869> backbone<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.890> a

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
Salla solid there's no backbone in a

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.359 
Salla solid there's no backbone in a
crab<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:39.030> an<00:01:39.500> exoskeleton<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:41.070> delicious

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
crab it's an exoskeleton it's delicious

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.210 
crab it's an exoskeleton it's delicious
and<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.960> Saturn<00:01:43.439> provides<00:01:43.950> a

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
and and that and Saturn provides a

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.480 
and and that and Saturn provides a
backbone<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.689> yes<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.409> it's<00:01:46.680> supportive

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
backbone so so yes it's it's supportive

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.149 
backbone so so yes it's it's supportive
but<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.210> different<00:01:48.899> than<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> cancer<00:01:49.920> moon

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
but it's different than the cancer moon

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.620 
but it's different than the cancer moon
and<00:01:50.579> then<00:01:50.820> later<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.240> as<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.899> solid<00:01:52.560> backbone

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
and then later on as that solid backbone

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.530 
and then later on as that solid backbone
given<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.869> cancer<00:01:55.290> moon<00:01:55.470> bumps<00:01:56.219> into

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
given to the cancer moon bumps into

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.350 
given to the cancer moon bumps into
Uranus<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.840> Pluto<00:01:58.460> then<00:01:59.460> things<00:01:59.909> can<00:02:00.180> get

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
Uranus and Pluto then things can get

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.240 
Uranus and Pluto then things can get
really<00:02:00.659> tough<00:02:00.990> well<00:02:01.320> we<00:02:01.439> also<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.920> Sun

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
really tough well we also have a Sun

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.980 
really tough well we also have a Sun
Mars<00:02:02.490> conjunction<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.509> we're<00:02:03.659> headed

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
Mars conjunction that we're headed

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.170 
Mars conjunction that we're headed
towards<00:02:04.380> which<00:02:04.799> means<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.549> will<00:02:05.850> is

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
towards which means that the will is

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.690 
towards which means that the will is
pushy<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.930> aggressive<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.799> yet<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.190> cancer

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
pushy and aggressive and yet that cancer

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.760 
pushy and aggressive and yet that cancer
son<00:02:08.940> still<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.660> tender<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.319> quite<00:02:10.739> a

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
son still is so tender it's quite a

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.530
