00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
only us doing the shooting will cause

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.350 
only us doing the shooting will cause
the<00:00:12.719> swap<00:00:12.929> over<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:14.130> won't<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:14.880> won't<00:00:15.030> suddenly

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
the swap over so won't we won't suddenly

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.260 
the swap over so won't we won't suddenly
swap<00:00:15.960> if<00:00:16.199> he<00:00:16.440> gets<00:00:16.619> shot<00:00:16.710> by<00:00:16.949> one<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.150> other

BOTS<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.900> game<00:00:19.250> but<00:00:20.300> how<00:00:21.300> do<00:00:21.359> we<00:00:21.630> make<00:00:21.900> it

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
BOTS in the game but how do we make it

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.759 
BOTS in the game but how do we make it
so<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.830> when<00:00:23.250> Bob<00:00:23.580> shoots<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.810> old<00:00:25.080> body<00:00:25.439> or

so that when Bob shoots the old body or

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.839 
so that when Bob shoots the old body or
when<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.580> inside<00:00:27.330> Bob<00:00:27.630> shoot<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.470> old<00:00:28.590> body<00:00:28.859> we

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
when we inside Bob shoot the old body we

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.810 
when we inside Bob shoot the old body we
swap<00:00:30.150> back<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> old<00:00:30.779> body<00:00:31.640> let's<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.790> a

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
swap back to the old body let's have a

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.110 
swap back to the old body let's have a
look<00:00:32.940> at<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.120> kismet<00:00:33.630> for<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:35.090> now<00:00:37.670> at<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
look at the kismet for this now at the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.930 
look at the kismet for this now at the
moment<00:00:39.680> we<00:00:40.680> have<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.070> lot<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.280> these<00:00:41.489> players

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
moment we have a lot of these players

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.380 
moment we have a lot of these players
zero<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:43.100> things<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.460> say<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> lot<00:00:45.030> we've<00:00:45.239> got

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
zero and things I say a lot we've got

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.619 
zero and things I say a lot we've got
two<00:00:46.550> but<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:48.260> there<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> problem<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:50.160> we

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
two but the there is a problem if we

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.740 
two but the there is a problem if we
simply<00:00:51.860> try<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.920> swap<00:00:53.370> back<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.059> player<00:00:54.300> zero

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
simply try to swap back to player zero

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.670 
simply try to swap back to player zero
from<00:00:55.379> being<00:00:55.710> Bob<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.300> player<00:00:58.289> zero

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
from being Bob and that is player zero

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.660 
from being Bob and that is player zero
refers<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.399> us<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.969> controller<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.109> actual

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
refers to us the controller the actual

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.549 
refers to us the controller the actual
person<00:01:02.670> doing<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> input<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.930> doesn't<00:01:04.290> refer

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
person doing the input it doesn't refer

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.590 
person doing the input it doesn't refer
to<00:01:04.769> Bob<00:01:05.309> or<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:06.630> old<00:01:07.020> body<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.939> so<00:01:08.939> if<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.390> try

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
to Bob or the old body and so if we try

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.109 
to Bob or the old body and so if we try
to<00:01:09.659> swap<00:01:10.110> from<00:01:10.470> Bob<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:11.010> player<00:01:11.250> 0<00:01:11.610> nothing

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
to swap from Bob to player 0 nothing

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.100 
to swap from Bob to player 0 nothing
will<00:01:12.270> happen<00:01:12.299> because<00:01:13.080> bob<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.740> now<00:01:14.100> player<00:01:14.430> 0

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
will happen because bob is now player 0

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.249 
will happen because bob is now player 0
so<00:01:16.110> how<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.530> make<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:18.200> instead<00:01:19.200> of

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
so how do we make it that instead of

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.390 
so how do we make it that instead of
these<00:01:19.500> sorts<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.890> players<00:01:20.340> zero<00:01:20.810> references

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
these sorts of players zero references

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.880 
these sorts of players zero references
we<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.729> references<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.840> old<00:01:25.049> body<00:01:25.560> in

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
we have references to the old body in

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.109 
we have references to the old body in
which<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.759> swap<00:01:27.330> back<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:28.850> hopefully<00:01:29.850> that

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
which to swap back to hopefully that

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.789 
which to swap back to hopefully that
makes<00:01:30.299> sense<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.869> very<00:01:31.049> complicated<00:01:31.380> way<00:01:31.770> of

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
makes sense is a very complicated way of

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.280 
makes sense is a very complicated way of
saying<00:01:32.159> things<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.759> you'll<00:01:33.600> get<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> picture

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
saying things but you'll get the picture

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.330 
saying things but you'll get the picture
once<00:01:34.680> once<00:01:35.220> we<00:01:35.400> set<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.640> up<00:01:36.560> you<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.770> see<00:01:37.979> here

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
once once we set it up you can see here

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.870 
once once we set it up you can see here
that<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:39.030> our<00:01:39.600> actor<00:01:40.079> factory<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.880> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
that we have our actor factory and the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.819 
that we have our actor factory and the
porn<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.840> spawned<00:01:43.170> from<00:01:43.350> our<00:01:43.530> active

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
porn that is spawned from our active

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.810 
porn that is spawned from our active
factory<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.430> called<00:01:44.820> Bob<00:01:45.350> well<00:01:46.350> we<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:47.520> also

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
factory is called Bob well we can also

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.450 
factory is called Bob well we can also
set<00:01:48.299> up<00:01:48.420> something<00:01:48.659> similar<00:01:49.170> here<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.280> that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
set up something similar here so that

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.539 
set up something similar here so that
when<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.880> touch<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.420> trigger<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.280> cause<00:01:53.280> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
when we touch this trigger and cause the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.420 
when we touch this trigger and cause the
actor<00:01:53.790> factory<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.360> create<00:01:54.659> Bob<00:01:55.219> we<00:01:56.219> can

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
actor factory to create Bob we can

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.840 
actor factory to create Bob we can
actually<00:01:56.630> create<00:01:57.630> or<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:58.979> an<00:01:59.430> object

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
actually create or we can have an object

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.090 
actually create or we can have an object
variable<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:01.140> person<00:02:01.500> who<00:02:01.649> touched<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
variable of the person who touched the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.450 
variable of the person who touched the
trigger<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.899> so<00:02:03.899> I'm<00:02:04.890> just<00:02:05.009> going<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.219> create

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
trigger and so I'm just going to create

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.779 
trigger and so I'm just going to create
a<00:02:05.520> new<00:02:05.610> object<00:02:05.969> variable<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:07.429> I'll<00:02:08.429> bring

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
a new object variable and I'll bring

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.779 
a new object variable and I'll bring
this<00:02:09.000> down<00:02:09.599> here

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
this down here

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.640 
this down here
and<00:02:12.549> just<00:02:13.549> as<00:02:13.670> we<00:02:13.819> did<00:02:13.969> here<00:02:14.030> I'm<00:02:14.500> going<00:02:15.500> to

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:18.859 
name this object variable the variable

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:23.849 
name this object variable the variable
name<00:02:19.250> I'm<00:02:19.400> going<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.609> give<00:02:19.849> it<00:02:20.620> is<00:02:21.620> built<00:02:22.040> so

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:23.859 
name I'm going to give it is built so

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:30.369 
name I'm going to give it is built so
now<00:02:24.859> we<00:02:24.920> have<00:02:25.069> bill<00:02:25.579> and<00:02:25.790> we<00:02:26.420> have<00:02:26.569> Bob<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:29.720> just

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
now we have bill and we have Bob so just

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.660 
now we have bill and we have Bob so just
to<00:02:30.530> see<00:02:30.739> if<00:02:30.980> this<00:02:31.459> works<00:02:32.120> if<00:02:32.599> this<00:02:32.780> is<00:02:32.959> a<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.680> way

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
to see if this works if this is a a way

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.949 
to see if this works if this is a a way
for<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.150> computer<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.920> register<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:37.959> bill

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
for the computer to register that bill

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.160 
for the computer to register that bill
is<00:02:39.459> actually<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:41.329> person<00:02:41.510> who<00:02:41.810> touched<00:02:41.989> the

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
is actually the person who touched the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.369 
is actually the person who touched the
trigger<00:02:42.469> and<00:02:43.159> we<00:02:43.310> don't<00:02:43.519> have<00:02:43.819> player<00:02:44.209> 0<00:02:47.379> have

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
trigger and we don't have player 0 have

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.409 
trigger and we don't have player 0 have

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:50.419 
references to play a zero anymore just

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:54.339 
references to play a zero anymore just
going<00:02:50.659> to<00:02:50.780> copy<00:02:51.129> and<00:02:52.129> paste<00:02:53.139> one<00:02:54.139> of<00:02:54.260> these

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
going to copy and paste one of these

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.559 
going to copy and paste one of these
named<00:02:54.620> variables<00:02:55.189> of<00:02:55.400> Bob<00:02:55.730> but<00:02:56.269> I'm<00:02:56.359> going<00:02:56.510> to

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
named variables of Bob but I'm going to

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.360 
named variables of Bob but I'm going to
change<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.989> variable<00:02:57.439> name<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:58.040> Bill<00:03:00.370> going

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
change the variable name to Bill going

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.780 
change the variable name to Bill going
to<00:03:02.319> break<00:03:03.319> that<00:03:03.500> connection<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:04.220> connect<00:03:04.669> to

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
to break that connection and connect to

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.710 
to break that connection and connect to
bill<00:03:05.000> instead<00:03:05.919> paste<00:03:06.919> another<00:03:07.310> one<00:03:07.489> of<00:03:07.720> Bob

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
bill instead paste another one of Bob

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.050 
bill instead paste another one of Bob
fact<00:03:09.379> it's<00:03:10.129> quicker<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.459> do<00:03:10.669> this<00:03:11.139> and<00:03:13.060> I'm

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
fact it's quicker to do this and I'm

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.939 
fact it's quicker to do this and I'm
going<00:03:14.269> to<00:03:14.359> break<00:03:14.599> this<00:03:15.079> connection<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.739> player

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:15.949 
going to break this connection to player

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:19.719 
going to break this connection to player
zero<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:17.269> connect<00:03:17.629> that<00:03:17.780> up<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:18.049> Bill<00:03:18.729> so

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:19.729 
zero and connect that up to Bill so

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:24.460 
zero and connect that up to Bill so
let's<00:03:19.909> see<00:03:20.150> if<00:03:20.389> that<00:03:20.870> still<00:03:21.909> works<00:03:23.019> in<00:03:24.019> terms

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
let's see if that still works in terms

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:34.629 
let's see if that still works in terms
of<00:03:24.790> swapping<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:26.299> Bob<00:03:31.180> wait<00:03:32.180> for<00:03:32.389> five<00:03:33.459> yet<00:03:34.459> we

swap back just get rid of these now that

swap back just get rid of these now that
we<00:03:50.090> don't<00:03:50.299> need<00:03:50.449> them<00:03:50.979> the<00:03:51.979> actual<00:03:52.310> kismet

it works I hardly believe that it works

it works I hardly believe that it works
I'm<00:04:03.919> just<00:04:04.129> going<00:04:04.250> to<00:04:04.280> select<00:04:04.459> this<00:04:04.870> and<00:04:05.870> we're

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
I'm going to go through wherever it says

Bob i'll change it to Bill over it says

00:04:46.590 --> 00:05:01.810 
Bob i'll change it to Bill over it says

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:08.650 

now<00:05:02.470> i'm<00:05:03.470> not<00:05:03.680> sure<00:05:03.860> why<00:05:04.460> it<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:07.880> works<00:05:08.450> like

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
now i'm not sure why it it works like

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:15.420 
now i'm not sure why it it works like
this<00:05:09.310> why<00:05:11.740> actually<00:05:12.740> naming<00:05:13.430> the<00:05:13.850> instigator

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
this why actually naming the instigator

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.940 
this why actually naming the instigator
over<00:05:16.430> here<00:05:16.700> on<00:05:16.880> the<00:05:17.030> touched<00:05:17.930> or<00:05:18.530> trigger

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
over here on the touched or trigger

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.190 
over here on the touched or trigger
touch<00:05:20.200> instigator<00:05:21.940> why<00:05:22.940> that<00:05:23.180> refers<00:05:23.570> to<00:05:23.930> the

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
touch instigator why that refers to the

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.910 
touch instigator why that refers to the
the<00:05:24.920> old<00:05:25.130> body<00:05:25.490> and<00:05:26.080> not<00:05:27.080> the<00:05:27.260> actual<00:05:27.410> player

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
the old body and not the actual player

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.520 
the old body and not the actual player
doing<00:05:28.490> the<00:05:29.860> doing<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:31.070> touching<00:05:31.960> but<00:05:32.960> if<00:05:33.140> we

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
doing the doing the touching but if we

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:43.120 
doing the doing the touching but if we
come<00:05:33.860> into<00:05:34.010> the<00:05:34.190> game<00:05:36.490> try<00:05:37.490> this<00:05:37.550> out<00:05:41.950> you<00:05:42.950> can

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
come into the game try this out you can

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.760 
come into the game try this out you can
see<00:05:43.340> that<00:05:43.370> it<00:05:43.580> works<00:05:43.610> we<00:05:44.270> can<00:05:44.420> now<00:05:44.600> swap<00:05:45.020> back

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
see that it works we can now swap back

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.550 
see that it works we can now swap back
and<00:05:45.980> forth<00:05:46.270> or<00:05:47.270> we<00:05:47.540> will<00:05:47.690> be<00:05:47.840> able<00:05:47.990> to<00:05:50.290> if<00:05:51.290> our

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
and forth or we will be able to if our

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.200 
and forth or we will be able to if our
triggers<00:05:51.980> worked<00:05:52.250> more<00:05:52.580> than<00:05:52.610> once<00:05:54.820> and<00:05:55.820> so<00:05:56.090> we

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
triggers worked more than once and so we

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.770 
triggers worked more than once and so we
might<00:05:56.390> just<00:05:56.630> fix<00:05:57.230> that<00:05:57.440> now<00:05:57.470> just<00:05:58.630> come<00:05:59.630> in

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
might just fix that now just come in

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:06.190 
might just fix that now just come in
here<00:05:59.810> to<00:06:00.200> the<00:06:01.300> take<00:06:02.300> damage<00:06:03.160> event<00:06:04.160> and<00:06:05.200> while

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
here to the take damage event and while

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.350 
here to the take damage event and while
I'm<00:06:06.350> here<00:06:06.620> I<00:06:06.740> might<00:06:06.800> take<00:06:07.340> off<00:06:07.580> the<00:06:08.060> link

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
I'm here I might take off the link

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.640 
I'm here I might take off the link
plasma<00:06:08.990> that<00:06:09.140> we<00:06:09.230> set<00:06:09.470> up<00:06:09.590> in<00:06:09.710> the<00:06:09.770> last<00:06:10.010> video

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
plasma that we set up in the last video

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.020 
plasma that we set up in the last video
and<00:06:12.650> I'm<00:06:12.890> going<00:06:13.070> to<00:06:13.100> set<00:06:13.340> the<00:06:13.460> max<00:06:13.670> trigger

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
and I'm going to set the max trigger

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.700 
and I'm going to set the max trigger
count<00:06:14.920> 20<00:06:16.690> I'll<00:06:17.690> do<00:06:17.870> the<00:06:17.960> same<00:06:18.230> for<00:06:18.530> this<00:06:18.650> one

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
count 20 I'll do the same for this one

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.680 
count 20 I'll do the same for this one
down<00:06:19.040> here

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:36.529 

so<00:06:24.690> now<00:06:24.900> if<00:06:25.199> we<00:06:25.259> test<00:06:25.650> it<00:06:34.849> we<00:06:35.849> can<00:06:36.030> swap<00:06:36.300> back

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
so now if we test it we can swap back

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:46.909 
so now if we test it we can swap back
and<00:06:36.750> forth<00:06:37.250> to<00:06:38.250> our<00:06:38.370> hearts<00:06:38.610> content<00:06:45.919> of

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
and forth to our hearts content of

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:51.070 
and forth to our hearts content of
course<00:06:47.190> every<00:06:47.639> time<00:06:47.849> we<00:06:48.030> shoot<00:06:49.490> bill<00:06:50.490> or<00:06:50.759> Bob

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 
course every time we shoot bill or Bob

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.659 
course every time we shoot bill or Bob
it's<00:06:52.080> hard<00:06:52.259> to<00:06:52.379> keep<00:06:52.500> track<00:06:52.560> of<00:06:52.860> who<00:06:53.129> we<00:06:53.280> are<00:06:53.310> am

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:53.669 
it's hard to keep track of who we are am

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:57.110 
it's hard to keep track of who we are am
I<00:06:53.940> build<00:06:54.210> out<00:06:54.389> or<00:06:54.599> am<00:06:54.690> I<00:06:54.810> Bob<00:06:55.819> you'll<00:06:56.819> notice

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
I build out or am I Bob you'll notice

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.070 
I build out or am I Bob you'll notice
that<00:06:57.150> we<00:06:57.389> lose<00:06:57.710> five<00:06:58.710> health<00:06:59.099> if<00:06:59.520> you<00:06:59.990> just<00:07:00.990> see

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
that we lose five health if you just see

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.210 
that we lose five health if you just see
the<00:07:01.199> top<00:07:01.380> half<00:07:01.409> of<00:07:01.590> the<00:07:01.740> numbers<00:07:02.039> of<00:07:02.069> the

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 
the top half of the numbers of the

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:08.330 
the top half of the numbers of the
bottom<00:07:02.460> of<00:07:02.550> the<00:07:02.610> screen<00:07:02.819> and<00:07:04.550> so<00:07:06.560> it<00:07:07.560> does<00:07:08.009> add

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 
bottom of the screen and so it does add

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.379 
bottom of the screen and so it does add
a<00:07:08.550> certain<00:07:09.030> amount<00:07:09.180> of<00:07:10.550> tactical<00:07:11.550> strategy<00:07:12.210> to

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:12.389 
a certain amount of tactical strategy to

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:15.080 
a certain amount of tactical strategy to
the<00:07:12.419> game<00:07:13.370> because<00:07:14.370> there<00:07:14.759> are<00:07:14.880> two

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.090 
the game because there are two

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:20.260 
the game because there are two
limitations<00:07:15.860> firstly<00:07:17.240> there's<00:07:18.240> distance

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.270 
limitations firstly there's distance

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.059 
limitations firstly there's distance
somebody<00:07:21.270> is<00:07:21.330> out<00:07:21.509> of<00:07:21.569> range<00:07:21.900> you<00:07:22.409> can't<00:07:22.680> what

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:23.069 
somebody is out of range you can't what

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:28.820 
somebody is out of range you can't what
you<00:07:23.310> can't<00:07:23.819> swap<00:07:24.270> to<00:07:24.449> them<00:07:25.219> and<00:07:26.219> also<00:07:27.650> you<00:07:28.650> have

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:28.830 
you can't swap to them and also you have

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:36.200 
you can't swap to them and also you have
to<00:07:28.979> be<00:07:29.130> able<00:07:29.280> to<00:07:30.380> justify<00:07:31.520> swapping<00:07:34.880> in<00:07:35.880> order

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.210 
to be able to justify swapping in order

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:41.510 
to be able to justify swapping in order
to<00:07:39.289> justify<00:07:40.289> the<00:07:40.500> loss<00:07:40.770> of<00:07:40.949> five<00:07:41.219> health

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 
to justify the loss of five health

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.689 
to justify the loss of five health
because<00:07:42.330> if<00:07:42.449> you<00:07:42.569> swap<00:07:42.840> too<00:07:43.050> many<00:07:43.229> times

00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:43.699 
because if you swap too many times

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:45.499 
because if you swap too many times
you're<00:07:44.699> going<00:07:44.729> to<00:07:44.969> kill<00:07:45.180> your<00:07:45.330> other

00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:45.509 
you're going to kill your other

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:52.159 
you're going to kill your other
character<00:07:47.630> so<00:07:48.630> there<00:07:49.169> we<00:07:49.259> go<00:07:50.719> you<00:07:51.719> can<00:07:51.900> set<00:07:52.080> up

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:52.169 
character so there we go you can set up

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:54.320 
character so there we go you can set up
all<00:07:52.349> sorts<00:07:52.680> of<00:07:52.860> puzzles<00:07:53.370> with<00:07:53.580> this<00:07:53.759> system<00:07:54.000> in

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:54.330 
all sorts of puzzles with this system in

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:59.330 
all sorts of puzzles with this system in
play<00:07:54.569> now<00:07:55.699> there<00:07:56.699> are<00:07:56.909> a<00:07:56.940> couple<00:07:57.360> of<00:07:58.340> ongoing

00:07:59.330 --> 00:07:59.340 
play now there are a couple of ongoing

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.370 
play now there are a couple of ongoing
issues<00:07:59.940> with<00:08:00.150> this<00:08:00.330> and<00:08:00.630> these<00:08:00.960> are<00:08:01.199> things

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:01.380 
issues with this and these are things

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.120 
issues with this and these are things
that<00:08:01.469> we<00:08:01.560> can<00:08:01.650> fix<00:08:02.099> in<00:08:02.460> kismet<00:08:02.880> and<00:08:03.560> so<00:08:04.560> we<00:08:04.860> will

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.130 
that we can fix in kismet and so we will

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:09.110 
that we can fix in kismet and so we will
go<00:08:05.430> into<00:08:05.699> those<00:08:06.029> in<00:08:06.449> the<00:08:06.599> next<00:08:06.840> video
