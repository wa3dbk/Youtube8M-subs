00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
they're all they're all buddies now I

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.969 
they're all they're all buddies now I
was<00:01:35.789> in<00:01:35.909> Riverdance<00:01:36.270> for<00:01:36.450> eight<00:01:36.570> years<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.619> I

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
was in Riverdance for eight years so I

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.670 
was in Riverdance for eight years so I
guess<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.579> whole<00:01:38.729> river<00:01:38.969> dance<00:01:39.240> craze<00:01:39.689> still

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
guess the whole river dance craze still

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.510 
guess the whole river dance craze still
hasn't<00:01:41.070> calmed<00:01:41.280> down<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.420> think<00:01:42.689> since<00:01:42.869> I

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
hasn't calmed down and I think since I

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.099 
hasn't calmed down and I think since I
actually<00:01:44.520> parents<00:01:45.180> started<00:01:45.450> contacting<00:01:45.810> me

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
actually parents started contacting me

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.109 
actually parents started contacting me
and<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.439> got<00:01:46.859> the<00:01:46.979> ball<00:01:47.189> rolling<00:01:47.219> into<00:01:47.789> going

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
and that got the ball rolling into going

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.779 
and that got the ball rolling into going
into<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.570> area<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.289> seen<00:01:49.530> forgetting

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
into the area and I seen forgetting

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.849

quite<00:01:50.789> a<00:01:50.820> lot<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.180> fights<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:52.619> there's<00:01:52.799> a

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
quite a lot of fights on it so there's a

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:54.170 
quite a lot of fights on it so there's a
