00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
want to call it and as you can see I've

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.250 
want to call it and as you can see I've
upgraded<00:00:32.250> my<00:00:33.239> chin<00:00:34.070> and<00:00:35.149> heart<00:00:36.149> all<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.390> maximum

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
upgraded my chin and heart all I maximum

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.560 
upgraded my chin and heart all I maximum
and<00:00:37.500> my<00:00:38.190> combination<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.850> pretty<00:00:39.000> high<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.239> I

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
and my combination is pretty high so I

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.799 
and my combination is pretty high so I
can<00:00:39.750> fall<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:41.190> self-explanatory<00:00:41.610> why<00:00:42.360> but

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
can fall it's self-explanatory why but

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.840 
can fall it's self-explanatory why but
so<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.530> can<00:00:43.680> throw<00:00:43.829> more<00:00:44.010> combination<00:00:44.610> together

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
so I can throw more combination together

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.619 
so I can throw more combination together
