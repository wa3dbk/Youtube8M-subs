gone<00:01:53.610> along<00:01:53.880> committing<00:01:54.479> myself<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.869> my<00:01:54.960> wife

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
gone along committing myself to my wife

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.260 
gone along committing myself to my wife
and<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.890> sort<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.130> thing<00:01:56.340> built<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.759> life<00:01:57.000> and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
and that sort of thing built a life and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.030 
and that sort of thing built a life and
that<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.750> know<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> really<00:01:58.680> good<00:01:58.829> stuff

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
that you know and the really good stuff

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.889 
that you know and the really good stuff
but<00:01:59.820> at<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> same<00:02:00.270> time<00:02:00.450> there<00:02:00.600> was<00:02:00.689> someone

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
but at the same time there was someone

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.889 
but at the same time there was someone
out<00:02:00.930> there<00:02:01.049> who<00:02:01.200> had<00:02:01.500> apparently<00:02:01.740> done<00:02:02.009> that

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
out there who had apparently done that

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.039 
out there who had apparently done that
however<00:02:04.130> what<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.159> actually<00:02:05.520> think<00:02:06.119> would<00:02:06.630> had

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
however what I actually think would had

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.949 
however what I actually think would had
happened<00:02:07.500> was<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.580> there<00:02:09.539> was<00:02:09.720> just<00:02:09.840> a

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
happened was that there was just a

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.330 
happened was that there was just a
random<00:02:10.140> bunch<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.649> flowers<00:02:10.979> stuck<00:02:11.190> together

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
random bunch of flowers stuck together

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.229 
random bunch of flowers stuck together
way<00:02:11.640> into<00:02:11.849> flora

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
way into flora

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.540 
way into flora
or<00:02:12.420> maybe<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.870> know

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
or maybe you know

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.670 
or maybe you know
we<00:02:14.180> actually<00:02:14.450> didn't<00:02:14.870> mean<00:02:14.990> anything<00:02:15.290> at<00:02:15.500> all

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
we actually didn't mean anything at all

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.930 
we actually didn't mean anything at all
because<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.160> doesn't<00:02:16.370> actually<00:02:16.610> represent

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
because that doesn't actually represent

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.970 
because that doesn't actually represent
anything<00:02:17.480> like<00:02:17.870> what<00:02:18.320> our<00:02:18.350> relationship<00:02:18.950> was

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
anything like what our relationship was

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.650 
anything like what our relationship was
like<00:02:19.250> which<00:02:19.460> was<00:02:19.610> like<00:02:19.820> very<00:02:20.060> casual

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
like which was like very casual

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.370 
like which was like very casual
basically<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.520> as<00:02:22.520> a<00:02:23.480> result<00:02:24.020> I<00:02:24.170> actually

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
basically and as a result I actually

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.260 
basically and as a result I actually
think<00:02:24.710> that<00:02:24.920> if<00:02:25.100> I<00:02:25.310> were<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:25.760> look<00:02:25.880> into<00:02:26.090> that

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
think that if I were to look into that

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.330 
think that if I were to look into that
it<00:02:26.480> would<00:02:26.660> be<00:02:26.810> in<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.260> sense<00:02:27.500> pursuing<00:02:28.070> a<00:02:28.160> blue

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
it would be in a sense pursuing a blue

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.730 
it would be in a sense pursuing a blue
rose<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.270> also<00:02:29.540> pursuing<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:29.990> blue<00:02:30.170> rose<00:02:30.410> in

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
rose and also pursuing a blue rose in

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.530 
rose and also pursuing a blue rose in
the<00:02:30.920> sense<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:31.550> it<00:02:32.150> would<00:02:32.480> be<00:02:33.850> nothing<00:02:34.850> it's

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
the sense that it would be nothing it's

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.450 
the sense that it would be nothing it's
just<00:02:35.690> in<00:02:36.020> my<00:02:36.350> imagination<00:02:36.440> it's<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.160> complete

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
just in my imagination it's a complete

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.030 
just in my imagination it's a complete
Mirage<00:02:37.820> just<00:02:38.390> new<00:02:38.570> illusion<00:02:38.990> and<00:02:39.200> also<00:02:39.800> I'm

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
Mirage just new illusion and also I'm

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.460 
Mirage just new illusion and also I'm
really<00:02:40.070> happy<00:02:40.670> with<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.420> people<00:02:41.780> person<00:02:42.380> that

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
really happy with the people person that

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.230 
really happy with the people person that
I'm<00:02:42.590> with<00:02:42.710> now<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.370> life<00:02:43.520> I've<00:02:43.730> built

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
I'm with now and the life I've built

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.970 
I'm with now and the life I've built
around<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:45.110> whole<00:02:45.290> thing<00:02:45.530> or<00:02:45.650> we<00:02:45.770> build

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
around the whole thing or we build

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.280 
around the whole thing or we build
around<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.490> so<00:02:46.970> that's<00:02:47.210> all<00:02:47.420> fine<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.110> I<00:02:48.230> don't

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
around it so that's all fine and I don't

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.020 
around it so that's all fine and I don't
have<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.590> problem<00:02:48.710> with<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:49.010> now<00:02:49.520> talking<00:02:49.910> about

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
have a problem with it now talking about

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.620 
have a problem with it now talking about
real<00:02:50.390> blue<00:02:50.720> roses<00:02:51.880> well<00:02:52.880> there<00:02:53.060> are<00:02:53.180> no<00:02:53.390> real

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
real blue roses well there are no real

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.840 
real blue roses well there are no real
blue<00:02:53.870> roses<00:02:54.080> about<00:02:54.440> 20<00:02:54.830> years<00:02:54.950> ago<00:02:55.250> there<00:02:55.700> was

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
blue roses about 20 years ago there was

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.100 
blue roses about 20 years ago there was
a<00:02:55.880> genetically<00:02:56.420> engineered<00:02:56.780> I<00:02:56.870> think<00:02:57.050> it

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
a genetically engineered I think it

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.330 
a genetically engineered I think it
might<00:02:57.260> be<00:02:57.410> more<00:02:57.530> recent<00:02:57.830> naturally<00:02:58.130> there<00:02:58.250> was

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
might be more recent naturally there was

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.190 
might be more recent naturally there was
a<00:02:58.400> genetically<00:02:58.910> engineered<00:02:59.510> so-called<00:02:59.990> blue

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
a genetically engineered so-called blue

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.650 
a genetically engineered so-called blue
rose<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.850> actually<00:03:01.850> it<00:03:01.940> was<00:03:02.090> lilac<00:03:02.300> they<00:03:02.600> were

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
rose and actually it was lilac they were

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.120 
rose and actually it was lilac they were
able<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.900> knock<00:03:03.200> out<00:03:03.380> all<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.650> genes<00:03:03.860> that<00:03:03.950> did

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
able to knock out all the genes that did

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.430 
able to knock out all the genes that did
the<00:03:04.250> color<00:03:04.550> and<00:03:04.820> introduce<00:03:05.750> something<00:03:05.990> like<00:03:06.410> a

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
the color and introduce something like a

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.290 
the color and introduce something like a
gene<00:03:06.950> from<00:03:07.070> a<00:03:07.160> rhododendron<00:03:07.490> or<00:03:07.880> something

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
gene from a rhododendron or something

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.150 
gene from a rhododendron or something
that<00:03:08.450> made<00:03:08.600> it<00:03:08.720> lilac<00:03:09.110> but<00:03:09.470> they<00:03:09.620> advertised

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
that made it lilac but they advertised

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.400 
that made it lilac but they advertised
it<00:03:10.370> as<00:03:10.400> blue<00:03:10.700> and<00:03:11.000> that's<00:03:11.390> typical<00:03:12.140> of<00:03:12.260> the

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
it as blue and that's typical of the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.940 
it as blue and that's typical of the
kind<00:03:12.710> of<00:03:12.950> illusory<00:03:13.670> mirages<00:03:14.300> that<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:14.660> get

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
kind of illusory mirages that you get

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.590 
kind of illusory mirages that you get
when<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.070> think<00:03:16.100> about<00:03:16.340> blue<00:03:16.640> roses<00:03:16.940> the

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
when you think about blue roses the

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.450 
when you think about blue roses the
other<00:03:17.750> way<00:03:17.900> of<00:03:17.990> doing<00:03:18.140> it<00:03:18.380> is<00:03:18.860> to<00:03:19.100> get<00:03:19.250> white

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
other way of doing it is to get white

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.450 
other way of doing it is to get white
rose<00:03:19.780> plant<00:03:20.780> it<00:03:20.990> in<00:03:21.140> some<00:03:21.530> ink<00:03:22.250> or<00:03:22.430> something

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
rose plant it in some ink or something

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.280 
rose plant it in some ink or something
something<00:03:22.970> it's<00:03:23.150> blue<00:03:23.330> and<00:03:23.510> then<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:24.020> pillar

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
something it's blue and then the pillar

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.020 
something it's blue and then the pillar
is<00:03:24.350> in<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.650> Rose<00:03:24.800> will<00:03:25.040> draw<00:03:25.280> it<00:03:25.490> up<00:03:25.640> into<00:03:25.880> the

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
is in the Rose will draw it up into the

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.150 
is in the Rose will draw it up into the
petals<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.570> it<00:03:26.660> will<00:03:26.810> become<00:03:27.080> blue<00:03:27.440> there's

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
petals and it will become blue there's

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.040 
petals and it will become blue there's
also<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.400> Chinese<00:03:28.670> legend<00:03:29.330> about<00:03:29.420> that<00:03:29.780> which

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
also a Chinese legend about that which

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.300 
also a Chinese legend about that which
is<00:03:30.170> quite<00:03:30.320> interesting<00:03:30.800> that<00:03:30.890> I've<00:03:31.010> got<00:03:31.130> time

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
is quite interesting that I've got time

basically<00:03:34.220> an<00:03:34.400> illusion<00:03:34.970> and<00:03:36.010> my<00:03:37.010> own

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
basically an illusion and my own

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.850 
basically an illusion and my own
language<00:03:37.880> flowers<00:03:38.330> thing<00:03:38.570> is<00:03:39.050> an<00:03:39.230> illusion<00:03:39.680> -

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.310

going<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.530> stick<00:03:42.740> with<00:03:42.770> that<00:03:42.920> and<00:03:44.200> say<00:03:45.790> that's

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
going to stick with that and say that's

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.540 
going to stick with that and say that's
the<00:03:47.030> symbolism<00:03:47.330> of<00:03:47.540> blue<00:03:47.660> roses<00:03:47.870> if<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:49.310> liked
