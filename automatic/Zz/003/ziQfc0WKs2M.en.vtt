 one side of rock history to the 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.170
 obama continues here even has these 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.410
 mountains here has a little bit of 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.000
 coquina so the legacy that also 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.470

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.380
 So this does not do it here. 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.299

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.000
 He 'll never do that, they 're never there. 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.500
 here are some more cool parts 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.710

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.400
 water, but the water does not change in the 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.140
 world is wise to that noisy changed 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.900

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:27.720
 participate because it is really very 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.220
 pretty very sagacious and comfortable I 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.830

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:48.509
 then into a tree after 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.449
 our face that impressive but beauty 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:55.530
 I'm going to leave that village that I do not 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:58.139
 I found it right as a paschal mystery 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.879
 mystery now if you will be thinking about me 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:03.150

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:07.110
 What will happen to that village ? 

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:09.569
 I'm really curious to know 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:12.090
 so if you're curious, you come in 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:14.189

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.860

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:19.169
 Spanish look there has three diamonds one 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.240
 horse and dead mpc

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:35.580
 because I liked it because this biome here 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.289
 I've never seen in my life in this 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.330
 minecraft has so much to play the 

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:41.969
 that they make and make new biomes that 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.500
 I find it unnecessarily since the 

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:45.810
 blocks are still square 

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:49.129
