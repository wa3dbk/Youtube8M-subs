changing things the 16 bit can be

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.450 
changing things the 16 bit can be
helpful<00:00:33.270> for<00:00:33.630> increasing<00:00:34.050> speed<00:00:34.410> as<00:00:35.070> well<00:00:35.399> as

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
helpful for increasing speed as well as

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.600 
helpful for increasing speed as well as
you<00:00:35.940> know<00:00:36.059> mapping<00:00:36.630> local<00:00:37.079> resources<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.250> you

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
you know mapping local resources so you

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.810 
you know mapping local resources so you
can<00:00:38.820> map<00:00:39.120> drives<00:00:39.750> like<00:00:40.260> C<00:00:40.620> drives<00:00:41.010> various

can map drives like C drives various

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.930 
can map drives like C drives various
Network<00:00:42.809> shares<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.620> things<00:00:43.829> like<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.399> over

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
Network shares and things like that over

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.000 
Network shares and things like that over
the<00:00:45.890> over<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.010> tool<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.600> also<00:00:49.010> go

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
the over this tool and you can also go

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.569 
the over this tool and you can also go
ahead<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.960> get<00:00:51.960> capture<00:00:52.410> remote<00:00:52.710> audio<00:00:53.129> or

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
ahead and get capture remote audio or

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.010 
ahead and get capture remote audio or
even<00:00:54.110> a<00:00:55.110> remote<00:00:55.890> microphone<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:57.020> there's

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
even a remote microphone so there's

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.260 
even a remote microphone so there's
programs<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.190> be<00:00:59.250> run<00:00:59.550> when<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.969> start

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
programs that can be run when you start

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.540 
programs that can be run when you start
and<00:01:00.420> stop<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.230> also<00:01:01.410> we<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:01.920> select<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and stop this and also we can select the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.869 
and stop this and also we can select the
speed<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.030> our<00:01:03.120> networks

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
speed of our networks

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.590 
speed of our networks
those<00:01:04.350> kind<00:01:05.350> of<00:01:05.439> like<00:01:05.619> how<00:01:06.070> much<00:01:06.520> to<00:01:07.030> push<00:01:07.360> it

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
those kind of like how much to push it

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.219 
those kind of like how much to push it
now<00:01:08.439> once<00:01:09.070> you<00:01:09.369> have<00:01:10.119> typed<00:01:10.479> all<00:01:10.750> this<00:01:10.930> stuff

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
now once you have typed all this stuff

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.469 
now once you have typed all this stuff
and<00:01:11.500> you<00:01:11.650> simply<00:01:11.950> have<00:01:12.369> to<00:01:12.520> hit<00:01:12.700> connect<00:01:13.150> and

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
and you simply have to hit connect and

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.480 
and you simply have to hit connect and
it'll<00:01:14.350> bring<00:01:14.560> up<00:01:14.830> a<00:01:14.979> window<00:01:15.130> like<00:01:15.670> this<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:17.490> go

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
it'll bring up a window like this and go

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.210 
it'll bring up a window like this and go
ahead<00:01:18.729> and<00:01:18.880> login<00:01:19.119> to<00:01:19.869> the<00:01:20.080> server<00:01:20.440> here<00:01:20.890> and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
ahead and login to the server here and

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.460 
ahead and login to the server here and
now<00:01:21.520> once<00:01:22.360> not<00:01:22.600> logged<00:01:22.869> the<00:01:23.080> end<00:01:23.259> of<00:01:23.380> the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
now once not logged the end of the

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.889 
now once not logged the end of the
server<00:01:23.799> I'm<00:01:24.159> actually<00:01:24.580> inside<00:01:25.330> of<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.570> party

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
server I'm actually inside of the party

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.560 
server I'm actually inside of the party
connection<00:01:26.649> so<00:01:26.830> this<00:01:26.950> is<00:01:27.100> a<00:01:27.130> Microsoft<00:01:27.700> 8003

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
connection so this is a Microsoft 8003

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.609 
connection so this is a Microsoft 8003
server<00:01:28.930> and<00:01:29.470> it<00:01:30.369> has<00:01:30.549> got<00:01:31.440> quite<00:01:32.440> a<00:01:32.470> few

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
server and it has got quite a few

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:33.899 
server and it has got quite a few
different<00:01:32.860> things<00:01:32.950> installed<00:01:33.369> on<00:01:33.640> it<00:01:33.759> that<00:01:33.880> I

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
different things installed on it that I

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.809 
different things installed on it that I
can<00:01:34.090> utilize<00:01:34.270> and<00:01:34.690> run<00:01:34.869> if<00:01:35.229> necessary<00:01:35.950> so<00:01:36.640> when

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
can utilize and run if necessary so when

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:38.999 
can utilize and run if necessary so when
I<00:01:36.880> move<00:01:37.090> my<00:01:37.270> mouse<00:01:37.479> up<00:01:37.720> here<00:01:38.110> I<00:01:38.350> get<00:01:38.800> a<00:01:38.830> little

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
I move my mouse up here I get a little

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.460 
I move my mouse up here I get a little
drop-down<00:01:39.460> bar<00:01:39.759> and<00:01:40.179> I<00:01:40.330> can<00:01:40.539> go<00:01:40.720> and<00:01:41.229> actually

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
drop-down bar and I can go and actually

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.499 
drop-down bar and I can go and actually
minimize<00:01:42.039> that<00:01:42.280> so<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.819> difference<00:01:43.240> is<00:01:43.479> that

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
minimize that so the difference is that

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.809 
minimize that so the difference is that
I'm<00:01:44.050> now<00:01:44.440> in<00:01:44.470> control<00:01:44.920> of<00:01:45.069> my<00:01:45.340> regular

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
I'm now in control of my regular

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:48.690 
I'm now in control of my regular
computer<00:01:46.649> versus<00:01:47.649> being<00:01:47.860> in<00:01:48.039> control<00:01:48.429> of<00:01:48.580> this

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
computer versus being in control of this

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.300 
computer versus being in control of this
other<00:01:49.000> environment<00:01:49.869> which<00:01:50.409> is<00:01:50.679> living<00:01:51.039> inside

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
other environment which is living inside

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.969 
other environment which is living inside
of<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.670> server<00:01:51.970> and<00:01:52.360> nobody<00:01:53.319> else<00:01:53.560> can<00:01:53.740> see<00:01:53.950> me

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
of the server and nobody else can see me

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.669 
of the server and nobody else can see me
moving<00:01:54.460> my<00:01:54.789> mouse<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:55.750> manipulating<00:01:56.530> these

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
moving my mouse and manipulating these

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.440 
moving my mouse and manipulating these
windows<00:01:57.069> because<00:01:57.460> I'm<00:01:57.610> in<00:01:57.759> a<00:01:57.789> remote<00:01:58.149> desktop

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
windows because I'm in a remote desktop

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.169 
windows because I'm in a remote desktop
session<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.350> that's<00:01:59.500> how<00:02:00.130> it<00:02:00.280> works<00:02:00.520> so<00:02:00.729> you

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
session and that's how it works so you

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:02.999 
session and that's how it works so you
know<00:02:01.630> a<00:02:01.659> lot<00:02:01.929> of<00:02:02.020> people<00:02:02.289> want<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:02.560> close<00:02:02.799> out

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
know a lot of people want to close out

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.340 
know a lot of people want to close out
of<00:02:03.039> this<00:02:03.280> they'll<00:02:03.700> go<00:02:03.940> up<00:02:04.119> here<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.390> close<00:02:04.750> and

example this is a test now I'm going to

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.470 
example this is a test now I'm going to
actually<00:02:17.440> close<00:02:17.829> and<00:02:18.400> I'm<00:02:18.730> going<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.000> just<00:02:19.209> end
