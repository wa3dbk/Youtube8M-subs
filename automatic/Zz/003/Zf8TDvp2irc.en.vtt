 I know that sounds crazy but accurate 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.550
 that's it he is a human being 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.659
 from the gene laboratory 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.649
 stronger 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.649
 more quickly 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.070

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.979
 to deal with me 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.810

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.720
 Well, if that was the right time , it was 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.160
 but then ideal to have tickets for you 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.440
 my taste but I like the short one 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.810
 slow motion moments hitman agent for 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.580
 travel the hitman agent 47 brings the 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.560
 trendy century fox is expected 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.000
 the third of september 2015 in the 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.650
 German cinemas tell the story 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 just that an agent of none 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.620
 real name has but one 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.420
 bar code in the back of the head genetically 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.010
 generates around the properties of 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.780
 very many very very bad ones 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.250
 he is one of violent criminals 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.750
 the faster the better the 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.400
 Smart is smarter than anyone 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.500
 others, so to speak the perfect one 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.510
 killer machine and here in hitman agent 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.610
 47 a waitress must protect herself 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.140
 a syndicate and, above all, all 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.310
 So his skills must work 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.840
 we have the woman we have the man 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.310
 maybe a little bit of romance 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.810
 if you can imagine that though 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.760
 especially a whole lot of action and 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.079
 logos paired with explosions yet 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.090
 so see that the partial berlin 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.519
 what the overtone on alexanderplatz 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.599
 As for at least a short Zehmisch also 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.709
 see that there you always feel like that 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.650
 a bit like a small part of 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.129
 hollywood I have to say in the end 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.959
 video game adaptations thats one 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.519
 reissue of the hitman movie 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.930
 are always such a thing they are often 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.310
 Hotly discussed and sometimes enough 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.450
 neither to the depth of the story of 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.130
 original play ran 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.329
 still somehow you always have that 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.040
 Feeling a little something like that 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.840
 popular increasingly tried with it box 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.220
 to do office but not right 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.450
 constant story for the film and 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.920
 maybe this will be the character 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.569
 a little different because of her awesome 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.099
 trend yes the main actor is always 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.290
 a first series homeland knows and 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.819
 so that has definitely proved that 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.139
 a character is and above all 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.299
 always the zachary quinto at his side 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.920
 is one of the relatively considered 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.359
 his films also selects the power 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.040
 that's why there is so much for and 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.209
 and until the third september sun 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.829
 while now so let's wait a 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.400

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.019
