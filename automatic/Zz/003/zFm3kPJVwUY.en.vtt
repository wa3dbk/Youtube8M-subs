yarn ball core so it's not providing

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.440 
yarn ball core so it's not providing
much<00:02:15.590> of<00:02:15.620> its<00:02:16.010> own<00:02:16.220> tension<00:02:16.790> but<00:02:17.000> typically

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
much of its own tension but typically

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.970 
much of its own tension but typically
you<00:02:17.569> would<00:02:17.690> have<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.930> lot<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.230> be<00:02:18.440> going<00:02:18.680> on<00:02:18.799> the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
you would have a lot of be going on the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.300 
you would have a lot of be going on the
normal<00:02:19.489> or<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:20.569> weight<00:02:20.780> of<00:02:20.959> that<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.920> going

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
normal or the weight of that and going

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.490 
normal or the weight of that and going
around<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:22.610> rod<00:02:22.849> would<00:02:23.060> create<00:02:23.360> tension<00:02:23.810> and

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
around this rod would create tension and

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.500 
around this rod would create tension and
but<00:02:24.980> if<00:02:25.069> you<00:02:25.190> have<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.459> apply<00:02:25.730> any<00:02:26.060> additional

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
but if you have to apply any additional

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.210 
but if you have to apply any additional
tension<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:27.019> simply<00:02:27.349> take<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.680> in<00:02:27.769> your<00:02:27.890> hand

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
tension you simply take it in your hand

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.729 
tension you simply take it in your hand
on<00:02:28.700> its<00:02:28.849> way<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.329> ball<00:02:29.510> winder<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:30.680> you

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
on its way to the ball winder and you

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.289 
on its way to the ball winder and you
can<00:02:30.860> see<00:02:31.069> that<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.459> know<00:02:31.549> there's<00:02:31.849> a<00:02:31.940> great

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
can see that you know there's a great

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.059 
can see that you know there's a great
method<00:02:32.540> for<00:02:32.870> getting<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.290> yarn<00:02:33.500> off<00:02:33.739> of<00:02:33.920> your

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
method for getting the yarn off of your

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.630 
method for getting the yarn off of your
ball<00:02:34.280> winder<00:02:35.500> onto<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.530> core<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.190> if<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.430> want

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
ball winder onto a core and if you want

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.759 
ball winder onto a core and if you want
to<00:02:37.730> rewind<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.269> or<00:02:38.390> use<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.569> off<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:39.019> there<00:02:39.200> you

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
to rewind it or use it off of there you

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.770 
to rewind it or use it off of there you
simply<00:02:40.130> mount<00:02:40.370> on<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:40.730> comb<00:02:41.150> over<00:02:41.450> like<00:02:41.630> we've

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
simply mount on the comb over like we've

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.479 
simply mount on the comb over like we've
done<00:02:41.959> on<00:02:42.440> this<00:02:42.590> sequence<00:02:42.860> we're<00:02:43.250> going<00:02:43.400> to

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
done on this sequence we're going to

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.750 
done on this sequence we're going to
take<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:44.239> seven-inch<00:02:45.220> yarn

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
take a seven-inch yarn

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.680 
take a seven-inch yarn
comb<00:02:47.329> and<00:02:48.319> it's<00:02:48.620> 100<00:02:49.579> me<00:02:49.849> ounces<00:02:50.150> maybe<00:02:50.299> about

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
comb and it's 100 me ounces maybe about

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.569 
comb and it's 100 me ounces maybe about
eight<00:02:50.840> ten<00:02:51.200> ounces<00:02:51.560> on<00:02:51.739> there<00:02:51.920> what<00:02:52.220> video

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
eight ten ounces on there what video

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.080 
eight ten ounces on there what video
actually<00:02:53.060> we're<00:02:53.959> an<00:02:54.049> amount<00:02:54.319> on<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.709> 3/8<00:02:55.370> 316

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
actually we're an amount on the 3/8 316

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:03.120 
actually we're an amount on the 3/8 316
stainless<00:02:56.450> steel<00:02:57.260> rod<00:02:58.329> included<00:02:59.329> the<00:02:59.480> slot

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.990 

see<00:03:04.130> how<00:03:04.280> it's<00:03:04.760> suspended<00:03:05.209> there<00:03:05.510> on<00:03:05.840> that<00:03:06.079> rod

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
see how it's suspended there on that rod

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.849 
see how it's suspended there on that rod
then<00:03:08.000> we'll<00:03:08.239> mount<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.840> one-inch<00:03:09.560> diver<00:03:10.420> down

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
then we'll mount the one-inch diver down

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:17.650 
then we'll mount the one-inch diver down
in<00:03:12.859> the<00:03:12.980> lower<00:03:13.160> position<00:03:15.430> this<00:03:16.430> will<00:03:16.670> add

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
in the lower position this will add

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.839 
in the lower position this will add
additional<00:03:17.810> tension<00:03:18.349> ecwid<00:03:18.709> while<00:03:18.859> you<00:03:21.849> run

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
additional tension ecwid while you run

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.190 
additional tension ecwid while you run
the<00:03:23.090> yarn<00:03:23.540> underneath<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:24.109> dowel<00:03:26.200> through

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
the yarn underneath the dowel through

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.370 
the yarn underneath the dowel through
the<00:03:27.470> wire<00:03:27.769> form<00:03:29.500> just<00:03:30.500> like<00:03:30.590> that<00:03:32.169> and<00:03:33.169> then<00:03:33.290> we

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
the wire form just like that and then we

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.930 
the wire form just like that and then we
go<00:03:33.500> over<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.769> the<00:03:33.859> ball<00:03:34.010> one

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.570 

tremendous<00:03:39.940> tension<00:03:40.150> on<00:03:40.480> this<00:03:40.659> stuff<00:03:41.159> on<00:03:42.159> the

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
tremendous tension on this stuff on the

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.920 
tremendous tension on this stuff on the
ball<00:03:42.760> winder<00:03:42.940> this<00:03:43.239> point<00:03:43.480> because<00:03:43.690> the

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
ball winder this point because the

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.280 
ball winder this point because the
weight<00:03:44.260> of<00:03:44.290> that<00:03:44.709> comb<00:03:45.040> is<00:03:45.310> fairly<00:03:46.269> high<00:03:46.599> and

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
weight of that comb is fairly high and

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.380 
weight of that comb is fairly high and
it<00:03:48.040> has<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.310> tremendous<00:03:48.849> amount<00:03:48.909> of<00:03:49.060> tension<00:03:51.390> so

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
it has a tremendous amount of tension so

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.910 
it has a tremendous amount of tension so
if<00:03:52.480> you<00:03:52.599> find<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:52.989> debtor<00:03:53.200> becomes<00:03:53.650> an<00:03:53.799> issue

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
if you find the debtor becomes an issue

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.360 
if you find the debtor becomes an issue
area<00:03:54.159> simply<00:03:55.590> don't<00:03:56.590> wrap<00:03:56.799> it<00:03:56.950> against<00:03:57.159> the

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
area simply don't wrap it against the

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.069 
area simply don't wrap it against the
air<00:03:57.579> around<00:03:57.879> the<00:03:58.090> big<00:03:58.780> dog<00:03:58.989> and<00:04:00.870> see<00:04:01.870> how<00:04:01.930> it's

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
air around the big dog and see how it's

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.170 
air around the big dog and see how it's
coming<00:04:02.110> off<00:04:02.470> here<00:04:02.709> in<00:04:02.860> a<00:04:02.890> control<00:04:03.310> condition

what<00:04:04.540> makes<00:04:04.720> this<00:04:04.930> qohor<00:04:05.530> unique<00:04:05.860> is<00:04:06.069> that<00:04:06.099> we

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
what makes this qohor unique is that we

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.330 
what makes this qohor unique is that we
mount<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:07.409> columns<00:04:08.409> horizontally<00:04:09.040> as

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
mount the columns horizontally as

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.479 
mount the columns horizontally as
opposed<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:09.879> in<00:04:10.120> a<00:04:10.180> vertical<00:04:10.450> manner<00:04:11.250> if<00:04:12.250> this

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
opposed to in a vertical manner if this

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.670 
opposed to in a vertical manner if this
romantic<00:04:12.790> vertically<00:04:13.359> you'd<00:04:13.569> have<00:04:13.720> it<00:04:13.840> you'd

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
romantic vertically you'd have it you'd

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.259 
romantic vertically you'd have it you'd
have<00:04:14.890> a<00:04:14.920> great<00:04:15.129> deal<00:04:15.400> of<00:04:15.579> trouble<00:04:15.819> trying<00:04:16.090> to

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
have a great deal of trouble trying to

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.819 
have a great deal of trouble trying to
get<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.539> yarn<00:04:16.720> off<00:04:16.870> it<00:04:17.109> unless<00:04:17.320> it<00:04:17.530> was<00:04:17.650> on<00:04:17.799> a

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
get the yarn off it unless it was on a

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.490 
get the yarn off it unless it was on a
special<00:04:18.310> platform<00:04:19.079> or<00:04:20.079> unless<00:04:20.289> you're

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
special platform or unless you're

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.830 
special platform or unless you're
pointing<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:20.979> yarn<00:04:21.160> overhead<00:04:21.789> so<00:04:22.510> in<00:04:22.690> this

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
pointing the yarn overhead so in this

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.770 
pointing the yarn overhead so in this
case<00:04:23.080> we<00:04:23.320> easily<00:04:23.620> remove<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.430> yarn<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:25.720> a

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
case we easily remove the yarn and a

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.480 
case we easily remove the yarn and a
horizontal<00:04:26.080> ball<00:04:26.470> very<00:04:27.010> similar<00:04:27.310> to<00:04:27.400> the

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
horizontal ball very similar to the

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.830 
horizontal ball very similar to the
manner<00:04:27.729> which<00:04:27.910> you<00:04:28.090> would<00:04:28.270> actually<00:04:28.479> pull

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
manner which you would actually pull

put it in the vertical mount on the rear
of<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:31.090> eye<00:05:31.120> and<00:05:31.990> we<00:05:32.110> take<00:05:32.290> a<00:05:32.320> normal<00:05:32.590> drinking

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
of the eye and we take a normal drinking

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.420 
of the eye and we take a normal drinking
straw<00:05:33.750> which<00:05:34.750> is<00:05:34.900> also<00:05:35.080> about<00:05:35.500> 3/16<00:05:36.280> of<00:05:36.340> an

straw which is also about 3/16 of an
inch<00:05:36.550> and<00:05:37.290> slip<00:05:38.290> it<00:05:38.410> over<00:05:38.530> the<00:05:38.770> steel<00:05:39.280> rod

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
inch and slip it over the steel rod

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.920 
inch and slip it over the steel rod
you'll<00:05:40.000> notice<00:05:40.300> that<00:05:40.420> there's<00:05:40.600> still<00:05:40.840> about

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
you'll notice that there's still about

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.710 
you'll notice that there's still about
an<00:05:41.110> inch<00:05:41.290> of<00:05:41.470> straw<00:05:41.740> about<00:05:42.130> the<00:05:42.340> abroad<00:05:42.730> the

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
an inch of straw about the abroad the

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.450 
an inch of straw about the abroad the
reason<00:05:43.960> we<00:05:44.080> do<00:05:44.200> that<00:05:44.230> is<00:05:44.440> it<00:05:44.740> supports<00:05:45.220> the

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
reason we do that is it supports the

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.220 
reason we do that is it supports the
scroll<00:05:45.760> so<00:05:46.060> it's<00:05:46.240> got<00:05:46.420> some<00:05:46.450> strength<00:05:46.960> and

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
scroll so it's got some strength and

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.770 
scroll so it's got some strength and
you'll<00:05:47.710> see<00:05:47.890> why<00:05:48.070> in<00:05:48.130> a<00:05:48.250> moment<00:05:48.450> we<00:05:49.450> don't<00:05:49.570> take

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
you'll see why in a moment we don't take

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.860 
you'll see why in a moment we don't take
our<00:05:50.020> drop<00:05:50.800> spindle<00:05:51.220> and<00:05:51.610> we<00:05:51.790> hope<00:05:52.330> the<00:05:52.570> end<00:05:52.750> of

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
our drop spindle and we hope the end of

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.270 
our drop spindle and we hope the end of
it<00:05:52.960> in<00:05:53.170> the<00:05:53.290> top<00:05:53.470> of<00:05:53.650> the<00:05:53.710> straw<00:05:55.620> so<00:05:56.620> some<00:05:57.040> drop

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
it in the top of the straw so some drop

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.890 
it in the top of the straw so some drop
spindles<00:05:57.640> have<00:05:57.760> a<00:05:57.790> more<00:05:58.030> pointed<00:05:58.300> end<00:05:58.720> which

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
spindles have a more pointed end which

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.110 
spindles have a more pointed end which
makes<00:05:59.080> it<00:05:59.290> easier<00:05:59.530> to<00:05:59.680> do<00:05:59.800> this<00:05:59.950> but<00:06:00.220> usually

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
makes it easier to do this but usually

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.810 
makes it easier to do this but usually
anyone<00:06:01.540> will<00:06:01.690> work<00:06:01.900> and<00:06:02.710> we<00:06:02.830> take<00:06:03.010> our<00:06:03.220> yarn<00:06:03.400> on

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
anyone will work and we take our yarn on

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.820 
anyone will work and we take our yarn on
the<00:06:03.880> drums<00:06:04.210> fiddle<00:06:04.570> and<00:06:05.230> just<00:06:05.410> push<00:06:05.620> it<00:06:05.800> down

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
the drums fiddle and just push it down

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.960 
the drums fiddle and just push it down
onto<00:06:06.460> the<00:06:06.550> straw<00:06:08.190> now<00:06:09.190> we<00:06:09.250> can<00:06:09.520> remove<00:06:09.670> this

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
onto the straw now we can remove this

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.450 
onto the straw now we can remove this
for<00:06:10.210> everyone<00:06:10.510> and<00:06:11.020> we<00:06:11.140> have<00:06:11.380> our<00:06:11.620> yarn<00:06:11.920> on<00:06:12.250> the
