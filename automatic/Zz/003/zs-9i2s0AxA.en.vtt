00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello everybody, we 'll show you in this video in a 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.300
 experience that will serve to observe 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.139
 Yield some engines 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.800
 electrical 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.189
 this way we will 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.960
 some friends looking for engines for 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.230
 a wind generator 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.220
 we selected ten engines and 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.349
 we will test each of them to know 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:36.000
 which ones can be used in a generator 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:40.710
 the engines submitted to the test 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.719
 will be this other printer engine 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:50.760
 tape drive motor motor tape 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:55.020
 dvd engine dvd engine 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:00.989
 engine camera of a 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.879
 other motor carriage 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.670
 of cart 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.070
 therefore ten engines that will be tested 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.799
 in order to see the performance of each 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.950
 their 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:17.880
 our appliance is composed of six 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.799
 children who make nine volts 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:26.479
 these six batteries powered this engine 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:29.310
 that will drive the intense engine 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.450
 this engine under test and generate the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.850
 which the Bolt Metro will register and we will know 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.200
 the voltage that each of the motors 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.159
 tested will provide you with the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.130
 performance of a cart 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:50.360
 the test we will trigger the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.280
 switch and last sector will register 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.350
 this energy 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:02.930
 both the engine of a car is not 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:04.680
 providing around 4.45 46 books 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.789
 4.46 points 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:13.590
 is what provides the engine of your car 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:16.800
 is undergoing a second test 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.700
 motor or trolley motor another motor 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.230
 of cart 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:27.540
 this motor can generate energy of 3.12 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:33.620
 3014 is more or less this attention 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.620
 known for this career engine 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.269
 third engine tested to test 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.690
 a toy train engine 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:53.900
 We'll run then screamed and this 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:53.900
 engine generates only 1,76 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.500
 point 3 and 1.77 landing 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:10.090
 we will now test the motor of a camera 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:13.800
 photo a small engine and we 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.800
 we will now see your income 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:25.650
 therefore a camera shaker can 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:34.370
 yield up to 3.12 good 31 and 33 billion 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:37.709
 wons we will now test a dvd engine 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:50.420
 DVD apparatus has two motors one 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:50.420
 of them will be tested now they think deceased 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:04:01.820
 6.86 from the happy inner rock and spin it 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:04.080
 range of 7 kilo 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:09.620
 the 10 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.620
 this well-known pdt promoter attention 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:17.250
 now we will be an engine of another 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.320
 motor 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.320
 we will note that it provides 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:37.210
 this engine can know 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:40.180
 because 4,13 ar 14 438 vox 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:46.860
 this is the voltage supplied by that other 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:51.340
 dvd engine now we will test a motor 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:55.150
 taken from a car plays tapes they 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:05:00.160
 old plays we 'll fire the 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:08.560
 motor switch rotates and at the same time 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:13.980
 generating around 4.43 44 45 6 volts 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.980
 this is the voltage generated by this motor 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:23.410
 we will now show the performance of a 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.470
 engine printer engine that both nodes 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:30.880
 we recommend and now we'll see why 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:36.380
 this recommendation, see that by triggering the 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:41.900
 printer motor switch rotates 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:44.780
 and provides 17.97 bulls 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:48.340
 none of the other engines provide the 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:55.160
 next disk but can provide 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:58.000
 above 17 bulls so they are so 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.000
 recommended 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:06.770
 we will now have the performance of another 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.810
 printer driver slightly smaller than the 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:12.050
 than previously used 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:14.600
 Note that this engine is much smaller than 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.730
 another printer but it will also 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.540
 generate good energy 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:26.410
 the switch and this small 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:26.410
 printer engine is capable of generating up to 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:34.700
 13,13 14 flights 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:37.490
 with this we are seeing in practice that the 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.370
 printer engines really are the 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:43.760
 better engines for the construction of 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:47.780
 generators is great because even though he was 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:51.860
 small they can provide energy 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:53.420
 enough to power mockups and 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.180
 take the light 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:59.920
 note that these engines are also 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:02.630
 capable of lighting multiple LEDs 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.820
 here we have some LEDs connected in 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:08.840
 parallel 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:11.500
 we will trip the switch and the LEDs 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.500
 they light 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:25.540
 the staff hope to have helped from 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.900
 someway 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.610
 such information shall be included in the 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.400
 our youtube channel 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:36.750
 a big hug to all and await the 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.750
 our next videos
