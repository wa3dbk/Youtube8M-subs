00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.039 
check it out at first but after playing
it<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.880> found<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.240> earlier<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.630> be<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> little<00:01:42.960> bit

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
it I found it earlier to be a little bit

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.770 
it I found it earlier to be a little bit
faster<00:01:43.560> than<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.920> RTS<00:01:44.340> style<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:45.540> almost

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
faster than the RTS style it's almost

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.179 
faster than the RTS style it's almost
like<00:01:45.990> they'll<00:01:46.170> force<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.619> make<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
like they'll force to make this in the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.980 
like they'll force to make this in the
last<00:01:47.430> five<00:01:47.700> minutes<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.180> their<00:01:48.390> seven<00:01:48.720> minute
