the<00:00:02.250> speculum<00:00:02.790> is<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:02.909> device<00:00:03.240> that<00:00:03.480> opens<00:00:03.629> up<00:00:03.929> a

the speculum is a device that opens up a
body<00:00:04.200> cavity<00:00:04.500> I'm<00:00:05.190> often<00:00:05.460> asked<00:00:05.879> what's<00:00:06.060> that

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
body cavity I'm often asked what's that

body cavity I'm often asked what's that
metal<00:00:06.540> thing<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:06.839> those<00:00:06.990> guys<00:00:07.200> stick<00:00:07.470> in<00:00:07.589> the

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649

it is it gives it is accepted well by
the<00:01:15.330> horse<00:01:15.630> once<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.140> hand<00:01:16.470> gets<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:16.830> there

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
the horse once the hand gets in there

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.800 
the horse once the hand gets in there
and<00:01:17.189> also<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.880> has<00:01:18.030> these<00:01:18.210> really<00:01:18.479> good

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
and also it has these really good

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.560 
and also it has these really good
tactile<00:01:19.320> senses<00:01:19.830> here<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.850> say<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.270> can

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
tactile senses here that can say I can

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.340 
tactile senses here that can say I can
sense<00:01:22.189> sharp<00:01:23.189> points<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.299> find<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.840> if<00:01:25.110> I

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
sense sharp points and I find that if I

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.410 
sense sharp points and I find that if I
can<00:01:25.560> feel<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.040> doesn't<00:01:26.520> necessarily<00:01:27.180> mean<00:01:27.390> I

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
can feel it doesn't necessarily mean I

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.260 
can feel it doesn't necessarily mean I
can<00:01:27.750> see<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.470> if<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.430> can<00:01:29.670> feel<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.180> know

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
can see it and if I can feel it I know

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.870 
can see it and if I can feel it I know
the<00:01:30.570> horse<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:31.020> feel<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.860> really<00:01:32.400> like

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the horse can feel it so I really like

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.120 
the horse can feel it so I really like
using<00:01:33.150> my<00:01:33.329> hand<00:01:33.630> as<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> speculum<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.860> does<00:01:35.100> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
using my hand as a speculum it does a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.160 
using my hand as a speculum it does a
great<00:01:35.340> job<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:36.060> can<00:01:36.420> reach<00:01:36.600> all<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.960> way<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.079> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
great job I can reach all the way to the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.170 
great job I can reach all the way to the
very<00:01:37.290> back<00:01:37.560> tooth<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.159> feel<00:01:38.640> both<00:01:38.880> top<00:01:39.150> and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
very back tooth and feel both top and

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.569 
very back tooth and feel both top and
bottom<00:01:39.420> inside<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.049> out<00:01:40.290> with<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.650> yes

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
bottom inside and out with it yes

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.219 
bottom inside and out with it yes
there's<00:01:41.820> danger<00:01:42.240> there's<00:01:42.479> no<00:01:42.630> doubt<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.079> use

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
there's danger there's no doubt I use

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.499 
there's danger there's no doubt I use
Kevlar<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:44.100> my<00:01:44.250> wrist<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.700> prevent<00:01:44.970> cuts<00:01:45.270> from

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
Kevlar on my wrist to prevent cuts from

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.990 
Kevlar on my wrist to prevent cuts from
incisors<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.409> canines<00:01:46.799> but<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
incisors and the canines but the

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.670 
incisors and the canines but the
I<00:01:49.090> don't<00:01:49.570> know<00:01:49.630> I've<00:01:49.750> just<00:01:49.780> been<00:01:50.020> used<00:01:50.320> doing

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
I don't know I've just been used doing

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.370 
I don't know I've just been used doing
it<00:01:50.770> for<00:01:50.860> so<00:01:51.010> long<00:01:51.040> since<00:01:51.460> you<00:01:51.850> know<00:01:51.940> 1983<00:01:52.780> that

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
it for so long since you know 1983 that

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.160 
it for so long since you know 1983 that
it<00:01:54.280> just<00:01:54.850> becomes<00:01:55.210> second<00:01:55.540> nature<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.810> me

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
it just becomes second nature to me

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.380 
it just becomes second nature to me
so<00:01:56.410> anyway<00:01:57.100> take<00:01:57.340> a<00:01:57.370> look<00:01:57.550> at<00:01:57.640> my<00:01:57.700> video<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.060> see

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
so anyway take a look at my video to see

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.020 
so anyway take a look at my video to see
how<00:01:58.570> its<00:01:58.780> are<00:01:59.080> the<00:02:00.010> fact<00:02:00.250> that<00:02:00.340> I<00:02:00.430> can<00:02:00.729> do<00:02:00.940> it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
how its are the fact that I can do it

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.219 
how its are the fact that I can do it
I'm<00:02:01.120> not<00:02:01.240> going<00:02:01.360> to<00:02:01.450> see<00:02:01.660> how<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:01.840> do<00:02:02.110> it

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229
