00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.569
 car almost dismantled 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.900
 every time I disassemble the Russian 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.469
 I get a car resistant 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.049
 the feeling that the designers AvtoVAZ 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:19.890
 bear some kind of wrongdoing they do 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.220
 something human worthy floor on 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.340
 so many bolts come up no would 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.410
 do on rivets as it should 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.560
 plastic clips there rivet need 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.840
 bolt selection bolt under the lid 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:41.489
 I don't know the cap under the shybochka 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.570
 disassembled one third plant all from her this 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:49.289
 not everything is just already out of anger all 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.440
 I left under the car well, I think everything with 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.910
 figured out the doors 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.550
 front driver's door handle 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.080
 this pen to pull me out 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:11.100
 I had to drive out the doors why now 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:14.820
 explain here it is a pen to become 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.780
 clear here it is like this 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:25.140
 here is the inside of this pen from here 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:29.430
 locks this bolt through the door further 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.979
 she puts all this on her 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.900
 here is a plastic handle 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:41.100
 but but to pull her out for turn out 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.610
 must notice there inside the doors here 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.479
 these are the holes where there are three fucking 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.590
 shurupchik and 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:54.390
 that keep this plastic here now yes 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.110
 these somehow can be seen 2 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.049
 but this one is under the larva here 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.100
 driven larvae they say there is a hole well 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.140
 how to notice him 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.080
 there and the little ones a screwdriver will not climb 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.690
 I do not understand how the poor collect 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.950
 AvtoVAZ collectors 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.690
 no would do something like 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:20.450
 fasteners and fasten it with this bolt 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.510
 it is necessary to invent so many of these 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:28.550
 the door was disassembled 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.250
 I found how to disassemble it I think everything with 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:38.300
 With these doors everything is clear somehow with grief 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:42.950
 in half all disassembled bumper remove the bumper 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:46.610
 the back falls here one on the other 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.330
 pad means go mudguard he 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.950
 screwed 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:55.010
 three groups further goes flap 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.209
 also screwed separately treat three 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:03.820
 screws and in the end in the bumper bolted 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:07.459
 two screws and the most interesting is not 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.440
 non standard faces per seven people i 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:14.329
 telling for you to know how 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:19.430
 disassemble the car and because there was neither 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:23.540
 had to break out but in order to 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:29.269
 Align the roof of me to remove the ceiling well 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:33.530
 there is more no less like all 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:36.320
 standard car handles for handles 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.440
 on the handles are the caps which 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:45.140
 you unscrew the hems you take off 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:49.070
 his pens this is what they call him 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:53.680
 sun visor protective lantern here 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:58.970
 the same as the standard well 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:03.410
 international here on this back 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:05.209
 sidebar here it is mine unfastened 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.780

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:13.750
 She'll get through the ceiling over there lights 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:18.459
 back stop the same 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:24.100
 try to pull the ceiling he's not going what 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:33.250
 the case is all unscrewed looked guessed 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:37.360
 But here you can see that is on the rack 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:40.800
 Roof around the perimeter taped 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.650
 rubber glue glue which 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:54.550
 Frontal 1 hour what to remove this ceiling 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:56.640
 I need to warm it with this hair dryer 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:01.860

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:07.330

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.840
 have to disassemble people know that on 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:17.680
 These are the nuances on Russian cars and 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:23.729
 do not know Putin suspected what 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.729
