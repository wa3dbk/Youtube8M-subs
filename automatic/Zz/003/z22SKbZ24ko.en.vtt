rocking the quad-core the detector 3 so

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.970 
rocking the quad-core the detector 3 so
let's<00:00:11.759> cool<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.509> do<00:00:12.840> these<00:00:13.019> boys<00:00:13.620> and

round on customer I'm I think on the
Galaxy<00:00:23.609> S<00:00:23.730> curve<00:00:24.199> yeah<00:00:25.199> but<00:00:25.560> still<00:00:25.769> kind<00:00:25.980> of

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
Galaxy S curve yeah but still kind of

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.509 
Galaxy S curve yeah but still kind of
open<00:00:26.279> though<00:00:26.750> so<00:00:27.750> that's<00:00:27.930> good<00:00:28.250> that's<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.340> good

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
open though so that's good that's a good

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.650 
open though so that's good that's a good
boy<00:00:29.699> okay

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
boy okay

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.240 
boy okay
so<00:00:30.929> let's<00:00:31.260> go<00:00:31.410> ahead<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.590> do<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:34.250> it's

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
so let's go ahead and do that it's

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.950 
so let's go ahead and do that it's
almost<00:00:35.489> like<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.730> need<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.059> make<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.329> shirt<00:00:36.690> that

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
almost like I need to make a shirt that

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.430 
almost like I need to make a shirt that
has<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> text<00:00:37.710> boot<00:00:37.890> up<00:00:38.070> test<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:39.140> think<00:00:40.140> people

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
has a text boot up test I think people

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.459 
has a text boot up test I think people
would<00:00:40.500> punish<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.219> even<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.239> would<00:00:42.510> okay<00:00:43.170> so

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
would punish it even I would okay so

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.160 
would punish it even I would okay so
kind<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.250> similar<00:00:44.579> space<00:00:45.000> there<00:00:45.300> when<00:00:45.660> they<00:00:46.140> I

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
kind of similar space there when they I

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.080 
kind of similar space there when they I
mean<00:00:46.379> seeing<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.890> ton<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.070> comments<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.579> yeah

mean seeing a ton of comments that yeah
the<00:00:48.329> address<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:48.899> force<00:00:49.110> really<00:00:49.710> looks<00:00:50.309> like

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the address was force really looks like

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.680 
the address was force really looks like
the<00:00:51.629> galaxy<00:00:52.020> s2<00:00:52.610> but<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> little<00:00:54.600> bit

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
the galaxy s2 but it is a little bit

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.689 
the galaxy s2 but it is a little bit
different<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> form<00:00:55.559> factor<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:55.920> let's

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
different in the form factor but let's

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:05.060 
different in the form factor but let's
go<00:00:56.789> ahead<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.090> do<00:00:57.180> this<00:01:03.379> okay<00:01:04.379> do<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:04.619> go<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
go ahead and do this okay do we go and

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.440 
go ahead and do this okay do we go and
you<00:01:05.250> finish<00:01:05.489> up<00:01:05.580> quickly<00:01:05.880> over<00:01:06.119> there<00:01:06.299> with

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
you finish up quickly over there with

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.330 
you finish up quickly over there with
the<00:01:06.570> sound<00:01:06.900> or<00:01:07.170> at<00:01:07.260> least<00:01:07.439> vibration<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.220> says

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the sound or at least vibration it says
