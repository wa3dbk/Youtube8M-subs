00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.850
 now I'm going to share this recipe for 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.190
 this smoothie that will help you for the 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.320
 cramps but it's also for men 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.980
 you can really take it from men and 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.920
 women since it deflates you and also 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.009
 Well, it's going to clean your body then 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.140
 but if you already have the colic you can 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:32.430
 make this smoothie and you can also 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.350
 make the tea from the ginger root and 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.770
 many women have improved on that 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.080
 discomfort of the colic that I have 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.590
 having the habit of exercising 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.740
 eat healthy or change the diet and 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.100
 also in incorporating juices and smoothies 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.680
 because during the whole month it is true that 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.440
 make you a habit is very important 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.930
 also clean the liver that's why you 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.140
 I recommend this liquefied colic 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.420
 and also a video has been up for a while 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.900
 of how to clean the liver so you have 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.330
 two options and three with the good tea 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.220
 what we are going to need is going to be a 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:18.180
 pineapple cup you're going to add water and you're going to 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.960
 add also a jett sale fist 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.420
 of mint and a piece of ginger from the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.720
 ginger root that is all that is 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.720
 will need 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.530
 so take your shakes 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.700
 It has very good flavor so do not miss it 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.750
 forget to rest well so that also 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:08.080
 that will help you de-stress and that those 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.330
