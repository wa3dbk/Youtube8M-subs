what<00:03:59.980> you<00:04:00.160> do<00:04:00.370> because<00:04:00.489> you're<00:04:00.700> only<00:04:00.850> there

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
what you do because you're only there

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.940 
what you do because you're only there
for<00:04:01.299> so<00:04:01.420> long<00:04:01.570> especially<00:04:02.110> the<00:04:02.530> ones<00:04:02.709> that<00:04:02.890> are

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
textin or even apply takes then mostly

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.250

actually works out

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.780 
actually works out
is<00:04:34.840> that<00:04:35.020> I<00:04:35.050> couldn't<00:04:35.350> extend<00:04:35.560> it<00:04:35.770> into<00:04:35.889> it<00:04:36.160> so
