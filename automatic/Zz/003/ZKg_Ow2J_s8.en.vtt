they're just there there's Beats now

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.450 
they're just there there's Beats now
by<00:05:26.900> their<00:05:27.050> own<00:05:27.080> company<00:05:27.530> so<00:05:27.560> here<00:05:27.980> we<00:05:28.100> have<00:05:28.280> the

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
by their own company so here we have the

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.090 
by their own company so here we have the
beats<00:05:28.700> it<00:05:29.030> has<00:05:29.240> the<00:05:29.450> swivel<00:05:30.050> feature<00:05:30.229> it's<00:05:30.950> a

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
beats it has the swivel feature it's a

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.650 
beats it has the swivel feature it's a
you<00:05:32.030> can<00:05:32.060> go<00:05:32.530> 100<00:05:33.530> and<00:05:33.710> something<00:05:34.669> 120<00:05:35.479> degrees

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
you can go 100 and something 120 degrees

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.780 
you can go 100 and something 120 degrees
I<00:05:35.840> think<00:05:36.050> it<00:05:36.440> says<00:05:36.590> in<00:05:36.680> the<00:05:36.740> booklet<00:05:36.919> but<00:05:37.490> a

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
I think it says in the booklet but a

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.510 
I think it says in the booklet but a
constant<00:05:38.330> 90<00:05:38.990> degrees<00:05:39.229> here<00:05:39.530> and<00:05:39.979> then<00:05:40.310> it<00:05:40.430> can

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
constant 90 degrees here and then it can

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.969 
constant 90 degrees here and then it can
go<00:05:40.669> 90<00:05:41.479> degrees<00:05:41.750> this<00:05:42.020> way<00:05:42.200> but<00:05:42.530> then<00:05:42.680> this<00:05:42.860> is

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
go 90 degrees this way but then this is

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:44.800 
go 90 degrees this way but then this is
how<00:05:43.100> you<00:05:43.130> basically<00:05:43.850> just<00:05:43.940> carry<00:05:44.360> it<00:05:44.450> like<00:05:44.660> it

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
how you basically just carry it like it

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.960 
how you basically just carry it like it
came<00:05:44.960> in<00:05:45.110> the<00:05:45.169> case<00:05:45.380> and<00:05:45.680> there's<00:05:46.580> the<00:05:46.700> 90

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
came in the case and there's the 90

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.860 
came in the case and there's the 90
degree<00:05:47.120> feature<00:05:47.600> and<00:05:48.850> basically<00:05:49.850> it<00:05:50.720> just

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
degree feature and basically it just

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.390 
degree feature and basically it just
goes<00:05:51.050> in<00:05:51.229> and<00:05:51.380> swivels<00:05:51.740> so<00:05:51.830> you<00:05:51.979> can<00:05:52.250> actually

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
goes in and swivels so you can actually

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.350 
goes in and swivels so you can actually
carry<00:05:52.970> it<00:05:53.440> it's<00:05:54.440> made<00:05:54.620> for<00:05:54.800> DJ's<00:05:55.130> mostly<00:05:56.030> but

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
carry it it's made for DJ's mostly but

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.630 
carry it it's made for DJ's mostly but
you<00:05:56.600> can<00:05:56.780> buy<00:05:56.960> them<00:05:57.140> to<00:05:57.320> use<00:05:57.500> them<00:05:57.740> like<00:05:58.310> I<00:05:58.580> just

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:58.640 
you can buy them to use them like I just

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.980 
you can buy them to use them like I just
I<00:05:59.060> bought<00:05:59.270> them<00:05:59.450> because<00:05:59.540> they're<00:05:59.780> really

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990

good<00:06:00.140> headphones<00:06:00.530> I<00:06:00.890> think<00:06:01.430> they're<00:06:01.610> my

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
good headphones I think they're my

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.420 
good headphones I think they're my
opinion<00:06:02.750> I<00:06:02.960> like<00:06:03.500> them<00:06:03.680> better<00:06:04.040> than<00:06:04.340> the

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
opinion I like them better than the

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.860 
opinion I like them better than the
studios<00:06:05.410> the<00:06:06.410> studios<00:06:06.800> are<00:06:06.950> pretty<00:06:07.130> good<00:06:07.310> too

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
studios the studios are pretty good too

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.600 
studios the studios are pretty good too

like<00:06:13.250> that<00:06:13.460> for<00:06:13.790> beats<00:06:14.030> so<00:06:14.630> here<00:06:14.870> we<00:06:14.960> have<00:06:15.110> the

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
like that for beats so here we have the

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.670 
like that for beats so here we have the
beats<00:06:15.500> mixr's<00:06:16.960> I've<00:06:17.960> tried<00:06:18.320> them<00:06:18.410> on<00:06:18.500> they

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
beats mixr's I've tried them on they

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
beats by dre probably can't see that

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.260 
beats by dre probably can't see that
because<00:06:27.710> my<00:06:27.890> camera<00:06:28.190> is<00:06:28.310> not<00:06:28.340> focusing<00:06:28.550> but<00:06:29.030> it

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
because my camera is not focusing but it

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789 
have the wire that kind of goes out and

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:50.350 
have the wire that kind of goes out and
it<00:06:44.330> has<00:06:44.539> a<00:06:44.569> this<00:06:45.560> this<00:06:46.069> cool<00:06:46.400> like<00:06:48.279> like<00:06:49.360> this
