color<00:00:34.900> and<00:00:35.320> shape<00:00:35.559> but<00:00:35.739> basically<00:00:36.460> what<00:00:36.730> we<00:00:36.879> do

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
color and shape but basically what we do

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.119 
color and shape but basically what we do
is<00:00:37.269> we<00:00:37.690> roll<00:00:38.339> a<00:00:39.339> combination<00:00:40.180> of<00:00:40.269> clay<00:00:41.129> organic

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
is we roll a combination of clay organic

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.460 
is we roll a combination of clay organic
compost<00:00:42.610> and<00:00:42.940> a<00:00:43.329> package<00:00:43.660> of<00:00:43.809> seed<00:00:43.989> and<00:00:44.260> each

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
compost and a package of seed and each

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.160 
compost and a package of seed and each
ball<00:00:44.769> so<00:00:45.100> each<00:00:45.250> ball<00:00:45.519> is<00:00:45.820> going<00:00:46.030> to<00:00:46.180> sprout<00:00:46.930> a

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
ball so each ball is going to sprout a

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.770 
ball so each ball is going to sprout a
multiple<00:00:47.890> of<00:00:48.100> plants<00:00:49.089> instead<00:00:49.330> of<00:00:49.540> single

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
multiple of plants instead of single

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.320 
multiple of plants instead of single
seed<00:00:50.080> single<00:00:50.440> sprouts<00:00:50.710> well<00:00:51.190> now<00:00:51.339> one<00:00:52.180> of<00:00:52.210> the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
seed single sprouts well now one of the

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.670 
seed single sprouts well now one of the
things<00:00:52.390> that<00:00:52.600> I<00:00:52.690> find<00:00:52.900> interesting<00:00:53.110> about<00:00:53.500> it

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
things that I find interesting about it

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.930 
things that I find interesting about it
is<00:00:53.799> you<00:00:54.220> know<00:00:54.280> we're<00:00:54.430> always<00:00:54.549> looking<00:00:54.760> for

is you know we're always looking for

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.100 
is you know we're always looking for
things<00:00:55.180> on<00:00:55.360> garden<00:00:55.629> times<00:00:55.780> that<00:00:55.869> are<00:00:55.900> new

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
things on garden times that are new

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.250 
things on garden times that are new
fresh<00:00:56.500> easy<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:57.820> is<00:00:58.030> an<00:00:58.180> easy<00:00:58.449> easy<00:00:58.750> thing<00:00:59.080> to

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
fresh easy this is an easy easy thing to

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.079 
fresh easy this is an easy easy thing to
do<00:00:59.439> it's<00:00:59.799> not<00:01:00.040> you<00:01:00.400> don't<00:01:00.580> you<00:01:00.760> don't<00:01:00.939> just

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
do it's not you don't you don't just

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:02.429 
do it's not you don't you don't just
toss<00:01:01.239> it<00:01:01.299> and<00:01:01.510> walk<00:01:01.659> away<00:01:01.689> you<00:01:02.080> stop<00:01:02.290> to

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:02.439 
toss it and walk away you stop to

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:04.469 
toss it and walk away you stop to
maintain<00:01:02.799> them<00:01:03.010> but<00:01:03.460> it's<00:01:03.580> much<00:01:03.729> easier<00:01:03.760> than

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
maintain them but it's much easier than

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.330 
maintain them but it's much easier than
saying<00:01:04.780> you<00:01:05.229> know<00:01:05.320> digging<00:01:05.619> little<00:01:05.890> holes<00:01:06.070> and

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
saying you know digging little holes and

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.280 
saying you know digging little holes and
putting<00:01:06.580> seeds<00:01:06.790> in<00:01:07.060> if<00:01:07.240> in<00:01:07.720> fact<00:01:07.869> here's<00:01:08.170> an

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
putting seeds in if in fact here's an

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.190 
putting seeds in if in fact here's an
example<00:01:08.590> of<00:01:08.950> ones<00:01:09.189> you<00:01:09.340> put<00:01:09.549> in<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.760> pot<00:01:10.200> what

would<00:01:11.320> I<00:01:11.350> do<00:01:11.470> if<00:01:11.650> I<00:01:12.040> were<00:01:12.130> going<00:01:12.280> to<00:01:12.369> plant

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
would I do if I were going to plant

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.820

these in a pot well you would just put

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.280 
these in a pot well you would just put
the<00:01:15.040> seed<00:01:15.610> ball<00:01:15.820> down<00:01:16.119> into<00:01:16.660> the<00:01:16.750> earth<00:01:16.900> you

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
the seed ball down into the earth you

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.600 
the seed ball down into the earth you
want<00:01:17.470> to<00:01:17.560> put<00:01:17.710> it<00:01:17.830> in<00:01:18.010> the<00:01:18.130> earth<00:01:18.250> but<00:01:18.520> you

earth and not covered and then and as

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.360 
earth and not covered and then and as
you<00:01:26.020> water<00:01:26.260> it<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.530> clay<00:01:26.680> is<00:01:26.800> going<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:26.980> soften

you water it the clay is going to soften

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.310 
you water it the clay is going to soften
and<00:01:27.550> become<00:01:27.850> a<00:01:27.880> pace<00:01:28.360> that<00:01:28.390> holds<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.050> seeds

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
and become a pace that holds the seeds

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.860 
and become a pace that holds the seeds
into<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.710> organic<00:01:30.190> material<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:30.790> boom<00:01:31.270> those

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
into the organic material and boom those

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.110 
into the organic material and boom those
seeds<00:01:32.290> will<00:01:32.440> just<00:01:32.650> start<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.370> sprout<00:01:33.880> and

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
seeds will just start to sprout and

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.490 
seeds will just start to sprout and
multiples<00:01:34.630> well<00:01:34.960> when<00:01:35.140> we<00:01:35.230> were<00:01:35.320> chatting

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
multiples well when we were chatting

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.960 
multiples well when we were chatting
earlier<00:01:35.740> Alice<00:01:36.190> one<00:01:36.340> of<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:36.520> things<00:01:36.700> you<00:01:36.790> said

earlier Alice one of the things you said
I<00:01:37.030> thought<00:01:37.210> was<00:01:37.360> really<00:01:37.780> interesting<00:01:37.870> is<00:01:38.409> the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
I thought was really interesting is the

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:39.899 
I thought was really interesting is the
reason<00:01:39.190> that<00:01:39.220> some<00:01:39.460> people<00:01:39.700> don't<00:01:39.790> have

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
reason that some people don't have

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.610 
reason that some people don't have

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
success in the garden is they forget

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.230 
success in the garden is they forget
about<00:01:41.770> them<00:01:42.100> if<00:01:42.640> you<00:01:42.820> have<00:01:42.940> an<00:01:43.060> event

about them if you have an event
container<00:01:43.659> you<00:01:43.990> must<00:01:44.200> water<00:01:44.440> them<00:01:44.650> you<00:01:44.740> must
