00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
together it's just more of a visual aid

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.979 
together it's just more of a visual aid
than<00:00:58.399> anything<00:00:58.609> else<00:00:58.879> it<00:00:59.090> just<00:00:59.270> helps<00:00:59.600> you<00:00:59.780> to

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
probably not been used to that at this

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.830
