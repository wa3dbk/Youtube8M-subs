 coach 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.960
 table with destabilization 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.990
 we started the exercise exactly like the previous one 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.519
 only this time the player a coach 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.399
 they will try to apply pressure to different areas of the player's body 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.399
 with the floor 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.190
 table with stretched arm 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.360
 the starting position is exactly the same as the previous armies 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.820
 only this time the player on the left floor one of his arms 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.500
 It is essential that the race is always maintained 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.500
 for him about the ground 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.390
 the coach a player 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.390
 can pressure pressure socrates pulled 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.499
 isometric with raised leg 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.769
 the position and the player 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:16.719
 it's the same 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.149
 in the exercise of the table 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:20.609
 on this occasion 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.669
 it's about lifting the leg 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.669
 and leave her in line with respect to her back 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.099
 with legs and arms raised 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.809
 we start from the table position 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:44.809
 we will raise one arm and the opposite leg 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:54.669
 it is essential to keep the hips to the ground 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:05.839
 table on unstable platform 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:11.120
 the player's initial position 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.419
 is the table 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.519
 only this time to support your feet on a rugby ball 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:28.449
 once the player has chosen this position the coach or trying 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:31.449
 put pressure on different parts of your body 

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:44.839
 table on two unstable platforms 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.029
 now we propose to increase the level of difficulty 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:52.389
 this passion 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:55.389
 we will support the feet on two rugby balls 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:00.969
 Coach 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:04.219
 once stabilized player different areas of the body 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:05.629
 generating imbalances 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.629
 to which will have to react player on the ground 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.449
 weight table 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.350
 start table position we can place with a dumbbell the lumbar area of 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:26.349
 the player on the floor should try to keep the weight I found 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.349
 all the muscles of the national center 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.849
 table by couple 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:37.409
 in table position 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.400
 the players I will be alone will have three props on the ground 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.670
 since the fourth support 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.670
 it will be passed the arm through the back to the companion 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:47.779
 Stavla by trios 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:51.949
 this time in table position two of the players will have three 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.119
 props on floor and the fourth only his company the middle 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.890
 at the same time the company of the medium will only expose the supports on the ground 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.449
 maybe other supports 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.449
 hugging her partners from the extremes 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.979
 8th of lateral 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:14.499
 the player will only have two nicknames on the ground 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.520
 and an elbow and forearm 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.520
 you should try to stay in that position constantly 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.349
 the coach a partner 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:38.349
 could try to destabilize players 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:47.839
 lateral stavla on unstable platform 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:52.810
 the player 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.130
 will adopt the same position as in the previous year on this occasion 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:59.719
 we will put a ball under his feet 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:06.479
 the player must always reward in front 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.059
 and will try to keep your body always parallel to the ground 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:15.300
 once adopted this position 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.340
 the coach may try to unbalance it in different areas of 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.600
 her body
