was going to do a quick give away but I

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.370 
was going to do a quick give away but I
realized<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.850> hard<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.540> check<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
realized that it is hard to check the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.130 
realized that it is hard to check the
youtube<00:02:01.829> messages<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.820> whenever<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.600> didn't

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
youtube messages so whenever I didn't

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.510 
youtube messages so whenever I didn't
give<00:02:04.290> away<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:05.030> don't<00:02:06.030> receive<00:02:06.960> back<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.799> you

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
give away I don't receive back the you

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.169 
give away I don't receive back the you
know

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
know

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.289 
know
messages<00:02:09.689> from<00:02:09.719> the<00:02:10.170> winners<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.489> it's<00:02:11.969> really

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
messages from the winners so it's really

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.899 
messages from the winners so it's really
hard<00:02:12.719> to<00:02:12.989> reach<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.590> winners<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.370> have<00:02:14.700> to

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
hard to reach the winners so I have to

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.509 
hard to reach the winners so I have to
think<00:02:15.269> of<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.810> different<00:02:16.019> way<00:02:16.769> to<00:02:16.799> do<00:02:17.280> the
