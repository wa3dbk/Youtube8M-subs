00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.750
 so together, welcome here 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.400
 in my channel 83 meters and in this 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.280
 Video I want you my new 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.039
 bluetooth speaker introduce it from 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.170
 manufacturer tonics and bluetooth 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.870
 Speakers quite clear when speakers 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.840
 speak box and that is via bluetooth 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.280
 over powered or supplied with sound 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.690
 so the whole part looks in one 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.910
 Packaging from costs about 25 euro there 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.840
 It's about Amazon and let's take a look 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.200
 now together 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.270
 Mr. Hello, girls already welcomed something 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.540
 here we have a little one 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.100
 operation manual 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.570
 Usually, however , the devices are 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.700
 meanwhile something of simple 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:51.960
 These days, they really are 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:54.020
 no longer needs the whole cosmos and 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.130
 look at what works 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.130
 how is that taken apart? 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.670
 I had should not draw so timid 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.950
 just go up and that's it 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.310
 rest of the present here and carton available 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.790
 is always such a 3.5 millimeter paw 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.430
 electric wire 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.820
 there we can borrow over 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.840
 The device can also be connected as an alternative 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.440
 operate usb 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.960
 then we have here micro USB cable for 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.520
 charge and of course has my battery 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.740
 is operated and this is the battery 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:37.740
 and the 6 march around 41 the part at and 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:41.610
 Of course we also hear that well 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.740
 always packed meanwhile there are so 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.479
 many are really cheap tina 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.420
 manufacturers really like those parts 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.140
 super produce and that too top 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.939
 praise 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.640
 and if you get it now 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.229
 still look at the feel of the feel 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.549
 one would have to do with opportunity or 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.650
 maybe if that buys itself now 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.119
 So really awesome feeling great 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.530
 I'm working on that here now 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.970
 Directly in hand have here 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.470
 model name and so on and off 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.939
 switch not at all 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.590
 wanted devices is always present 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:13.380
 opinion is very important because otherwise 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.250
 the thing runs permanently in standby and 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.010
 that is also wrong so set now 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.980
 Rear simply times the battery just so 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.860
 that is in it 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.870
 zack lid on it and drives the part 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.300
 Clearly logical here were the 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.430
 button by directly up there we wait 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.230
 Let's take a look at the part 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.660
 first time on is really quite simple 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.740
 and she is as tall as my hand and 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.940
 just when I start up, I would have 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.680
 already heard the speaker has 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.690
 the walls are still buzzing 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.850
 volume buttons our menu button in 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.800
 the middle and here we have one 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.290
 can small hole and say see 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.070
 because that is the microphone input that is 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.660
 we can as well 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.670
 Handsfree we use now 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.020
 somehow sitting outside in the garden or 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.040
 on the meadow or anywhere else i can 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.660
 also with one 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.970
 handsfree as with after 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.120
 hands-free calling jobs 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.520
 accept as just mentioned with the 3.5 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.650
 mm cable here to charge the micro usb 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.390
 connection and yours on button 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.700
 if we turn on here now 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.560
 we that the blue led starts directly too 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.320
 to shine 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.410
 Here comes this start-up noise 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.330
 now the part is blinking permanently and then 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.470
 Let's go take it now here 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.150
 in this case his galaxy tablet and 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.280
 connect that with the flowers 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.510
 bluetooth for that i am now holding as 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.280
 Simply setting bluetooth up 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:43.370
 it turns bluetooth a descendant 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:47.700
 nice so still has the button right 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.489
 press and 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.690
 Click up here again and would now 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.849
 we will all be available right now 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.810
 displayed that is the exactly where the 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.940
 speaker tsk 0 2 of comics will 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:06.840
 also displayed right here because I tell 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:08.940
 Easy coupling took a little moment 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.250
 now it is also blue and that is part 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.750
 so connect now so here 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.729
 there was still a confirmation 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.870
 stone and if we go out of here now 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:26.370
 Now, here's the youtube app 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:31.080
 let's say so and if we do now 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.669
 looking for my channel 83 meters 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.490
 We also find that right when you are here 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.570
 Enter 83 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.790
 now we look times nor any 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.280
 small video have a bit of sound 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.690
 so you can hear that as well as possible 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.780
 not some i'll be kidding someday 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:49.889
 Store'm perhaps as exhaust sound 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.030
 For example, offers something for yes 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:05:00.360
 at exactly z4 35is on sundays or 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:02.010
 exhaus sound the exhaust sound and that 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.360
 Wlan is not able to see me here 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.130
 just the strongest up here in the 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.410
 space in image quality will be too 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:11.850
 very modest 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:13.919
 but it's about the sound sorry for that 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:21.090
 Of course, here is the video 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:23.510
 in that he invite little more crowded 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.510
 journey 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.500
 that does not sound bad at all 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.120
 we can now have a look I have 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.580
 now here on the tablet the volume 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.830
 Of course, publishing also means four 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.270
 more accurate than the confirmation is now 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.230
 the loudest point reached when I 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:53.430
 now hold down here minus 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:55.350
 wants to press multiple times right now 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.490
 Confirmation of his the quietest and me 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.770
 do the same during the video 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.210
 plays louder with this higher 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.500
 could make a difference what you get here 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.310
 from the power rauskriegt from this 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.310
 small speaker 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.030
 I notice their clear combination 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.420
 so in the hands 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.840
 a speaker here are apparently 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.840
 30 at the number 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.520
 yes that sounds right in any case 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.350
 neat so people small 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.570
 loudspeakers one can ideally with the 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.780
 garden in the garden use on the 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.340
 terrace and balcony or even if you 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.320
 somewhere in the park since and a bit 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.540
 sound want to have a serial 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.610
 thing for the top price, as I said 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.110
 at amazon link to this I pack you 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.430
 below the videos in the infobox 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.580
 look at children here 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.020
 the device and if you like the video 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.350
 liked space like thumbs 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.360
 above 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.950
 I'm very happy to subscribe to mine
