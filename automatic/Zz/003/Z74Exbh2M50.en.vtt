I'll<00:02:13.760> show<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.270> you

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.310 

okay<00:02:42.830> this<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.760> this<00:02:43.910> is<00:02:44.060> bias<00:02:44.420> tape<00:02:44.660> okay

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
okay this is it this is bias tape okay

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.890 
okay this is it this is bias tape okay
you<00:02:45.920> can<00:02:46.100> make<00:02:46.190> it<00:02:46.370> yourself<00:02:46.570> if<00:02:47.570> you<00:02:47.630> have<00:02:47.870> a

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
you can make it yourself if you have a

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.010 
you can make it yourself if you have a
bias<00:02:48.230> foot<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:49.280> have<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.520> foot<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.720> have<00:02:50.870> to

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
bias foot you have the foot you have to

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.520 
bias foot you have the foot you have to
run<00:02:51.260> in<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.470> fabric<00:02:52.150> on<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.450> you<00:02:54.020> have<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.260> run

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
run in the fabric on the you have to run

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.850 
run in the fabric on the you have to run
to<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.100> fabric<00:02:55.550> on<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.150> bias<00:02:56.540> or<00:02:57.080> no<00:02:57.620> you<00:02:57.680> do

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
to the fabric on the bias or no you do

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.190 
to the fabric on the bias or no you do
diagonal<00:02:58.550> and<00:02:58.760> if<00:02:59.270> when<00:02:59.510> you<00:02:59.600> cut<00:02:59.870> the<00:02:59.990> fabric

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
diagonal and if when you cut the fabric

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.010 
diagonal and if when you cut the fabric
diagonal<00:03:01.010> it<00:03:01.190> stretches<00:03:01.730> so<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.600> has<00:03:02.780> more

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
diagonal it stretches so it has more

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.220 
diagonal it stretches so it has more
ease<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.950> it<00:03:06.850> see<00:03:07.850> if<00:03:08.450> you<00:03:08.660> pull<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.020> fabric

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
ease to it see if you pull the fabric

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.610 
ease to it see if you pull the fabric
this<00:03:09.590> way<00:03:09.770> here's<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.400> salvage<00:03:10.850> right<00:03:11.180> here

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
this way here's the salvage right here

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.710 
this way here's the salvage right here
along<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.770> top<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.880> could<00:03:14.000> see<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.300> salvage

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
along the top you could see the salvage

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.330 
along the top you could see the salvage
they<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:16.220> know<00:03:16.330> okay<00:03:17.330> so<00:03:17.390> it<00:03:17.930> has<00:03:18.230> no<00:03:18.530> movement

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
they you know okay so it has no movement

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.990 
they you know okay so it has no movement
to<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:21.410> do<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.590> on<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.830> side<00:03:22.070> it<00:03:22.520> still<00:03:22.790> has

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
to it you do it on the side it still has

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.790 
to it you do it on the side it still has
no<00:03:23.180> movement<00:03:23.690> but<00:03:23.870> if<00:03:24.020> you<00:03:24.140> do<00:03:24.290> it<00:03:24.440> on<00:03:24.590> the

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
no movement but if you do it on the

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.630 
no movement but if you do it on the
diagonal<00:03:25.520> see<00:03:26.510> how<00:03:26.600> it<00:03:26.720> moves<00:03:27.130> so<00:03:28.130> when<00:03:28.520> you're

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
diagonal see how it moves so when you're

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.050 
diagonal see how it moves so when you're
cutting<00:03:28.940> for<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.480> bias<00:03:29.780> strips<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:31.550> cut<00:03:31.880> the

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
cutting for the bias strips you cut the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.920 
cutting for the bias strips you cut the
fabric<00:03:32.560> diagonal<00:03:33.560> see<00:03:34.070> the<00:03:34.190> lines<00:03:34.459> here<00:03:34.930> that

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
fabric diagonal see the lines here that

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.000 
fabric diagonal see the lines here that
should<00:03:36.200> help<00:03:36.320> you<00:03:36.530> too

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
should help you too

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:47.940 
should help you too
okay<00:03:37.430> all<00:03:37.970> right<00:03:38.150> enough<00:03:38.989> with<00:03:39.020> that

section in double fold bias tape this is
double<00:03:56.260> fold<00:03:56.560> bias<00:03:57.040> tape<00:03:57.959> okay<00:04:03.600> what<00:04:04.600> is<00:04:04.750> the

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
double fold bias tape okay what is the

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.220 
double fold bias tape okay what is the
side<00:04:05.110> to<00:04:05.319> be<00:04:05.470> used<00:04:05.709> in<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.130> wrong<00:04:06.310> side<00:04:07.230> okay

side to be used in the wrong side okay
so<00:04:08.290> now<00:04:08.650> what<00:04:08.860> I'm<00:04:08.980> going<00:04:09.100> to<00:04:09.160> do<00:04:09.340> is<00:04:09.580> it<00:04:10.450> wants

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
so now what I'm going to do is it wants

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.550 
so now what I'm going to do is it wants
me<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:12.310> put<00:04:13.209> the<00:04:13.360> bias<00:04:13.600> tape<00:04:14.110> on<00:04:14.769> the<00:04:15.430> edge

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
me to put the bias tape on the edge

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.620 
me to put the bias tape on the edge
first<00:04:17.560> I<00:04:17.739> have<00:04:17.950> to<00:04:18.160> make<00:04:18.430> sure<00:04:19.209> that<00:04:19.480> my

markings are on this and I have a piece

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:30.360 
markings are on this and I have a piece
of<00:04:24.280> chalk<00:04:24.700> here<00:04:28.229> this<00:04:29.229> way<00:04:29.410> I<00:04:29.440> know<00:04:29.590> what<00:04:30.280> I'm

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
of chalk here this way I know what I'm

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:39.459 
of chalk here this way I know what I'm
doing<00:04:32.070> this<00:04:33.070> is<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.340> middle<00:04:33.639> fun

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:39.469 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:42.009 

when<00:04:39.649> I<00:04:39.739> cut<00:04:39.949> out<00:04:39.979> my<00:04:40.219> notches<00:04:40.789> my<00:04:41.209> notch<00:04:41.449> and

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:42.019 
when I cut out my notches my notch and

00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:44.739 
when I cut out my notches my notch and
this<00:04:42.889> wanted<00:04:43.339> me<00:04:43.459> to<00:04:43.489> cut<00:04:43.879> it<00:04:43.909> on<00:04:44.239> the

00:04:44.739 --> 00:04:44.749 
this wanted me to cut it on the

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:48.339 
this wanted me to cut it on the
centerfold<00:04:45.999> just<00:04:46.999> the<00:04:47.149> centerfolds<00:04:48.019> it's<00:04:48.199> on

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349

and take care of your our tissue paper
for<00:05:17.780> your<00:05:17.900> patterns<00:05:18.350> because<00:05:19.310> if<00:05:19.550> you<00:05:19.760> just

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
for your patterns because if you just

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.440 
for your patterns because if you just
you<00:05:20.630> know<00:05:20.720> bunch<00:05:20.960> it<00:05:21.110> up<00:05:21.230> and<00:05:21.820> punch<00:05:22.820> it<00:05:23.030> up<00:05:23.150> and

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
you know bunch it up and punch it up and

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.580 
you know bunch it up and punch it up and
throw<00:05:23.870> it<00:05:23.900> into<00:05:24.140> the<00:05:24.350> envelope<00:05:26.350> it's<00:05:27.350> gonna

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
throw it into the envelope it's gonna

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.430 
throw it into the envelope it's gonna
make<00:05:27.800> it<00:05:27.830> impossible<00:05:28.010> to<00:05:28.790> lay<00:05:29.360> it<00:05:29.510> flat<00:05:29.750> on<00:05:30.200> the

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
make it impossible to lay it flat on the

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.140 
make it impossible to lay it flat on the
fabric<00:05:30.950> so<00:05:32.650> take<00:05:33.650> your<00:05:33.770> time<00:05:34.040> both<00:05:34.700> it<00:05:34.910> good

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
fabric so take your time both it good

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.200 
fabric so take your time both it good
and<00:05:36.080> what<00:05:36.170> i<00:05:36.200> do<00:05:36.320> is<00:05:36.470> i<00:05:36.890> bowl<00:05:37.430> with<00:05:37.610> mine<00:05:37.910> and
