00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
the way up to where the stem connects

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.530 
the way up to where the stem connects
you<00:01:08.250> don't<00:01:08.430> want<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.670> wait<00:01:08.790> until<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> berries

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
you don't want to wait until the berries

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.870 
you don't want to wait until the berries

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
are dark and burgundy in color because

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.760 
are dark and burgundy in color because
then<00:01:12.060> they're<00:01:12.240> usually<00:01:12.390> overripe<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.470> taste

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
then they're usually overripe and taste

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.830 
then they're usually overripe and taste
spoiled<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:15.030> also<00:01:15.299> don't<00:01:15.479> want<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.689> pick

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
spoiled you also don't want to pick

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.840 
spoiled you also don't want to pick
berries<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.530> little<00:01:17.040> green<00:01:17.310> or<00:01:17.640> white

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
berries that have little green or white

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.999 
berries that have little green or white
spots<00:01:18.240> still<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.869> them<00:01:19.140> because<00:01:19.710> they're

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
spots still on them because they're

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.600 
spots still on them because they're
under<00:01:20.369> ripe<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.820> generally<00:01:21.420> tastes<00:01:21.720> sour<00:01:22.610> so

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
under ripe and generally tastes sour so

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.859 
under ripe and generally tastes sour so
it's<00:01:23.820> picking<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.270> morning<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.750> this

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
it's picking in the morning like this

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.510 
it's picking in the morning like this
okay<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.409> know<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.650> said<00:01:25.890> time<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.250> day<00:01:26.369> was

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
okay I know you said time of day was

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.249 
okay I know you said time of day was
important<00:01:26.970> actually<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.720> perfect<00:01:27.930> time

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
important actually it's the perfect time

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.929 
important actually it's the perfect time
because<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> dew<00:01:28.950> will<00:01:29.220> have<00:01:29.340> evaporated

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
because the dew will have evaporated

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.730 
because the dew will have evaporated
already<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.780> berries<00:01:31.110> are<00:01:31.259> still<00:01:31.500> cool

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740

space<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.159> plants<00:01:56.579> four<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.240> six<00:01:57.479> inches

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
space the plants four to six inches

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.010 
space the plants four to six inches
apart<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.380> if<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.460> have<00:01:59.670> bare<00:02:00.030> spots<00:02:00.420> plug<00:02:00.840> in

apart and if you have bare spots plug in

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.630 
apart and if you have bare spots plug in
some<00:02:01.229> new<00:02:01.409> plants<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.009> that'll<00:02:02.310> keep<00:02:02.460> your

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
some new plants and that'll keep your

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.149 
some new plants and that'll keep your
bed<00:02:02.850> going<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.450> going<00:02:03.810> sounds<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.979> lot<00:02:05.130> of

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
bed going and going sounds like a lot of

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.119 
bed going and going sounds like a lot of

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
work and it kind of is the other method

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.430 
work and it kind of is the other method
is<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.670> can<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:08.970> let<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.270> go<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.720> rip<00:02:10.289> all

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
is you can just let it go and rip all

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.930 
is you can just let it go and rip all
these<00:02:10.619> plants<00:02:11.009> out<00:02:11.129> in<00:02:11.160> three<00:02:11.610> or<00:02:11.730> four<00:02:11.760> years
