this<00:04:48.090> that<00:04:48.270> people<00:04:48.600> will<00:04:48.750> take<00:04:48.930> it<00:04:48.990> seriously

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
this that people will take it seriously

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.710 
this that people will take it seriously
that<00:04:50.070> if<00:04:50.190> he<00:04:50.310> calls<00:04:50.580> guys<00:04:50.820> up<00:04:51.030> and<00:04:51.120> says<00:04:51.270> I<00:04:51.480> want

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
that if he calls guys up and says I want

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.910 
that if he calls guys up and says I want
to<00:04:51.780> trade<00:04:51.960> Dany<00:04:52.170> Heatley<00:04:52.350> what<00:04:52.680> are<00:04:52.740> you<00:04:52.800> gonna

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
to trade Dany Heatley what are you gonna

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.230 
to trade Dany Heatley what are you gonna
offer<00:04:53.070> me<00:04:53.280> people<00:04:53.910> don't<00:04:53.940> believe

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
offer me people don't believe

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.380 
offer me people don't believe
necessarily<00:04:54.510> yeah<00:04:55.230> no<00:04:55.560> it<00:04:56.100> does<00:04:56.580> remove<00:04:57.030> some

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
necessarily yeah no it does remove some

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.900 
necessarily yeah no it does remove some
of<00:04:57.420> the<00:04:57.510> uncertainty<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.260> and<00:04:58.560> clearly<00:04:59.550> I

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
of the uncertainty and and clearly I

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.030 
of the uncertainty and and clearly I
think<00:05:00.060> that<00:05:00.480> allows<00:05:00.780> him<00:05:01.170> to<00:05:01.200> probably<00:05:01.950> make

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
think that allows him to probably make

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.470 
think that allows him to probably make
the<00:05:02.160> best<00:05:02.340> deal<00:05:02.460> he<00:05:02.580> can<00:05:02.670> make<00:05:02.850> you<00:05:03.090> know<00:05:03.120> I<00:05:03.210> I

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
the best deal he can make you know I I

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.730 
the best deal he can make you know I I
just<00:05:03.720> love<00:05:03.870> the<00:05:03.960> perspective<00:05:04.380> you<00:05:04.470> gave<00:05:04.620> me
