00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
with avoiding gangs that was shown in

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.610 
with avoiding gangs that was shown in
the<00:03:40.330> first<00:03:40.540> week<00:03:40.750> where<00:03:40.900> I<00:03:40.930> got<00:03:41.140> targeted<00:03:41.560> a

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
the first week where I got targeted a

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.530 
the first week where I got targeted a
lot<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:42.010> almost<00:03:42.519> every<00:03:42.760> gang<00:03:42.910> was<00:03:43.090> successful

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
lot and almost every gang was successful

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.570 
lot and almost every gang was successful
I've<00:03:43.720> worked<00:03:43.959> on<00:03:44.080> it<00:03:44.230> yesterday<00:03:44.920> I<00:03:45.190> still<00:03:45.430> got

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
I've worked on it yesterday I still got

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.759 
I've worked on it yesterday I still got
a<00:03:45.610> successful<00:03:46.120> gank<00:03:46.239> against<00:03:46.570> me<00:03:46.780> but<00:03:47.350> i<00:03:47.560> think

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
a successful gank against me but i think

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.140 
a successful gank against me but i think
that<00:03:47.860> overall<00:03:47.980> i<00:03:48.250> have<00:03:48.489> really<00:03:48.760> improved<00:03:48.970> on

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
that overall i have really improved on

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.340 
that overall i have really improved on
that<00:03:49.180> so<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.510> early<00:03:49.780> games<00:03:49.989> are<00:03:50.140> a<00:03:50.170> lot

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
that so the early games are a lot

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.380 
that so the early games are a lot
smoother<00:03:50.709> for<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:50.980> entire<00:03:51.220> team<00:03:51.519> and<00:03:51.730> i<00:03:52.150> think

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
smoother for the entire team and i think

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.180 
smoother for the entire team and i think
that<00:03:52.510> i<00:03:52.600> am<00:03:52.750> one<00:03:53.230> of<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.380> strongest<00:03:53.680> teleport

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
that i am one of the strongest teleport

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.770 
that i am one of the strongest teleport
