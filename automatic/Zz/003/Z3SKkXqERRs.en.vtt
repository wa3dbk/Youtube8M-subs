00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.120
 I added one more an adventure map 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.750
 that here you can start from here 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:48.110
 if they can not remove it and ignore it 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.680

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.680
 consist of him 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.860

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:42.850

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.850

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.159

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.119
 well here it is from here it starts to 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.119

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.370
 from there below it is 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:02.440

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:06.480

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.190
 stress as their in also their 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.319
 creatives 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.040

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:37.000
 in creative the best of zombies and 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.000
 others others 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:42.290
 news from minecraft city is searched 63 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:45.230
 miners 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.680
 it resonates to me like here it is only known that 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.569
 they went to mine and they did not leave again 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.670
 that mine 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:57.720
 they say that mine in that mine 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.590
 forgive my mistakes 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:05.730
 in that mine they found classes never 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:09.150
 seen so they closed good really 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.160
 in this fear and spelling I think what 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.740
 I do not remember when I did it well 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.480
 recently obviously yes but I think that 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:21.090
 was the afa I do not know is that I think it was 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.360
 the rapidity of that fear of me being 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.360
 forget 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:31.730
 the plan that the story of d 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:35.690
 the system for adventure then never 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.900
 previously seen is that it will be determined by 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.870
 very high toxic gases and qriocity and 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.230
 ready and then they would just have to 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.060
 get in 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.459
 to the mine 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.710
 and it's called I'll do it has to 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:54.340
 download looks 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.960
 what can there be or what can there be that 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.300
 there may be 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.610
 and well 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:08.430

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:10.859

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.400
