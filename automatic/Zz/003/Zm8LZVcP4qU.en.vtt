00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.400
 I worked let's say breeding based 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.579
 genetically engineered for many years in genetics 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.809
 the bacteria there are just all pencil and 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.520
 Initially, you know that you need such and such 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:29.210
 the gene that is in metabolism 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.130
 standing here 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.050
 from it this substance will turn out 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.129
 this is and i need to get here the next one 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.800
 our mind is at the entrance 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.899
 there would be a very large flow of matter 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.700
 monomial need some kind of take organism 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.440
 which stream here together give a big 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.150
 then I need to when he 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.770
 turns further he would not go away 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.530
 side unnecessary announce it need 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.480
 here put a mutation here and here 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.100
 also put the block to be it 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.170
 substance they are following in which 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.260
 happens normally but it is known that he 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.000
 because of this will die therefore if you do 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.700
 everything as I say it will not work 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.530
 what of being dead 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.879
 Well, this is considered on paper because 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.740
 what is there in the end you pick up 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.640
 dependent mutations are valid from 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.350
 temperatures 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.420
 to make it a certain temperature 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.790
 worked there when the other is not to 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.460
 included activation of genes or 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.260
 its copy number grew sharply there and that's all 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.510
 It is considered on paper then implemented 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.000
 per watt and then eventually this 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.920
 called lethal synthesis you turn on 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.530
 this whole chain and organism is really 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.560
 its say there are thousands of different 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.140
 cell substances that contain carbon 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.360
 and here this substance is target it is one and 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.030
 it turns out in the amount of 60 percent 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.330
 from all products lying protein by 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.570
 sold by its share and its concentration 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.270
 such that the body of the port center but 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.070
 we know that in doing so he will die because 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.439
 that he doesn't do all the things he needs 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.770
 I had I do not need to have then 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:58.280
 when we get all the microbes have become others 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.000
 seemingly got what you need in your hands 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.070
 that's not the kind and it turned out that 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.110
 Dokh's organism if it was not formed 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.929
 yourself of holes so that this substance is she and 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.879
 begins to poison Ivanova went but 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.280
 it turns out so you need not soluble in 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.049
 water she falls m sediment there is not clean 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.970
 need because substance gets into 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.010
 sediment it no longer dissolves in 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.040
 the solution in which the bacteria lives 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.700
 squad over amino acids and works here 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.390
 these processes are amino acids they are 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.290
 protein elements that when in 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.090
 sixties from the task was 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.010
 set before science and the task of these 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.799
 boring but want blood was 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.420
 set and we will substitute in the body of the year 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.220
 born genetic engineering the course 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.780
 finished universities and colors their genes 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.150
 ashburn elements as doctoral 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.440
 dissertations them there mastered it 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.239
 practically put me on 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.609
 the genetic part I killed her 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.510
 bacteria produce components for 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:55.760
 artificial blood make it up 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.900
 this is the process that train in our 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.180
 country, he was accordingly protected 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.700
 and the right to use it was 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.060
 sold these patents licensed 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:13.159
 this substance is produced abroad and 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:15.290
 we buy it in our country 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.970
 Moreover, the whole team except 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.159
 I found me in the Academy of Sciences and this whole 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.959
 the team was bought japan was created 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.120
 Japanese enterprises Moscow 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.819
 whose search and inadvertently head 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.560
 all side from my colleagues here I am not 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.530
 continues to do the best in the world 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.150
 amino acid producers for 25 years 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.599
 who work in the Academy of Sciences and not 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:39.440
 working on the pond in the same place well 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:42.310
 here is how it is and why we can't do it 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.349
 do when this is the whole ideology 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.780
 handmade and up to technology over 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:51.609
 our glands 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.799
 fermenter and they are Japanese but what is there 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:57.440
 live put it how it handles 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:59.359
 it's all ours now japanese something that doesn't 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.069
 bought it rotates practical 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.419
 application 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.739
 practical application but practically 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:06.199
 with me this is about the quality of feed 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:10.879
 supplements first priority poultry and in 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:13.699
 pig breeding we and there other organisms 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.979
 we don't do all the amino acids here we are 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:20.810
 for example threonine do not do lysine 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:23.810
 and if you give one let's say the birds here 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.360
 here you give some food most 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.800
 wonderful naturally 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.780
 but it will be used by 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.400
 substance that limits the increase 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.000
 the weight is that if we assume not enough 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.430
 rubber 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.560
 then almost eat more weight will not increase 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.930
 because he is in total bird balance 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.210
 he must have such a percentage and 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.860
 if he doesnâ€™t reach the number 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.780
 to make it a kilogram 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.120
 it turns out a pound it still does not 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.710
 there will be no half a kilo because 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:56.560
 kalyazin limits weighty component a and 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.389
 this is a huge industry when adds here 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.550
 these essential acids they do not do there 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.229
 birds interest me there is not the body and deceive 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.449
 don't do there some different acid 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.849
 over it doesn't matter about any one of them 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.889
 and the same main kalyazin it should be 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:11.110
 in very large quantities produced 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.300
 without him there are pig and poultry 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.580
 she will be ineffective 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.520
 the next three are i am about bacteria 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.129
 tarzan genetically modified yes here it is 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.750
 That's all and all these medications there 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.370
 all this is solid vodka all she 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.169
 genetically modified because 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.840
 everything is based on enzymes 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.099
 splitting starch and cellulose and all 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.870
 these enzymes are produced exclusively 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:33.839
 from genetically modified 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.729
 there are no other organisms 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:38.440
 all vodka all and solid genetically 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:42.099
 modified product and resolutely 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.750
 harmful here is what i agree rick bears 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.759
 no there is no other soul 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.830
 has a cause of its harmfulness to 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:49.690
 the method of obtaining an organism from which 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.879
 which uses to produce there 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.759
 Alcohol uses well as a rule now 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:57.430
 uses honor pure enzyme in 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:59.139
 nature when the season say 1 alcohol is not 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.939
 the product which mankind deal 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.879
 consciously start this beer 

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:04.830
 Egypt yes it's more expensive there which 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:07.389
 produces enzymes 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.129
 spiritually degrading carbohydrates and they 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.979
 generally in the end should 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:13.419
 turn into carbon dioxide and water but 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.400
 as it doesn't reach carbon dioxide 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:18.969
 gas and water intermediate manifests itself 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.580
 alcohol but also here it is the key 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:23.020
 the product of the finished times began to receive 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.940
 this grass 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.080
 here is the original production therefore 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.229
 use live yeast 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.389
 They are now used moonshine but in 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.340
 industries use the squad why 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:35.289
 there to humanity an enzyme is needed of them 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.970
 and do not offend not of them if this enzyme 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:38.110
 can faster from bacteria you him 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.210
 its strength from bacteria 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.580
 if he pursue doing the same 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.139
 chemical reaction there razhev needed there 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.610
 bacterial is all the same important 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:47.740
 so that it is as chemically pure 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.560
 substance this enzyme here and it and 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:53.349
 done but from you about him he is no longer 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.539
 protein is a metabolite you need to 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:58.990
 proteins stood and defended and turning 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:07:01.479
 glucose and something else in let's say 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.310
 training is a much more difficult thing 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:05.650
 here it is the production of enzymes 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.090
 much simpler is the gene of it 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.770
 need to make it a product he 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.569
 carries out the conversion there 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:14.319
 some substance there let's say pulp 

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:16.240
 already in concrete and yours accordingly 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:18.069
 the business of getting a bag of this 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.840
 powder which is an enzyme 

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:22.659
 the right amount at the right temperature 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.000
 pour it accordingly 

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:27.580
 lay out the proposed created the whole is 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.620
 from sugars and in general their 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.210
 conversions she leads to an expert 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.120
 not give not brought to carbon 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:36.490
 gas and water on the fact that here these enzymes 

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.800
 they are used in huge quantities 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:42.539
 different microbiological industries in 

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.539
 particular and crossed over alcohol
