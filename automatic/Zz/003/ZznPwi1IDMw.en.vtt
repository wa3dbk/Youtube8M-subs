 Ailing in Mexico, it should be noted that

 this is just the reflection of something that 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.350
 it happened from a problem of 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.210
 insecurity that goes to more states 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.790

 next few hours we will be expanding the

 information something that is also 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.890
 happening in other parts of mexico 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:45.850
 we are going to that country with 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.010
 francisco ceres or he is part and 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.120
 the organization is headed by the committee 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.040

 open image 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:06.140
 we already saw it in writings that are in 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.969
 your cherry committee website where they speak 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.000
 the situation of China 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:13.760
 it was only the drop that spilled the 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.230
 glass of one more problem that is of 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.970
 backdrop that are the thousands of 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.549
 disappearances in Mexico expanding more 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.000
 about this francisco and effectively to 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.829
 From 2008 to war against 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.349
 drug trafficking that we call a 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.150
 war against the people and the 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.790
 forced disappearance as a strategy 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.489
 systematic of the Mexican state it 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.689
 applied against all people 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:42.739
 with the aim of generating fear 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:45.230
 terror destroy the social fabric and with 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.629
 it allow the conditions for 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.019
 is what we are seeing in year 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.879
 Chinese for that is massacres 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:56.180
 widespread because it is not the only one and 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:57.889
 even the clandestine graves that 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.530
 have found there are many more 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:04.040
 bodies what is talking about a 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.330
 emergency situation in mexico this 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.310
 been denouncing however the state 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.610
 they have denied us the responsibility that 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.770
 have in enforced disappearances and 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.420
 even today he is talking about 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.299
 case of ayotzinapa as if they were 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.170
 people who are absent or people 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.880
 that are not found and trying to 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.520
 omit the word forced disappearance 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.340
 which implies the participation of agents 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.490
 of the state in this case and in very many 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.920
 others in Mexico we have good not 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.600
 there is a number an exact number of 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.730
 how many missing forced there in 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.190
 mexico but you're talking about 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.050
 around 30 thousand people who 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.810
 they have been disappeared and within them 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.880
 around 3000 4000 people who 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.390
 they are enforced disappearances that is 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.630
 acts committed by military policemen 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:57.240
 in the navy in mexico and of these 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.240
 how many of these forced disappearances 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.310
 you how many data do you calculate that are 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.350
 recognized by the state because as 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.870
 you point out of the 43 students the 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.570
 Mexican government has not wanted to use 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.780
 this term forced disappearances in 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.370
 how much would we be estimating 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.000
 to these missing figures that 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.700
 corresponds is this typology of 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.830
 crimes francisco we calculate 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.380
 because it is also very difficult to be able to 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.570
 document all these acts especially 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.850
 when they are made by groups 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.510
 paramilitaries we say there will be 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.860
 about four thousand people who are 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:37.490
 forced disappearances that is where 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.090
 the state has directly ordered the 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.490
 disappearance 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.910
 now francisco you have pointed out that 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.780
 this problem is a pro is something that 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:50.340
 characterizes mexico or that 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.810
 represents or is emblematic of the problem 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.479
 of the disappearances in mexico 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.400
 I could comment on this because the 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.979
 international opinion of the community 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.660
 international has been outraged by 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.520
 this case but as you already point out 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.110
 there have been other cases have occurred 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.000
 other cases especially in the last 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.340
 decade that had been hidden 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.560
 hidden in mexico and that are now 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.440
 coming to light in the wake of this case of 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.030
 ayotzinapa francisco and there have been other 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.440
 cases that have also had a 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.150
 international resonance for example 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.729
 is the case of the execution 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.669
 extrajudicial of 22 people on the beach 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:26.010
 which is made by the army 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:28.530
 mexican is also the massacre of san 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.419
 fernando who were migrants who 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.180
 they were also arrested tortured 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.770
 executed extrajudicially what 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.750
 what's happening in Mexico is that 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.360
 also the Mexican state tries to 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:42.630
 give or take responsibility to the 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.400
 organized crime when according to 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.810
 information including witnesses in the 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.450
 ayotzinapa case 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.550
 they talk about those groups 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.410
 drug traffickers of united warriors is 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.440
 a group that was born to defend the 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:57.570
 army of another group of 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.180
 drug traffickers what is saying 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:02.340
 that there is also a strategy for 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.940
 militarization in Mexico are 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:08.150
 using the sinister hand let's say that 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.750
 are the paramilitary groups that 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.150
 disguised as groups of 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.460
 drug traffickers but it also implies the 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:17.130
 direct responsibility of the state 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.800
 Mexican in the creation of these groups 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:22.080
 and in acting with the question of the 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.270
 arbitrary detention torture 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.389
 forced disappearance and execution 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:30.479
 extrajudicial against not only the 

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:32.940
 inhabitants of mexico but currently 

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:35.280
 also against the social movement 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:38.310
 organized as it is happening or as 

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.200
 it happened in China for good there's a 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:43.639
 situation and as you already pointed out 

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:46.020
 it's a problem that is only 

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:48.840
 spilling the glass of a whole situation 

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.220
 of systematic disappearances in 

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.560
 systematic samples in mexico 

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.380
 Francisco Ceres or the cherry committee 

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.730
