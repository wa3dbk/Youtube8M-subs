00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 hello girls I'm happy with you 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.380
 find in this video all the more 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.170
 it's a top 5 foundation 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.490
 special acne skin then if you do not 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.349
 do not know my story with my 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.570
 break nor is the whole adventure here 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.190
 knowing that I went through a lot of 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.199
 phases I came back to my old 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.060
 hormonal treatment that worked from 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.650
 thunder on me I had almost 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.330
 small imperfections of punctual 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.730
 but really very rarely 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.160
 and when I really wanted to stop this 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.090
 treatment I ended up with 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.539
 something that gave me pimples 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.710
 etc. 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.689
 I do not want to tell you my life 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.099
 I already told you about it I already have you 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.510
 did my little routine on how I 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.860
 covers all imperfections but I 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.989
 did not tell you about all the funds 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.160
 complexion that I like to use or the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.809
 foundation that works on a 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.980
 acne skin I already told you about 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.420
 foundation parish that I love 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.890
 but all the foundation does not 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.809
 not work systematically on a 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.460
 acne skin so a lot of bottom of your 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.230
 as revealed in colruyt which is 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.940
 beautiful on my skin when she is 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.620
 without having petitions are all 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.480
 simply ignoble on a bo with a 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.710
 acne and for once I really want 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.910
 to show you all the foundations 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.710
 that are worth buying 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.379
 when you have acne that was hatching nice 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.329
 pressure with a natural finish 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.710
 that's really what I'm looking for and 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.000
 pretty amazing way all funds from 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.770
 complexion that I present to you are really 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.570
 very bright with a coverage 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.860
 modular and camouflage is very much the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.210
 imperfections in any case I hope that 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.020
 it will help you the first foundation 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.000
 I'm going to talk to you about it 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.470
 heard the studio spikes leak from mac's 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.600
 I told you about a billion times 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.280
 he knows he had to postpone very often I 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.270
 am so much her 35 and I'm at my 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.950
 second skin in one year 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.159
 what I like with this foundation 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.900
 this is the very flowing side fired from the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.299
 Coverage she is average after strong 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.490
 the satin finish that really brings the 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.650
 light and incredible comfort 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.240
 I love this foundation it has a 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.820
 fluid texture but still enough 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.290
 thick to know if ever that's what 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.479
 you're looking for it or not but it's a 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.799
 foundation that I like and that 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.780
 I will love I still think because he 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.250
 works as much on a technique as 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.840
 on a skin without imperfection with 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.939
 some imperfections since it offers 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.079
 really something perfect the 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.790
 foundation that lead to 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.470
 perfect really baby's skin it's 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.090
 this one I strongly advise you 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.850
 game love it and I recommend it 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.710
 still little parenthesis help you 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.540
 makes a perfect coverage with this background 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.060
 of complexion I do you the video here does not 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.140
 not flee the light because it takes 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.909
 thanks to ayew me ruby ​​i know it 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.560
 now that I was changing settings to the 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.510
 hand now when I would like to 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.430
 filming because otherwise we'll say 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.060
 that the light will focus on the 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.069
 warm colors 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.560
 so that it can appear yellow 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.290
 fluo and then the color to recover 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.310
 little by little it's the settings of 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.780
 the camera the ones interested 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.459
 who make videos maybe that 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.660
 can help you in any case second 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.670
 factor that I love is the agreement 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.750
 perfect at l'oréal 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.790
 I love this short is not because it is 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.880
 fluid it has a finished this one more time 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.510
 satin all that is semi matte and 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.010
 that's what I like 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.090
 you still have something 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.220
 perfectly that it makes you level 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.050
 imperfections an ultra texture 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.060
 fluid is the foundation most 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.440
 fluid and that I have is the most covering 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.720
 per month to its fluidity 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.310
 little parenthesis this one is a 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.810
 another room but I'm Belgian would have 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.390
 I usually bought this one 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.200
 shit 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.230
 usually I 'm crooked but 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.720
 I would have at l'oréal and there I bought 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.880
 mine in duty free is untenable 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.579
 and I do not advise you if ever 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.500
 you actually want a little effect 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.299
 light for shining in the good 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.250
 health the but I would have done really 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.700
 bring out this effect the sand is 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.829
 much more neutral and I prefer it 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.820
 not in fact I advise you so the 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.350
 Belgian would have if you have the same 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.269
 carnation than me and I recommend you 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.760
 a thousand times this very fluid foundation 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.190
 to the unfounded modular runoff so much 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.829
 I love recently it's been a month 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.440
 and a half that I have a lunch 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:33.019
 hilcona high and contrary to his name 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.209
 ok it makes you appear a nice glow 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.489
 natural in splinters but not a sparkle 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.530
 comparable to something fat of 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.510
 too bright it's just a sparkle 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.070
 I would say control you have this 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.870
 light that has worn through the foundation 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.010
 which is very interesting because you 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.380
 have a texture that still 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.450
 covering I would say from medium to strong 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.620
 depending on how you apply it this 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.120
 that I found interesting in this background 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.709
 it is the light that is 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.960
 provided I would say it is a good 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.340
 very bright weather with a finish that 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.950
 nehme recovering the same average 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.000
 really reports according to how 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.860
 you will apply your forehead 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.190
 terminal heard you're going to have a 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.450
 bottom of your who will appear as xiii 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.280
 came back on your face and 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.900
 hiding some of your appearances 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.370
 the other two are quieter or 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.940
 flowers but this one works very 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.260
 as well 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.180
 I will make you a routine with because 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.250
 that it's really worth the detour 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.510
 the attack I'm trying barcelona 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.560
 I really like this engine at bottom 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.480
 especially since I loved it 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.710
 when I had the cone but I 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.690
 chips and the dream lon kohler steve 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.220
 basic 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.950
 be careful the formula I liked 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.750
 it was the normal formula dries well 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.580
 that I have poor thanks to the time when 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.260
 I had my mac is it's the only one 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.330
 formula that I think offers 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.610
 hydration 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.220
 beyond the coverage of the semi-matte finish 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.020
 so possible to sign but really due 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.610
 very coverage against two years ago 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.890
 the dispute between them normal to cuttlefish 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.780
 and prom x to fat and quite 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.640
 amazing is the normal pot dries 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.870
 which I preferred because the formula 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.250
 is much more moisturizing 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.400
 then you have to go to 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.500
 cover of course the satin finish and 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.640
 7 hydration that allowed you 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.890
 to have a foundation that holds in 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.770
 place all day to perfection 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.390
 who will really stay on the skin then 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.100
 that I find that whoever is for 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.950
 mixed to oily skin had more 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.000
 tendency to dry imperfections 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.020
 even enough in some areas of the 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.090
 skin and blow mark the 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.310
 imperfections a little pity but 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.080
 the normal to 16 he is extra he is 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.080
 awesome and shoot that in terms of 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.700
 comparison they are really alike 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.800
 not bad the studio fixed son of chez mac 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.240
 and the caller is to the extent that they 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.820
 are very common or both short 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.140
 on average to very strong and that's 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.010
 really what we are looking for when 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.360
 has imperfections 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.070
 in any case me it is a foundation 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.540
 I loved litter and even in summer it 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.460
 holds very well that your foundation 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.500
 I loved I wore them during 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.300
 many years I loved it all 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.030
 heart is the one to see me and it's 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.130
 the smell I no longer wear despite the fact 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.600
 that this without a great foundation even if 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.710
 he changed his formula 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.930
 now I test the sample there 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.790
 slightly more fluid since a few 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.560
 month does it bother me absolutely 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.120
 not personally it does not bother me 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.980
 at all on the level there covering 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.330
 finds the same covering what is a 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.070
 coverage on average to very high 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.600
 also and now I'm thinking 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.670
 well it's the only foundation that 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.100
 holds from morning to evening without 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.390
 retouches and without powder really the de 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.350
 valloire des steelers hours this is the 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.850
 foundation of the tropics 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.830
 you can put it anytime 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.660
 anywhere he had done magnificent 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.220
 when I noticed someone it's true 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.950
 that especially for a bridal makeup 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.120
 I like to have seen malware deaths 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.830
 the ardor simply because the 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.290
 debate the web is the one that will hold 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.090
 without any problem offer to finish 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.280
 really very natural despite the fact that 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.530
 it is very covering and in addition to that 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.330
 I think he has a light that 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.640
 is clean 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.290
 really and he resists all he resists 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.030
 at the heat he resists kisses he 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.500
 really resists a lot of things 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.060
 different there is no transfer 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.160
 for me it's true that it's one of 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.150
 best in access and if 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.350
 I had my iphone and who were 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.390
 stayed and as you know I 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.760
 resumed my only treatment I think that 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.540
 I would have it again without hesitation it is 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.160
 really very good 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.450
 if you have not tried asking for a 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.250

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.270

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.450

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.720

 tendency to almost mark the 

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.980
 imperfections time he dried the skin 

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:33.400
