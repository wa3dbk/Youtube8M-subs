00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.910
 18 collection because we are in a new 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.320
 video and I wanted to play metal 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.360
 get there so I said I will win here 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.920
 a like a mission and well then now 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.550
 I will comment on what the mission is and such 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.900
 I just started it because the beginning 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.840
 it's a bit slow so I've passed 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.420
 those first steps but basically what 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.699
 you need to do is kill two 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.920
 people are worth telling us in the 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.050
 map someone shows this bad site 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.180
 one will be here and another one here is worth 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.710
 I'm going to start working 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.510
 and well what we have to do 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.950
 basically delete it are not not 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.910
 our orders eliminate those two 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.829
 uncles who will be like two big shots 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.270
 and good stolen a gun because I've seen 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.710
 that the only thing that they give me in the way 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.030
 difficult that I 'm testing it now 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.030
 same 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.140
 sorry is the gun is of darts and if 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.190
 we have to kill them with a 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.190
 dart gun as they saw 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.880
 so good what I would like to have is to have 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.010
 some pistols with silencer but bases 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.510
 they have not given it to us and I do not know 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.280
 I know almost the map because almost I have not 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.790
 played so I do not know where where I can 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.790
 get one 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.320
 so good we go here I all 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.340
 the missions of the month I have already spent in 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.830
 normal mode once I know the map 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.600
 of structure pretty much the way I the 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.600
 I know, but the places where they are 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:32.650
 things I have no idea so a 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.650
 little here I believe 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.969
 yes ss ss 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.590
 as here I am going to teach here we have the 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.469
 report of the mission that we have each 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.420
 one is this and another is this that is the one 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.950
 we just saw it 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.560
 so the first thing I need 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.659
 If I get a gun, it's still here 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.539
 a place where they were hidden weapons 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.450
 what I do not know that there will be inside does not 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.560
 agreement 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.560
 but I'm going to try 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.310
 and there's a very important guy to mark it with 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.150
 the 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.150
 how can it be called this 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.830
 I do not know the telescope this do not know how 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.770
 call someone 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.240
 If you keep it there, then the 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.190
 truth is that it comes pretty good in case 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.450
 for now turn around or come by 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.940
 behind and does not know and if the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.940
 you have marked you already know where they are 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:40.370
 and now I wanted to get in here but that's 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.370
 I do not know if I'm going to be able, I'm going to try 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.830
 to see for god that there is a weapon with 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.830
 muffler 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.930
 4 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.930
 a franc 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.010
 OK 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.560
 no weapon with silencer can make 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.880
 with the franc 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.880
 that goes in the car there 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.120
 it's worth where you want to play uncle is 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.120
 A) Yes 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.290
 this not 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.489
 if it is not this this one is clean 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.330
 mother and the one that has been carried in the 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.330
 head of that man 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.840
 annoying as or more than their peers 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.840
 they stay so calm 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.849
 caution 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.849
 now they move not 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.800
 host 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.110
 that gives you no 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.069
 It's worth the truth is to make a quick 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.900
 view not the colleague 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.830
 you have to be careful because you 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.210
 discover with nothing now in caution 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.210
 to his partner 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.080
 Well, the other one, if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.930
 I was up here 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.920
 and noah gordon 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.920
 I do not know 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.829
 it's little by little because I do not know if it's 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.829
 up there or not 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.780
 so I do not want to mess it up either, I know that 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.780
 Uncle time is left in black 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.720
 this kid how is he so fast 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.720
 edano 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:35.769
 or the other 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.710
 I hate that this new trip yes yes yes 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:44.020
 yes yes yes we go as you see since we 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.930
 they discover we have then 23 seconds to 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.400
 sleep what goes in slow motion 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.470
 I do not know if it's better or worse but good 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.520
 it's okay because they give you an option 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.660
 at least because you see how I 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.660
 they discover is that it is impossible 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.500
 impossible that they do not see you once in 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.070
 when you already have to be here a pro 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.830
 about where so perfect 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.990
 I like that with the good franc of a 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.640
 fuck 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.640
 ok i 'm going to put myself here 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.220
 you look with prismatic binoculars 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.220
 they are called by the way 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:27.900
 it may be it decides there in white 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:29.939
 ss ss double league allied league gives you 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.569
 shoot point down why that happens to me 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:35.610
 for not knowing me the controls 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:39.479
 and if we are not the head 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:43.159
 we are your march or the crisis has taken 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.159
 from 93 meters good too 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.740
 ok I think now I have to leave the 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.780
 map is already 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.169
 Well, that's it if you do not discover me now 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.169
 you know 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.700
 okay this leaves him sleeping so this 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.010
 the easiest way in principle 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.720
 see carefully equally good 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.160
 kids tell you to see if I finish the 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.410
 a mission and while I tell you 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.780
 if you want me to upload all the 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.280
 missions that are 6 as I said without 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.870
 no problem if you see that you like 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.770
 and such without any problem I will upload them 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.770
 different and 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.720
 Until you already have to sleep I think so 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.970
 OK 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:27.080
 and to the other one surely when I give the 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.080
 turn what you have to do the same 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.449
 Wait, he kissed me still 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:38.140
 ok my mother this made a progress 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.140
 I almost do not play 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.889
 after more or less like the others 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.370
 metal gear so I pretty much have 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:48.009
 calculated you see it although it swings more 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.960
 I believe in previous ones that already 

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:53.440
 time and played from small ideal good 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:56.080
 the metal gear 4 I have even mine what 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.430
 I went there all at one hundred percent and one 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.529
 I really like this kind of 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.659
 games 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:02.189
 and nothing like I said if he saw that 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:04.529
 you give a lot of secc and such and that for 

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:06.419
 comments has comments 

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:08.159
 positive and all that and you want more without 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:11.729
 no problem I will upload more missions worth 

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:13.019
 is already a getaway route so 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:14.549
 good good here we have mission 

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:16.739
 completed I do not think it gives us much 

00:07:14.549 --> 00:07:18.589
 rank because we have killed seeing each other in 

00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:21.709
 we have not done so many more 

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:21.709
 mission accomplished 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:28.740
 to see the good range death have been 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.460
 killed two dead without evil I have 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:34.460
 that kill ornament that's inevitable 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.460
 so 

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:39.790
 Attempts 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:43.150
 attempts because I have restarted the mission 

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.720
 before starting it's worth it's good 

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:44.980
 fairly good 

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.690
 I was not expecting you 

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.370
 liked and as I said then there 

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.840
 favorites put by the comments if 

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:52.920
 you want more and all that and nothing we see 

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.920
 in the next video chao 

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.610
 two
