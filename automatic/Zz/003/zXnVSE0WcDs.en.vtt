00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.290 

so<00:00:00.960> this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.319> a<00:00:01.350> part<00:00:02.040> free<00:00:02.399> of<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.879> rendering

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
so this is a part free of the rendering

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.630 
so this is a part free of the rendering
technique<00:00:03.689> series<00:00:04.170> and<00:00:04.440> we're<00:00:05.339> going<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.490> have

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
technique series and we're going to have

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.940 
technique series and we're going to have
a<00:00:05.670> look<00:00:05.850> at<00:00:06.000> blurry<00:00:06.799> reflections<00:00:07.799> and

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
a look at blurry reflections and

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.030 
a look at blurry reflections and
refractions<00:00:08.750> so<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:10.080> set<00:00:10.260> up<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.440> simple<00:00:10.830> scene

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
refractions so I set up the simple scene

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.720 
refractions so I set up the simple scene
at<00:00:12.030> quick<00:00:12.269> VFX<00:00:12.750> text<00:00:13.290> I've<00:00:14.160> got<00:00:14.340> some<00:00:14.549> like

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
at quick VFX text I've got some like

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.120 
at quick VFX text I've got some like
blue<00:00:15.089> objects<00:00:15.900> falling<00:00:16.199> from<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.920> sky<00:00:17.160> and

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
blue objects falling from the sky and

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.230 
blue objects falling from the sky and
I've<00:00:20.130> got<00:00:20.279> some<00:00:20.430> basic<00:00:20.609> lighting<00:00:21.090> as<00:00:21.210> well

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
I've got some basic lighting as well

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.200 
I've got some basic lighting as well
nothing<00:00:21.840> special<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.880> basically<00:00:23.880> right<00:00:24.150> now

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
nothing special so basically right now

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.609 
nothing special so basically right now
I've<00:00:24.510> got<00:00:24.689> my<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.869> render<00:00:25.410> set<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.890> standard<00:00:26.340> and

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
I've got my I render set to standard and

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.269 
I've got my I render set to standard and
if<00:00:28.619> we<00:00:28.769> try<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.099> render<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.460> scene<00:00:31.279> it's

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
if we try and render the scene it's

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.130 
if we try and render the scene it's
actually<00:00:32.669> going<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> take<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.329> pretty<00:00:33.870> long

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
actually going to take a pretty long

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.860 
actually going to take a pretty long
time<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.770> calculate<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:37.969> this<00:00:38.969> material<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.840> a

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
time to calculate and this material on a

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.560 
time to calculate and this material on a
quick<00:00:40.230> VFX

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
quick VFX

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.889 
quick VFX
that's<00:00:42.570> my<00:00:42.719> layer<00:00:42.960> here<00:00:43.910> to<00:00:44.910> activate<00:00:45.149> blurry

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that's my layer here to activate blurry

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.660 
that's my layer here to activate blurry
reflections<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:47.100> simply<00:00:47.340> go<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
reflections just simply go to the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.330 
reflections just simply go to the
reflection<00:00:48.059> tab<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.899> material<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.590> then

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
reflection tab on the material and then

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.100 
reflection tab on the material and then
where<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.700> says<00:00:50.879> blurriness<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:51.840> kind<00:00:52.020> of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
where it says blurriness just kind of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.420 
where it says blurriness just kind of
increase<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:54.379> when<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.680> zero<00:00:56.010> you

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
increase that and when it's a zero you

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.830 
increase that and when it's a zero you
don't<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.730> these<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.120> extra<00:00:57.480> options

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
don't have these like extra options

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.840 
don't have these like extra options
activated<00:00:58.440> but<00:00:59.039> as<00:00:59.129> soon<00:00:59.280> as<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.460> go<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.640> one

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
activated but as soon as you go to one

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.459 
activated but as soon as you go to one
percent<00:01:00.239> starts<00:01:00.809> using<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.140> different

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
percent starts using a different

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.549 
percent starts using a different
algorithm<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.609> all<00:01:03.449> these<00:01:03.719> sampling<00:01:04.290> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
algorithm and the all these sampling and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.240 
algorithm and the all these sampling and
accuracy<00:01:05.189> options<00:01:05.850> become<00:01:06.119> available<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:07.860> and

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
accuracy options become available so and

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.510 
accuracy options become available so and
also<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.450> more<00:01:09.720> blurriness<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.770> add<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
also the more blurriness you add the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.980 
also the more blurriness you add the
longer<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> render<00:01:12.270> time<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.780> take

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
longer the render time is going to take

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.140 
longer the render time is going to take
it's<00:01:13.409> kind<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.619> strange<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.369> that's<00:01:14.850> how<00:01:15.000> it

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
it's kind of strange but that's how it

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.719 
it's kind of strange but that's how it
works<00:01:16.400> so<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:18.000> put<00:01:18.810> some<00:01:18.950> pretty<00:01:19.950> high<00:01:20.189> samples

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
works so I put some pretty high samples

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.960 
works so I put some pretty high samples
here<00:01:20.939> minimum<00:01:21.420> 64<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.380> maximum<00:01:22.799> 128<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
here minimum 64 and maximum 128 the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.859 
here minimum 64 and maximum 128 the
accuracy<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.509> very<00:01:24.600> high<00:01:24.979> 95%<00:01:26.240> so<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
accuracy is very high 95% so with the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.520 
accuracy is very high 95% so with the
standard<00:01:28.320> renderer<00:01:29.060> this<00:01:30.060> takes<00:01:30.570> quite<00:01:31.409> a

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
standard renderer this takes quite a

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.620 
standard renderer this takes quite a
while<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.799> render<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:33.000> then<00:01:35.570> basically<00:01:36.570> if

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
while to render and then basically if

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.569 
while to render and then basically if
you<00:01:36.750> want<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.990> use<00:01:37.170> blurry<00:01:37.500> reflections<00:01:38.340> it's

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
you want to use blurry reflections it's

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.210 
you want to use blurry reflections it's
best<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.909> use<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.180> physical<00:01:40.079> renderer<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:41.070> go

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
best to use the physical renderer so go

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.850 
best to use the physical renderer so go
to<00:01:41.280> render<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.030> then<00:01:42.360> set<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.990> type<00:01:43.619> to

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
to render and then set the type to

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.760 
to render and then set the type to
physical<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:45.920> then<00:01:47.990> just<00:01:48.990> set<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> sampling

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
physical and then just set the sampling

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.480 
physical and then just set the sampling
quality<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.369> low<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:52.189> we're<00:01:53.189> just<00:01:53.250> going<00:01:53.399> to

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
quality to low and we're just going to

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.899 
quality to low and we're just going to
hit<00:01:53.549> render<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:55.040> as<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.159> can<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.340> straight

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
hit render and as you can see straight

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.459 
hit render and as you can see straight
away<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.390> render<00:01:57.689> time<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:58.110> increased

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
away the render time is increased

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.520 
away the render time is increased
greatly<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.420> also<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.570> physical<00:02:00.750> render<00:02:01.350> is

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
greatly and also the physical render is

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.899 
greatly and also the physical render is
a<00:02:01.860> more<00:02:02.700> ideal<00:02:02.880> for<00:02:03.509> situations<00:02:04.049> with

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
a more ideal for situations with

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.749 
a more ideal for situations with
advanced<00:02:05.909> reflection<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.600> refraction

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.089 

so<00:02:10.450> I'm<00:02:10.509> just<00:02:10.659> going<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.840> set<00:02:11.019> my<00:02:11.099> sampling

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
so I'm just going to set my sampling

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.479 
so I'm just going to set my sampling
quality<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.700> medium<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:14.159> have<00:02:15.159> a<00:02:15.190> look<00:02:15.370> at

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
quality to medium and have a look at

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.470 
quality to medium and have a look at
that<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:17.700> it's<00:02:18.700> still<00:02:18.790> much<00:02:19.090> quicker<00:02:19.330> than

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
that and it's still much quicker than

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.479 
that and it's still much quicker than
the<00:02:19.659> standard<00:02:20.049> render<00:02:20.440> even<00:02:21.370> now<00:02:21.519> and

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
the standard render even now and

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.150 
the standard render even now and
obviously<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.610> higher<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:25.239> sampling<00:02:25.720> rate

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
obviously the higher the sampling rate

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.830 
obviously the higher the sampling rate
the<00:02:27.160> less<00:02:27.340> grain<00:02:27.670> you're<00:02:27.910> going<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.150> get<00:02:28.860> and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
the less grain you're going to get and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.869 
the less grain you're going to get and
as<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:31.930> can<00:02:32.049> see<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:32.739> can<00:02:32.890> already<00:02:33.580> see<00:02:33.849> the

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
as you can see you can already see the

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:39.030 
as you can see you can already see the
blurry<00:02:34.209> reflections<00:02:35.340> in<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.400> scene<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:38.040> in

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
blurry reflections in the scene and in

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.509 
blurry reflections in the scene and in
our<00:02:39.159> settings<00:02:39.579> here<00:02:41.250> we<00:02:42.250> can<00:02:42.400> obviously

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
our settings here we can obviously

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.339 
our settings here we can obviously
increase<00:02:43.239> all<00:02:43.540> these<00:02:43.690> sampling<00:02:44.349> subdivisions

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
increase all these sampling subdivisions

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.660 
increase all these sampling subdivisions
reduce<00:02:47.349> the<00:02:47.560> shading<00:02:47.950> error<00:02:48.129> threshold

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
reduce the shading error threshold

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.789 
reduce the shading error threshold
that's<00:02:48.910> going<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.180> increase<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.900> accuracy

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
that's going to increase the accuracy

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.759 
that's going to increase the accuracy
reducing<00:02:51.730> this<00:02:51.989> but<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:53.230> don't<00:02:53.470> want<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.650> go<00:02:53.709> too

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
reducing this but I don't want to go too

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.089 
reducing this but I don't want to go too
low<00:02:54.129> and<00:02:55.319> obviously<00:02:56.319> these<00:02:56.709> subdivisions

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
low and obviously these subdivisions

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.780 
low and obviously these subdivisions
here<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:59.290> blurriness<00:02:59.650> subdivision<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.579> going

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
here the blurriness subdivision is going

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.900 
here the blurriness subdivision is going
to<00:03:00.849> help<00:03:01.180> greatly<00:03:01.810> if<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.260> increase<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.910> and

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
to help greatly if you increase that and

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.309 
to help greatly if you increase that and
we<00:03:04.000> don't<00:03:04.180> actually<00:03:04.299> need<00:03:04.629> these<00:03:04.900> here

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
we don't actually need these here

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.750 
we don't actually need these here
because<00:03:05.620> we're<00:03:05.769> not<00:03:05.799> using<00:03:06.099> a<00:03:06.280> subsurface

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
because we're not using a subsurface

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.539 
because we're not using a subsurface
scattering<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:08.410> I<00:03:08.709> could<00:03:08.920> actually<00:03:09.040> set<00:03:09.400> these

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
scattering so I could actually set these

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:17.039 
scattering so I could actually set these
to<00:03:09.760> just<00:03:09.970> one<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:14.609> the<00:03:15.609> blurry<00:03:16.060> refraction

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
to just one and the blurry refraction

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.349 
to just one and the blurry refraction
pretty<00:03:17.530> much<00:03:17.769> works<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.220> same<00:03:18.430> way<00:03:18.700> except

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
pretty much works the same way except

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.370 
pretty much works the same way except
I'm<00:03:20.019> going<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.290> create<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.680> new<00:03:21.040> material<00:03:21.160> here

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
I'm going to create a new material here

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.159 
I'm going to create a new material here
I'm<00:03:23.380> going<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.590> apply<00:03:23.829> it<00:03:23.889> to<00:03:24.010> my<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.870> quick

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
I'm going to apply it to my the quick

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:30.240 
I'm going to apply it to my the quick
part<00:03:26.590> of<00:03:26.799> my<00:03:26.950> quick<00:03:27.160> VFX<00:03:27.639> and<00:03:29.010> I'm<00:03:30.010> just<00:03:30.130> going

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
part of my quick VFX and I'm just going

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.319 
part of my quick VFX and I'm just going
to<00:03:30.340> delete<00:03:30.459> this<00:03:30.700> old<00:03:30.940> material<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:33.329> I'm

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
to delete this old material and I'm

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.280 
to delete this old material and I'm
going<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.480> activate<00:03:34.780> transparency<00:03:37.019> so<00:03:38.019> the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
going to activate transparency so the

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.670 
going to activate transparency so the
way<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.500> transparency<00:03:39.099> works<00:03:39.370> is<00:03:40.680> just

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
way the transparency works is just

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.890 
way the transparency works is just
reduce<00:03:41.950> it<00:03:41.980> slightly<00:03:42.250> if<00:03:43.239> you<00:03:43.389> activate<00:03:43.840> a

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
reduce it slightly if you activate a

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.580 
reduce it slightly if you activate a
blurriness<00:03:44.650> here<00:03:45.900> it's<00:03:46.900> pretty<00:03:47.290> much<00:03:47.410> the

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
blurriness here it's pretty much the

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.440 
blurriness here it's pretty much the
same<00:03:47.620> deal<00:03:47.859> as<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:50.099> reflection<00:03:51.180> by<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.239> way

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
same deal as the reflection by the way

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.150 
same deal as the reflection by the way
when<00:03:52.690> you<00:03:52.780> use<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.019> physical<00:03:53.410> render<00:03:53.769> these

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
when you use the physical render these

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.009 
when you use the physical render these
options<00:03:54.639> are<00:03:54.790> greyed<00:03:54.970> out<00:03:55.000> because<00:03:55.389> you

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
options are greyed out because you

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.710 
options are greyed out because you
basically<00:03:56.169> control<00:03:56.590> everything<00:03:57.069> here<00:03:57.519> in<00:03:58.060> the

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
basically control everything here in the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.129 
basically control everything here in the
render<00:03:59.019> settings<00:03:59.230> panel<00:04:00.720> so<00:04:01.720> I'm<00:04:01.780> just<00:04:01.959> going

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
render settings panel so I'm just going

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.830 
render settings panel so I'm just going
to<00:04:02.169> increase<00:04:03.269> refraction<00:04:04.269> blurriness<00:04:04.720> to

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
to increase refraction blurriness to

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.589 
to increase refraction blurriness to
maybe<00:04:05.019> 40<00:04:05.410> percent<00:04:05.799> and<00:04:06.269> I'm<00:04:07.269> going<00:04:07.449> to<00:04:07.510> do

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
maybe 40 percent and I'm going to do

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.580 
maybe 40 percent and I'm going to do
around<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:07.930> region<00:04:08.410> have<00:04:08.709> a<00:04:08.739> look<00:04:08.980> and<00:04:10.410> as<00:04:11.410> you

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
around the region have a look and as you

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.369 
around the region have a look and as you
can<00:04:11.709> see<00:04:11.769> in<00:04:12.010> this<00:04:12.129> render<00:04:12.519> here<00:04:13.199> it's<00:04:14.199> kind<00:04:14.349> of

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
can see in this render here it's kind of

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.409 
can see in this render here it's kind of
like<00:04:14.560> a<00:04:14.590> frosted<00:04:15.099> glass<00:04:15.160> effect<00:04:15.790> you<00:04:16.090> can<00:04:16.239> see

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
like a frosted glass effect you can see

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.250 
like a frosted glass effect you can see
that<00:04:16.570> blue<00:04:16.810> bowl<00:04:17.079> kind<00:04:17.349> of<00:04:18.299> behind<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.570> C<00:04:19.930> but

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
that blue bowl kind of behind the C but

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.980 
that blue bowl kind of behind the C but
it's<00:04:20.380> kind<00:04:20.530> of<00:04:20.590> diffused<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:22.510> lights<00:04:22.690> kind<00:04:22.930> of

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
it's kind of diffused the lights kind of

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.050 
it's kind of diffused the lights kind of
scattered<00:04:23.469> so<00:04:24.070> it's<00:04:24.190> a<00:04:24.250> very<00:04:24.430> nice<00:04:24.640> kind<00:04:24.940> of

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
scattered so it's a very nice kind of

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.500 
scattered so it's a very nice kind of
subtle<00:04:25.390> effect<00:04:25.719> and<00:04:26.340> then<00:04:27.340> join<00:04:28.180> me<00:04:28.300> for<00:04:28.330> part

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
subtle effect and then join me for part

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.959 
subtle effect and then join me for part
four<00:04:28.960> in<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:29.229> next<00:04:29.440> tutorial<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:30.010> thanks<00:04:30.909> for
