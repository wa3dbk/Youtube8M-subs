00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.850
 very good to all welcome to me 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.589
 welcome to a new video channel 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.210
 You see after a long time 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:08.559
 I bring a new trade video or before 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.969
 to start with the video tell you that if 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.280
 route this kind of videos liked 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.289
 videos pop the button alexis lived 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.969
 many likes then every week about a 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.980
 video with the bowling pins unfold is like 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.500
 I'm trying, I all want to say 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.480
 the trade on if it's something very simple 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.550
 it's just buying something and selling it 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.380
 more expensive if you manage to do those already 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.970
 are you trying this I think what 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.159
 complicated is to know at every moment of the 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.599
 game is to know what trade are worth not 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:34.629
 I am an expert but it is true that 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.760
 there are times when things look 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.579
 very clear and it is very clear for example 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.129
 right now every week the tops come out 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.140
 As you know, these are the blue letters and 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.269
 every week they put on a series of tournaments or 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.710
 a tournament right now right now 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.000
 is the tournament of the barclays is worth and 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.969
 everyone wants to play for 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.370
 some over 50 thousand and 7 thousand coins 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.679
 then we are going to take advantage of this vale 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.149
 you have to look for a player and in this 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:59.710
 case well although many likes in each 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.660
 video what I will do is recommend you 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.980
 a series of players or a player each 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.590
 time that the best thing is going well for me 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.850
 try in this case is walker worth in 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.830
 this case this week 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.840
 walker I think it's the best 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.220
 players to try because because it's 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.439
 a player who in his band in his 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.090
 position is the most used and also 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.100
 it has a fairly cheap price and that 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.990
 have 100 thousand or one million coins to 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.009
 to be able to deal with it then you have 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.750
 what to do then look what is the game 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.520
 of the purchase price already at that minimum 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.460
 moment as you have seen by was 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.140
 between 3000 and 3200 coins and from 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.210
 there look how much you want to get out of 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.070
 I believe in this case 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.659
 He thought out 500 coins 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.270
 benefit was very good so I 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.860
 put all I see to 2500 coins 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.590
 one thing that I want to highlight and that 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.539
 I want you to be attentive is that when 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.280
 you are going to bid on this jump that 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.259
 will warn screen happens the last one 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.060
 pushed is in 57 minutes and the 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.920
 next is in two hours and three 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.990
 minutes be attentive to this because to 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.970
 sometimes we start to bid like crazy and 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.800
 ended up pushing players that are left 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.690
 hours or even days and we have to 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.789
 is for them to finish once it's a 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.049
 bitch and as you see once we have already 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.909
 brought all the players because we 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.350
 all suddenly appear here and if not 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.270
 you know how to do it when you have the 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.369
 transferable list that already puts you what 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.750
 I had carried and you have many in between 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.600
 to the triangle and 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.460
 you do not give l1 in playstation or lb in 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.130
 xbox and you are all here you like it 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.280
 so then this is the moment 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.230
 more start of the trade or it's worth it 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.540
 we have to go assigning everything very very 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.310
 slowly and on the web app it was all 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.720
 much simpler but if we want 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.459
 work because the truth is that it is the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.750
 only way as you see I also take 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.340
 luis filipe as some tried 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.709
 also deal with filipe luis alberto 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.120
 Brunette clichy and also tried with 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.040
 sturridge but it's turis the truth is that 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.290
 I have not gone as well as it has been 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.420
 what better has gone as you see then good 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.290
 some I bought for 2,300 others 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.420
 2500 others for 2700 even but good e 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.090
 go bidding also at this time to what 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.900
 better the amount that I started working 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.610
 find an uncle who is also 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.620
 tried to bring with that player and you 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.480
 annoys a little bit if you see if you pass 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.370
 that we hope a bit to try a 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.420
 little later and good for once and 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.860
 we have put all the players 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.170
 simply wait and wait for 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.600
 that are sold as you see here I sold 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.100
 practically everyone in the majority 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.650
 they sell in an hour but if you can not 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.880
 put it back you also put what 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.270
 you want and then I want to tell you is that 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.970
 yes 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.410
 if for example the player that more for 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.180
 the for example any or in this case 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.040
 the cheapest is three thousand coins in 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.540
 that moment and you want to sell it to three 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.840
 a thousand coins or a little more three thousand 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.460
 hundred and put it to a longer time 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.140
 It is worth putting for example twelve time 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.460
 hours since if you put twelve hours 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.620
 surely in those twelve hours there will be a 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.350
 moment in which all the walker's 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.000
 three thousand coins are sold and between the 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.950
 3100 that would be the cheapest would be the 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.480
 yours and the whole will buy if you want it 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.580
 sell quickly put it to an hour and 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.470
 put it always 100 coins cheaper 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.760
 that what is at stake is cheaper 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.370
 For example, if the cheapest walker 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.320
 up to three thousand coins put it to 2900 and 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.520
 If someone wants a goal I want to buy 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.920
 here because it's the cheapest one worth 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.110
 so then, well, I simply 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.490
 I recommend that you bring with walker but if 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.590
 do you have any other player that 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.700
 you can see that it is good to try it with 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.280
 the 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.140
 try players who in your position 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.450
 if it can be the best or the most 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.180
 used then that walker is he was 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.860
 very clear and good if it's a game 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.840
 uses a lot because it's the best thing about 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.310
 everything that is used a lot then as 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.750
 I say it served a lot of selection this video 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.000
 next week for the tops that 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.000
 come out in is a world is league would be 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.830
 see what it is because he had many likes 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.240
 subtract another video teaching by 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.100
 good players with whom I am 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.169
 dealing with the player that they bring from 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.550
 marbles I'm getting the good but has 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.990
 been I do not share it with you and 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.610
 you can also get many 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.870
 coins so nothing more than the trick 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.250
 August the video already knows if it's done 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.780
