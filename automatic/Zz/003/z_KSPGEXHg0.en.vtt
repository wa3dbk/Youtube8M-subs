00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.399
 of the king welcome to the last video that 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.110
 I do it alone in this back market 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.180
 Wonder action traffic are the truth 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.340

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.840

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.820
 to your report I that you are working 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.980
 in a new graphic hole the successor 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.690
 of a kid thought a more magazine 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.490
 simply from the one you said for the 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.140
 pines is what has still given in 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.370
 vanderlei magazines confirming that 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.070
 is working on a new album 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.660
 confirmed for 2015 so I do not 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.670
 tempts to take music you want to like ya 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.140
 I said with producer Mark Ronson how 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.570
 a new guest in the production 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.160
 because the team that the remainder is the 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.750
 team that has collaborated with him andrew 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.130
 in his previous albums and he said 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.570
 have many pains to leave behind their 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.579
 workers that seems a discazo 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.020
 that he thinks is his best work and that 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.670
 It is very sad to leave behind that sound 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.110
 but that you buy it so you want 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.480
 do new things but they were little more 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.430
 with jazz with the purest sun so 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.630
 maybe the next job but nothing that 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.550
 see with this style a little more I think that 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.590
 him and me that I'm not a kid chase 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.590
 with rock soul jazz 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.110
 I will know one of the songs that 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.120
 they would be within the radius they choose is already 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.100
 a man thought that a woman is not a 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.350
 best man models bootboats is a 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.850
 producer who has given the sniper the wave 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.460
 for life but is that in addition to this 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.810
 after launching several ultras have been 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.120
 started recording songs of desire 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.070
 to laugh like they are the titles that will leave 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.560
 that low managed to say all know here 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.220
