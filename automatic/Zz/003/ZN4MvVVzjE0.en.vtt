if you can get a good solid hole to it
you<00:02:13.920> can<00:02:14.100> split<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.460> nut<00:02:14.820> with<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.120> chisel<00:02:16.760> you

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
you can split that nut with a chisel you

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.670 
you can split that nut with a chisel you
can<00:02:17.910> heat<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.120> up<00:02:18.330> as<00:02:18.600> we<00:02:18.870> said<00:02:19.080> that's<00:02:19.260> that's

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
can heat it up as we said that's that's

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.770 
can heat it up as we said that's that's
another<00:02:19.920> item<00:02:20.160> but<00:02:20.820> what<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.000> prefer<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.600> do

another item but what I prefer to do
when<00:02:22.020> I've<00:02:22.140> got<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.350> situation<00:02:22.620> like<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:23.900> is

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
when I've got a situation like this is

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.880 
when I've got a situation like this is
to<00:02:25.400> shock<00:02:26.400> open<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.300> in<00:02:28.050> these<00:02:28.230> cases<00:02:28.500> here

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
to shock open it and in these cases here

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.350 
to shock open it and in these cases here
it'll<00:02:29.070> just<00:02:29.130> be<00:02:29.460> somebody's<00:02:29.880> tightened<00:02:30.270> up

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
it'll just be somebody's tightened up

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.510 
it'll just be somebody's tightened up
very<00:02:30.630> tight<00:02:30.900> may<00:02:31.590> have<00:02:31.710> shrunk<00:02:31.890> up<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.250> little

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
very tight may have shrunk up a little

bit and so forth so the method that I
use<00:02:35.690> let's<00:02:36.690> say<00:02:36.780> we've<00:02:37.020> got<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.200> nut<00:02:37.790> this<00:02:38.790> is

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
use let's say we've got a nut this is

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.330 
use let's say we've got a nut this is
for<00:02:39.150> Toby<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:39.930> particular<00:02:40.230> we've<00:02:40.710> got<00:02:40.860> we've

for Toby in particular we've got we've
got<00:02:41.370> this<00:02:41.670> nut<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.780> I'll<00:02:43.050> just<00:02:43.200> put<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.440> down

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
got this nut and I'll just put that down

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.580 
got this nut and I'll just put that down
there<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.910> we'll<00:02:45.150> paint<00:02:45.810> in<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.080> bit<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.350> see

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
there and we'll paint in a bit and see

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.120 
there and we'll paint in a bit and see
if<00:02:46.620> we<00:02:46.800> can<00:02:48.110> we<00:02:49.110> can<00:02:49.290> see<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.650> little<00:02:49.770> bit

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
if we can we can see this a little bit

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.590 
if we can we can see this a little bit
better<00:02:50.310> without<00:02:50.580> that<00:02:50.730> background<00:02:51.420> either

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
better without that background either

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.910 
better without that background either
fearing<00:02:52.050> too<00:02:52.230> much<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:54.360> I'll<00:02:55.350> endeavour<00:02:55.800> to

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
fearing too much and I'll endeavour to

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.220 
fearing too much and I'll endeavour to
show<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:57.440> one<00:02:58.440> thing<00:02:58.680> so<00:02:59.570> the<00:03:00.570> method<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.020> like

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
show you one thing so the method I like

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.870 
show you one thing so the method I like
to<00:03:01.410> use<00:03:02.570> use<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.600> hammer<00:03:03.930> or<00:03:04.830> use<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.310> block<00:03:05.700> of

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
to use use a hammer or use a block of

to use use a hammer or use a block of
steel<00:03:07.040> but<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:09.150> idea<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:10.410> shock<00:03:10.890> open

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
steel but the the idea is to shock open

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.840 
steel but the the idea is to shock open
than<00:03:13.410> that<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:14.370> this<00:03:15.180> one<00:03:15.390> here<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:16.640> is<00:03:17.640> the

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
than that and this one here is a is the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.240 
than that and this one here is a is the
right<00:03:18.000> hand<00:03:18.300> nut<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.930> what<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.770> need<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.100> do

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
right hand nut and what you need to do

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.380 
right hand nut and what you need to do
is<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.520> have<00:03:21.200> something<00:03:22.200> really<00:03:22.440> solid<00:03:22.770> behind

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
is to have something really solid behind

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.210 
is to have something really solid behind
preferably<00:03:24.390> with<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.720> flat<00:03:25.020> surface<00:03:25.320> but<00:03:25.710> it

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
preferably with a flat surface but it

to strike the flat slightly off the flat
to<00:03:38.340> be<00:03:38.520> able<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.880> open<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.660> up<00:03:39.810> so<00:03:39.870> if<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:40.320> were<00:03:40.380> to

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
to be able to open it up so if I were to

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.830 
to be able to open it up so if I were to
hold<00:03:40.710> that<00:03:40.910> straight<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.720> hit<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:43.020> here

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
hold that straight and to hit it here

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.080 
hold that straight and to hit it here
that<00:03:45.840> will<00:03:46.050> spin<00:03:46.290> off<00:03:46.350> that<00:03:46.740> nut<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.880> same

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
that will spin off that nut and the same

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.320 
that will spin off that nut and the same
thing<00:03:48.660> he<00:03:48.870> could<00:03:49.050> do<00:03:49.230> here<00:03:50.070> with<00:03:50.340> this<00:03:50.459> one<00:03:50.760> if

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
thing he could do here with this one if

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.940 
thing he could do here with this one if
you<00:03:51.450> have<00:03:51.570> to<00:03:51.660> put<00:03:51.870> something<00:03:52.110> in<00:03:52.350> behind<00:03:52.740> it

you have to put something in behind it

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.930 
you have to put something in behind it
and<00:03:53.209> strike<00:03:54.209> it<00:03:54.650> so<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.709> can<00:03:56.040> use<00:03:56.250> piece<00:03:56.760> of

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
and strike it so you can use piece of

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.190 
and strike it so you can use piece of
steel<00:03:57.180> or<00:03:57.540> whatever<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.560> what<00:03:59.550> you're<00:03:59.700> doing

ensue from getting close here what we're
trying<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.630> do<00:04:03.840> is<00:04:04.760> to<00:04:05.760> strike<00:04:06.240> that<00:04:06.510> flat<00:04:06.900> just

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
trying to do is to strike that flat just

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.130 
trying to do is to strike that flat just
off<00:04:08.420> in<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.720> direction<00:04:09.900> we<00:04:10.320> want<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.590> open<00:04:10.980> it

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
off in the direction we want to open it

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.199 
off in the direction we want to open it
just<00:04:13.140> like<00:04:13.709> it<00:04:13.860> there<00:04:14.070> but<00:04:14.700> hold<00:04:14.910> it<00:04:15.060> you're

use this method a long long time ago for

they're<00:04:58.300> nuts<00:04:58.479> or<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:58.900> studs<00:04:59.169> they<00:04:59.860> just

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
they're nuts or the studs they just

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.710 
they're nuts or the studs they just
could<00:05:00.280> not<00:05:00.430> remove<00:05:00.909> that<00:05:00.940> couldn't<00:05:01.419> move<00:05:01.569> it

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
could not remove that couldn't move it

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.040 
could not remove that couldn't move it
we<00:05:01.840> couldn't<00:05:02.080> apply<00:05:02.560> heat<00:05:03.180> and<00:05:04.180> so<00:05:04.479> I<00:05:04.690> would

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
we couldn't apply heat and so I would

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.649 
we couldn't apply heat and so I would
hit<00:05:05.229> do<00:05:05.919> that<00:05:06.159> and<00:05:06.400> shock<00:05:07.030> them<00:05:07.270> and<00:05:07.419> work<00:05:07.630> them

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:07.659 
hit do that and shock them and work them

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:11.240 
hit do that and shock them and work them
and<00:05:08.139> then<00:05:08.470> spin<00:05:08.830> those<00:05:09.009> nuts<00:05:09.340> off<00:05:09.550> and<00:05:10.229> so

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
and then spin those nuts off and so

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.960 
and then spin those nuts off and so
that's<00:05:13.620> this<00:05:14.620> this<00:05:15.009> little<00:05:15.190> one<00:05:15.460> this<00:05:15.729> little

heat and have done damage because it's

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.800 
heat and have done damage because it's
extremely<00:05:38.349> difficult<00:05:38.680> to<00:05:39.130> apply<00:05:39.880> very

without<00:05:44.110> something<00:05:44.490> without<00:05:45.490> ever<00:05:46.060> they're

it and all these things that people
don't<00:05:50.710> normally<00:05:50.919> have<00:05:51.280> and<00:05:51.550> so<00:05:52.150> the<00:05:52.300> heat<00:05:52.449> goes

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
don't normally have and so the heat goes

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.480 
don't normally have and so the heat goes
everywhere<00:05:53.259> but<00:05:53.469> where<00:05:53.680> you<00:05:53.800> really<00:05:54.190> want<00:05:54.370> it
