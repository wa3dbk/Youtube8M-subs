00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.190 

and<00:02:03.820> actually<00:02:04.149> do<00:02:04.299> a<00:02:04.330> real<00:02:04.539> good<00:02:04.570> job<00:02:04.750> on<00:02:05.110> the

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
and actually do a real good job on the

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:15.630 
and actually do a real good job on the
mud<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:14.200> front<00:02:14.530> was<00:02:14.680> just<00:02:14.860> torsion<00:02:15.220> twists<00:02:15.459> on

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
mud the front was just torsion twists on

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.930 
mud the front was just torsion twists on
the<00:02:16.120> back<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.630> have<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:17.170> bigger<00:02:17.350> shackles

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
the back I have the bigger shackles

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.809 
the back I have the bigger shackles
they<00:02:19.540> are<00:02:19.690> right<00:02:20.050> there

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.289 

I<00:02:27.950> like<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.069> way<00:02:29.159> it<00:02:29.280> loads<00:02:29.489> on<00:02:29.609> the<00:02:29.639> back<00:02:29.909> it's

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
I like the way it loads on the back it's

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.670 
I like the way it loads on the back it's
actually<00:02:30.420> popping<00:02:30.930> out<00:02:31.049> a<00:02:31.170> little<00:02:31.379> bit

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
actually popping out a little bit

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.819 
actually popping out a little bit
it's<00:02:31.799> a<00:02:31.889> 3.75<00:02:32.760> backspacing<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:34.469> then<00:02:34.680> it

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
it's a 3.75 backspacing so then it

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:39.970 
it's a 3.75 backspacing so then it
actually<00:02:34.950> throws<00:02:35.219> it<00:02:35.459> out<00:02:35.609> a<00:02:35.639> little<00:02:35.879> bit

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:56.610 

little<00:02:40.980> aggressive<00:02:41.310> stands<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.819> gives<00:02:41.969> it

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.380 

cars<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.400> then<00:02:57.519> hop<00:02:57.760> in<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.090> let<00:02:58.180> me<00:02:58.209> go

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
cars and then hop in and let me go

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.449 
cars and then hop in and let me go
further<00:02:58.629> back<00:02:58.989> there<00:02:59.260> see<00:03:00.040> if<00:03:00.129> I<00:03:00.220> find

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
further back there see if I find

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:09.330 
further back there see if I find
anything<00:03:00.760> interesting

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.190 

all<00:03:10.340> those<00:03:10.549> tracks<00:03:10.879> are<00:03:11.000> mine<00:03:11.239> I<00:03:11.540> did<00:03:11.989> him<00:03:12.079> with

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
all those tracks are mine I did him with

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.800 
all those tracks are mine I did him with
these<00:03:12.379> tires<00:03:12.939> back<00:03:13.939> when<00:03:14.090> it<00:03:14.180> was<00:03:14.209> kind<00:03:14.719> of

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
these tires back when it was kind of

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:23.490 
these tires back when it was kind of
muddy<00:03:17.439> so<00:03:18.439> let's<00:03:18.620> go<00:03:18.739> ahead<00:03:18.829> and<00:03:18.950> see

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.820 

all<00:03:24.100> those<00:03:24.340> tracks<00:03:24.610> are<00:03:24.730> mine<00:03:25.420> these<00:03:26.290> Kenda's

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
all those tracks are mine these Kenda's

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:46.120 
all those tracks are mine these Kenda's
are<00:03:27.760> pretty<00:03:28.060> good<00:03:28.270> on<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.450> mud

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.940 

it's<00:03:47.130> not<00:03:47.280> much<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:47.640> big<00:03:47.880> mud<00:03:48.209> spot<00:03:48.830> but<00:03:49.830> it's

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
it's not much of a big mud spot but it's

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.640 
it's not much of a big mud spot but it's
secluded<00:03:50.220> it's<00:03:51.110> outside<00:03:52.110> of<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.349> city<00:03:52.590> limits

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
secluded it's outside of the city limits

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.860 
secluded it's outside of the city limits
so<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.819> can<00:03:53.940> pretty<00:03:54.090> much<00:03:54.209> do<00:03:54.450> whatever<00:03:54.599> we

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
so you can pretty much do whatever we

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.620 
so you can pretty much do whatever we
want<00:03:55.110> here<00:03:55.319> and<00:03:56.010> not<00:03:57.000> many<00:03:57.180> people<00:03:57.239> know<00:03:57.510> about

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
want here and not many people know about

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.089 
want here and not many people know about
it<00:03:57.900> so<00:03:58.080> that's<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.349> best<00:03:58.590> thing<00:03:58.739> about<00:03:58.860> it

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
it so that's the best thing about it

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.100 
it so that's the best thing about it
when<00:03:59.580> it<00:03:59.700> rains<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.269> see<00:04:00.690> all<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.870> tracks

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
when it rains you see all the tracks

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.550 
when it rains you see all the tracks
there

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560
