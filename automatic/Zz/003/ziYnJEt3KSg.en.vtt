an<00:00:58.570> auto<00:00:59.170> focus<00:01:00.059> illumination<00:01:01.059> light<00:01:01.299> on<00:01:01.600> our

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
an auto focus illumination light on our

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.009 
an auto focus illumination light on our
transmitter<00:01:03.250> I<00:01:03.580> thought<00:01:04.449> that<00:01:04.690> was<00:01:04.809> pretty

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
transmitter I thought that was pretty

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.480 
transmitter I thought that was pretty
cool<00:01:05.409> but<00:01:06.070> it<00:01:06.549> gets<00:01:06.729> better<00:01:07.000> watch<00:01:07.810> this<00:01:08.320> if<00:01:09.190> I

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
cool but it gets better watch this if I

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.630 
cool but it gets better watch this if I
switch<00:01:09.850> on<00:01:10.060> my<00:01:10.900> speed<00:01:11.260> light<00:01:11.530> okay

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
switch on my speed light okay

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.749 
switch on my speed light okay
look<00:01:13.030> at<00:01:13.270> that<00:01:13.479> YouTube<00:01:14.140> we<00:01:14.710> have<00:01:15.070> an<00:01:15.460> auto

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
look at that YouTube we have an auto

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.330 
look at that YouTube we have an auto
focus<00:01:16.420> light<00:01:16.719> on<00:01:16.990> our<00:01:17.350> speed<00:01:17.649> light<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.219> it's

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
focus light on our speed light and it's

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.179 
focus light on our speed light and it's
all<00:01:18.520> been<00:01:18.729> done<00:01:18.939> wirelessly<00:01:19.450> I<00:01:20.140> thought<00:01:21.009> that

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
all been done wirelessly I thought that

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:22.289 
all been done wirelessly I thought that
was<00:01:21.430> fantastic

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
was fantastic

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.510 
was fantastic
well<00:01:22.570> done<00:01:22.899> pixel<00:01:23.759> okay<00:01:25.079> moving<00:01:26.079> on<00:01:26.310> pixel<00:01:27.310> has

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
well done pixel okay moving on pixel has

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.359 
well done pixel okay moving on pixel has
installed<00:01:28.450> these<00:01:28.659> little<00:01:29.200> grooves<00:01:29.560> here<00:01:30.189> on

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
installed these little grooves here on

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.090 
installed these little grooves here on
the<00:01:30.729> locking<00:01:31.000> ring<00:01:31.270> and<00:01:31.869> that<00:01:32.079> makes<00:01:32.409> our<00:01:32.710> job

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
the locking ring and that makes our job

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.459 
the locking ring and that makes our job
a<00:01:33.369> whole<00:01:33.399> lot<00:01:33.609> easier<00:01:33.820> of<00:01:34.689> getting<00:01:35.350> the

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469 
a whole lot easier of getting the

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.480 
a whole lot easier of getting the
transmitter<00:01:36.159> on<00:01:36.609> and<00:01:37.329> off<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:38.409> camera<00:01:38.859> on<00:01:39.100> the

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
transmitter on and off the camera on the

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.419 
transmitter on and off the camera on the
bishop's<00:01:39.969> if<00:01:40.240> you<00:01:40.600> screw<00:01:41.560> that<00:01:41.770> up<00:01:41.829> too<00:01:42.070> tight

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
bishop's if you screw that up too tight

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.249 
bishop's if you screw that up too tight
that<00:01:42.759> was<00:01:42.850> a<00:01:42.880> pin<00:01:43.270> getting<00:01:43.659> off<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:44.109> know

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
that was a pin getting off you know

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.889 
that was a pin getting off you know
because<00:01:44.619> you<00:01:45.549> couldn't<00:01:45.880> get<00:01:46.119> a<00:01:46.179> great<00:01:46.539> band

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
because you couldn't get a great band

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.039 
because you couldn't get a great band
but<00:01:47.710> now<00:01:48.009> it's<00:01:48.399> fixed<00:01:48.939> well<00:01:49.210> done<00:01:49.539> picks<00:01:49.840> up

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
but now it's fixed well done picks up

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:56.160 
but now it's fixed well done picks up
not<00:01:50.799> only<00:01:50.829> that<00:01:51.310> pixel<00:01:51.939> is<00:01:52.229> installed<00:01:54.810> here<00:01:55.810> a

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
not only that pixel is installed here a

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.309 
not only that pixel is installed here a
little<00:01:57.159> locking<00:01:57.579> pin<00:01:57.850> on<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.390> receiver<00:01:58.810> of

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
little locking pin on the receiver of

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:06.510 
little locking pin on the receiver of
the<00:02:00.929> King<00:02:01.929> which<00:02:02.679> you<00:02:03.399> know<00:02:03.549> I<00:02:04.350> noticed<00:02:05.520> don't

shoot<00:02:20.049> is<00:02:20.230> we<00:02:20.500> can't<00:02:20.860> control<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:22.390> speed

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
shoot is we can't control this speed

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.900 
shoot is we can't control this speed
light<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.440> way<00:02:23.560> we<00:02:24.040> thought<00:02:24.340> we<00:02:24.580> could

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
light the way we thought we could

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.990 
light the way we thought we could
for<00:02:25.180> what<00:02:25.510> we<00:02:25.870> basically<00:02:26.170> thought<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:27.700> we

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
for what we basically thought that we

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.090 
for what we basically thought that we
could<00:02:28.240> control<00:02:28.690> or<00:02:29.200> speed<00:02:30.130> like<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.810> speedlight

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
could control or speed like a speedlight

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.770 
could control or speed like a speedlight
like<00:02:33.100> we<00:02:33.370> can<00:02:33.610> with<00:02:33.820> a<00:02:33.850> Nick<00:02:34.120> on<00:02:34.270> creative

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
like we can with a Nick on creative

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.380 
like we can with a Nick on creative
lighting<00:02:34.990> system<00:02:35.560> that<00:02:35.770> is<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.430> say<00:02:36.640> commander

lighting system that is to say commander

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.430 
lighting system that is to say commander
mode<00:02:37.630> we<00:02:38.320> thought<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:39.460> the<00:02:39.850> pixel<00:02:40.300> King<00:02:40.600> was

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
mode we thought that the pixel King was

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.960 
mode we thought that the pixel King was
going<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.770> give<00:02:41.890> us<00:02:42.130> like<00:02:42.340> some<00:02:42.610> form<00:02:42.850> of

so if I change my hair so Jim 1000 have

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.060 
so if I change my hair so Jim 1000 have
moved<00:05:49.990> GIS<00:05:50.710> or<00:05:50.920> 1000<00:05:51.790> if<00:05:52.600> I<00:05:52.810> change<00:05:53.200> it<00:05:53.470> a<00:05:53.680> bath

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
moved GIS or 1000 if I change it a bath

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:00.680 
moved GIS or 1000 if I change it a bath
dying<00:05:54.540> C<00:05:55.540> is<00:05:56.200> all<00:05:56.590> 400<00:05:57.280> and<00:05:57.490> back<00:05:58.030> on<00:05:58.270> ISO<00:05:58.960> 400

dying C is all 400 and back on ISO 400

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.780 
dying C is all 400 and back on ISO 400
another<00:06:01.690> thing<00:06:01.990> of<00:06:02.170> what<00:06:03.270> pixel<00:06:04.270> has<00:06:04.600> done<00:06:04.960> his

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
another thing of what pixel has done his

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.780 
another thing of what pixel has done his
they've<00:06:06.790> done<00:06:06.970> a<00:06:07.000> slow<00:06:07.300> setting<00:06:07.750> where<00:06:08.790> where

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
they've done a slow setting where where

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.110 
they've done a slow setting where where
the<00:06:10.030> focal<00:06:10.450> length<00:06:10.480> you<00:06:11.020> moved<00:06:11.260> she<00:06:11.740> so<00:06:12.700> does

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
the focal length you moved she so does

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.880 
the focal length you moved she so does
your<00:06:13.450> speed<00:06:13.660> light<00:06:13.930> so<00:06:14.320> I'm<00:06:14.440> currently<00:06:14.650> on

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
your speed light so I'm currently on

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.210 
your speed light so I'm currently on
eighty<00:06:15.550> millimeters<00:06:16.510> of<00:06:16.780> a<00:06:17.380> focal<00:06:17.770> length<00:06:17.800> for

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
eighty millimeters of a focal length for

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:24.810 
eighty millimeters of a focal length for
changed<00:06:18.970> that<00:06:19.270> I<00:06:20.910> am<00:06:21.910> not<00:06:23.070> on<00:06:24.070> the<00:06:24.490> focal

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
changed that I am not on the focal

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.270 
changed that I am not on the focal
lengths<00:06:24.970> of<00:06:25.150> 38<00:06:25.360> millimeters<00:06:26.290> for<00:06:26.890> changed

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
lengths of 38 millimeters for changed

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.120 
lengths of 38 millimeters for changed
out<00:06:27.460> again<00:06:27.880> I<00:06:29.460> wanna<00:06:30.820> out<00:06:30.940> 452<00:06:31.690> and

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
out again I wanna out 452 and

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.390 
out again I wanna out 452 and
went<00:06:33.130> back<00:06:33.340> dying<00:06:33.760> to<00:06:34.300> ear<00:06:34.570> team<00:06:34.950> and<00:06:35.950> there<00:06:36.310> we

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
went back dying to ear team and there we

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.650 
went back dying to ear team and there we
go<00:06:36.550> we're<00:06:37.000> back<00:06:37.270> at<00:06:37.510> the<00:06:37.630> 18<00:06:38.730> if<00:06:39.730> I<00:06:40.240> change<00:06:40.570> my

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
go we're back at the 18 if I change my

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.720 
go we're back at the 18 if I change my
exposure<00:06:41.530> value<00:06:43.440> there<00:06:44.440> we<00:06:44.560> go<00:06:44.740> we<00:06:45.580> don't

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.730 
exposure value there we go we don't

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.500 
exposure value there we go we don't
actually<00:06:46.030> see<00:06:46.240> this<00:06:46.690> change<00:06:47.110> on<00:06:48.240> the<00:06:49.240> speed

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
actually see this change on the speed

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.700 
actually see this change on the speed
light

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710 
light

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.660 
light
so<00:06:51.710> if<00:06:52.220> I<00:06:52.700> move<00:06:52.940> it<00:06:53.210> again

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:54.670 
so if I move it again

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.320 
so if I move it again
going<00:06:55.670> to<00:06:55.820> mitosis<00:06:57.370> again<00:06:58.370> we<00:06:58.850> don't<00:06:59.030> actually

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
going to mitosis again we don't actually

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.480 
going to mitosis again we don't actually
see<00:06:59.570> that<00:07:00.050> changing<00:07:00.800> on<00:07:00.920> the<00:07:01.010> speed<00:07:01.250> lights

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490 
see that changing on the speed lights

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.080 
see that changing on the speed lights
however<00:07:02.060> what<00:07:02.510> we<00:07:02.630> do<00:07:02.810> see<00:07:03.140> changing<00:07:03.830> is<00:07:04.090> our

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.090 
however what we do see changing is our

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:11.530 
however what we do see changing is our
meters<00:07:06.050> of<00:07:07.900> defective<00:07:08.900> flight<00:07:09.380> range<00:07:10.540> so

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:11.540 
meters of defective flight range so

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.710 
meters of defective flight range so
vehicle<00:07:11.930> usually<00:07:12.080> does<00:07:12.530> basically<00:07:13.660> how<00:07:14.660> the

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 
vehicle usually does basically how the

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.110 
vehicle usually does basically how the
pickle<00:07:15.260> king<00:07:15.530> does<00:07:15.950> communicate<00:07:16.700> with

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 
pickle king does communicate with

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:26.050 
pickle king does communicate with
there's<00:07:17.390> be<00:07:17.630> 900
