 director of the company your body in this video 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.330
 I will demonstrate the work of the machine in 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.040
 semi-automatic mode detail which 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.420
 we will manufacture called 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.090
 valve and iris cool 4 grams time 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.710
 Exposure 11 seconds task set 5 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.920
 products temperature on the first two 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.800
 temperature contours better not set 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.780
 it provides very high 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.030
 improved molten propelling 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.899
 of the material 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.899
 juice material polypropylene 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.100
 semiautomatic mode is completely 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.410
 automatic mode with one 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.780
 feature he pauses after 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:57.910
 each cycle 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.270
 today we will pour pensions like this 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.730
 wind 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.910
 we use the composition of our ride under 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.340
 clamps 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.800
 why was the machine automatic 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.800
 very handy when you pour mortgages 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.270
 this workpiece for the valve is galvanized 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.060
 stud with drilled hole and 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.920
 inserted in a short piece of wire 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.920
 in order to eliminate turning 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:35.360
 insert our workpiece 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:47.270
 visually convinced that all is well and 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:47.270
 push the form going on happening 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.939
 holding time 1 second suppression 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.710
 with 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.140
 received in the neck of the case 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.550
 take the next billet 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.480
 when working in semi-automatic mode 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.090
 you can press as start button which 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.260
 should to the right of the panels and start 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.260
 which is on the panel itself 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.860
 as you see on the counter costs 0 5 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.250
 valve is made 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.250
 task completed 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.270
