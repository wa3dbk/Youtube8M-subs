00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
plan on doing Celestia or Luna because

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.550 
plan on doing Celestia or Luna because
that's<00:02:00.030> very<00:02:00.450> cliche<00:02:00.840> at<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.079> moment<00:02:01.229> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
that's very cliche at this moment and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.020 
that's very cliche at this moment and
there's<00:02:02.040> no<00:02:02.100> point<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.430> doing<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.700> because<00:02:02.850> I

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
there's no point in doing that because I

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.830 
there's no point in doing that because I
have<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> feeling<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.659> beat<00:02:03.750> all

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
to use this as kind of a way to hate the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.550
