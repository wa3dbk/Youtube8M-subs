level<00:00:27.779> laser<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.369> red<00:00:29.760> light<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.240> you

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
level laser it's a red light that you

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.080 
level laser it's a red light that you
can<00:00:30.510> actually<00:00:30.660> see<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.349> lighting<00:00:32.009> up<00:00:32.160> here<00:00:32.489> it's

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
can actually see a lighting up here it's

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.209 
can actually see a lighting up here it's
painless<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:34.170> for<00:00:34.590> body<00:00:35.040> lipo<00:00:35.790> sculpting

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
painless it's for body lipo sculpting

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.889 
painless it's for body lipo sculpting
and<00:00:38.219> what<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.550> actually<00:00:38.790> going<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.420> with<00:00:39.719> this

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
and what is actually going on with this

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.389 
and what is actually going on with this
light<00:00:40.350> but<00:00:40.530> we've<00:00:40.649> seen<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> lot<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.040> different

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
light but we've seen a lot of different

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.520 
light but we've seen a lot of different
kinds<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.879> lipos<00:00:42.780> out<00:00:43.020> there<00:00:43.230> different

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
kinds of lipos out there different

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.650 
kinds of lipos out there different
lasers<00:00:43.980> how<00:00:44.489> does<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.850> work<00:00:45.090> how<00:00:45.360> does<00:00:45.539> it

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
lasers how does this work how does it

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.630 
lasers how does this work how does it
differ<00:00:45.840> from<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.379> others<00:00:46.649> yeah<00:00:46.920> there<00:00:47.160> it's

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
differ from the others yeah there it's

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.940 
differ from the others yeah there it's
been<00:00:47.940> around<00:00:48.239> for<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> number<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:49.110> years<00:00:49.230> now<00:00:49.530> I

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
been around for a number of years now I

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.119 
been around for a number of years now I
mean<00:00:50.190> there<00:00:50.370> are<00:00:50.550> other<00:00:52.579> similar<00:00:53.579> wavelength

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
mean there are other similar wavelength

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.889 
mean there are other similar wavelength
machines<00:00:56.129> or<00:00:56.430> lasers<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.850> deliver<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.690> same

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
machines or lasers that deliver the same

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.260 
machines or lasers that deliver the same
thing<00:00:58.230> one<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.010> I'll<00:00:59.340> just<00:00:59.550> mention<00:00:59.760> a<00:01:00.000> trade

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
thing one and I'll just mention a trade

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.970 
thing one and I'll just mention a trade
name<00:01:00.300> because<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:00.930> well<00:01:01.199> known<00:01:01.410> as<00:01:01.620> orona

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
name because it's well known as orona

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.549 
name because it's well known as orona
huh<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:03.300> functions<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.049> different<00:01:04.379> way

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
huh and it functions in a different way

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.920 
huh and it functions in a different way
however<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.519> think<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.850> has<00:01:06.090> some<00:01:06.330> advantages

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
however I think this has some advantages

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.670 
however I think this has some advantages
because<00:01:07.200> you're<00:01:08.130> applying<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.880> laser<00:01:09.180> light

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
because you're applying the laser light

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.850 
because you're applying the laser light
the<00:01:10.680> diodes<00:01:11.189> directly<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.420> skin<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.049> when

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
the diodes directly to the skin and when

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.190 
the diodes directly to the skin and when
will<00:01:14.070> pan<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.909> you'll<00:01:15.150> see<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.630> you

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
will pan on this you'll see that you

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.240 
will pan on this you'll see that you
have<00:01:16.470> thirty<00:01:17.100> six<00:01:17.580> separate<00:01:18.119> laser<00:01:18.479> diodes

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
have thirty six separate laser diodes

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.800 
have thirty six separate laser diodes
working<00:01:20.250> right<00:01:20.490> through<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.939> skin<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
working right through the skin on the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.050 
working right through the skin on the
fat<00:01:22.020> cells<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:22.890> are<00:01:22.979> they<00:01:23.100> doing<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.759> fat

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
fat cells what are they doing to the fat

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.820 
fat cells what are they doing to the fat
cells<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.479> fat<00:01:24.689> cells<00:01:25.020> are<00:01:25.290> like<00:01:25.470> little

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
cells the fat cells are like little

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.530 
cells the fat cells are like little
globules<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:27.110> clusters<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.140> grapes<00:01:28.439> and

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
globules of clusters of grapes and

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.679 
globules of clusters of grapes and
really<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:31.350> laser<00:01:31.740> light<00:01:32.189> without<00:01:33.119> emitting

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
really this laser light without emitting

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.530 
really this laser light without emitting
heat<00:01:34.229> or<00:01:34.799> causing<00:01:35.369> pain<00:01:35.579> or<00:01:35.880> any<00:01:36.030> damage<00:01:36.509> to

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
heat or causing pain or any damage to

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.440 
heat or causing pain or any damage to
the<00:01:36.840> skin<00:01:37.220> changes<00:01:38.220> those<00:01:38.490> fat<00:01:38.729> cells<00:01:38.759> it

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
the skin changes those fat cells it

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.530 
the skin changes those fat cells it
breaks<00:01:40.140> down<00:01:40.579> triglycerides<00:01:41.579> into<00:01:42.240> free

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
breaks down triglycerides into free

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.870 
breaks down triglycerides into free
fatty<00:01:42.780> acids<00:01:43.320> which<00:01:43.860> people<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.460> use<00:01:44.670> as

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
fatty acids which people can use as

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.590 
fatty acids which people can use as
energy<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.540> glycerol<00:01:46.040> now<00:01:47.090> why<00:01:48.090> does<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.450> do

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
energy and glycerol now why does it do

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.210 
energy and glycerol now why does it do
that<00:01:48.630> or<00:01:48.960> what<00:01:49.170> does<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.470> accomplish<00:01:49.619> well

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
that or what does that accomplish well

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.330 
that or what does that accomplish well
once<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.640> break<00:01:50.880> down<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.450> large<00:01:52.340> triglyceride

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
once you break down a large triglyceride

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.330 
once you break down a large triglyceride
molecule<00:01:54.140> into<00:01:55.140> these<00:01:55.290> smaller<00:01:55.710> molecules

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
molecule into these smaller molecules

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.490 
molecule into these smaller molecules
that<00:01:56.430> can<00:01:56.549> leak<00:01:56.820> out<00:01:57.060> through<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.509> cell<00:01:57.780> gets

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
that can leak out through the cell gets

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.999 
that can leak out through the cell gets
absorbed<00:01:58.799> by<00:01:59.280> your<00:01:59.310> lymphatics<00:02:00.180> and

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
absorbed by your lymphatics and

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.200 
absorbed by your lymphatics and
certainly<00:02:02.009> after<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.520> get<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:02.939> treatment

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
certainly after you get this treatment

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.010 
certainly after you get this treatment
you<00:02:03.509> see<00:02:03.719> immediate<00:02:04.350> reduction<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.810> one<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.960> a

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
you see immediate reduction of one and a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.650 
you see immediate reduction of one and a
half<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.500> two<00:02:07.710> inches<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:08.369> fat<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.330> see<00:02:09.509> that

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
half to two inches of fat you see that

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.839 
half to two inches of fat you see that
right<00:02:09.690> away<00:02:09.929> right<00:02:10.440> away<00:02:10.800> that's<00:02:11.340> incredible

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
right away right away that's incredible

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.370 
right away right away that's incredible
but<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.599> keep<00:02:12.930> it

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
but to keep it
