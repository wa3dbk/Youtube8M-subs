00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
presentable looking so this is like the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.959

quickest easiest my favorite look that I

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.060 
quickest easiest my favorite look that I
have<00:00:36.390> found<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.440> basically<00:00:37.649> what<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:37.980> do

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
have found and it's basically what I do

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.209 
have found and it's basically what I do
every<00:00:38.399> single<00:00:38.430> day<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:40.170> did<00:00:40.680> my<00:00:40.800> hair<00:00:41.040> like

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
every single day and I did my hair like

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.740 
every single day and I did my hair like
this<00:00:41.280> even<00:00:41.700> when<00:00:41.850> my<00:00:42.030> hair<00:00:42.210> was<00:00:42.239> really<00:00:42.570> long

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
this even when my hair was really long

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.150 
this even when my hair was really long
um<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.670> really<00:00:45.000> useful<00:00:45.989> technique<00:00:46.980> of

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
um so it's a really useful technique of

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.520 
um so it's a really useful technique of
curling<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.000> think<00:00:48.360> because<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.840> think<00:00:49.289> it

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
curling and I think because I think it

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.760 
curling and I think because I think it
looks<00:00:49.680> good<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:49.890> any<00:00:50.129> length<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.550> hair<00:00:50.760> and

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
looks good on any length of hair and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.290 
looks good on any length of hair and
it's<00:00:52.770> really<00:00:53.010> easy<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:54.090> doesn't<00:00:54.270> look

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
it's really easy and it doesn't look

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.180 
it's really easy and it doesn't look
like<00:00:54.420> you've<00:00:54.629> tried<00:00:54.870> too<00:00:55.110> hard<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.800> at<00:00:56.010> least

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
like you've tried too hard but at least

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.010 
like you've tried too hard but at least
