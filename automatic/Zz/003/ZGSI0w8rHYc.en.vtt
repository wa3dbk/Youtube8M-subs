through the arch but we'll see what

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.140 
through the arch but we'll see what
happens<00:01:03.840> at<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.739> moment<00:01:05.070> we've<00:01:05.280> got<00:01:05.309> the

sliding it on timber battles we're now

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.300 
sliding it on timber battles we're now
to<00:01:13.710> come<00:01:14.280> into<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> crucial<00:01:15.150> part<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:16.310> how

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
to come into the crucial part of how

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
to come into the crucial part of how
it's<00:01:17.520> going<00:01:18.229> down<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.470> steps<00:01:20.090> we've<00:01:21.090> got<00:01:21.240> the

it's going down the steps we've got the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.270 
it's going down the steps we've got the
border<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.200> edge<00:01:22.229> now<00:01:22.759> ready<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:24.030> go<00:01:24.960> and

border on the edge now ready to go and

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.350 
border on the edge now ready to go and
we're<00:01:26.280> hoping<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.090> slide

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
we're hoping that it's going to slide

we're hoping that it's going to slide
what<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.020> might<00:01:28.200> roll<00:01:28.500> if<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.700> rolls<00:01:30.229> this<00:01:31.229> is

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
what it might roll if it rolls this is

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.039 
what it might roll if it rolls this is
the<00:01:31.590> path<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.040> would<00:01:32.130> take<00:01:32.720> straight<00:01:33.720> into

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
the path that would take straight into

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:42.110 
the path that would take straight into
into<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.130> geraniums
