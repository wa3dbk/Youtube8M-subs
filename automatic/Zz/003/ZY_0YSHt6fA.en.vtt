00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.360
 and I told them how are I, I am blue 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.760
 gamer and bs day here back from 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.779
 the vacation was a long time 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:20.320
 long since I did not upload a video with 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.449
 content of gta 5 updated so that 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.920
 It turns out that yesterday I started watching videos and 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:29.080
 it turns out that there are new mods and hacks in 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.660
 the gta online but we'll talk about that 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.420
 more ahead because today 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.460
 I have a guest called key the very 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.710
 good to all of you some of you already 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.170
 they know and they have seen it in some videos 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.510
 previous but today I want 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.889
 together with him to make the opinions of 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:51.039
 what we see or what is my opinion 

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:53.620
 that rockstar is allowing the 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.749
 people are modifying the game to their 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.299
 craving good you are going to tell me what 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:00.940
 mods and sax have gotten it turns out that 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.809
 they have put animals that are supposed to 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.789
 animals 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.400
 I have inside we go out in the online 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.800
 they have gotten zombies 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.940
 I've got something that allows you to 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:16.120
 weapons have an impressive size have 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.510
 put that more than all the weapons 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.130
 shoot missiles like the rocket launcher 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.050
 that you can fly with cars and so on 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.030
 etcetera etcetera many many many 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.040
 things to the best and if I find myself 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.380
 some of them in a server because they 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.810
 recorded gameplays I show you but 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.250
 good the opinion of killer is very 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.920
 important to me so let's go to 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.690
 start first 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.330
 Well, not only what you said 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.270
 blues but I've also seen hacks like 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.890
 for example remove the water to the map or 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.560
 even put a kind of super 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.540
 tsunami that covers the entire water map 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.970
 not all and there would not be buildings and 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.310
 some mountains above and good those 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.800
 I would add to those that you said that in 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.770
 principle there are some like for example 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.540
 in which I'm mentioning that 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.340
 apparently they do not harm the game they do not harm 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.960
 the experience simply as they add 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.810
 more fun 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.520
 because changing things change us 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.380
 what has been normal for us 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.050
 we are used to playing in a 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.450
 way and that's because we change it 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.110
 to have new and new options 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.020
 ways to play but I think that to 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.110
 the long thing he does is that as soon as 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.550
 remove the hack makes the game the mode 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.800
 normal what we have been playing 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.850
 always do more boring since 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:37.440
 it no longer has those that additive component 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.790
 what are the hacks and modify the mods or 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.040
 modify the game in some way that 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.550
 I would call it both hacks and not so much more 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.600
 as a show or modifications of some 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.730
 aspect of the game but it is true that 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.590
 everything that by changing it at the beginning can 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.590
 be fun but in the long run you can 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.300
 do something boring like that and it's good 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.730
 you are going to tell me but blue is that 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.550
 they are modifying the game 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.730
 is cheating and all that ok I agree 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:10.090
 that there are we and sax that are to give 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.920
 advantage to the player but for example the 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.220
 of randomly bigger that same we are 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.019
 very interesting very very very funny the 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.099
 of which all weapons fire 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:23.910
 missiles I do not know is something very good and that 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:26.980
 I bet that if the gta goes out for pc 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.049
 you are going to put them mods until 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.319
 exploit the computer because because 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.000
 the mods put an extra to the game that 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.940
 if in itself the game is good with the 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.730
 mods are great is how you do not have 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.010
 the gta iv are playing campaign but not 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.650
 it's the same to play the campaign with 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:49.060
 franklin you can play with iron man 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.140
 or is it is something different to I do not know if I 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.599
 I can explain 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.370
 what I mean it should be 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.069
 rock star good rock star first 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.500
 It should go, we're going to look like everyone 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.060
 those mistakes all say those those 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.670
 parties quotes in which the engines 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.010
 can enter and can thanks to the code 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.069
 of the game to be able to modify things to their 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.230
 whim 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.889
 and they should do it because it's fair 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:16.519
 because it is normal not and what to do with 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:19.009
 the models and the hackers well they go 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:22.300
 hummer that is to handle us all or as 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:24.289
 can do it separate them not in 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.000
 servers different servers for 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:28.759
 cheaters and server for players 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.949
 legal to me does not affect me because I'm 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.419
 perfect that we have as long as not 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.550
 affect the game experience such and 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.039
 as qui says that maybe 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.990
 a guy comes and he throws me lasers 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.389
 then there is better than touching 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.599
 because because he has lasers and I 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.970
 not then so is basically the 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:49.050
 question or this would be the side my opinion 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.289
 principal 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.720
 you avoid avoid modifying the game 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.009
 if you can enjoy if they got a 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.259
 server and they gave them millions of 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:01.229
 united dollars you can do 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.819
 you can not take it off and enjoy the 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.129
 I play mainly and have fun 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.840
 for the end of the day for that are the 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:09.180
 video games then something you want 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.169
 add quiles if I would be I would add 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.180
 to that it is true that what they are all 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.490
 the hacks landmarks the mods so I know when 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.289
 there is a hacker in the game a person 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.819
 which is the one that carries all these 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.949
 characteristics of being able to launch 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:25.229
 rays in it in the event that it was 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.449
 the check also has to be 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:29.190
 invincible because they are things that 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.610
 They bother the game experience a lot 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:35.069
 but for example if you remove the water 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.110
 of the map and all the players of the 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:39.030
 server in the water removed that is in 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.550
 equal conditions for all of me 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.919
 I would only see everything wrong because it's like 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.530
 that nobody is fucking for nothing 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:49.379
 they are all there in the same 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.909
 conditions no one is more than anyone and not 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:52.949
 you can get angry because you are a 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:55.110
 hacker you killed me because I do not you 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:57.990
 I'm going to be because you're invincible 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.420
 that is, if we are all equal in that 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.340
 server there would be no problem in 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.800
 change yes there are problems when you 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.980
 an uncle enters who is invincible or who 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.500
 he launches missiles on his own that he can 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.870
 get to annoy the whole experience 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.490
 of game that is how it is and well then I here 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.980
 I say goodbye I hope you liked it 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.540
 you think that what they think 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.580
 you of the mods and that many have 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.980
 seen you guys call them attention 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.230
 I here say goodbye to the channel of who 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.790
 It is in the description so as we 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.650
 we see until next I am blue 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.120
 I hope you enjoyed it
