00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
and I this is fascinating I would ask

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.920 
and I this is fascinating I would ask
people<00:02:54.450> who<00:02:55.019> have<00:02:55.230> who<00:02:55.739> use<00:02:55.980> uber<00:02:56.370> frequently

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
people who have who use uber frequently

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.020 
people who have who use uber frequently
would<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.170> rather<00:02:58.350> have<00:02:58.739> no<00:02:59.610> one<00:02:59.850> in<00:03:00.000> that

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
would you rather have no one in that

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.979 
would you rather have no one in that
driver<00:03:00.450> seat<00:03:00.780> uh<00:03:01.410> as<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:03.090> know<00:03:03.150> consumer<00:03:03.840> as

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
driver seat uh as a you know consumer as

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.500 
driver seat uh as a you know consumer as
a<00:03:04.050> customer<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.860> know<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.640> CEO<00:03:06.120> would<00:03:06.300> rather

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
a customer I know the CEO would rather

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.210 
a customer I know the CEO would rather
have<00:03:06.750> no<00:03:06.930> one<00:03:07.050> in<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.200> driver<00:03:07.590> seat<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.100> know

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
have no one in that driver seat you know

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.130 
have no one in that driver seat you know
I<00:03:08.250> think<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.760> would<00:03:09.000> Louis<00:03:09.209> because<00:03:09.780> I've<00:03:09.930> had

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
I think I would Louis because I've had

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.250 
I think I would Louis because I've had
multiple<00:03:10.380> instances<00:03:11.130> with<00:03:11.640> uber<00:03:12.060> where<00:03:12.810> the

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
multiple instances with uber where the

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.970 
multiple instances with uber where the
driver<00:03:13.620> is<00:03:14.040> texting<00:03:14.970> where<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.959> driver<00:03:16.290> seems

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
driver is texting where the driver seems

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.440 
driver is texting where the driver seems
distracted<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.989> uh<00:03:18.989> uh<00:03:19.370> presumably<00:03:20.370> your<00:03:21.209> car

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
distracted and uh uh presumably your car

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.970 
distracted and uh uh presumably your car
is<00:03:21.630> not<00:03:21.780> going<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.079> be<00:03:22.200> texting<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.709> mean<00:03:22.860> it'll

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
is not going to be texting I mean it'll

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.380 
is not going to be texting I mean it'll
be<00:03:23.100> doing<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.370> whole<00:03:23.519> bunch<00:03:23.549> of<00:03:23.820> other<00:03:24.000> stuff<00:03:24.090> in

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
be doing a whole bunch of other stuff in

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.180 
be doing a whole bunch of other stuff in
the<00:03:24.480> background<00:03:24.660> its<00:03:25.079> algorithm<00:03:25.380> will<00:03:25.799> anyway

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
the background its algorithm will anyway

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.520 
the background its algorithm will anyway
but<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:27.239> think<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:27.720> this<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:28.079> that's<00:03:28.440> a

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
but I think that this is a that's a

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.680 
but I think that this is a that's a
really<00:03:28.799> good<00:03:28.890> point<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.519> imagine<00:03:30.269> if<00:03:30.570> you

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
really good point and imagine if you

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.660 
really good point and imagine if you
were<00:03:30.840> me<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.350> had<00:03:31.709> Newbridge<00:03:32.130> Iver<00:03:32.370> tell

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
were me and you had Newbridge Iver tell

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.860 
were me and you had Newbridge Iver tell
you<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:33.000> Donald<00:03:33.450> Trump<00:03:33.480> should<00:03:33.810> be

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
you that Donald Trump should be

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.979 
you that Donald Trump should be
President<00:03:34.040> David<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:36.150> mental<00:03:36.540> distress

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
President David the the mental distress

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.170 
President David the the mental distress
the<00:03:37.260> anguish<00:03:37.709> you<00:03:38.280> would<00:03:38.459> suffer<00:03:38.820> as<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:38.970> result

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
the anguish you would suffer as a result

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.440 
the anguish you would suffer as a result
of<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.930> think<00:03:40.799> that<00:03:41.130> no<00:03:41.430> driver<00:03:41.790> in<00:03:42.120> that

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
of that I think that no driver in that

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.690 
of that I think that no driver in that
seat<00:03:42.750> is<00:03:42.930> probably<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.769> best<00:03:44.100> possible

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
seat is probably that the best possible

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.090 
seat is probably that the best possible
outcome<00:03:45.000> here<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.690> big<00:03:45.930> takeaway<00:03:46.470> is<00:03:46.500> we<00:03:46.980> are

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
outcome here the big takeaway is we are

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.920 
outcome here the big takeaway is we are
much<00:03:47.310> closer<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.820> autonomous<00:03:48.570> vehicle

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
much closer to autonomous vehicle

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.810 
much closer to autonomous vehicle
technology<00:03:49.530> from<00:03:49.739> being<00:03:49.980> a<00:03:50.070> reality<00:03:50.250> than

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
technology from being a reality than

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.610 
technology from being a reality than
many<00:03:51.030> people<00:03:51.390> are<00:03:51.510> willing<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.840> admit<00:03:52.079> still

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
many people are willing to admit still

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.080 
many people are willing to admit still
lots<00:03:52.860> of<00:03:53.010> people<00:03:53.280> every<00:03:53.489> time<00:03:53.519> we<00:03:53.790> talk<00:03:53.940> about

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090
