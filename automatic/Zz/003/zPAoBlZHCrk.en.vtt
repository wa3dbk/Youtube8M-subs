00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.020 
don't want any of the paint to actually
go<00:01:57.930> into<00:01:58.110> brush<00:01:58.439> cleaner<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.979> once<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.880> sort

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
go into brush cleaner so once you sort

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.230 
go into brush cleaner so once you sort
of<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.210> enough<00:02:00.469> on<00:02:03.770> gribble<00:02:04.770> grid<00:02:04.920> off

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
of have enough on gribble grid off

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.830 
of have enough on gribble grid off
and<00:02:07.240> what<00:02:07.360> I<00:02:07.390> do<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.979> I<00:02:09.280> can<00:02:09.340> either<00:02:09.490> grab<00:02:09.840> just

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
and what I do is I can either grab just

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.170 
and what I do is I can either grab just
the<00:02:10.960> Genesis<00:02:11.440> min<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:13.120> just<00:02:13.630> work<00:02:13.810> your<00:02:13.960> way

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
the Genesis min and just work your way

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.160 
the Genesis min and just work your way
sort<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.240> mix<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.600> up<00:02:17.310> fresh<00:02:18.310> cleaner<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.930> try

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
sort of mix it up fresh cleaner and try

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.610 
sort of mix it up fresh cleaner and try
and<00:02:20.290> get<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.410> down<00:02:21.090> into<00:02:22.090> your<00:02:22.270> bristles<00:02:25.620> you

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
and get it down into your bristles you

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.410 
and get it down into your bristles you
can<00:02:26.800> see<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.130> color<00:02:27.340> coming<00:02:27.670> off<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.270> those

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
can see the color coming off and those

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.200 
can see the color coming off and those
bristles<00:02:29.160> going<00:02:30.160> back<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.760> their<00:02:30.910> natural

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
bristles going back to their natural

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:44.070 
bristles going back to their natural
color<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:33.250> just<00:02:33.280> keep<00:02:33.790> moving<00:02:34.120> it<00:02:34.150> around

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.740 

and<00:02:45.080> I'll<00:02:45.200> probably<00:02:45.380> do<00:02:45.680> this<00:02:45.890> maybe<00:02:46.630> two<00:02:47.630> or

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
and I'll probably do this maybe two or

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.000 
and I'll probably do this maybe two or
three<00:02:47.780> times<00:02:47.959> depending<00:02:48.319> on<00:02:48.620> how<00:02:48.709> dirty<00:02:48.770> my

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
three times depending on how dirty my

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.110 
three times depending on how dirty my
brushes<00:02:49.400> are<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:51.340> just<00:02:52.340> prolongs<00:02:52.760> our<00:02:52.940> life

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
brushes are that just prolongs our life

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.309 
brushes are that just prolongs our life
and<00:02:53.330> makes<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.750> bristles

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
and makes the bristles

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.550 
and makes the bristles
stand<00:02:55.069> back<00:02:55.250> on<00:02:55.430> in<00:02:55.580> so<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:55.849> get<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.209> nice

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
stand back on in so you get that nice

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.559 
stand back on in so you get that nice
effect<00:02:57.560> when<00:02:57.709> you're<00:02:58.150> bouncing<00:02:59.150> your<00:02:59.239> vinyl

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
effect when you're bouncing your vinyl

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.540 
effect when you're bouncing your vinyl
and<00:03:00.020> your<00:03:00.200> paint<00:03:02.709> scrape<00:03:03.709> all<00:03:03.860> that<00:03:03.890> off<00:03:04.100> and

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
and your paint scrape all that off and

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.850 
and your paint scrape all that off and
just<00:03:04.730> into<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.300> lid<00:03:08.380> now<00:03:09.380> this<00:03:09.650> isn't

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
just into the lid now this isn't

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.240 
just into the lid now this isn't
actually<00:03:10.870> too<00:03:11.870> dirty<00:03:12.140> or<00:03:12.500> got<00:03:12.830> too<00:03:12.950> much<00:03:13.040> paint

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
actually too dirty or got too much paint

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.820 
actually too dirty or got too much paint
you<00:03:13.400> can<00:03:13.519> actually<00:03:13.640> reuse<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:14.530> on<00:03:15.530> a<00:03:15.590> couple

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
you can actually reuse that on a couple

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.080 
you can actually reuse that on a couple
of<00:03:15.860> these<00:03:16.010> smaller<00:03:16.340> brushes<00:03:16.580> sort<00:03:16.910> of<00:03:16.970> Lucky

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
of these smaller brushes sort of Lucky

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:24.970 
of these smaller brushes sort of Lucky
fineliners<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:18.739> feel<00:03:18.890> bits<00:03:23.620> as<00:03:24.620> much<00:03:24.830> as

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
fineliners and you feel bits as much as

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.330 
fineliners and you feel bits as much as
that<00:03:25.220> oh<00:03:25.459> as<00:03:26.209> you<00:03:26.360> can<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:28.010> then<00:03:28.160> we're<00:03:28.250> gonna

go and rinse it in clean water and then

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.039 
go and rinse it in clean water and then
with<00:03:32.510> your<00:03:32.660> water<00:03:33.760> again

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
with your water again

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:45.240 
with your water again
you're<00:03:36.049> too<00:03:36.200> thick

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.350 

you<00:03:46.250> can<00:03:46.370> do<00:03:46.519> this<00:03:46.640> under<00:03:46.879> a<00:03:46.940> tap<00:03:47.120> if<00:03:47.239> you

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
you can do this under a tap if you

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.030 
you can do this under a tap if you
prefer<00:03:47.690> which<00:03:48.050> I<00:03:48.200> normally<00:03:48.560> do<00:03:48.709> I'm<00:03:48.860> just

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
prefer which I normally do I'm just

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.729 
prefer which I normally do I'm just
doing<00:03:49.370> it<00:03:49.459> in<00:03:49.489> a<00:03:49.580> bowl<00:03:49.700> just<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:50.030> show<00:03:50.209> you<00:03:50.269> guys

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
doing it in a bowl just to show you guys

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.770 
doing it in a bowl just to show you guys
but<00:03:51.739> um<00:03:52.060> make<00:03:53.060> sure<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:53.239> get<00:03:53.330> all<00:03:53.420> your<00:03:53.510> brush

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
but um make sure you get all your brush

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.949 
but um make sure you get all your brush
cleaner<00:03:54.050> out<00:03:54.290> you<00:03:54.709> can<00:03:54.830> sort<00:03:54.980> of<00:03:55.040> see<00:03:55.250> I<00:03:55.959> still

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
cleaner out you can sort of see I still

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:57.940 
cleaner out you can sort of see I still
get<00:03:57.080> a<00:03:57.110> little<00:03:57.170> bit<00:03:57.290> of<00:03:57.410> a<00:03:57.440> read<00:03:57.590> on<00:03:57.709> that<00:03:57.739> so

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
get a little bit of a read on that so

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.460 
get a little bit of a read on that so
I'll<00:03:58.040> probably<00:03:58.190> do<00:03:58.400> this<00:03:58.519> one<00:03:58.700> again<00:03:59.230> but<00:04:00.230> um

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
I'll probably do this one again but um

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.440 
I'll probably do this one again but um
that<00:04:00.980> once<00:04:01.519> it's<00:04:01.819> dry

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
that once it's dry

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.910 
that once it's dry
and<00:04:03.170> once<00:04:03.319> you've<00:04:03.440> got<00:04:03.560> all<00:04:03.620> your<00:04:03.739> brush

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
and once you've got all your brush

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.619 
and once you've got all your brush
cleaner<00:04:04.160> out<00:04:04.340> we'll<00:04:05.150> be<00:04:05.180> ready<00:04:05.510> for<00:04:05.810> pencil

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.180 

you<00:04:11.629> can<00:04:11.750> sort<00:04:11.959> of<00:04:11.989> see<00:04:12.200> if<00:04:12.560> you<00:04:12.709> rub<00:04:12.980> it<00:04:13.069> with

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
you can sort of see if you rub it with

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.070 
you can sort of see if you rub it with
your<00:04:13.220> fingers<00:04:13.549> a<00:04:13.580> little<00:04:13.700> bit<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.900> you<00:04:14.959> get

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
your fingers a little bit and you get

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.860 
your fingers a little bit and you get
the<00:04:15.200> soapy<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:15.739> means<00:04:15.920> you<00:04:16.040> haven't<00:04:16.250> actually

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
the soapy it means you haven't actually

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.569 
the soapy it means you haven't actually
got<00:04:17.870> all<00:04:18.109> of<00:04:18.200> your<00:04:18.350> brush<00:04:18.919> cleaner<00:04:19.220> out<00:04:19.370> so<00:04:19.519> you

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
got all of your brush cleaner out so you

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.450 
got all of your brush cleaner out so you
can<00:04:19.700> just<00:04:19.820> use<00:04:20.030> your<00:04:20.060> fingers<00:04:20.450> and<00:04:21.310> this<00:04:22.310> is

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
can just use your fingers and this is

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.310 
can just use your fingers and this is
again<00:04:22.729> the<00:04:23.270> reason<00:04:23.540> why<00:04:23.690> I<00:04:23.720> use<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.139> tap

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
again the reason why I use the tap

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.659 
again the reason why I use the tap
because<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.680> pressure<00:04:24.919> pressure<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.550> the

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
because the pressure pressure of the

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.900 
because the pressure pressure of the
water<00:04:25.820> will<00:04:26.810> actually<00:04:26.990> help<00:04:27.290> to<00:04:27.590> get<00:04:27.770> all<00:04:28.760> of

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
water will actually help to get all of

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:38.970 
water will actually help to get all of
that<00:04:29.030> out

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.060 

and<00:04:39.980> that's<00:04:40.390> basically<00:04:41.390> how<00:04:41.630> I<00:04:42.110> clean<00:04:43.040> my

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
and that's basically how I clean my
