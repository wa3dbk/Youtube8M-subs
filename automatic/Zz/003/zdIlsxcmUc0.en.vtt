complete restoration many of the parts

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.930 
complete restoration many of the parts
are<00:00:47.660> still<00:00:47.840> original<00:00:48.080> take<00:00:48.980> a<00:00:49.010> heat<00:00:49.310> exchanger

for<00:00:49.970> example<00:00:50.600> clearly<00:00:51.020> a<00:00:51.200> wearing<00:00:51.830> part<00:00:52.130> in

for example clearly a wearing part in
this<00:00:52.790> case<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:53.240> only<00:00:53.420> solution<00:00:54.050> is<00:00:54.230> to

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
this case the only solution is to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.010 
this case the only solution is to
replace<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:55.040> part<00:00:55.280> however<00:00:55.850> fortunately<00:00:56.720> the

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
replace the part however fortunately the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.990 
replace the part however fortunately the
engine<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:57.560> transmission<00:00:57.800> housing<00:00:58.310> is<00:00:58.730> the

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
engine and transmission housing is the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.970 
engine and transmission housing is the
original<00:00:59.420> so<00:00:59.810> we<00:00:59.930> still<00:01:00.200> have<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.590> matching

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
original so we still have the matching

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.620

numbers with no friend of matching

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.020
