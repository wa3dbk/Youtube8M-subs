00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
put the link of where I purchased this

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.650 
down below as well as the film I did
purchase<00:00:17.100> them<00:00:17.460> separately<00:00:17.820> because<00:00:18.630> I

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
purchase them separately because I

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.599 
purchase them separately because I
thought<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.529> was<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.800> lot<00:00:20.070> cheaper<00:00:20.310> if<00:00:20.550> I

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
thought that it was a lot cheaper if I

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.840 
thought that it was a lot cheaper if I
did<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.090> way<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.619> instant<00:00:23.310> mini<00:00:23.550> it

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
did that way so the instant mini it

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
bit to the right then it's supposed to

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.240 
bit to the right then it's supposed to
be<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:24.690> keep<00:02:25.170> down<00:02:25.319> my<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:25.709> when<00:02:25.860> you're<00:02:25.950> taking

a picture kind of move it to right a

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.559 
a picture kind of move it to right a
little<00:02:28.769> bit<00:02:28.920> um<00:02:29.220> in<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.730> make<00:02:30.000> sense<00:02:30.390> and

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
little bit um in that make sense and

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.080 
little bit um in that make sense and
make<00:02:30.629> sure<00:02:31.379> that<00:02:31.560> nothing<00:02:31.799> is<00:02:32.250> like<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.940> don't

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
make sure that nothing is like you don't

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.089 
make sure that nothing is like you don't
have<00:02:33.239> your<00:02:33.420> finger<00:02:33.720> on<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:33.959> because<00:02:34.799> you<00:02:34.920> can't

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
have your finger on it because you can't

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.350 
have your finger on it because you can't
really<00:02:35.280> see<00:02:35.459> it<00:02:35.489> through<00:02:35.730> here<00:02:35.940> since<00:02:36.150> you're

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
really see it through here since you're

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.149 
really see it through here since you're
over<00:02:36.569> looking<00:02:36.930> from<00:02:37.290> up<00:02:37.440> here<00:02:37.709> not<00:02:37.950> down<00:02:38.099> here

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
over looking from up here not down here

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.100 
over looking from up here not down here
and<00:02:38.519> that<00:02:38.909> makes<00:02:39.150> any<00:02:39.390> sense

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
and that makes any sense

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.059 
and that makes any sense
so<00:02:40.799> um<00:02:41.329> yeah<00:02:42.329> that's<00:02:42.540> pretty<00:02:43.049> much<00:02:43.200> all<00:02:43.590> I

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
so um yeah that's pretty much all I

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.190 
so um yeah that's pretty much all I
would<00:02:44.459> have<00:02:44.609> to<00:02:44.760> say<00:02:44.940> about<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.690> camera<00:02:45.959> self

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
would have to say about the camera self

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.890 
would have to say about the camera self
up<00:02:46.379> and<00:02:46.980> right<00:02:47.430> here<00:02:47.790> indicates<00:02:48.359> how<00:02:48.840> many

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.949 
up and right here indicates how many
pictures<00:02:49.379> you<00:02:49.680> have<00:02:49.920> left<00:02:50.190> s<00:02:50.370> means<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.329> don't

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
really know what S stands for but um

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.240 
really know what S stands for but um
there's<00:02:54.870> no<00:02:55.049> more<00:02:55.200> film<00:02:55.409> in<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:55.799> which<00:02:56.010> I'll

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
there's no more film in this which I'll

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.030 
there's no more film in this which I'll
show<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.519> guys<00:02:56.700> how<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.420> change<00:02:58.079> it<00:02:58.290> out<00:02:58.530> so

show you guys how to change it out so

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.280 
show you guys how to change it out so
this<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.549> Fuji<00:02:59.760> film<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.390> purchased<00:03:00.930> a

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
this is the Fuji film I purchased a

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.860 
this is the Fuji film I purchased a
hundred<00:03:02.040> of<00:03:02.280> these<00:03:02.519> or<00:03:02.790> ten<00:03:03.150> packs<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:03.720> this

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
hundred of these or ten packs of this

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.080 
hundred of these or ten packs of this
which<00:03:04.140> is<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.590> hundred<00:03:05.220> sheets<00:03:05.430> um<00:03:05.840> for<00:03:06.840> about

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
which is a hundred sheets um for about

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.759 
which is a hundred sheets um for about
$69<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.209> believe<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:09.659> that's<00:03:09.900> roughly<00:03:10.590> about

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
$69 I believe so that's roughly about

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.309 
$69 I believe so that's roughly about
seven<00:03:11.129> seventy<00:03:12.090> cents<00:03:12.480> per<00:03:12.750> film<00:03:12.959> which<00:03:13.170> is

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
seven seventy cents per film which is

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.030 
seven seventy cents per film which is
really<00:03:13.650> expensive<00:03:13.859> but<00:03:14.819> um<00:03:15.620> so<00:03:16.620> I'm<00:03:16.859> just

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
really expensive but um so I'm just

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.650 
really expensive but um so I'm just
gonna<00:03:17.130> open<00:03:17.519> this<00:03:17.849> and<00:03:18.030> show<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.239> guys<00:03:18.269> how<00:03:18.389> to

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
gonna open this and show you guys how to

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.809 
gonna open this and show you guys how to
put<00:03:19.049> it<00:03:19.139> in<00:03:21.769> so<00:03:22.769> this<00:03:22.919> is<00:03:23.099> what<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.430> looks<00:03:23.669> like

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
put it in so this is what it looks like

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.930 
put it in so this is what it looks like
from<00:03:24.090> out<00:03:24.329> of<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.569> box<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.139> it<00:03:25.560> has<00:03:25.739> um<00:03:26.489> that

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
from out of the box and it has um that

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.360 
from out of the box and it has um that
has<00:03:27.120> like<00:03:27.419> instructions<00:03:27.989> on<00:03:28.139> where<00:03:28.739> open<00:03:29.220> it

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
has like instructions on where open it

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.199 
has like instructions on where open it
so<00:03:29.549> I'm<00:03:29.609> just<00:03:29.639> going<00:03:29.879> to<00:03:30.000> open<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.389> right<00:03:30.540> now

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:42.979 

so<00:03:36.209> this<00:03:36.660> is<00:03:36.989> what<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.430> looks<00:03:39.299> like<00:03:40.910> and<00:03:41.989> then

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
so this is what it looks like and then

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.039

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
and then this is just like kind of like

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.920 
and then this is just like kind of like
um<00:04:32.539> the<00:04:34.639> front<00:04:35.639> which<00:04:35.880> I<00:04:36.060> don't<00:04:36.120> know<00:04:36.300> just<00:04:36.630> so

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
um the front which I don't know just so

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.800 
um the front which I don't know just so
that<00:04:37.229> the<00:04:37.680> film<00:04:38.610> doesn't<00:04:39.000> get<00:04:39.270> exposed<00:04:39.660> to

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
that the film doesn't get exposed to

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.170 
that the film doesn't get exposed to
light<00:04:40.080> when<00:04:40.289> you're<00:04:40.440> opening<00:04:41.190> a<00:04:41.280> new<00:04:41.430> path<00:04:41.729> if

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
light when you're opening a new path if

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.510 
light when you're opening a new path if
that<00:04:42.600> makes<00:04:42.810> any<00:04:42.960> sense<00:04:43.139> probably<00:04:43.620> not<00:04:43.740> but<00:04:44.220> so

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
that makes any sense probably not but so

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.610 
that makes any sense probably not but so
yeah<00:04:44.669> I'm<00:04:44.910> these<00:04:45.240> that's<00:04:45.509> pretty<00:04:45.780> small<00:04:46.139> so

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.779 
yeah I'm these that's pretty small so
they're<00:04:46.770> pretty<00:04:47.070> much<00:04:47.160> about<00:04:47.370> this<00:04:47.550> size

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
they're pretty much about this size

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:53.480 
they're pretty much about this size
which<00:04:48.389> is<00:04:48.660> uh<00:04:50.810> about<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:52.289> same<00:04:52.500> size<00:04:52.740> as<00:04:53.130> like

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
which is uh about the same size as like

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.659 
which is uh about the same size as like
a<00:04:53.759> debit<00:04:54.570> card<00:04:54.720> credit<00:04:55.169> card<00:04:55.349> a<00:04:55.889> business<00:04:56.370> card
