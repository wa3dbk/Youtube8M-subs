I've<00:00:00.570> taught<00:00:00.840> you<00:00:01.020> how<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.199> juggle<00:00:01.500> a<00:00:01.800> single

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
I've taught you how to juggle a single

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.610 
I've taught you how to juggle a single
spin<00:00:02.790> Club<00:00:03.240> pattern<00:00:03.449> now<00:00:04.319> we're<00:00:04.470> going<00:00:04.560> to

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
spin Club pattern now we're going to

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.730 
spin Club pattern now we're going to
work<00:00:04.830> towards<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.310> double<00:00:05.700> spin<00:00:05.910> pattern<00:00:06.740> the

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
work towards a double spin pattern the

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.140 
work towards a double spin pattern the
only<00:00:07.950> difference<00:00:08.160> is<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.910> club<00:00:09.090> is

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
only difference is that the club is

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.089 
only difference is that the club is
going<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.599> go<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.780> little<00:00:10.019> higher<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.559> spend<00:00:11.070> a

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
going to go a little higher and spend a

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.240 
going to go a little higher and spend a
little<00:00:11.250> more<00:00:14.960> it<00:00:15.960> takes<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.379> long<00:00:16.590> time<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.980> be

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
little more it takes a long time to be

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.189 
little more it takes a long time to be
able<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.520> get<00:00:17.670> used<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.180> seeing<00:00:18.510> what<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.170> a

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
able to get used to seeing what is a

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.960 
able to get used to seeing what is a
single<00:00:19.710> what<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> double<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.609> what<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:20.939> a

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
single what is a double and what is a

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.330 
single what is a double and what is a
triple<00:00:21.480> spin<00:00:21.840> but<00:00:22.500> as<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.680> juggler<00:00:23.100> it's<00:00:23.220> your

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
triple spin but as a juggler it's your

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.480 
triple spin but as a juggler it's your
responsibility<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:24.060> know<00:00:24.439> so<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.769> may<00:00:26.310> just

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
responsibility to know so you may just

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.519 
responsibility to know so you may just
want<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.789> practice<00:00:27.210> with<00:00:27.359> one<00:00:27.630> club<00:00:27.900> until

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
want to practice with one club until

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.830 
want to practice with one club until
you're<00:00:28.740> sure<00:00:28.910> where<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.029> spin<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.420> if<00:00:30.599> you

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
you're sure where the spin is if you

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.740 
you're sure where the spin is if you
catch<00:00:31.050> one<00:00:31.320> backwards<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.540> try<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.600> be

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
catch one backwards like this try to be

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.870 
catch one backwards like this try to be
able<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.050> identify<00:00:34.200> did<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.010> overspend<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.700> or

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
able to identify did you overspend it or

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.700 
able to identify did you overspend it or
under<00:00:36.180> spin<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.930> then<00:00:37.079> when<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.440> make<00:00:37.680> your

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
under spin it so then when you make your

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.619 
under spin it so then when you make your
next<00:00:38.070> throw<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:38.820> fixed<00:00:39.360> now<00:00:40.160> as<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.820> told<00:00:42.450> you

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
next throw it's fixed now as I told you

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.470 
next throw it's fixed now as I told you
in<00:00:42.660> last<00:00:42.960> clip<00:00:43.670> your<00:00:44.670> arm<00:00:44.879> controls<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
in last clip your arm controls the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.690 
in last clip your arm controls the
height<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.930> your<00:00:45.960> wrist<00:00:46.739> tension<00:00:47.250> controls

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
height and your wrist tension controls

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.119 
height and your wrist tension controls
the<00:00:47.850> spin<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.989> throw<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.289> double<00:00:49.739> versus<00:00:50.100> a

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the spin so to throw a double versus a

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.670 
the spin so to throw a double versus a
single<00:00:50.640> you'll<00:00:51.149> want<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.510> throw<00:00:51.840> you'll<00:00:52.440> want

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
single you'll want to throw you'll want

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.889 
single you'll want to throw you'll want
to<00:00:52.739> put<00:00:53.309> more<00:00:53.520> arm<00:00:53.850> strength<00:00:54.239> into<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.809> get

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
to put more arm strength into it to get

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.689 
to put more arm strength into it to get
it<00:00:55.050> higher<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.500> tense<00:00:56.160> your<00:00:56.370> wrists<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.670> little

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
it higher and tense your wrists a little

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.660 
it higher and tense your wrists a little
bit<00:00:57.030> more<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.420> make<00:00:57.600> sure<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.899> spins<00:00:58.109> around

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
bit more to make sure it spins around

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.670 
bit more to make sure it spins around
you<00:00:59.670> won't<00:00:59.910> want<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.239> test<00:01:00.510> your<00:01:00.660> wrist<00:01:00.899> tense

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
you won't want to test your wrist tense

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.009 
you won't want to test your wrist tense
your<00:01:01.859> wrist<00:01:02.039> very<00:01:02.250> much<00:01:02.640> because<00:01:03.270> technically

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
your wrist very much because technically

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.500 
your wrist very much because technically
compared<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> height<00:01:05.090> the<00:01:06.090> spin<00:01:06.360> is

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
compared to the height the spin is

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.490 
compared to the height the spin is
relative<00:01:08.270> but<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.510> will<00:01:09.689> take<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.260> little

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
relative but it will take just a little

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.770 
relative but it will take just a little
bit<00:01:10.650> more<00:01:10.830> flick<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.820> get<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> spindle<00:01:12.479> across

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
bit more flick to get the spindle across

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.630 
bit more flick to get the spindle across
otherwise<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.409> may<00:01:13.560> end<00:01:13.799> up<00:01:14.070> with<00:01:14.280> kind<00:01:14.520> of

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
otherwise you may end up with kind of

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.260 
otherwise you may end up with kind of
dead<00:01:14.909> fish<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:16.909> once<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.090> have<00:01:18.240> that

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
dead fish like that once you have that

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.010 
dead fish like that once you have that
down<00:01:19.009> pick<00:01:20.009> up<00:01:20.189> your<00:01:20.280> three<00:01:20.520> clubs<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.060> start

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
down pick up your three clubs and start

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.520 
down pick up your three clubs and start
with<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> single<00:01:22.560> spin<00:01:22.770> cascade<00:01:24.290> once<00:01:25.290> you're

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
with a single spin cascade once you're

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.550 
with a single spin cascade once you're
solid<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.100> your<00:01:26.280> cascade<00:01:26.970> try<00:01:27.840> throwing<00:01:28.200> just

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
solid in your cascade try throwing just

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.300 
solid in your cascade try throwing just
one<00:01:28.770> double<00:01:31.579> from<00:01:32.579> each<00:01:32.700> hand

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.429 

and<00:01:35.399> then<00:01:36.000> work<00:01:36.270> your<00:01:36.299> way<00:01:36.479> up<00:01:36.600> eventually<00:01:37.049> to

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
and then work your way up eventually to

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.590 
and then work your way up eventually to
being<00:01:37.680> able<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.130> all<00:01:38.340> doubles<00:01:41.299> now<00:01:42.299> as<00:01:42.570> you

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
being able to do all doubles now as you

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.460 
being able to do all doubles now as you
get<00:01:42.930> confident<00:01:43.470> with<00:01:43.500> doubles<00:01:45.200> you'll<00:01:46.200> see

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
get confident with doubles you'll see

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.920 
get confident with doubles you'll see
that<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.860> can<00:01:46.890> manipulate<00:01:47.700> how<00:01:48.509> high<00:01:48.720> they

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
that you can manipulate how high they

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.200 
that you can manipulate how high they
are<00:01:49.049> with<00:01:49.590> how<00:01:49.770> much<00:01:49.950> tension<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.549> arm

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
are with how much tension and arm

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.630 
are with how much tension and arm
strength<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.570> use<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.560> i<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:53.130> throw<00:01:53.280> doubles

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
strength you use so i can throw doubles

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.560 
strength you use so i can throw doubles
here<00:01:55.070> or<00:01:56.070> here<00:01:56.820> or<00:01:57.439> here<00:01:59.149> now<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.210> see<00:02:00.479> i'm

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
here or here or here now you see i'm

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.850 
here or here or here now you see i'm
catching<00:02:00.929> them<00:02:01.049> backwards<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:01.590> i'm<00:02:01.679> not

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
catching them backwards so i'm not

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.289 
catching them backwards so i'm not
actually<00:02:02.159> throwing<00:02:02.579> out<00:02:02.759> here<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.000> double

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
actually throwing out here in double

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.630 
actually throwing out here in double
stereo<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.049> those<00:02:04.950> some<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.399> those<00:02:05.490> were

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
stereo and those some of those were
