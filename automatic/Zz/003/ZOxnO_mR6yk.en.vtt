00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.619
 addictive and I want to teach them to 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.869
 make in a video two recipes of snacks 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.460
 have chocolates be prepared 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.440
 with my friends they come when I do 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.510
 meetings but on special occasions 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.180
 nothing more solbes when you want to look 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.640
 tea with some dessert or some botanita 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.530
 this prepared us really are super 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.600
 easy to do and in addition to all to 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.760
 everyone loves it and so let's see 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.770
 how do these delicious snacks with 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.500
 chocolates the ingredients that we're going to 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.990
 need for the first snack are a 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.760
 cup of chocolates of preference that are 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.100
 little ones and you do not get young 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.380
 You can also use the big ones 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.940
 cup of chocolate can be of milk or 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.430
 bitter and this has to be for 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.979
 melt and toppings in this case I would 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.110
 I'm going to put puffed rice and cranberry 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.970
 dry you can put peanut 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.040
 put a nut on it or you can also put 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.620
 almond first melt your chocolate to 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.079
 bain-marie or in the microwave 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.079
 [Music] 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.600
 Now in a small bowl you will empty the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.600
 chocolate and the other ingredients 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.990
 if you have big chocolates cut 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.650
 with scissors to make them 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.650
 little ones 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.369
 I see with a straw enough to stir it 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.369
 all 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.920
 and now in a tray with paper 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.869
 waxed you are going to empty all your mixture and 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.619
 with spatula you're going to start 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.619
 expand it 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.460
 try to expand in this way 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.920
 and you're going to put it in the freezer for 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.020
 an hour with her once past the 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.330
 refrigerator jump your bar and with 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.670
 careful you are going to cut it into pieces 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.800
 you can cut it into bars in triangles 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.910
 or as you want and then see them 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.130
 putting on a plate to serve them 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.500
 success thanks to eat all too 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.100
 you can keep it from finding you and you put it in 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.100
 to the refrigerator 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.840
 the second idea we're going to need 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.359
 whole grain cookies 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.049
 I got wholemeal crackers with honey 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:53.269
 big chocolates and chocolates 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.269
 like these that do not have almonds 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.080
 let's put our snacks first 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.390
 you are going to take a cookie and you are going to put 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.800
 a chocolate in this way is innovation 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.800
 accommodating in a tray 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.190
 when you have all your cookies 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.770
 ready you're going to put them in your oven 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.870
 electric or to your conventional oven if 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.770
 you are going to use electric oven only 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.930
 put five minutes in 250 degrees and if 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.020
 you are going to use the conventional oven 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.730
 only 5 minutes to 150 degrees when 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.210
 spend the five minutes take them out with 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.210
 watch out 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.980
 if you are going to put a chocolate for 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.980
 over this way 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.069
 when it is already cold you will know if you can 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.420
