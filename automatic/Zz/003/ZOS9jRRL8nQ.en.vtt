00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:09.159

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:10.440 
Scott went yeah so it's a really dark
you<00:02:09.489> might<00:02:09.519> want<00:02:09.879> to<00:02:09.970> turn<00:02:10.119> up<00:02:10.299> your

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
you might want to turn up your

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.960 
you might want to turn up your
brightness<00:02:10.989> I<00:02:11.170> looked<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.159> I<00:02:12.400> think<00:02:12.670> someone

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
brightness I looked and I think someone

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.690 
brightness I looked and I think someone
just<00:02:13.000> doc<00:02:13.299> committed<00:02:13.780> suicide<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:15.280> yeah<00:02:15.489> it's

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
just doc committed suicide but yeah it's

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.270 
just doc committed suicide but yeah it's
a<00:02:15.819> really<00:02:16.090> interesting<00:02:17.019> that<00:02:17.409> it's<00:02:17.920> really

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
a really interesting that it's really

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.030 
a really interesting that it's really
claustrophobic<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:19.480> think<00:02:19.720> that<00:02:19.870> adds<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.920> the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
claustrophobic I think that adds to the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.490 
claustrophobic I think that adds to the
atmosphere<00:02:21.159> and<00:02:21.870> if<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:23.049> get<00:02:23.200> low<00:02:23.470> enough

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
atmosphere and if you get low enough

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.729 
atmosphere and if you get low enough
you'll<00:02:24.430> get<00:02:24.760> oh<00:02:24.970> no<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:26.349> get<00:02:26.530> low<00:02:26.709> enough

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
you'll get oh no you get low enough

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.649 
you'll get oh no you get low enough
you'll<00:02:27.129> get<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.400> an<00:02:27.519> area<00:02:27.819> that's<00:02:28.090> just<00:02:28.450> like

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
you'll get to an area that's just like

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.050 
you'll get to an area that's just like
completely<00:02:28.930> flooded<00:02:29.530> with<00:02:29.799> water<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.430> hence

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
completely flooded with water and hence

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.830 
completely flooded with water and hence
its<00:02:31.269> name<00:02:31.359> flooded<00:02:32.049> mines<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:34.060> there<00:02:34.689> are

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
its name flooded mines and there are

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.990
