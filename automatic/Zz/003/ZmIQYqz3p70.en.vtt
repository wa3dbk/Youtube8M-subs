00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
notes here what we have is the third to

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.920 
notes here what we have is the third to
the<00:00:36.380> seven<00:00:36.860> to<00:00:37.129> the<00:00:37.250> route<00:00:37.489> to<00:00:38.059> the<00:00:38.210> fifth<00:00:38.480> to

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
the seven to the route to the fifth to

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.220 
the seven to the route to the fifth to
the<00:00:38.960> seventh<00:00:39.530> to<00:00:39.860> the<00:00:39.980> room<00:00:40.160> now<00:00:41.230> something

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
the seventh to the room now something

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.960 
the seventh to the room now something
very<00:00:42.260> cool<00:00:42.650> here<00:00:42.980> we<00:00:43.100> talked<00:00:43.550> about<00:00:43.699> using

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
very cool here we talked about using

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.540 
very cool here we talked about using
different<00:00:44.480> melody<00:00:44.930> notes<00:00:45.170> but<00:00:45.800> now<00:00:45.949> that<00:00:46.430> we

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
different melody notes but now that we

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.630 
different melody notes but now that we
have<00:00:46.580> two<00:00:46.940> different<00:00:47.620> ways<00:00:48.620> to<00:00:48.860> play<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.400> C

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
have two different ways to play the C

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.540 
have two different ways to play the C
major<00:00:49.820> 7<00:00:50.180> remember<00:00:51.080> the<00:00:51.559> first<00:00:51.800> one<00:00:52.160> was<00:00:52.340> like

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
major 7 remember the first one was like

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.710 
major 7 remember the first one was like
that<00:00:52.820> and<00:00:53.090> now<00:00:53.690> we<00:00:53.750> got<00:00:54.019> this<00:00:55.269> the<00:00:56.269> two<00:00:56.480> top

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
that and now we got this the two top

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.990 
that and now we got this the two top
notes<00:00:57.050> are<00:00:57.290> different<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.040> on<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:58.850> first

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
notes are different so on the first

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.810 
notes are different so on the first
conversion<00:00:59.950> we<00:01:00.950> have<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.190> root<00:01:01.399> at<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:02.390> top

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
conversion we have the root at the top

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.070 
conversion we have the root at the top
one<00:01:04.820> for<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.030> route<00:01:05.149> we<00:01:05.300> have<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.570> ninth<00:01:05.810> so

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
one for the route we have the ninth so

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.230 
one for the route we have the ninth so
now<00:01:06.200> we<00:01:06.289> can<00:01:06.560> create<00:01:06.830> a<00:01:06.920> melody<00:01:07.369> back<00:01:08.030> and

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
now we can create a melody back and

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.719 
now we can create a melody back and
forth<00:01:08.479> between<00:01:08.630> these<00:01:08.990> two<00:01:09.289> notes<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:10.340> C<00:01:10.550> and

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
forth between these two notes to C and

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.999 
forth between these two notes to C and
the<00:01:10.789> D<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.690> let's<00:01:11.840> put<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.080> jam<00:01:12.289> track<00:01:12.590> on<00:01:12.800> and

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
the D so let's put the jam track on and

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.930 
the D so let's put the jam track on and
check<00:01:13.190> that<00:01:13.369> out<00:01:14.860> so<00:01:15.860> I'll<00:01:15.920> start<00:01:16.130> up<00:01:16.310> slow<00:01:16.640> for

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
check that out so I'll start up slow for

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:53.800 
check that out so I'll start up slow for
you

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.360 

so<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.900> can<00:01:55.020> see<00:01:55.230> you<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.590> go<00:01:55.710> back<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:55.950> forth

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
so you can see you can go back and forth

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.370 
so you can see you can go back and forth
between<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.910> two<00:01:56.940> different<00:01:57.690> notes<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.350> you

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
between the two different notes and you

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.070 
between the two different notes and you
get<00:01:58.830> some<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.460> know<00:01:59.490> very<00:01:59.790> cool<00:02:00.060> sounds<00:02:00.960> and

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
get some you know very cool sounds and

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.630 
get some you know very cool sounds and
plus<00:02:01.230> you're<00:02:01.410> getting<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.770> different<00:02:01.950> sweep<00:02:02.400> so

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
plus you're getting a different sweep so

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.370 
plus you're getting a different sweep so
you're<00:02:02.760> getting<00:02:02.880> another<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.780> know<00:02:03.840> type<00:02:04.140> of

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
you're getting another you know type of

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.340 
you're getting another you know type of
sound<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:05.580> up<00:02:05.760> and<00:02:05.910> down<00:02:06.000> which<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.020> know

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
sound going up and down which you know

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.750 
sound going up and down which you know
sooner<00:02:07.950> or<00:02:07.980> later<00:02:08.100> you<00:02:08.369> could<00:02:08.520> start

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
sooner or later you could start

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.580 
sooner or later you could start
connecting<00:02:09.090> all<00:02:09.570> these<00:02:09.899> different<00:02:10.170> sweeps

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
connecting all these different sweeps

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.980 
connecting all these different sweeps
together<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.670> know<00:02:11.790> by<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.030> time<00:02:12.120> we<00:02:12.420> finish

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
together you know by the time we finish

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.810 
together you know by the time we finish
we're<00:02:13.170> now<00:02:13.260> 52<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.950> them<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.280> it's<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.520> lot<00:02:14.760> of

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
we're now 52 of them so it's a lot of

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.060 
we're now 52 of them so it's a lot of
different<00:02:14.970> possibilities<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:16.650> as<00:02:16.920> you're

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
different possibilities so as you're

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.740 
different possibilities so as you're
working<00:02:17.220> through<00:02:17.430> all<00:02:18.360> these<00:02:18.540> different

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
working through all these different

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.910 
working through all these different
suites<00:02:19.140> check<00:02:19.410> out<00:02:19.590> some<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:19.830> these

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
suites check out some of these

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.710 
suites check out some of these
possibilities<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.670> putting<00:02:21.150> more<00:02:21.390> than<00:02:21.540> one

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
possibilities of putting more than one

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.570 
possibilities of putting more than one
together<00:02:21.930> especially<00:02:22.350> when<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.920> top<00:02:23.130> note<00:02:23.430> at

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
together especially when the top note at

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.970 
together especially when the top note at
the<00:02:23.670> bottom<00:02:23.700> note<00:02:24.180> isn't<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.470> same<00:02:25.680> Noakes

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
the bottom note isn't the same Noakes

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.660 
the bottom note isn't the same Noakes
and<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.340> can<00:02:26.490> get<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> little<00:02:26.790> melody<00:02:27.300> going
