railroads but you know what they work
just<00:00:44.850> great<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.020> that's<00:00:46.230> what<00:00:46.379> we're

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
just great for that so that's what we're

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.310 
just great for that so that's what we're
going<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.829> using<00:00:47.010> them<00:00:47.340> for<00:00:47.750> in<00:00:48.750> many<00:00:49.050> ways

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320

we were all sitting around madam Woo's
listening<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.630> these<00:01:18.750> stride<00:01:19.170> styles<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.009> the

listening to these stride styles of the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.399 
listening to these stride styles of the
professor<00:01:20.640> when<00:01:21.479> Dale<00:01:21.689> announced<00:01:22.290> he'd

acquired<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.920> new<00:01:23.100> camera<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:24.799> GoPro<00:01:25.799> which<00:01:26.250> is

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
acquired a new camera a GoPro which is

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.940 
acquired a new camera a GoPro which is
small<00:01:26.700> enough<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.600> could<00:01:27.990> adequately<00:01:28.680> be

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
small enough that it could adequately be

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.260 
small enough that it could adequately be
stuffed<00:01:29.369> into<00:01:29.640> oh<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:31.020> three<00:01:31.290> car<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:32.610> first

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
stuffed into oh and three car the first

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.260 
stuffed into oh and three car the first
effort<00:01:33.720> was<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> passenger<00:01:34.530> car<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.970> has

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
effort was a passenger car and it has

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.810 
effort was a passenger car and it has
three<00:01:36.630> windows<00:01:37.049> four<00:01:37.470> seats<00:01:37.799> pretty<00:01:38.579> much

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
three windows four seats pretty much

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.330 
three windows four seats pretty much
finished<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.659> then<00:01:40.320> we<00:01:40.979> started

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
finished and then we started

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.660 
finished and then we started
experimenting<00:01:42.590> we<00:01:43.590> found<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> GoPro

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
experimenting we found that the GoPro

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.880 
experimenting we found that the GoPro
when<00:01:44.970> installed<00:01:45.450> blocked<00:01:46.020> much<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> light

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
when installed blocked much of the light

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.219 
when installed blocked much of the light
that<00:01:47.549> would<00:01:47.759> have<00:01:47.850> illuminated<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> interior

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
that would have illuminated the interior

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.880 
that would have illuminated the interior
we<00:01:50.329> initially<00:01:51.329> debated<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.079> use<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.590> lights

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
we initially debated the use of lights

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.460 
we initially debated the use of lights
on<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.250> inside<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> car<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:54.899> somebody

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
on the inside of the car but somebody

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.200 
on the inside of the car but somebody
came<00:01:55.710> up<00:01:55.770> with<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.130> idea<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.490> mirrors<00:01:57.030> in

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
came up with the idea of mirrors in

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.170 
came up with the idea of mirrors in
either<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.570> pan<00:01:57.930> i<00:01:58.020> do<00:01:58.079> not<00:01:58.350> remember<00:01:58.530> who<00:01:59.180> the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
either a pan i do not remember who the

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.230 
either a pan i do not remember who the
mirrors<00:02:00.829> again<00:02:01.829> are<00:02:02.159> set<00:02:02.579> at<00:02:02.790> three<00:02:03.060> different

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
mirrors again are set at three different

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.070 
mirrors again are set at three different
angles

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
angles

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.880 
angles
one<00:02:04.230> is<00:02:04.380> at<00:02:04.500> 45<00:02:05.100> degrees<00:02:05.970> one<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.900> about<00:02:07.230> 25

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
one is at 45 degrees one is about 25

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.609 
one is at 45 degrees one is about 25
degrees<00:02:08.070> and<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.640> other<00:02:08.759> one<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.090> about<00:02:09.390> Oh<00:02:09.660> 60

and we windows in the side provide
sufficient<00:03:34.410> light<00:03:34.830> that<00:03:35.130> you<00:03:35.220> could<00:03:35.400> actually

also the camera sits a little bit away
from<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:43.140> back<00:03:43.320> of<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.590> car<00:03:43.830> something<00:03:44.519> we

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
from the back of the car something we

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.640 
from the back of the car something we
couldn't<00:03:45.090> do<00:03:45.269> with<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.450> passenger<00:03:45.930> car<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.590> it

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
couldn't do with a passenger car and it

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.680 
couldn't do with a passenger car and it
allows<00:03:46.920> ambient<00:03:47.610> light<00:03:47.820> to<00:03:47.850> leak<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.390> around

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
allows ambient light to leak in around

the<00:03:48.900> care<00:03:49.110> this<00:03:50.070> guy<00:03:50.300> has<00:03:51.300> proven<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.170> be

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
the care this guy has proven to be

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.509 
the care this guy has proven to be
really<00:03:53.070> fun<00:03:53.550> and<00:03:53.580> interesting<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.600> work<00:03:54.780> with

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
really fun and interesting to work with

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.240 
really fun and interesting to work with
the<00:03:56.519> door<00:03:56.760> was<00:03:57.600> left<00:03:57.780> open<00:03:58.019> so<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.010> have<00:03:59.100> a

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
the door was left open so you have a

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.810 
the door was left open so you have a
pretty<00:03:59.519> good<00:03:59.760> as<00:04:00.140> opening<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:02.280> shoot<00:04:02.489> through

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
pretty good as opening to shoot through

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.240 
pretty good as opening to shoot through

the<00:04:06.019> downward<00:04:07.019> angle<00:04:07.500> was<00:04:08.010> provided<00:04:08.519> through

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
the downward angle was provided through

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.330 
the downward angle was provided through
experimentation

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
experimentation

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.830 
experimentation
originally<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.459> cameras<00:04:11.880> installed<00:04:12.360> flat

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
originally the cameras installed flat

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.530 
originally the cameras installed flat
and<00:04:13.530> it<00:04:13.770> just<00:04:13.950> didn't<00:04:14.190> work<00:04:14.220> well<00:04:14.640> at<00:04:15.270> all

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
and it just didn't work well at all

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.629 
and it just didn't work well at all
however<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.169> shooting<00:04:16.530> down<00:04:16.739> solved<00:04:17.549> a<00:04:17.609> lot

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
however the shooting down solved a lot

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.780 
however the shooting down solved a lot
of<00:04:17.910> uh<00:04:17.970> nastier<00:04:18.450> problems<00:04:19.019> we<00:04:19.500> have<00:04:19.790> added

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
of uh nastier problems we have added

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.810 
of uh nastier problems we have added
weights<00:04:21.530> to<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.650> bottom<00:04:23.010> because<00:04:23.370> again<00:04:23.669> the

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
weights to the bottom because again the

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.750 
weights to the bottom because again the
camera<00:04:24.060> is<00:04:24.300> slightly<00:04:24.930> offset<00:04:25.440> so<00:04:26.400> we've<00:04:26.550> got<00:04:26.730> a

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
camera is slightly offset so we've got a

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:52.540 
camera is slightly offset so we've got a
string<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.240> weights<00:04:27.510> to<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.620> far<00:04:28.860> side

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
pretty darn fantastic it's really fun to
