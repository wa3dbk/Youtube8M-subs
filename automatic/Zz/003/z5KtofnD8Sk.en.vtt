00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
okay our brew has been fermenting in the

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.749 
okay our brew has been fermenting in the
dark<00:00:03.170> for<00:00:04.170> about<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.350> week<00:00:04.529> at<00:00:04.950> about<00:00:05.250> 20

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.410 
see we've achieved a reasonable degree
of<00:00:14.250> clarity<00:00:15.890> however<00:00:16.910> will<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.029> clarity

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
of clarity however will that clarity

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.200 
of clarity however will that clarity
remain<00:00:18.779> once<00:00:19.320> we<00:00:19.439> open<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.830> or<00:00:20.580> will<00:00:20.910> something

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
remain once we open it or will something

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.640 
remain once we open it or will something
terrible<00:00:21.869> happen<00:00:24.230> open<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.320> with<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.470> quick

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
terrible happen open it with a quick

terrible happen open it with a quick
twist<00:00:27.380> move<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.500> camera<00:00:28.890> around<00:00:29.070> here<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.550> you

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
twist move the camera around here so you

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.200 
twist move the camera around here so you
can<00:00:29.789> see<00:00:29.910> what's<00:00:30.060> going<00:00:30.119> on

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
can see what's going on

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
go see you've got some carbonation

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.229 
go see you've got some carbonation
happening<00:00:36.980> totally<00:00:37.980> natural<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.460> saw<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
happening totally natural I saw a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.529 
happening totally natural I saw a
particle<00:00:39.690> yep<00:00:39.930> yeah<00:00:41.360> whoo<00:00:44.300> yes<00:00:45.300> yeah<00:00:45.450> that's

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
particle yep yeah whoo yes yeah that's

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.020 
particle yep yeah whoo yes yeah that's
what<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:45.930> don't<00:00:46.200> want<00:00:46.530> oh<00:00:47.840> my<00:00:48.840> goodness

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
what we don't want oh my goodness

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.490 
what we don't want oh my goodness
yes<00:00:52.430> that's<00:00:53.430> what<00:00:53.670> happens<00:00:54.090> when<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.960> mix<00:00:55.199> a

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
yes that's what happens when you mix a

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.740 
yes that's what happens when you mix a
carbonated<00:00:56.160> beverage

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.440 

and<00:01:02.870> we<00:01:03.620> get<00:01:03.800> mixing<00:01:04.190> because<00:01:04.730> the<00:01:04.970> particles

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
and we get mixing because the particles

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.180 
and we get mixing because the particles
the<00:01:05.930> carbon<00:01:06.230> dioxide<00:01:06.290> attaches<00:01:07.010> to<00:01:07.100> the

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
the carbon dioxide attaches to the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.660 
the carbon dioxide attaches to the
particles<00:01:07.690> they<00:01:08.690> go<00:01:08.870> up<00:01:09.370> particles<00:01:10.370> go<00:01:10.460> down

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
particles they go up particles go down

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.650 
particles they go up particles go down
they<00:01:10.970> go<00:01:11.120> up<00:01:11.300> they<00:01:11.660> go<00:01:11.690> down<00:01:12.130> and<00:01:13.390> creates<00:01:14.390> this

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
they go up they go down and creates this

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.920 
they go up they go down and creates this
mixing<00:01:15.170> thing

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.950 

what<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.970> might<00:01:22.090> want<00:01:22.300> to<00:01:22.360> do<00:01:22.450> next<00:01:22.660> time<00:01:22.900> is

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
what we might want to do next time is

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.490 
what we might want to do next time is
rinse<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.400> sliced<00:01:25.360> ginger<00:01:25.900> off<00:01:26.050> very

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
rinse the sliced ginger off very

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.570 
rinse the sliced ginger off very
carefully<00:01:26.740> prior<00:01:27.340> to<00:01:27.640> boiling<00:01:28.980> it<00:01:29.980> to<00:01:30.280> try<00:01:30.550> and

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
carefully prior to boiling it to try and

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.610 
carefully prior to boiling it to try and
get<00:01:30.730> rid<00:01:30.820> of<00:01:30.880> as<00:01:31.030> many<00:01:31.480> as<00:01:31.780> much<00:01:31.960> of<00:01:32.110> a<00:01:32.170> particle

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
get rid of as many as much of a particle

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:44.370 
get rid of as many as much of a particle
stuff<00:01:32.800> as<00:01:32.950> possible<00:01:42.510> now<00:01:43.510> let's<00:01:43.990> see<00:01:44.200> what's

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
isn't any unfortunately it still tastes

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.270 
isn't any unfortunately it still tastes
good<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:57.100> tastes<00:01:57.640> very<00:01:57.790> dry<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:59.100> sugar<00:02:00.100> has

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
good it tastes very dry the sugar has

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.710 
good it tastes very dry the sugar has
been<00:02:00.460> converted<00:02:00.910> in<00:02:01.119> the<00:02:01.180> process<00:02:01.540> of

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
been converted in the process of

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.570 
been converted in the process of
fermentation<00:02:01.930> so<00:02:02.649> it<00:02:02.800> doesn't<00:02:03.100> exist<00:02:03.250> anymore

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
fermentation so it doesn't exist anymore

and<00:02:15.610> we'll<00:02:15.790> mix<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.030> up<00:02:16.150> with<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.330> little<00:02:16.540> bit<00:02:16.660> of

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
and we'll mix it up with a little bit of

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.850 
and we'll mix it up with a little bit of
this<00:02:16.930> highly<00:02:17.590> volatile<00:02:18.450> in<00:02:19.450> your<00:02:19.660> beverage

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
that and we'll add a splash of rum this

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.210 
that and we'll add a splash of rum this
makes<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.480> best<00:02:35.840> rum<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:36.530> ginger<00:02:36.560> are<00:02:36.980> much

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
Oh see if I pour the side flowing gently

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.739 
Oh see if I pour the side flowing gently
gently
