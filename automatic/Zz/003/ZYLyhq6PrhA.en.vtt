00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.020 
years I go with the gut feeling and the
same<00:02:21.240> time<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.660> try<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.380> do<00:02:23.030> multi-dimensional

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
same time I try and do multi-dimensional

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.910 
same time I try and do multi-dimensional
so<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.270> doesn't<00:02:24.600> nobody<00:02:25.020> else<00:02:25.350> can<00:02:25.500> copy<00:02:25.770> it

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
so it doesn't nobody else can copy it

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.740
