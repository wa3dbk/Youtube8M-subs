so<00:00:16.660> I'm<00:00:16.750> going<00:00:16.870> to<00:00:16.930> work<00:00:17.080> with<00:00:17.380> a<00:00:17.410> number<00:00:18.070> 12

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
so I'm going to work with a number 12

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.750 
so I'm going to work with a number 12
synthetic<00:00:20.350> bristle<00:00:20.800> brush<00:00:21.100> this<00:00:21.400> is<00:00:21.550> made<00:00:21.730> by

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
synthetic bristle brush this is made by

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.070 
synthetic bristle brush this is made by
Windsor<00:00:22.180> Newton<00:00:22.390> it<00:00:22.660> actually<00:00:22.930> actually

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
Windsor Newton it actually actually

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.850 
Windsor Newton it actually actually
brand-new<00:00:23.770> and<00:00:24.270> the<00:00:25.270> rule<00:00:26.050> of<00:00:26.200> thumb<00:00:26.380> is<00:00:26.619> as

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
brand-new and the rule of thumb is as

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.370 
brand-new and the rule of thumb is as
you<00:00:27.040> work<00:00:27.250> larger<00:00:27.849> you<00:00:28.029> want<00:00:28.240> to<00:00:28.380> gradually

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
you work larger you want to gradually

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.290 
you work larger you want to gradually
scale<00:00:29.860> up<00:00:30.040> the<00:00:30.220> size<00:00:30.430> of<00:00:30.610> your<00:00:30.730> brush<00:00:30.970> so<00:00:31.180> this

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
scale up the size of your brush so this

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.970 
scale up the size of your brush so this
is<00:00:31.420> 11<00:00:31.660> by<00:00:31.930> 14<00:00:32.010> canvas<00:00:33.010> we're<00:00:33.940> going<00:00:34.059> to<00:00:34.980> work

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
is 11 by 14 canvas we're going to work

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.119 
is 11 by 14 canvas we're going to work
with<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:36.850> number<00:00:37.120> 12<00:00:37.390> brush<00:00:37.780> to<00:00:38.350> establish

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
with the number 12 brush to establish

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.270 
with the number 12 brush to establish
the<00:00:39.340> undertone<00:00:39.989> I'm<00:00:40.989> gonna<00:00:41.199> begin<00:00:41.559> to<00:00:41.739> thicken

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
the undertone I'm gonna begin to thicken

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.439 
the undertone I'm gonna begin to thicken
up<00:00:43.500> some<00:00:44.500> of<00:00:44.650> the<00:00:44.769> forms<00:00:45.129> of<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.370> trees<00:00:45.699> here

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
up some of the forms of the trees here

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:47.910 
up some of the forms of the trees here
give<00:00:46.989> them<00:00:47.080> a<00:00:47.140> little<00:00:47.260> bit<00:00:47.380> more<00:00:47.440> visual

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
give them a little bit more visual

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.590 
give them a little bit more visual
weight<00:00:48.130> and<00:00:48.970> pull<00:00:49.239> them<00:00:49.530> forward<00:00:50.530> as<00:00:51.600> areas

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
weight and pull them forward as areas

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.330 
weight and pull them forward as areas
become<00:00:52.960> more<00:00:53.110> transparent<00:00:53.380> they<00:00:54.010> actually

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
become more transparent they actually

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:05.250 
become more transparent they actually
recede<00:00:54.730> back<00:00:54.940> into<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.420> depths<00:00:55.750> of<00:00:55.840> the<00:00:55.960> space

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.850 

but<00:01:05.860> here<00:01:06.250> it'll<00:01:06.400> be<00:01:06.460> a<00:01:06.580> field<00:01:07.090> and<00:01:07.930> then<00:01:08.680> it's

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
but here it'll be a field and then it's

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.040 
but here it'll be a field and then it's
it's<00:01:09.280> like<00:01:09.430> sculpting<00:01:09.940> you<00:01:10.210> can<00:01:10.360> take<00:01:10.570> areas

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
it's like sculpting you can take areas

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.230 
it's like sculpting you can take areas
if<00:01:11.350> you<00:01:11.470> get<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:11.620> little<00:01:11.800> bit<00:01:11.950> big<00:01:12.130> you<00:01:12.340> can<00:01:12.520> wipe

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
if you get a little bit big you can wipe

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.560 
if you get a little bit big you can wipe
away<00:01:13.270> and<00:01:13.870> change<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.800> configuration<00:01:18.570> now

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
away and change the configuration now

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.150 
away and change the configuration now
we're<00:01:19.690> going<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:19.870> develop<00:01:20.110> these<00:01:20.410> mountains

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
we're going to develop these mountains

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.850 
we're going to develop these mountains
way<00:01:21.520> off<00:01:21.760> in<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.030> distance<00:01:22.150> and<00:01:22.930> in<00:01:23.350> a<00:01:23.500> second

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
way off in the distance and in a second

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.880 
way off in the distance and in a second
you're<00:01:23.980> going<00:01:24.070> to<00:01:24.160> see<00:01:24.310> me<00:01:24.490> mix<00:01:25.240> up<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.890> neutral

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
you're going to see me mix up a neutral

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:36.510 
you're going to see me mix up a neutral
very<00:01:27.760> neutral<00:01:28.920> middle<00:01:29.920> value<00:01:30.430> gray<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:36.400> we

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
very neutral middle value gray so we

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.340 
very neutral middle value gray so we
have<00:01:36.670> our<00:01:36.850> background<00:01:37.150> with<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.660> sky<00:01:37.960> our

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
have our background with the sky our

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.410 
have our background with the sky our
foreground<00:01:38.650> and<00:01:39.250> what<00:01:39.520> we've<00:01:39.640> done<00:01:39.790> so<00:01:40.030> far<00:01:40.240> is

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
foreground and what we've done so far is

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.750 
foreground and what we've done so far is
really<00:01:40.860> isolated<00:01:41.860> this<00:01:41.950> middle<00:01:42.310> ground

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
really isolated this middle ground

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.660 
really isolated this middle ground
let's<00:01:43.690> just<00:01:43.840> keep<00:01:44.020> developing<00:01:44.400> some<00:01:45.400> of<00:01:45.430> these

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
let's just keep developing some of these

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.560 
let's just keep developing some of these
tree<00:01:46.330> formations<00:01:47.050> I<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:48.520> come<00:01:48.700> across<00:01:48.820> sort

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
tree formations I can come across sort

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.010 
tree formations I can come across sort
of<00:01:49.630> scumble<00:01:50.080> that<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.640> standing<00:01:52.150> back<00:01:52.420> looking

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
of scumble that so standing back looking

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.100 
of scumble that so standing back looking
at<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.260> small<00:01:53.530> panel<00:01:54.330> just<00:01:55.330> taking<00:01:55.870> some<00:01:56.080> of

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
at the small panel just taking some of

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.150 
at the small panel just taking some of
that<00:01:57.030> neutral<00:01:58.030> green<00:01:58.870> tonality<00:01:59.380> and<00:01:59.770> working

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
that neutral green tonality and working

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.380 
that neutral green tonality and working
right<00:02:01.620> into<00:02:02.620> the<00:02:02.770> mountains<00:02:03.330> looking<00:02:04.330> for

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
right into the mountains looking for

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.990 
right into the mountains looking for
those<00:02:04.630> secondary<00:02:05.200> shapes<00:02:05.560> Oh<00:02:05.860> a<00:02:06.640> little<00:02:06.820> bit

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
those secondary shapes Oh a little bit

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.350 
those secondary shapes Oh a little bit
of<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.350> blue<00:02:08.350> tint<00:02:09.310> got<00:02:09.580> into<00:02:09.760> my<00:02:09.880> brush<00:02:10.119> which

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
of the blue tint got into my brush which

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:21.930 
of the blue tint got into my brush which
is<00:02:10.510> fine<00:02:19.709> now<00:02:20.709> we're<00:02:20.890> gonna<00:02:20.980> take<00:02:21.310> some<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.670> the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
is fine now we're gonna take some of the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.449 
is fine now we're gonna take some of the
blue<00:02:22.300> tone<00:02:22.600> LEDs<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:23.110> we<00:02:23.350> see<00:02:23.590> here<00:02:23.890> in<00:02:24.100> the

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
blue tone LEDs that we see here in the

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.310 
blue tone LEDs that we see here in the
water<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.000> move<00:02:25.209> them<00:02:25.450> down<00:02:25.480> into<00:02:26.170> the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
water and move them down into the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.620 
water and move them down into the
foreground<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:27.930> look<00:02:28.930> for<00:02:29.140> ways<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.290> vary<00:02:30.070> the

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
foreground to look for ways to vary the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.140 
foreground to look for ways to vary the
the<00:02:31.630> grass<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.260> moves<00:02:32.560> back<00:02:32.800> into<00:02:33.040> space<00:02:33.370> and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
the grass that moves back into space and

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.390 
the grass that moves back into space and
then<00:02:34.420> some<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.870> blue<00:02:35.080> tone<00:02:35.290> LEDs<00:02:35.769> from<00:02:36.130> the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
then some of the blue tone LEDs from the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.310 
then some of the blue tone LEDs from the
water<00:02:36.700> will<00:02:36.970> also<00:02:37.239> be<00:02:37.390> moved<00:02:37.600> up<00:02:37.750> into<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.080> sky

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
water will also be moved up into the sky

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.949 
water will also be moved up into the sky
in<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.620> few<00:02:38.800> places<00:02:38.950> so<00:02:39.550> at<00:02:40.150> this<00:02:40.269> point<00:02:40.630> we've

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
in a few places so at this point we've

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.580 
in a few places so at this point we've
got<00:02:40.989> we've<00:02:41.890> gone<00:02:42.100> from<00:02:42.430> general<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.090> specific

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
got we've gone from general to specific

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.530 
got we've gone from general to specific
we've<00:02:44.590> set<00:02:44.860> up<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.459> foreground<00:02:46.030> middle

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
we've set up the foreground middle

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.470 
we've set up the foreground middle
ground<00:02:46.570> background<00:02:46.989> have<00:02:47.590> all<00:02:47.769> those<00:02:47.950> major

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
ground background have all those major

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.440

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
spots of value and color sort of like a

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.790 
spots of value and color sort of like a
big<00:02:52.630> porridge<00:02:53.350> now<00:02:53.920> we've<00:02:54.190> got<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.489> add

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
big porridge now we've got to add

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
times you just you take the brush and

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
through between the trees this is a key

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.259 
through between the trees this is a key
Junction<00:03:49.040> comes<00:03:50.040> down<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.849> then<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.060> same

Junction comes down and then the same
way<00:03:51.450> we<00:03:51.799> just<00:03:52.799> moved<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.519> paint<00:03:53.790> around<00:03:54.000> we

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
way we just moved the paint around we

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.080 
way we just moved the paint around we
can<00:03:54.299> bring<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:55.860> yellow<00:03:56.160> down<00:03:56.340> here<00:03:56.580> to<00:03:56.670> sculpt

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
can bring the yellow down here to sculpt

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.530 
can bring the yellow down here to sculpt
the<00:03:57.390> trees<00:03:57.890> directly<00:03:58.890> below<00:03:59.090> at<00:04:00.090> this<00:04:00.269> point

the trees directly below at this point

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.259 
the trees directly below at this point
in<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.720> painting<00:04:01.140> we've<00:04:01.319> really<00:04:02.269> established

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
in the painting we've really established

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.690 
in the painting we've really established
the<00:04:03.420> basic<00:04:03.870> structure<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:04.680> we're<00:04:05.519> beginning

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
the basic structure and we're beginning

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.410 
the basic structure and we're beginning
to<00:04:06.150> develop<00:04:06.440> subtleties<00:04:07.440> with<00:04:07.620> it<00:04:07.709> in<00:04:07.829> peace

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
to develop subtleties with it in peace

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.180 
to develop subtleties with it in peace
now<00:04:09.420> we've<00:04:09.630> got<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.900> think<00:04:10.019> about<00:04:10.190> temperature

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
now we've got to think about temperature

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.750 
now we've got to think about temperature
temperature<00:04:11.730> is<00:04:12.120> a<00:04:12.150> real<00:04:12.480> key<00:04:13.549> element<00:04:14.549> within

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
temperature is a real key element within

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.520 
temperature is a real key element within
landscape<00:04:15.420> painting<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.079> right<00:04:16.320> now<00:04:16.470> we

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
landscape painting and right now we

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.130 
landscape painting and right now we
permanently<00:04:17.039> have<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.400> lot<00:04:17.549> of<00:04:17.669> cool<00:04:18.000> so<00:04:18.989> with

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
permanently have a lot of cool so with

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.990 
permanently have a lot of cool so with
no<00:04:19.380> additional<00:04:19.919> linseed<00:04:20.340> oil<00:04:20.430> I'm<00:04:20.669> just<00:04:20.850> gonna

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
no additional linseed oil I'm just gonna

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.650 
no additional linseed oil I'm just gonna
place<00:04:21.419> a<00:04:21.450> little<00:04:21.870> bit<00:04:22.140> onto<00:04:22.919> this<00:04:23.460> brush<00:04:23.880> and<00:04:24.539> I

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
place a little bit onto this brush and I

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.659 
place a little bit onto this brush and I
can<00:04:24.810> take<00:04:25.050> this<00:04:25.260> brush<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:26.100> just<00:04:26.310> sort<00:04:26.580> of

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
can take this brush and just sort of

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.450 
can take this brush and just sort of
drag<00:04:27.180> it<00:04:27.630> down<00:04:28.160> beautiful<00:04:29.160> that<00:04:29.250> works

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
drag it down beautiful that works

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.570 
drag it down beautiful that works
wonderfully<00:04:30.289> it<00:04:31.289> creates<00:04:31.889> sort<00:04:32.340> of<00:04:32.430> the

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
wonderfully it creates sort of the

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.930 
wonderfully it creates sort of the
imprinting<00:04:33.510> of<00:04:34.110> grass<00:04:34.590> you<00:04:35.400> can<00:04:35.490> take<00:04:35.700> it<00:04:35.850> and

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
imprinting of grass you can take it and

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.460 
imprinting of grass you can take it and
turn<00:04:36.000> it<00:04:36.240> sideways<00:04:36.510> too<00:04:38.539> and<00:04:39.539> as<00:04:39.810> we<00:04:39.960> do<00:04:40.169> this

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
turn it sideways too and as we do this

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.219 
turn it sideways too and as we do this
we<00:04:40.950> can<00:04:40.979> naturally<00:04:41.419> soften<00:04:42.419> these<00:04:42.539> edges<00:04:43.050> back

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
we can naturally soften these edges back

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.379 
we can naturally soften these edges back
here<00:04:43.560> sort<00:04:44.550> of<00:04:44.580> pull<00:04:44.820> a<00:04:44.850> little<00:04:45.060> bit<00:04:45.180> of<00:04:45.270> the

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
here sort of pull a little bit of the

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:46.879 
here sort of pull a little bit of the
gray<00:04:45.600> from<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.900> mountain<00:04:46.320> down<00:04:46.500> into<00:04:46.770> the

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
gray from the mountain down into the

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:52.580 
gray from the mountain down into the
water<00:04:49.280> and<00:04:50.280> then<00:04:50.400> use<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:51.600> brush<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:52.260> sort<00:04:52.530> of

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
water and then use the brush to sort of

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.420 
water and then use the brush to sort of
bring<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.669> violet<00:04:54.860> right<00:04:55.860> on<00:04:55.979> top<00:04:56.190> of<00:04:56.340> the

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
bring the violet right on top of the

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.430 
bring the violet right on top of the
tree<00:04:56.820> to<00:04:57.150> sort<00:04:57.389> of<00:04:57.479> vary<00:04:57.810> the<00:04:58.050> edge<00:04:58.200> of<00:04:58.380> the

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.270 
see by bringing this file across it
really<00:05:07.360> adds<00:05:07.540> the<00:05:07.990> depth<00:05:08.260> and<00:05:08.590> that<00:05:08.890> it<00:05:09.040> just

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
really adds the depth and that it just

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.910 
really adds the depth and that it just
works<00:05:09.490> wonderfully<00:05:10.150> this<00:05:10.360> tunnel<00:05:11.290> contrast

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
works wonderfully this tunnel contrast

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.120 
works wonderfully this tunnel contrast
of<00:05:12.130> gray<00:05:12.310> vial<00:05:12.670> against<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:13.240> gray<00:05:13.420> yellow<00:05:14.130> and

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
of gray vial against the gray yellow and

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.790 
of gray vial against the gray yellow and
then<00:05:15.250> we<00:05:15.340> can<00:05:15.490> take<00:05:15.760> it

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
then we can take it

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.630 
then we can take it
bring<00:05:17.800> it<00:05:19.050> shape<00:05:20.050> some<00:05:20.410> of<00:05:20.530> these<00:05:20.710> these<00:05:21.130> hills

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
bring it shape some of these these hills

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.140 
bring it shape some of these these hills
in<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:21.970> just<00:05:22.350> just<00:05:23.350> drag<00:05:23.830> this<00:05:24.190> on<00:05:24.430> top<00:05:24.760> and

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
in the just just drag this on top and

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.990 
in the just just drag this on top and
allow<00:05:25.570> some<00:05:25.990> of<00:05:26.140> what's<00:05:26.350> underneath<00:05:26.770> to<00:05:27.130> poke

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
allow some of what's underneath to poke

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.720 
allow some of what's underneath to poke
through<00:05:28.030> and<00:05:28.600> that's<00:05:28.900> the<00:05:29.050> trick

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
through and that's the trick

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.710 
through and that's the trick
allowing<00:05:30.730> what's<00:05:30.940> underneath<00:05:31.240> to<00:05:31.480> poke

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
allowing what's underneath to poke

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:44.620 
allowing what's underneath to poke
through

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.910 

come<00:05:45.350> down<00:05:45.560> here<00:05:45.590> just<00:05:46.400> pull<00:05:47.470> right<00:05:48.470> into<00:05:48.710> the

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
come down here just pull right into the

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.390 
come down here just pull right into the
water<00:05:49.160> a<00:05:49.310> little<00:05:49.490> bit<00:05:50.380> so<00:05:51.380> just<00:05:51.560> this<00:05:51.680> this<00:05:52.250> is

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
water a little bit so just this this is

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.100 
water a little bit so just this this is
like<00:05:52.520> a<00:05:52.580> scumble<00:05:53.150> glaze<00:05:53.570> is<00:05:53.780> the<00:05:53.810> sort<00:05:54.080> of

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
like a scumble glaze is the sort of

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.820 
like a scumble glaze is the sort of
lowers<00:05:54.590> the<00:05:54.860> value<00:05:56.410> pushes<00:05:57.410> the<00:05:57.560> mountain

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
lowers the value pushes the mountain

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.590 
lowers the value pushes the mountain
back<00:05:58.070> and<00:05:58.760> then<00:05:58.880> there's<00:05:59.060> still<00:05:59.210> some<00:05:59.450> areas

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
back and then there's still some areas

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.110 
back and then there's still some areas
of<00:05:59.840> violet<00:06:00.260> coming<00:06:00.560> through<00:06:00.860> that<00:06:01.040> what<00:06:02.030> I'm

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
of violet coming through that what I'm

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.270 
of violet coming through that what I'm
going<00:06:02.240> to<00:06:02.300> do<00:06:02.480> is<00:06:02.690> go<00:06:02.840> back<00:06:02.870> to<00:06:03.110> my<00:06:03.560> the<00:06:03.890> brush<00:06:04.130> I

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
going to do is go back to my the brush I

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.880 
going to do is go back to my the brush I
was<00:06:04.400> using<00:06:04.580> for<00:06:04.730> the<00:06:04.910> sky<00:06:05.210> and<00:06:06.110> do<00:06:06.560> like<00:06:06.770> an

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
was using for the sky and do like an

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.800 
was using for the sky and do like an
over<00:06:07.220> paint<00:06:07.490> so<00:06:07.850> that<00:06:08.030> edge<00:06:08.150> becomes<00:06:08.540> a<00:06:08.690> little

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
over paint so that edge becomes a little

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.310 
over paint so that edge becomes a little
bit<00:06:08.960> softer<00:06:09.910> there<00:06:10.910> we<00:06:11.060> go<00:06:11.240> I<00:06:11.420> don't<00:06:12.110> I<00:06:12.260> don't

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
bit softer there we go I don't I don't

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.050 
bit softer there we go I don't I don't
want<00:06:12.530> that<00:06:12.680> to<00:06:12.800> be<00:06:12.830> too<00:06:13.130> linear<00:06:14.050> right<00:06:15.050> there

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
want that to be too linear right there

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.170 
want that to be too linear right there
so<00:06:17.060> it's<00:06:17.180> that<00:06:17.360> back-and-forth<00:06:17.950> movement

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
so it's that back-and-forth movement

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.460 
so it's that back-and-forth movement
panning<00:06:20.180> a<00:06:20.240> little<00:06:20.450> bit<00:06:20.570> of<00:06:20.660> the<00:06:20.750> sky<00:06:21.080> and<00:06:21.350> then

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
panning a little bit of the sky and then

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.840 
panning a little bit of the sky and then
a<00:06:21.500> little<00:06:21.680> bit<00:06:21.860> of<00:06:21.950> the<00:06:22.010> mountain<00:06:22.370> to<00:06:22.550> get<00:06:22.670> the

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
a little bit of the mountain to get the

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.020 
a little bit of the mountain to get the
perfect<00:06:23.150> edge<00:06:24.040> and<00:06:25.040> then<00:06:25.160> go<00:06:25.310> back<00:06:25.580> so<00:06:25.910> you<00:06:25.940> all

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
perfect edge and then go back so you all

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.460 
perfect edge and then go back so you all
some<00:06:26.210> of<00:06:26.240> these<00:06:26.360> little<00:06:26.600> bristle<00:06:26.960> marks<00:06:27.230> came

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.470 
some of these little bristle marks came

00:06:27.470 --> 00:07:05.730 
some of these little bristle marks came
on<00:06:27.680> top

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.800
