will come out in a new game like first
of<00:02:37.650> all<00:02:37.799> the<00:02:37.920> connection<00:02:38.430> usually<00:02:38.940> it's<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.150> big

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
of all the connection usually it's a big

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.630 
of all the connection usually it's a big
problem<00:02:39.599> that<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.019> start<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.349> game<00:02:40.640> and

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
problem that the start of the game and

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.660 
problem that the start of the game and
people<00:02:42.030> tend<00:02:42.299> to<00:02:42.390> judge<00:02:42.659> it<00:02:42.810> early<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.920> think

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
people tend to judge it early so I think

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.780 
people tend to judge it early so I think
that<00:02:45.209> you<00:02:46.079> should<00:02:46.110> be<00:02:46.530> too<00:02:46.739> hyped<00:02:47.160> about<00:02:47.370> game

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
that you should be too hyped about game
