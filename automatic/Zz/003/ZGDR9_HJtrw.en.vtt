00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
was one of the choices that we had early

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.620 
was one of the choices that we had early
on<00:04:27.410> and<00:04:27.860> he<00:04:28.250> stuck<00:04:28.610> around<00:04:28.639> to<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.419> whole

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
on and he stuck around to the whole

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.810 
on and he stuck around to the whole
process<00:04:29.840> when<00:04:30.650> we<00:04:30.830> thought<00:04:31.280> about<00:04:31.340> who<00:04:31.699> we

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
process when we thought about who we

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.820 
process when we thought about who we
would<00:04:32.000> like<00:04:32.389> to<00:04:32.419> produce<00:04:32.900> the<00:04:33.259> album<00:04:33.349> and<00:04:33.680> then

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
would like to produce the album and then

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.550 
would like to produce the album and then
finally<00:04:34.639> we<00:04:34.759> ended<00:04:35.060> up<00:04:35.150> with<00:04:35.360> him<00:04:35.900> because<00:04:36.110> he

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
finally we ended up with him because he

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.860 
finally we ended up with him because he
was<00:04:36.729> probably<00:04:37.729> the<00:04:37.910> only<00:04:38.060> one<00:04:38.360> that<00:04:38.509> we<00:04:38.630> could

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
was probably the only one that we could

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.760 
was probably the only one that we could
like<00:04:39.349> trust<00:04:40.220> and<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.820> only<00:04:41.030> one<00:04:41.240> who<00:04:41.419> had<00:04:42.020> done

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
such word that we were confident that

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.490 
such word that we were confident that
everything<00:04:45.830> he<00:04:46.340> had<00:04:46.490> done<00:04:46.669> he<00:04:47.210> made<00:04:48.169> it<00:04:48.349> a

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
everything he had done he made it a

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.290 
everything he had done he made it a
little<00:04:48.650> bit<00:04:48.830> better<00:04:49.099> than<00:04:49.550> it<00:04:50.090> would<00:04:50.270> have

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
little bit better than it would have

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.790 
little bit better than it would have
been<00:04:50.539> without<00:04:50.900> himself<00:04:51.940> in<00:04:52.940> that<00:04:53.090> sense<00:04:53.419> we

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
been without himself in that sense we

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.400 
been without himself in that sense we
sort<00:04:54.800> of<00:04:54.889> made<00:04:55.490> a<00:04:55.550> safe<00:04:55.820> choice<00:04:55.849> but<00:04:56.660> still<00:04:56.990> a

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
sort of made a safe choice but still a

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.189 
sort of made a safe choice but still a
good<00:04:58.220> one<00:04:58.460> because<00:04:58.759> he's<00:04:59.180> a<00:04:59.210> music<00:04:59.720> lover<00:04:59.870> and

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599

except<00:05:36.499> of<00:05:36.769> a<00:05:36.949> I<00:05:38.499> think<00:05:39.499> all<00:05:39.860> the<00:05:40.219> songs<00:05:40.489> were

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:41.259 
except of a I think all the songs were

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:44.949 
except of a I think all the songs were
really<00:05:42.259> tightly<00:05:43.129> arranged<00:05:43.819> before<00:05:44.629> we<00:05:44.779> went

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:44.959 
really tightly arranged before we went

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:48.459 
really tightly arranged before we went
to<00:05:45.049> studio<00:05:45.349> and<00:05:45.709> and<00:05:46.309> I<00:05:46.429> said<00:05:46.669> hi<00:05:46.849> I'm<00:05:47.269> too<00:05:48.199> busy

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:48.469 
to studio and and I said hi I'm too busy

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:51.699 
to studio and and I said hi I'm too busy
to<00:05:48.769> do<00:05:48.919> any<00:05:49.219> songs<00:05:49.939> that<00:05:50.269> I<00:05:50.299> don't<00:05:50.659> believe<00:05:51.349> and

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:51.709 
to do any songs that I don't believe and

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:54.279 
to do any songs that I don't believe and
I<00:05:52.579> think<00:05:52.819> it's<00:05:52.969> wasted<00:05:53.389> everybody's<00:05:53.659> time<00:05:53.929> to

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
I think it's wasted everybody's time to

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.489 
I think it's wasted everybody's time to
go<00:05:54.439> to<00:05:54.499> studio<00:05:54.829> to<00:05:55.129> a<00:05:55.159> song<00:05:55.459> that's<00:05:55.610> not<00:05:56.349> if<00:05:57.349> you

00:05:57.489 --> 00:05:57.499 
go to studio to a song that's not if you

00:05:57.499 --> 00:06:00.489 
go to studio to a song that's not if you
don't<00:05:57.619> know<00:05:57.829> it's<00:05:57.979> going<00:05:58.129> to<00:05:58.189> be<00:05:58.249> great
