00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
really I know they obviously would have

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.230 
really I know they obviously would have
been<00:01:04.979> battling<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.400> then<00:01:05.549> only<00:01:05.670> they<00:01:06.030> could<00:01:06.150> be

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
been battling it then only they could be

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.730

going<00:01:06.360> down<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.260> then<00:01:07.380> they<00:01:07.500> will<00:01:07.619> have

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
going down so and then they will have

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.410

everything I predict goes wrong so why

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.149 
everything I predict goes wrong so why
did<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.110> think<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.380> Van<00:01:25.530> Gogh<00:01:25.680> if<00:01:25.950> the

appointment does comfort that's all
right<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:34.020> mean<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.650> could<00:01:34.799> be<00:01:34.829> what<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.340> mean

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
right but I mean it could be what I mean

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.100 
right but I mean it could be what I mean

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
there are other things there that need

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:37.339 
there are other things there that need
to<00:02:31.470> be<00:02:31.500> sorted<00:02:31.860> out<00:02:32.069> ie<00:02:32.900> uncle<00:02:33.900> mal<00:02:35.900> yeah<00:02:36.930> Gary

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349

to be sorted out ie uncle mal yeah Gary
in<00:02:37.500> some<00:02:37.650> respects<00:02:38.069> I<00:02:38.129> mean<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.340> think<00:02:38.400> it's

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
in some respects I mean I think it's

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.970 
in some respects I mean I think it's
harsh<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.720> blame<00:02:39.900> everything<00:02:40.140> on<00:02:40.349> him<00:02:40.410> but

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
harsh to blame everything on him but

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.690 
harsh to blame everything on him but
then<00:02:41.160> similarly<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:43.230> way<00:02:43.410> my<00:02:44.129> brother<00:02:44.280> worded

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
then similarly the way my brother worded

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.460 
then similarly the way my brother worded
it<00:02:44.849> was<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.480> looks<00:02:45.660> like<00:02:45.810> Ryan<00:02:46.050> Giggs<00:02:46.230> can

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
it was it looks like Ryan Giggs can

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.600 
it was it looks like Ryan Giggs can
polish<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.739> turd<00:02:46.830> as<00:02:47.220> well

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
polish a turd as well

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.880 
polish a turd as well
you<00:02:48.420> know<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.540> think<00:02:48.959> there<00:02:49.080> are<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.530> couple<00:02:49.620> of

be changed around I think there are

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.960 
be changed around I think there are
things<00:03:07.379> at<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.590> too<00:03:07.650> mixed<00:03:07.980> up<00:03:08.190> but<00:03:08.760> I'd<00:03:08.849> say

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
things at a too mixed up but I'd say

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.100 
things at a too mixed up but I'd say
we've<00:03:09.150> got<00:03:09.180> rid<00:03:09.390> of<00:03:09.450> more<00:03:09.629> than<00:03:09.750> half<00:03:09.810> the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
we've got rid of more than half the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.119 
we've got rid of more than half the
problem<00:03:10.440> I'd<00:03:10.590> say<00:03:10.739> probably<00:03:10.890> like

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
problem I'd say probably like

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.420 
problem I'd say probably like
three-quarters<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.120> problem
