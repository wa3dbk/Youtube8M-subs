00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
in corona and then our engine stays

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.050 
in corona and then our engine stays
in-house<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.160> have<00:01:02.310> an<00:01:02.430> engine<00:01:02.700> builder

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
in-house that we have an engine builder

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.830 
in-house that we have an engine builder
that<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:05.060> that<00:01:06.060> rebuilds<00:01:06.539> it<00:01:06.630> goes

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
that we have that that rebuilds it goes

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.389 
that we have that that rebuilds it goes
through<00:01:07.049> everything<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.799> goes<00:01:08.039> from<00:01:08.189> there

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
through everything and goes from there

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.889 
through everything and goes from there
and<00:01:09.289> basically<00:01:10.289> what<00:01:10.619> we<00:01:10.770> do<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:12.179> clean

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
and basically what we do is we clean

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:14.810 
and basically what we do is we clean
everything<00:01:13.109> and<00:01:13.679> prep<00:01:13.859> everything<00:01:14.189> for<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
everything and prep everything for the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.169 
everything and prep everything for the
next<00:01:15.060> rates<00:01:15.299> coming<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.289> up<00:01:16.969> make<00:01:17.969> sure

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
next rates coming on up make sure

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.160 
next rates coming on up make sure
everything<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.079> good<00:01:19.439> from<00:01:19.679> race<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.130> race<00:01:20.340> and

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
everything is good from race to race and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.840 
everything is good from race to race and
and<00:01:22.170> then<00:01:22.469> eventually<00:01:22.770> we'll<00:01:23.100> start<00:01:23.399> building

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
and then eventually we'll start building

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.099 
and then eventually we'll start building
it<00:01:23.969> together<00:01:24.329> for<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.109> next<00:01:25.350> race<00:01:26.659> wheels<00:01:27.659> we

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.109 
it together for the next race wheels we

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:29.239 
it together for the next race wheels we
have<00:01:28.229> Dunlop<00:01:28.649> here

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:29.249 
have Dunlop here

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:30.590 
have Dunlop here
that's<00:01:29.460> prepping<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.939> wheels<00:01:30.149> right<00:01:30.390> now

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
that's prepping the wheels right now

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.929 
that's prepping the wheels right now
getting<00:01:31.200> ready<00:01:31.289> for<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.679> next<00:01:31.890> race<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.789> when

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
getting ready for the next race so when

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.569 
getting ready for the next race so when
we<00:01:33.090> get<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.359> bike<00:01:33.539> all<00:01:33.810> apart<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:35.340> is

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
we get the bike all apart this is

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.459 
we get the bike all apart this is
actually<00:01:35.999> just<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.359> frame<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:36.990> how<00:01:37.170> far

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
actually just a frame this is how far

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.039 
actually just a frame this is how far
that<00:01:37.920> we<00:01:38.130> bring<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.460> down<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.179> obviously

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
that we bring it down to and obviously

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.950 
that we bring it down to and obviously
we<00:01:40.740> look<00:01:40.920> at<00:01:41.100> any<00:01:41.340> damage<00:01:41.999> of<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> frame<00:01:42.689> from

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
we look at any damage of the frame from

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.109 
we look at any damage of the frame from
the<00:01:43.109> race<00:01:43.289> and<00:01:43.649> then<00:01:44.280> we<00:01:44.399> go<00:01:44.549> from<00:01:44.670> there<00:01:44.909> and

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
the race and then we go from there and

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.840 
the race and then we go from there and
then<00:01:45.359> we<00:01:45.539> actually<00:01:45.719> scream<00:01:46.469> it<00:01:46.670> clean<00:01:47.670> it

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
then we actually scream it clean it

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.179 
then we actually scream it clean it
scrub<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.420> make<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.810> look<00:01:48.960> clean<00:01:49.139> new<00:01:49.710> brand

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
scrub it make it look clean new brand

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.849 
scrub it make it look clean new brand
new<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.639> then<00:01:50.850> assemble<00:01:51.659> all<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.409> parts<00:01:52.590> back

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
new and then assemble all the parts back

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:56.120 
new and then assemble all the parts back
onto<00:01:53.249> it<00:01:53.549> again<00:01:53.819> we<00:01:54.450> clean<00:01:54.719> and<00:01:54.960> expect<00:01:55.530> every

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
onto it again we clean and expect every

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.459 
onto it again we clean and expect every
bolt<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.490> comes<00:01:56.670> off<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.880> bike<00:01:57.179> we<00:01:57.990> scrub<00:01:58.289> it

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
bolt that comes off the bike we scrub it

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.840 
bolt that comes off the bike we scrub it
we<00:01:58.679> look<00:01:58.859> at<00:01:59.039> it<00:01:59.249> make<00:01:59.459> sure<00:01:59.490> there's<00:01:59.729> no

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
we look at it make sure there's no

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.140 
we look at it make sure there's no
damage<00:02:00.090> any<00:02:00.959> rock<00:02:01.200> damage<00:02:01.709> or

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
damage any rock damage or

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.360 
damage any rock damage or
or<00:02:02.270> anything<00:02:02.600> of<00:02:02.870> that<00:02:02.900> aspect<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:03.710> then<00:02:04.160> we

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
or anything of that aspect and then we

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.760 
or anything of that aspect and then we
neatly<00:02:04.910> lay<00:02:05.210> everything<00:02:05.570> out<00:02:05.930> in<00:02:06.230> a<00:02:06.410> certain

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
neatly lay everything out in a certain

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.249 
neatly lay everything out in a certain
order<00:02:06.980> so<00:02:07.760> when<00:02:07.940> we<00:02:08.119> go<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:08.360> build<00:02:08.690> it's<00:02:09.050> that

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
order so when we go to build it's that

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.940 
order so when we go to build it's that
much<00:02:09.440> easier<00:02:09.710> to<00:02:10.130> to<00:02:11.090> assemble<00:02:11.540> so<00:02:11.950> obviously

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
much easier to to assemble so obviously

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.570 
much easier to to assemble so obviously
we<00:02:13.190> have<00:02:13.460> our<00:02:14.380> our<00:02:15.380> chassis<00:02:15.800> bolts<00:02:16.070> up<00:02:16.220> here

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
we have our our chassis bolts up here

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.450 
we have our our chassis bolts up here
