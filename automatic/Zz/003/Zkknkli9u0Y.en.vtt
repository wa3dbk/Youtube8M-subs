00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:11.040
 hello classmates again here I am for 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.360
 do some tests with another of the 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.500
 bullshit that people have for the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.270
 mountain 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.340
 to a tile and approve the rompecocos 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.300
 I repeat again I have never done this 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.200
 kind of tests I do not know how to use it well 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.460
 but good guess in some 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.869
 situation especially in the life of a 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.029
 soldier they may need this to 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.090
 get out of a vehicle to get out 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.920
 someone or for 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.180
 any need then some house of 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.899
 ammunition or something 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.899
 how is this 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.899
 ah 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.420
 no problem 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.050
 he eats it without any problem 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.930
 I'll try to use the tip as 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.929
 we are here in full slaughter because I think 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.370
 that will resist perfectly 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:06.089
 break coconuts 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.089
 intact 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.210
 to try the tip 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.970
 also for anxiety 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.440
 nothing that has been broken is a joke 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.680
 perfect 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.700
 and that I think it gives 23 to all my 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.990
 precautions 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.990
 if there is a little marquita on the ground 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.899
 but as you see 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.899
 tip 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.890
 to make contrast 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.510
 intact board 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.820
 good mates now let's move on to 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.760
 the last test 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.470
 stylish style 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.510
 that this is already the repanocha of what 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.190
 pull the people who are a pig already 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.030
 extremes 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.030
 for when you see it 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.010
 and a bale of a car 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.700
 so let's give it changing between 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.390
 coconuts 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.760
 ah 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.100
 and as you see people throw any 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.690
 bullshit to the mountain that for this case we 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.050
 has come well to do this are you 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.630
 laughs but I think people 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.920
 about much I repeat again that I want 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.530
 that this is a message for the 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.280
 people stop doing this 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.500
 well in what situation can be given 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.600
 has to break a lighthouse because it does not 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.880
 typical of the movie that you for the 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.520
 police says he's fined because he 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.030
 cut a lighthouse retouch lighthouse east and 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.030
 I have breaks 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.580
 as few 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.319
 and this I think there will not be any 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.300
 problem of course commenting that the 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.600
 ergonomics and grip the knife 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.520
 exceptional 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.640
 that is, it does not slip even though these 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.100
 gloves are not for it 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.140
 they are also I think they slide more than 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.150
 what should slip but still 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.600
 knife I do not know does not get out of hand 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.950
 in any moment 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.550
 so let's see how it behaves 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.550
 frontex 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.459
 No problem 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:41.410
 well after these tests all 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.510
 let's see how the edge has been 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.240
 Y 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.819
 I'm going to look at the tip all 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.910
 in no nick my micro media 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.890
 no bullshit in vinegar 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.910
 the tests of the button and so on 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.550
 Well I leave them for another kind of 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.720
 knives but this knife would not have 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.930
 no problem with this thickness 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.819
 to take whatever was ahead 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.000
 so I 'm going to bring again the 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.000
 sheet 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.970
 the style 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.260
 after all the nonsense that we have 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.260
 done today 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.389
 especially the part of the tip that 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.060
 you will see that no 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.860
 that keeps cutting it locks up a bit 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.629
 because there will be some 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.610
 some dirt and probably because 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:40.389
 something of 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:43.139
 some invisible micro media of these 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.070
 who work on paper but good 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.090
 as you see 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.870
 if we have a cut 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.870
 very good 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:00.330
 my note for my knife verdict 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:02.940
 It would be a remarkable high 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.440
 almost an outstanding 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.600
 yes 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.180
 if I take 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.500
 I would have it like this for example the 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.490
 endings as I say the holes 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.490
 they were better 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.240
 these little details that by the 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.330
 price the knife should be more 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.360
 I can not say that I am 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:26.210
 happy with that I'm sorry I do not like it 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.100
 mess with the brands because I know that 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.740
 they all make an effort to try 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.160
 improve your products but it's a touch 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.520
 of attention 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:39.210
 and another touch forgiveness touch of attention 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.009
 is the subject of the angle the angle at 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.410
 better for wanting to improve the robustness of 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:46.110
 philo and others I think it has gone from 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.569
 obtuse when you see with an edge of 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.009
 30 degrees you can get a cut 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:53.430
 Excellent 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:55.199
 and therefore improve so much 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.969
 penetrability as cuts as the 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.550
 utility of the knife without affecting 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:01.589
 the robustness of the eight 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.939
 fellow greetings and I hope that you 

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:05.180
 have fun fun with the 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:05.180
 tests
