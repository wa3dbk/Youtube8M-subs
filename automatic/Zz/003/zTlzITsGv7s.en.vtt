so many ways for me as the manager of

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.970 
so many ways for me as the manager of
the<00:00:08.790> team<00:00:09.200> most<00:00:10.200> important<00:00:10.559> t<00:00:10.620> we<00:00:10.679> had<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.830> deal

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
the team most important t we had to deal

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.680 
the team most important t we had to deal
with<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.130> setback<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.460> conceding<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.599> was

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
with a setback of conceding and that was

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.140 
with a setback of conceding and that was
a<00:00:12.719> real<00:00:12.870> test<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.200> our<00:00:13.320> character<00:00:14.150> thankfully

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
a real test of our character thankfully

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.849 
a real test of our character thankfully
the<00:00:15.240> lads<00:00:15.420> walk<00:00:15.990> again<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.560> got<00:00:16.800> the

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
the lads walk again and and got the

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.170 
the lads walk again and and got the
second<00:00:17.220> goal<00:00:17.250> but<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.580> don't<00:00:17.820> think<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.119> was

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
second goal but I don't think it was

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.460 
second goal but I don't think it was
anything<00:00:18.359> we<00:00:18.539> didn't<00:00:18.750> deserve<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.170> thought<00:00:19.350> we

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
anything we didn't deserve I thought we

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.679 
anything we didn't deserve I thought we
were<00:00:19.590> really<00:00:20.279> good<00:00:20.520> in<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.090> first<00:00:21.119> half<00:00:21.480> took

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
were really good in the first half took

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:22.820 
were really good in the first half took

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.769 
the game to chart and had a number of
shots<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.220> chances<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.539> hopefully

a<00:00:27.180> word<00:00:27.300> about<00:00:27.420> Lewis<00:00:27.840> Grabban<00:00:28.050> he's<00:00:28.349> come<00:00:28.890> a

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
a word about Lewis Grabban he's come a

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.320 
a word about Lewis Grabban he's come a
few<00:00:29.130> going<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.460> our<00:00:29.580> school<00:00:29.849> but<00:00:30.060> he<00:00:30.150> always

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
few going to our school but he always

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.359 
few going to our school but he always
had<00:00:30.510> faith<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.750> he<00:00:30.990> would<00:00:31.250> well<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.279> think

he's a good player and I think other

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.100 
he's a good player and I think other
players<00:00:36.000> perhaps<00:00:36.390> got<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.600> headlines<00:00:36.930> and

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110

team more than perhaps we did last year
just<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.640> world<00:01:11.790> I'm<00:01:11.880> Ryan<00:01:12.180> Fraser<00:01:12.450> who<00:01:12.810> look<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
just a world I'm Ryan Fraser who look to

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.230 
just a world I'm Ryan Fraser who look to
lively<00:01:13.860> when<00:01:13.950> he<00:01:14.040> came<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.280> yeah<00:01:14.850> he<00:01:14.939> did<00:01:15.090> he

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
lively when he came on yeah he did he

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.800 
lively when he came on yeah he did he
certainly<00:01:16.070> gave<00:01:17.070> us<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.759> momentum<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.479> get

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
certainly gave us the momentum to get

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.060 
certainly gave us the momentum to get
back<00:01:18.990> into<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.350> game<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.619> thought<00:01:19.799> he<00:01:19.920> was

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
back into the game I thought he was

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.920 
back into the game I thought he was
really<00:01:20.400> positive<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> number<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.840> good

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
really positive but a number of good

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.270 
really positive but a number of good
crosses<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.380> box<00:01:22.590> had<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> couple<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.070> shots

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
crosses in the box had a couple of shots

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.789 
crosses in the box had a couple of shots
got<00:01:23.880> fouled<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.420> obviously<00:01:24.689> got<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.960> boy

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
got fouled and obviously got the boy

he's<00:01:27.630> still<00:01:27.810> very<00:01:27.930> young<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.710> improving<00:01:29.220> but

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
he's still very young and improving but

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.249 
he's still very young and improving but
it<00:01:29.970> could<00:01:30.090> be<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.270> real<00:01:30.390> talent<00:01:30.720> did<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.170> think

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
it could be a real talent did you think

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.050 
it could be a real talent did you think
of<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.439> sending<00:01:31.770> off<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.130> thought<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.729> was<00:01:32.850> I

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
of the sending off I thought it was I

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.780 
of the sending off I thought it was I
thought<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.299> was<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.450> two-footed<00:01:33.810> tackle<00:01:34.409> and

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
thought it was a two-footed tackle and

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.770 
thought it was a two-footed tackle and
hopefully<00:01:35.790> Ryan's<00:01:36.060> got<00:01:36.150> away<00:01:36.360> with<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:36.720> I

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
hopefully Ryan's got away with it so I

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.569 
hopefully Ryan's got away with it so I
think<00:01:36.900> he's<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:38.070> say<00:01:38.220> you're<00:01:38.310> gonna<00:01:38.430> be

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
think he's like you say you're gonna be

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.830 
think he's like you say you're gonna be
keeping<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.970> lid<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.360> one<00:01:39.600> swallow

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
keeping a lid on this one swallow

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.929 
keeping a lid on this one swallow

that feeling and the crowd and the
atmosphere<00:02:09.290> was<00:02:09.560> really<00:02:09.920> good<00:02:10.070> so<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:10.280> can't

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
atmosphere was really good so I can't

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.490 
atmosphere was really good so I can't
thank<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:11.000> Bournemouth<00:02:11.810> people<00:02:12.110> enough<00:02:12.350> for

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
that it really helped the team even when

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.910 
that it really helped the team even when
we<00:02:14.630> conceded<00:02:15.020> there<00:02:15.260> still<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.500> positive

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
we conceded there still a positive

Addison<00:02:47.570> so<00:02:47.690> it's<00:02:48.340> yeah<00:02:49.340> not<00:02:49.850> easy<00:02:50.000> decisions

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
Addison so it's yeah not easy decisions

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.960 
Addison so it's yeah not easy decisions
but<00:02:50.540> that's<00:02:50.720> gonna<00:02:51.530> be<00:02:52.160> hopefully<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.700> strength

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
but that's gonna be hopefully a strength

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.479 
but that's gonna be hopefully a strength
for<00:02:53.030> us<00:02:53.239> as<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.450> season<00:02:53.720> progresses<00:02:54.019> because

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
for us as the season progresses because
