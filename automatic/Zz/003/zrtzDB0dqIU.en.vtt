 in this opportunity we have the ovens 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.880

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.810
 move them and bring them closer to the table or 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.490
 different places that we want the 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.300
 fundamental characteristics that have 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:46.610
 these ovens is that the interior cabins 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.180
 they are in the fairies that allows 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.210
 better cleaning when cooking 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.460
 and then with the subject of fats and 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.590
 etcetera the part of the base has 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.320
 refractory brick then to make 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.150
 pieces to the stone are spectacular and 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.129
 the part of the cabin where the 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.380
 firewood because they are fed up two wood-burning ovens 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.280
 It is also made with special material 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.220
 what 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.159
 does not transmit up or smells 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.630
 but if it allows me to warm up or achieve 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.000
 temperatures needed for each of 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.250
 the cooking and what is undoubtedly 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.590

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.380
 wheel and it is transportable how it is handled 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.479

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.910
