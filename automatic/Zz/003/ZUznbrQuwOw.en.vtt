00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
this thing doesn't light up so that's

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.999 
this thing doesn't light up so that's
kind<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.619> lame<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.009> ask<00:01:26.189> me<00:01:27.799> now<00:01:28.799> go<00:01:28.950> ahead

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
kind of lame if you ask me now go ahead

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:43.899 
kind of lame if you ask me now go ahead
and<00:01:29.159> show<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.340> how<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.579> targets<00:01:30.000> work

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:53.020 

I<00:01:43.990> wanna<00:01:44.990> see<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.439> pistol<00:01:45.770> that<00:01:45.799> shoot<00:01:46.130> em<00:01:52.030> so

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
I wanna see the pistol that shoot em so

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.410 
I wanna see the pistol that shoot em so
that<00:01:53.060> one<00:01:53.329> just<00:01:53.450> lights<00:01:53.689> up<00:01:54.220> anything<00:01:55.420> this

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
that one just lights up anything this

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.260 
that one just lights up anything this
and<00:01:56.630> if<00:01:56.689> you<00:01:56.780> shoot<00:01:56.960> it<00:01:57.729> it<00:01:58.729> actually<00:01:58.850> makes<00:01:59.179> a

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
and if you shoot it it actually makes a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.620 
and if you shoot it it actually makes a
noise<00:01:59.390> when<00:01:59.509> you<00:01:59.719> hit<00:01:59.750> it<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.799> I<00:02:04.450> don't<00:02:05.450> know<00:02:05.569> if

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
noise when you hit it so I don't know if

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.730 
noise when you hit it so I don't know if
you<00:02:05.689> could<00:02:05.780> hear<00:02:05.929> it<00:02:06.020> over<00:02:06.079> the<00:02:06.319> gunfire<00:02:06.500> but

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
you could hear it over the gunfire but

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.430 
you could hear it over the gunfire but
let<00:02:07.130> me<00:02:07.220> turn<00:02:07.549> it<00:02:07.610> down<00:02:07.850> here<00:02:08.319> so<00:02:09.319> you<00:02:09.349> could

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
let me turn it down here so you could

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.820 
let me turn it down here so you could
actually<00:02:09.590> hear<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.099> target<00:02:11.500> let<00:02:12.500> me<00:02:12.590> change

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
actually hear the target let me change

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:25.330 
actually hear the target let me change
the<00:02:13.040> color<00:02:15.880> so<00:02:16.880> it'll<00:02:17.000> shoot<00:02:17.180> green<00:02:17.510> out<00:02:24.340> and

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
the color so it'll shoot green out and

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.479 
the color so it'll shoot green out and
this<00:02:25.610> one<00:02:27.370> this<00:02:28.370> registers<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.060> color<00:02:29.269> so<00:02:30.489> so

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
this one this registers the color so so

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.630 
this one this registers the color so so
that's<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.819> difference<00:02:32.120> pretty<00:02:32.299> much<00:02:33.640> the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
that's the difference pretty much the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.220 
that's the difference pretty much the
assault<00:02:34.910> rifles<00:02:35.239> usually<00:02:35.630> run<00:02:35.750> about<00:02:35.900> 40

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
assault rifles usually run about 40

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.740 
assault rifles usually run about 40
bucks<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:36.860> then<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.250> regular<00:02:38.120> strikers<00:02:38.540> or

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
bucks and then the regular strikers or

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.309 
bucks and then the regular strikers or
30<00:02:39.079> bucks<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:39.470> 10<00:02:39.650> $10<00:02:40.160> price<00:02:40.489> difference<00:02:41.319> so

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
30 bucks so 10 $10 price difference so

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.100 
30 bucks so 10 $10 price difference so
if<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.650> can<00:02:42.799> only<00:02:42.920> get<00:02:43.069> one<00:02:43.310> unit<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:44.420> one<00:02:44.720> you

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
if you can only get one unit and one you

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.420 
if you can only get one unit and one you
know<00:02:45.200> gun<00:02:45.410> I'll<00:02:45.560> probably<00:02:45.799> get<00:02:46.010> an<00:02:46.130> assault

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
know gun I'll probably get an assault

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.670 
know gun I'll probably get an assault
rifle<00:02:46.489> cuz<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.090> could<00:02:47.209> also<00:02:47.450> do<00:02:47.690> more

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
rifle cuz you could also do more

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.580 
rifle cuz you could also do more
customization<00:02:49.459> on<00:02:49.549> these<00:02:49.700> you<00:02:49.910> could<00:02:50.060> get<00:02:50.180> the

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
customization on these you could get the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.050 
customization on these you could get the
