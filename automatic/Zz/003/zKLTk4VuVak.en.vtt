other person responds to it by shaking
it<00:00:42.070> well<00:00:42.460> that's<00:00:42.640> a<00:00:42.730> protocol<00:00:43.180> in<00:00:43.390> some

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
it well that's a protocol in some

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.540 
it well that's a protocol in some
countries<00:00:44.050> or<00:00:44.380> families<00:00:44.740> you<00:00:44.950> initiate<00:00:45.490> a

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
countries or families you initiate a

countries or families you initiate a
connection<00:00:45.700> by<00:00:46.150> kissing<00:00:46.540> someone<00:00:46.720> on<00:00:46.900> the

connection by kissing someone on the

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.290 
connection by kissing someone on the
cheek<00:00:47.200> well<00:00:47.680> that's<00:00:47.890> another<00:00:48.160> protocol<00:00:48.670> so

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
cheek well that's another protocol so

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.630 
cheek well that's another protocol so
HTTP<00:00:49.990> is<00:00:50.290> a<00:00:50.320> protocol<00:00:50.860> that<00:00:50.920> happens<00:00:51.520> to

HTTP is a protocol that happens to
involve<00:00:51.910> computers<00:00:52.600> instead<00:00:52.870> of<00:00:52.990> humans<00:00:53.350> and

involve computers instead of humans and

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.590 
involve computers instead of humans and
here's<00:00:54.070> how<00:00:54.220> it<00:00:54.310> works<00:00:54.460> when<00:00:54.970> a<00:00:55.000> browser<00:00:55.240> wants

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
here's how it works when a browser wants

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.630 
here's how it works when a browser wants
to<00:00:55.720> show<00:00:55.930> a<00:00:55.960> human<00:00:56.380> a<00:00:56.440> web<00:00:56.620> page<00:00:56.800> it<00:00:57.220> initiates

who<00:01:44.770> then<00:01:44.950> returns<00:01:45.310> with<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:45.639> same<00:01:45.850> in<00:01:46.179> fact

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
who then returns with the same in fact

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:47.969 
who then returns with the same in fact
it's<00:01:46.869> for<00:01:47.020> this<00:01:47.079> very<00:01:47.139> reason<00:01:47.380> that<00:01:47.709> browsers

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
it's for this very reason that browsers

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.489 
it's for this very reason that browsers
are<00:01:48.399> often<00:01:48.700> called<00:01:48.939> clients<00:01:49.659> and<00:01:49.810> servers<00:01:50.200> are

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:50.499 
are often called clients and servers are

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:52.620 
are often called clients and servers are
called<00:01:50.679> well<00:01:50.889> servers<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.819> relationship<00:01:52.420> is

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
called well servers the relationship is

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.349 
called well servers the relationship is
very<00:01:52.899> much<00:01:53.079> the<00:01:53.289> same<00:01:53.439> it<00:01:54.280> makes<00:01:54.459> sense<00:01:54.639> all

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
very much the same it makes sense all

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:56.399 
very much the same it makes sense all
right<00:01:55.509> well<00:01:55.630> let's<00:01:55.780> take<00:01:55.929> a<00:01:55.990> look<00:01:56.079> at<00:01:56.319> an

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
right well let's take a look at an

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.459 
right well let's take a look at an
