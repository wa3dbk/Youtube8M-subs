the new cartoon bumblebee and once again
design-wise<00:00:22.339> I<00:00:22.880> really<00:00:23.150> dig<00:00:23.300> his<00:00:23.419> car<00:00:23.659> it's

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
design-wise I really dig his car it's

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.130 
design-wise I really dig his car it's
angular<00:00:24.169> it's<00:00:25.159> a<00:00:25.429> it's<00:00:26.419> got<00:00:26.570> some<00:00:26.720> neat<00:00:26.869> lines

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
angular it's a it's got some neat lines

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.849 
angular it's a it's got some neat lines
to<00:00:27.409> it<00:00:27.560> just<00:00:28.070> is<00:00:28.970> basically<00:00:29.359> a<00:00:29.859> animated

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
to it just is basically a animated

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.460 
to it just is basically a animated
angular<00:00:31.400> version<00:00:31.849> of<00:00:32.029> his<00:00:32.419> prime<00:00:32.750> mode

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
angular version of his prime mode

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.870 
angular version of his prime mode
considering<00:00:34.160> this<00:00:34.250> is<00:00:34.399> supposed<00:00:34.730> to<00:00:34.820> be

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
considering this is supposed to be

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.230 
considering this is supposed to be
apparently<00:00:35.300> an<00:00:35.960> extension<00:00:36.500> of<00:00:36.590> Prime<00:00:37.120> in<00:00:38.120> the

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:38.240 
apparently an extension of Prime in the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.230 
apparently an extension of Prime in the
future<00:00:38.690> this<00:00:39.650> is<00:00:39.920> a<00:00:39.950> actually<00:00:40.910> not<00:00:41.030> a<00:00:41.060> bad

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.240 
future this is a actually not a bad

design<00:00:41.690> for<00:00:41.900> bumblebee<00:00:42.230> I<00:00:42.260> like<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:42.710> colic

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
design for bumblebee I like the colic

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.930 
design for bumblebee I like the colic
his<00:00:43.130> pointy<00:00:43.490> bits<00:00:45.280> it's<00:00:46.280> got<00:00:46.400> a<00:00:46.430> sword<00:00:46.730> that

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
his pointy bits it's got a sword that

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.810 
his pointy bits it's got a sword that
stores<00:00:47.240> underneath<00:00:47.690> I<00:00:47.960> just<00:00:48.620> tap<00:00:49.430> it<00:00:49.550> right<00:00:49.700> on

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
stores underneath I just tap it right on

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.600 
stores underneath I just tap it right on
those<00:00:49.940> pegs<00:00:50.560> and<00:00:52.060> this<00:00:53.060> car<00:00:53.270> mode<00:00:53.450> so

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
those pegs and this car mode so

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.760 
those pegs and this car mode so
transform<00:00:55.610> him<00:00:56.260> kind<00:00:57.260> of<00:00:57.290> want<00:00:57.440> to<00:00:57.470> pull<00:00:57.680> those

shoulders<00:02:01.340> up<00:02:01.369> a<00:02:01.790> little<00:02:02.540> bit<00:02:02.720> gives<00:02:03.020> them<00:02:03.140> a

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
shoulders up a little bit gives them a

little<00:02:03.229> bit<00:02:03.350> more<00:02:03.439> room<00:02:03.939> and<00:02:04.939> I<00:02:05.540> think<00:02:05.720> that's

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
little bit more room and I think that's

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.840 
little bit more room and I think that's
a<00:02:05.930> cool<00:02:06.049> looking<00:02:06.260> bumblebee<00:02:06.740> I<00:02:06.920> know<00:02:07.340> it's

a cool looking bumblebee I know it's
bumblebee<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.360> everybody's<00:02:08.929> tired<00:02:09.170> of

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
bumblebee and everybody's tired of

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.850 
bumblebee and everybody's tired of
bumblebee<00:02:09.849> but<00:02:10.849> I<00:02:11.470> really<00:02:12.470> dig<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:12.709> like<00:02:12.800> I

there's there some issues like I wish
they'd<00:03:37.160> maybe<00:03:37.340> found<00:03:37.610> something<00:03:37.970> better<00:03:38.120> to

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
they'd maybe found something better to

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.850 
they'd maybe found something better to
do<00:03:38.510> with<00:03:38.750> this<00:03:38.900> whole<00:03:39.080> hood<00:03:39.290> assembly<00:03:39.710> then

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
do with this whole hood assembly then

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.740 
do with this whole hood assembly then
just<00:03:40.040> stick<00:03:40.220> it<00:03:40.340> on<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.520> back<00:03:40.670> of<00:03:40.700> his<00:03:40.880> legs<00:03:41.150> or

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
just stick it on the back of his legs or

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.960 
just stick it on the back of his legs or
at<00:03:41.840> least<00:03:42.080> since<00:03:42.590> there's<00:03:42.830> pegs<00:03:43.220> here<00:03:43.580> to<00:03:43.760> peg

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
at least since there's pegs here to peg

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.430 
at least since there's pegs here to peg
in<00:03:44.150> maybe<00:03:44.360> give<00:03:44.570> him<00:03:44.660> a<00:03:44.750> peg<00:03:44.930> hole<00:03:45.140> here<00:03:45.320> so

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
in maybe give him a peg hole here so

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.380 
in maybe give him a peg hole here so
this<00:03:45.560> could<00:03:45.770> sit<00:03:46.070> a<00:03:46.220> little<00:03:46.850> flatter<00:03:47.150> up

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
this could sit a little flatter up

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.630 
this could sit a little flatter up
against<00:03:47.810> his<00:03:48.680> back<00:03:48.950> leg<00:03:49.190> you<00:03:49.340> know<00:03:49.430> so<00:03:49.580> you

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
against his back leg you know so you

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.180 
against his back leg you know so you
maybe<00:03:49.850> tab<00:03:50.150> it<00:03:50.300> in<00:03:50.450> and<00:03:50.720> push<00:03:51.350> this<00:03:51.530> forward<00:03:51.800> so

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
maybe tab it in and push this forward so

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.950 
maybe tab it in and push this forward so
this<00:03:52.370> sat<00:03:52.670> flat<00:03:53.000> instead<00:03:53.390> of<00:03:53.510> having<00:03:53.810> this

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
this sat flat instead of having this

goes somewhere I think there's some
clever<00:04:02.540> design<00:04:02.870> choices<00:04:03.140> and<00:04:03.440> while<00:04:03.590> it<00:04:03.710> is

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800
