00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
up a little bit like Washington

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.680 
up a little bit like Washington
Washington<00:02:31.530> played<00:02:32.220> Stanford<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:32.970> then<00:02:33.450> went

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
Washington played Stanford and then went

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.280 
Washington played Stanford and then went
to<00:02:33.840> Oregon<00:02:34.050> okay<00:02:34.890> now<00:02:35.070> you've<00:02:35.250> got<00:02:35.460> UCLA

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
to Oregon okay now you've got UCLA

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.660 
to Oregon okay now you've got UCLA
following<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.410> same<00:02:37.620> pattern<00:02:38.040> here<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.550> we

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
following the same pattern here and we

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.360 
following the same pattern here and we
know<00:02:38.820> what<00:02:39.000> happened<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.450> Huskies<00:02:39.870> I

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370

don't<00:02:41.370> know<00:02:41.490> if<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:41.730> spells<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.330> good<00:02:42.840> system

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
don't know if it spells a good system

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.770 
don't know if it spells a good system
for<00:02:43.290> UCLA<00:02:43.950> yeah<00:02:44.490> I<00:02:44.520> think<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:45.330> got<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.570> worry

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
for UCLA yeah I think you got to worry

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.000 
for UCLA yeah I think you got to worry
about<00:02:45.900> when<00:02:46.080> you're<00:02:46.230> stepping<00:02:46.410> up<00:02:46.620> in<00:02:46.770> class

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
about when you're stepping up in class

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.770 
about when you're stepping up in class
and<00:02:47.310> all<00:02:47.400> these<00:02:47.550> gaming<00:02:47.880> games<00:02:48.240> back<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.750> back

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
the backwards Oregon's just coasting and

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.229 
the backwards Oregon's just coasting and
everything<00:02:51.660> is<00:02:51.810> fine<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.580> you<00:02:53.580> really<00:02:54.030> have

everything is fine and you really have
to<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:55.020> know<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.770> UCLA<00:02:56.250> looked<00:02:56.520> very<00:02:56.730> good

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
to I know that UCLA looked very good

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.610 
to I know that UCLA looked very good
when<00:02:57.120> they<00:02:57.209> played<00:02:57.390> in<00:02:57.480> Nebraska<00:02:57.959> but<00:02:58.140> we

really is you know you see late to go
ahead<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.820> go<00:03:06.030> through<00:03:06.330> all<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.600> one

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
ahead and go through all that and one

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.300 
ahead and go through all that and one
thing<00:03:07.020> with<00:03:07.170> this<00:03:07.260> total<00:03:07.680> like<00:03:07.770> sits<00:03:08.070> in<00:03:08.220> that

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
thing with this total like sits in that

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.120 
thing with this total like sits in that
78<00:03:08.790> it's<00:03:09.690> almost<00:03:09.900> like<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.440> do<00:03:10.560> power<00:03:10.770> ratings

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
78 it's almost like you do power ratings

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.710 
78 it's almost like you do power ratings
don't<00:03:11.250> work<00:03:11.580> because<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.270> got<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.480> take<00:03:12.570> the

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
don't work because you got to take the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.850

slightly higher than that you almost

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.420 
slightly higher than that you almost
have<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.790> multiply<00:03:21.299> by<00:03:21.600> 1.5<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.830> normalize<00:03:23.250> it

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
have to multiply by 1.5 to normalize it

I<00:03:27.120> would<00:03:27.570> expect<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.019> organ<00:03:28.410> defense<00:03:28.860> to

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
I would expect the organ defense to

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.090 
I would expect the organ defense to
contain<00:03:29.780> UCLA<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.810> little<00:03:31.140> bit<00:03:31.350> you<00:03:32.070> know

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
contain UCLA a little bit you know

contain UCLA a little bit you know
Washington<00:03:32.730> State<00:03:32.970> got<00:03:33.180> some<00:03:33.420> points<00:03:33.780> against

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
Washington State got some points against

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.949 
Washington State got some points against
them<00:03:34.350> but<00:03:34.830> Stanford<00:03:35.459> maybe<00:03:36.150> late<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:36.420> blueprint

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
them but Stanford maybe late a blueprint

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.710 
them but Stanford maybe late a blueprint
you<00:03:37.470> know<00:03:37.590> for<00:03:37.830> how<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.040> slow<00:03:38.700> down<00:03:38.880> this<00:03:39.090> UCLA

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
you know for how to slow down this UCLA

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.600 
you know for how to slow down this UCLA
offense<00:03:40.200> now<00:03:40.410> Stanford<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:41.040> know<00:03:41.100> is<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.370> more

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
offense now Stanford I know is a more

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.690 
offense now Stanford I know is a more
physical<00:03:42.140> NFL<00:03:43.140> Pro<00:03:43.170> style<00:03:43.799> team<00:03:44.160> than<00:03:44.400> oregon

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
is but you know I think organ is maybe a

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.460 
is but you know I think organ is maybe a
little<00:03:47.790> bit<00:03:47.970> underrated<00:03:48.299> defensively<00:03:48.930> organ

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
little bit underrated defensively organ

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.600 
little bit underrated defensively organ
going<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.739> run<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:49.950> table<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:50.340> be<00:03:50.459> in<00:03:50.519> the

going to run the table and be in the

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.720 
going to run the table and be in the
title<00:03:51.030> game<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.360> think<00:03:51.810> so<00:03:51.989> yeah<00:03:52.410> I<00:03:52.730> personally

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
title game I think so yeah I personally

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.479 
title game I think so yeah I personally
think<00:03:53.970> they're<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.239> best<00:03:54.540> team<00:03:55.040> now<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.100> know

think they're the best team now you know
Alabama<00:03:57.090> there's<00:03:57.510> certainly<00:03:58.170> plenty<00:03:58.500> of

Alabama there's certainly plenty of

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.289 
Alabama there's certainly plenty of
