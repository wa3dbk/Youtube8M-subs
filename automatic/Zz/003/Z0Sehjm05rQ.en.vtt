it's not a model kit this just fits in
right<00:02:17.200> up<00:02:17.440> here<00:02:18.250> in<00:02:18.370> fact<00:02:18.580> in<00:02:18.850> this<00:02:19.000> simplest

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
right up here in fact in this simplest

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
doesn't have a lot of extra ports to

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.740 
doesn't have a lot of extra ports to
allow<00:04:06.230> for<00:04:06.650> massive<00:04:07.400> amounts<00:04:07.490> of<00:04:07.850> additional

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
allow for massive amounts of additional

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.260 
allow for massive amounts of additional
playability<00:04:09.380> um<00:04:09.920> you<00:04:10.550> could<00:04:10.760> kind<00:04:11.090> of<00:04:11.150> give

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
playability um you could kind of give

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.920 
playability um you could kind of give
him<00:04:11.330> horse<00:04:11.720> legs<00:04:12.080> and<00:04:12.380> stuff<00:04:12.620> I<00:04:12.770> suppose<00:04:13.160> but

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
him horse legs and stuff I suppose but

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.289 
him horse legs and stuff I suppose but
the<00:04:14.930> only<00:04:15.080> open<00:04:15.709> spaces<00:04:16.070> are<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.669> pegs<00:04:16.970> on<00:04:17.150> his

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
the only open spaces are the pegs on his

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.570 
the only open spaces are the pegs on his
back<00:04:17.709> that's<00:04:18.709> really<00:04:19.070> about<00:04:19.250> it

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
back that's really about it

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.090 
back that's really about it
so<00:04:20.299> you'd<00:04:20.450> have<00:04:20.480> to<00:04:20.660> flop<00:04:20.959> around<00:04:20.989> leg<00:04:21.620> pieces

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
so you'd have to flop around leg pieces

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.290 
so you'd have to flop around leg pieces
and<00:04:22.310> stuff<00:04:22.490> and<00:04:22.700> see<00:04:22.820> what<00:04:22.910> you<00:04:23.030> can<00:04:23.090> come<00:04:23.240> up

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
and stuff and see what you can come up

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.630 
and stuff and see what you can come up
with<00:04:23.620> but<00:04:24.620> I'm<00:04:24.800> not<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:25.130> greatest<00:04:25.520> for

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
with but I'm not the greatest for

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.909 
with but I'm not the greatest for
customization<00:04:26.090> but<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:27.260> possibilities

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
customization but the the possibilities

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.610 
customization but the the possibilities
are<00:04:27.950> still<00:04:28.280> there<00:04:28.690> so<00:04:29.690> overall<00:04:30.020> I<00:04:30.140> think<00:04:30.350> is<00:04:30.590> a

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
are still there so overall I think is a

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.409 
are still there so overall I think is a
kind<00:04:31.070> of<00:04:31.160> neat<00:04:31.340> little<00:04:31.370> addition<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.210> plum

kind of neat little addition to the plum

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.930 
kind of neat little addition to the plum
