think it's a pretty good gameplay it's
definitely<00:00:20.730> my<00:00:20.820> best<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.330> far<00:00:21.359> in<00:00:21.689> advanced

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
definitely my best so far in advanced

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.370 
definitely my best so far in advanced
warfare<00:00:22.289> it's<00:00:22.470> also<00:00:22.590> my<00:00:22.890> first<00:00:23.160> DNA<00:00:23.760> bomb

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
warfare it's also my first DNA bomb

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.870 
warfare it's also my first DNA bomb
don't<00:00:25.380> think<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.769> I'll<00:00:25.859> get<00:00:26.010> one<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.519> fast

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
don't think that I'll get one this fast

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.880 
don't think that I'll get one this fast
again<00:00:27.420> at<00:00:27.630> least<00:00:27.750> for<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.080> while<00:00:28.170> because<00:00:28.500> this

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
again at least for a while because this

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.130 
again at least for a while because this
game<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.099> tough<00:00:29.580> there's<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.300> lot<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.599> stuff<00:00:31.109> to

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
game is tough there's a lot of stuff to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.840

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
sometimes or the hbr but this is

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.899 
sometimes or the hbr but this is
definitely<00:01:16.259> my<00:01:16.439> go-to<00:01:16.860> weapon<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.640> lot<00:01:17.820> of

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
definitely my go-to weapon and a lot of

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.310 
definitely my go-to weapon and a lot of
people<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.330> ak-12<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.140> right

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
people like the ak-12 but this right

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.109 
people like the ak-12 but this right
here<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.560> definitely<00:01:20.070> my<00:01:20.220> go-to<00:01:20.430> weapon<00:01:20.939> and

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
here is definitely my go-to weapon and

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.390 
here is definitely my go-to weapon and
seeing<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.320> get<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> DNA<00:01:22.650> bomb<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:23.220> it

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
seeing that I can get a DNA bomb with it

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.890 
seeing that I can get a DNA bomb with it
I<00:01:23.430> think<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.090> probably<00:01:24.570> one<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
I think that it is probably one of the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.539 
I think that it is probably one of the
best<00:01:25.020> weapons<00:01:25.380> within<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.740> game<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.430> if<00:01:26.490> you

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
best weapons within the game so if you

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.950 
best weapons within the game so if you
guys<00:01:26.640> want<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.030> definitely<00:01:27.390> check<00:01:27.659> out<00:01:27.750> that

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
guys want to definitely check out that

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.840 
guys want to definitely check out that
class<00:01:28.200> setup<00:01:28.500> video<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> couple<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.670> tips
