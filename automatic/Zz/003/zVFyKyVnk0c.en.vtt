00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.640
 my colleague Kouchner Rollen and I have set ourselves a powerful 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.460
 trekking tour is weighted as little as possible 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.350
 we did not want to jeopardize 15 20 kilos of XE like we used to do often enough 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.829
 wanted to have done 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:18.269
 Backpacks have weighed the first of the ten kilos 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:22.999
 Also, beer would be on tour for at least four to five five days and not 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:24.839
 binding overnight stays are scheduled 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:26.319
 in the tent or 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:27.550
 under the open sky 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.109
 what counts is black, of course 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.840
 because then this Prof Zion to save the tent because so sympathetic and were 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.280
 are also chosen a route because the Canary Island where his son the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.370
 Events usually at least that one has the tent also confidently 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.450
 can omit 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.490
 the add-on Canaria 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.990
 Straub with the leash 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.500
 a trekking tour is planned that leads across the island 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.610
 Mountain village San Martín 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.610
 16 cents 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.120
 basically stayed between supplied 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.680
 for the next four days 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.660
 the value 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.400
 is that different 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.400
 give the small rights at the start 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.610
 come over 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.610
 the poodles are better for me 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.330
 the reason to do everything around the order praise 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.780
 a try and then on the way he of course also together 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.970
 then pass it on 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.750
 the national park 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.970
 Violence is 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.510
 spend two real ones 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.470
 not included 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.470
 in front of the national park yield right 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.320
 "That worked pretty well on the whole 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.320
 promptly and the equipment the authorities had 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.030
 the ipad app so scared that many in the end really everyone exactly 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.950
 Coma had 2 kilograms new at least showed the airport construction 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.909
 there were the food of four days already that was types is natural 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.550
 and and cereal bars 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.409
 there was no plaintiff pasture 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.320
 also a very smart sleeping mat 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.049
 in the Bund reached sleeping bag 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.159
 Martin Denk Sammer has matured over it 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:14.609
 almost 500 grams 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.119
 We could have topics like that 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:19.119
 Humbug bags gave it 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:21.039
 each under one kilogram 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:22.650
 Paul Hogan 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.600
 Gasoline Corado of course heavier gas Corp. applied on the flight one 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.730
 Take gas cartridge so we had in the last knockout next to 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:32.549
 then just prescribe 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.540
 down the petrol at the gas station because you got the MSTR taken 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.029
 Although proven good 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:38.909
 Galbi not 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.219
 I also believed SUV 350 grams all in all, of course, the petrol engine 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:46.189
 So there we mix enough 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.630
 since finally the equipment worked well 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.989
 not let us down 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.609
 and many are 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.609
 to travel relatively comfortably 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.170
 as he lies by the key with not possible pain in shoulders arms 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.209
 to be allowed to sink onto the mattress 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.709
 such a possible relaxed 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.379
 because to lie down 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.039
 that was not quite so relaxed 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:11.839
 Attention was, among other things, and is 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:13.799
 becomes fasting 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.939
 Drinking water problem easy 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:17.639
 simply ignored 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.599
 not so many streams are flowing on the island so we 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.290
 Companies on sources and also supply station speaks shops 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.739
 on the way places were dependent 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.719
 but the Liberals then too far apart that we then up to 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:35.919
 it was a maximum of magazine liters of water to haul for two days 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:37.689
 at Skicrosser sports car manufacturer 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:39.749
 under the heat 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:43.629
 it had our weight he grew powerfully and increased 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:47.309
 and the relaxation also a bit displaced since we 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:51.359
 Ebner in Europe also had to contend victory when Löw from the world think that they 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.489
 exists also still possible on the spot and is really still water 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:55.829
 leads 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.179
 Grunder all of us went very well though 

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:01.179
 It also showed us that his lightweight tour 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:03.279
 mm 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:06.539
 Smith does not necessarily have a southern Kandahar 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:10.599
 Wu Vienna this water drinking problems prevails but that is 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.649
 certainly even easier opponents with the old wells than the quotas 

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:18.069
 you might have tossed many Leipzig with whom now 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:22.039
 but just always drinking water ready and with their PC, the three 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.039
 Men are finding 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.930
 the conclusion that the fcn- from this tour 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.340
 is consistently positive that pays off that has under the latter 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.129
 more fun times fast on the move man's mobile Rapidler 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:39.129
 Insurance 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.830
 give me more kilometers per day what crew more track and you enjoy these 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.610
 Track up 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.349
 Click point heavy backpack 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:49.169
 comes in Spangdahlem 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.120
 it just has more fun 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.420
 the enrollment you have to accept good draw with tweezers 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.210
 relative 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.360
 Warsaw before 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.360
 It's definitely worth trying out 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.870
 Best right on the doorstep in the Alps 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.030
 we definitely wish 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.940
 good times succeed
