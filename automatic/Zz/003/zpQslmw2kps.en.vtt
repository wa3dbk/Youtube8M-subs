harder to use with crochet than with

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.990 
harder to use with crochet than with
knitting<00:00:22.590> because<00:00:23.590> it's<00:00:24.250> very<00:00:24.489> difficult<00:00:24.849> to

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
around you can see where your stitches

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.270 
around you can see where your stitches
there's<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:00.940> stem<00:01:03.150> check<00:01:04.150> that<00:01:04.330> out

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
there's the stem check that out

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.640 
there's the stem check that out
there's<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.490> stem<00:01:06.820> of<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.330> first<00:01:07.659> stitch<00:01:07.990> if

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
there's the stem of the first stitch if

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.350 
there's the stem of the first stitch if
you<00:01:08.770> poke<00:01:09.010> around<00:01:09.190> you<00:01:09.700> can<00:01:09.880> see<00:01:10.120> by<00:01:10.300> the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
you poke around you can see by the

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.220 
you poke around you can see by the
second<00:01:10.840> stem<00:01:11.110> is<00:01:11.320> but<00:01:11.500> along<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.890> top<00:01:12.100> here

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
second stem is but along the top here

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.640 
second stem is but along the top here
you're<00:01:14.230> guessing<00:01:14.440> really<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:16.410> if<00:01:17.410> you're

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
you're guessing really and if you're

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.080 
you're guessing really and if you're
going<00:01:17.770> to<00:01:17.830> put<00:01:18.010> the<00:01:18.130> hook<00:01:18.310> exactly<00:01:18.820> where<00:01:18.970> it

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
going to put the hook exactly where it

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.090 
going to put the hook exactly where it
belongs<00:01:19.390> it's<00:01:19.780> it's<00:01:20.530> a<00:01:20.620> lot<00:01:20.740> of<00:01:20.830> fiddling

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
belongs it's it's a lot of fiddling

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.850 
belongs it's it's a lot of fiddling
around<00:01:21.190> it'd<00:01:21.490> take<00:01:21.670> you<00:01:21.790> forever<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:23.530> I<00:01:23.770> think

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
around it'd take you forever so I think

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.050 
around it'd take you forever so I think
the<00:01:24.160> best<00:01:24.340> way<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:26.110> my<00:01:26.260> experience<00:01:26.920> is<00:01:27.370> to

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
the best way and my experience is to

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.960 
the best way and my experience is to
just<00:01:28.270> work<00:01:28.510> between<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.230> stitches<00:01:29.970> there's

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
just work between the stitches there's

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.210 
just work between the stitches there's
no<00:01:31.240> point<00:01:31.600> doing<00:01:31.810> a<00:01:31.960> fancy<00:01:32.350> stitch<00:01:32.560> with

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
no point doing a fancy stitch with

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.290 
no point doing a fancy stitch with
fluffy<00:01:36.220> yarn<00:01:36.400> because<00:01:36.850> you<00:01:36.970> won't<00:01:37.090> see<00:01:37.420> it<00:01:39.300> so

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
fluffy yarn because you won't see it so

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.700 
fluffy yarn because you won't see it so
just<00:01:40.420> do<00:01:40.600> plain<00:01:40.840> stitches

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.300 

so<00:01:44.250> that's<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.610> first<00:01:44.790> chain<00:01:45.410> and<00:01:46.410> it's<00:01:47.130> also

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
so that's the first chain and it's also

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.000 
so that's the first chain and it's also
easier<00:01:47.970> if<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.810> don't<00:01:49.200> count<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.800> first

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
easier if you don't count the first

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:56.030 
easier if you don't count the first
chain<00:01:50.550> as<00:01:54.170> especially<00:01:55.170> turning<00:01:55.530> chain<00:01:55.770> don't

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
chain as especially turning chain don't

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.280 
chain as especially turning chain don't
count<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.550> as<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> stitch<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.690> quite<00:01:58.229> easy

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
count it as a stitch so it's quite easy

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.370 
count it as a stitch so it's quite easy
just<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:59.220> stick<00:01:59.460> your<00:01:59.640> finger<00:01:59.940> through<00:02:00.380> slip

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
just to stick your finger through slip

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.260 
just to stick your finger through slip
it<00:02:01.560> through<00:02:01.590> stick<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.430> through<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.850> can<00:02:03.030> see

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
it through stick it through you can see

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.200 
it through stick it through you can see
where<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> gaps<00:02:03.780> are

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
where the gaps are

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.120 
where the gaps are
because<00:02:06.210> otherwise<00:02:06.470> you're<00:02:07.470> guessing<00:02:07.920> and

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
because otherwise you're guessing and

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.919 
because otherwise you're guessing and
you<00:02:08.250> end<00:02:08.429> up<00:02:08.610> getting<00:02:08.729> too<00:02:09.030> many<00:02:09.179> stitches<00:02:09.330> too

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
you end up getting too many stitches too

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.830 
you end up getting too many stitches too
few<00:02:10.200> stitches

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
few stitches

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.690 
few stitches
it's<00:02:12.840> all<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.990> bit<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.320> mess<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:14.250> just<00:02:14.490> work

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
it's all a bit of a mess to just work

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.130 
it's all a bit of a mess to just work
between<00:02:15.030> stick<00:02:15.390> your<00:02:15.540> finger<00:02:15.840> through<00:02:15.959> you

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
between stick your finger through you

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.600 
between stick your finger through you
can<00:02:16.260> find<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.620> gap<00:02:16.770> there<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.010> stick<00:02:17.400> anything

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
can find the gap there I stick anything

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.800 
can find the gap there I stick anything
to<00:02:17.760> through<00:02:19.459> what<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.610> travel<00:02:20.970> into<00:02:21.180> there<00:02:21.390> as

I<00:02:25.790> can<00:02:26.790> wrap<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.030> round<00:02:27.980> you've<00:02:28.980> just<00:02:29.220> done

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
I can wrap it round you've just done

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:37.750 
I can wrap it round you've just done
that<00:02:29.610> one<00:02:31.880> just<00:02:32.880> go<00:02:33.030> into<00:02:33.270> every<00:02:33.630> gap

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.679 

you<00:02:38.330> won't<00:02:38.540> notice<00:02:38.689> the<00:02:38.989> difference<00:02:40.689> stitches

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
you won't notice the difference stitches

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:47.850 
you won't notice the difference stitches
maybe<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:42.110> tiny<00:02:42.500> bit<00:02:42.939> shorter<00:02:45.189> that's<00:02:46.189> about<00:02:46.489> it

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
maybe a tiny bit shorter that's about it

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.990 
maybe a tiny bit shorter that's about it
all<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.010> way<00:02:49.159> along<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.760> end<00:02:51.700> I'll<00:02:52.700> make

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
all the way along to the end I'll make

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.020 
all the way along to the end I'll make
it<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:53.390> much<00:02:53.780> quicker<00:02:54.049> and<00:02:54.349> easier<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:55.790> flop

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
it so much quicker and easier the flop

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.369 
it so much quicker and easier the flop
will<00:02:56.180> hide<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.750> all<00:02:58.569> it<00:02:59.569> look<00:02:59.780> exactly<00:03:00.140> the

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
will hide it all it look exactly the

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.059 
will hide it all it look exactly the
same<00:03:01.390> as<00:03:02.390> if<00:03:03.019> you<00:03:03.049> were<00:03:03.290> working<00:03:03.769> into<00:03:03.920> the

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
same as if you were working into the

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:15.690 
same as if you were working into the
stitch

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.230 

now<00:03:16.700> when<00:03:17.120> you<00:03:17.240> get<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:19.340> end<00:03:19.550> of<00:03:19.790> your<00:03:19.940> row

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.090 

because<00:03:23.240> you<00:03:23.450> didn't<00:03:25.180> sorry<00:03:26.980> because<00:03:27.980> you

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
because you didn't sorry because you

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.090 
because you didn't sorry because you
didn't<00:03:28.370> count<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:29.000> turning<00:03:29.420> chain<00:03:29.450> as<00:03:30.100> a

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
didn't count the turning chain as a

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.940 
didn't count the turning chain as a
stitch<00:03:32.050> we<00:03:33.050> get<00:03:33.200> to<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.440> last<00:03:33.650> one

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
stitch we get to the last one

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.470 
stitch we get to the last one
now<00:03:34.100> there's<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.490> stair<00:03:34.850> more<00:03:35.150> you<00:03:35.240> can't

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
now there's the stair more you can't

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.580 
now there's the stair more you can't
really<00:03:35.690> see<00:03:36.050> properly<00:03:37.480> that's<00:03:38.480> as<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.230> two

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
really see properly that's as the two

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.580 
really see properly that's as the two
holes<00:03:39.860> either<00:03:40.100> side<00:03:40.430> of<00:03:40.460> the<00:03:40.700> stem<00:03:41.530> on<00:03:42.530> the

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
holes either side of the stem on the

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:50.560 
holes either side of the stem on the
last<00:03:45.220> stitch<00:03:48.280> so<00:03:49.280> we'll<00:03:49.430> go<00:03:49.580> into<00:03:49.850> that<00:03:50.000> first

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
last stitch so we'll go into that first

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:56.770 
last stitch so we'll go into that first
hole<00:03:50.960> that<00:03:51.470> Earth<00:03:52.100> gap<00:03:52.460> and<00:03:53.830> then<00:03:54.830> into<00:03:55.780> the

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
hole that Earth gap and then into the

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.720 
hole that Earth gap and then into the
next<00:03:57.170> one<00:03:57.410> normally<00:03:57.950> you'd<00:03:58.070> be<00:03:58.100> going<00:03:58.370> into

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
next one normally you'd be going into

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.610 
next one normally you'd be going into
the<00:03:58.850> stitch<00:03:59.180> at<00:03:59.360> the<00:03:59.420> top<00:03:59.660> of<00:03:59.810> that<00:03:59.840> and<00:04:00.260> then

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
the stitch at the top of that and then

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.590 
the stitch at the top of that and then
into<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:01.040> turning<00:04:01.460> chain<00:04:01.490> as<00:04:01.880> well<00:04:02.120> because

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
into the turning chain as well because

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.570 
into the turning chain as well because
you<00:04:02.720> counted<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.260> turning<00:04:03.650> chain<00:04:03.680> as<00:04:04.520> a

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
you counted the turning chain as a

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.160 
you counted the turning chain as a
stitch<00:04:05.000> but<00:04:05.210> we're<00:04:05.330> not<00:04:05.480> counting<00:04:05.720> it<00:04:06.050> as<00:04:06.110> a

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
stitch but we're not counting it as a

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.770 
stitch but we're not counting it as a
stitch<00:04:06.530> so<00:04:06.800> we<00:04:07.580> only<00:04:07.730> need<00:04:07.850> to<00:04:08.180> do<00:04:08.330> that<00:04:08.480> last

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
stitch so we only need to do that last

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.860 
stitch so we only need to do that last
one<00:04:09.020> in<00:04:09.170> there<00:04:09.440> if<00:04:09.740> you<00:04:10.340> did<00:04:10.580> happen<00:04:10.820> to<00:04:11.060> count

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
one in there if you did happen to count

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.960 
one in there if you did happen to count
it<00:04:12.080> as<00:04:12.230> a<00:04:12.740> stitch<00:04:13.160> at<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.430> beginning<00:04:13.640> and

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
it as a stitch at the beginning and

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.860 
it as a stitch at the beginning and
missed<00:04:14.870> out<00:04:15.050> the<00:04:15.290> first<00:04:15.590> gap<00:04:16.810> at<00:04:17.810> the

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
missed out the first gap at the

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.450 
missed out the first gap at the
beginning<00:04:18.260> of<00:04:18.410> your<00:04:18.590> row<00:04:18.739> you<00:04:18.980> would<00:04:19.070> have<00:04:19.280> to

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:19.460 
beginning of your row you would have to

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.789 
beginning of your row you would have to
do<00:04:19.670> two<00:04:20.480> stitches<00:04:20.930> in<00:04:20.960> there<00:04:21.230> we're<00:04:21.590> just

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
do two stitches in there we're just

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.710 
do two stitches in there we're just
doing<00:04:21.950> the<00:04:22.160> one<00:04:22.340> and<00:04:22.550> then<00:04:22.940> three<00:04:23.150> chain<00:04:23.510> two

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
doing the one and then three chain two

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:36.290 
doing the one and then three chain two
turn<00:04:23.930> and<00:04:24.500> carry<00:04:25.010> on
