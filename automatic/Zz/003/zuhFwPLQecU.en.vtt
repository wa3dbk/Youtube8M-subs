know that Sony kind of keeps to a six

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.710 
know that Sony kind of keeps to a six
year<00:05:45.270> cycle<00:05:45.690> and<00:05:46.250> so<00:05:47.250> that<00:05:47.580> means<00:05:47.850> the<00:05:48.150> ps4<00:05:48.450> or

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
year cycle and so that means the ps4 or

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.150 
year cycle and so that means the ps4 or
whatever<00:05:49.170> they<00:05:49.350> decided<00:05:49.710> to<00:05:49.800> call<00:05:49.950> it

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
whatever they decided to call it

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.180 
whatever they decided to call it
shouldn't<00:05:50.790> be<00:05:50.880> accepted<00:05:51.300> to<00:05:51.330> around<00:05:52.190> twenty

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
shouldn't be accepted to around twenty

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.680 
shouldn't be accepted to around twenty
twelve<00:05:53.460> and<00:05:54.830> the<00:05:55.830> xbox<00:05:56.430> microsoft<00:05:56.820> their

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
twelve and the xbox microsoft their

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.110 
twelve and the xbox microsoft their
system<00:05:58.140> seemed<00:05:58.320> to<00:05:58.500> be<00:05:58.620> on<00:05:58.830> a<00:05:59.010> force<00:05:59.400> four-year

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
system seemed to be on a force four-year

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.820 
system seemed to be on a force four-year
cycle<00:06:00.270> so<00:06:00.660> I<00:06:00.870> definitely<00:06:01.290> thought<00:06:01.620> the

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
cycle so I definitely thought the

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.160 
cycle so I definitely thought the
PlayStation<00:06:02.490> 3<00:06:02.790> was<00:06:03.000> a<00:06:03.030> better<00:06:03.270> buy<00:06:03.480> and<00:06:03.780> of

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170 
PlayStation 3 was a better buy and of

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.690 
PlayStation 3 was a better buy and of
