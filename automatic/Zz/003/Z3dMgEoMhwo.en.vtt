00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
yeah like like a band Pro and basically

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.610 
yeah like like a band Pro and basically
what's<00:00:35.910> what's<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:36.840> with<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.380> that

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
what's what's going on with this is that

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
there was a sort of a need for a really

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.500 
there was a sort of a need for a really
high-end<00:00:42.860> artistic<00:00:43.860> cinematography<00:00:44.550> lens<00:00:46.460> to

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
kind of fit in an area that was sort of

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.290 
kind of fit in an area that was sort of
a<00:00:51.750> gap<00:00:52.010> in<00:00:53.010> existing<00:00:53.489> families<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.149> prime

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
a gap in existing families of prime

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.260 
a gap in existing families of prime
lenses<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.020> basically<00:00:55.579> was<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.969> lens

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
are identical in length all the gear

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.240 
are identical in length all the gear
positionings<00:01:12.210> are<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.450> same<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.250> well

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
positionings are the same and well

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.179 
positionings are the same and well
there's<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.299> 135<00:01:15.869> that's<00:01:16.110> slightly<00:01:16.409> longer<00:01:16.590> but

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
there's a 135 that's slightly longer but

the gear positions are the same also

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.249 
the gear positions are the same also
what's<00:01:19.830> really<00:01:19.860> unique<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:21.020> focus<00:01:22.020> scale

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
what's really unique is the focus scale

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.170 
what's really unique is the focus scale
between<00:01:22.470> infinity<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.070> six<00:01:23.430> feet<00:01:23.700> which<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.030> a

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
between infinity and six feet which is a

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.450 
between infinity and six feet which is a
common<00:01:24.570> range<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.930> pull<00:01:25.140> from<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.590> identical

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
common range to pull from is identical

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.060 
common range to pull from is identical
in<00:01:26.549> every<00:01:26.670> lens<00:01:27.060> regardless<00:01:27.780> if<00:01:27.930> it's<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.170> 100
