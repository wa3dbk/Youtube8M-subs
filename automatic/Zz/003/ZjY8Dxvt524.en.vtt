00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.689
 like BA, our body is at stake 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.689
 it's supposed to be dangerous situations 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.269
 which protects our body from cold or heat 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:27.610
 I was 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.800
 in order to grow and why we have to wake up again 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.280
 which changes take place during puberty 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.810
 an answer to this 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.440
 Sören further questions we find if we are with the same 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.030
 System of greeting and harmony of the human body deal 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.540
 the human body is one and the complex entity 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.230
 it is made up of different organs and is made up of trillions of cells 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.830
 composite 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.310
 to work together the various organs and cells too 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.259
 enable coordination and regulation systems are needed 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.870
 the body has two important systems for these tasks 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.290
 One is the nervous system that affects the brain and market 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.290
 Nerve fibers exists 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.080
 Löf is the hormone system or Endo Kringe system 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.660
 It is for different reasons 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.660
 are the hormones produce 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.560
 These glands release their hormones in the blood vessels 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.130
 a municipalities are chemical 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.750
 Beautiful messengers that use the circulatory system throughout the body 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.750
 can be distributed 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.150
 We recognize their specific goals by using recipes that are 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.290
 located on special surface 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.840
 The receptor is where the hormone attaches to the receptor 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.680
 Zeller can staple 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.190
 Hormones and receptor go together like key and lock 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.900
 the hormone that occupies a suitable receptor generates a projection in 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.409
 the cell in question 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.950
 For example, the hormone can cause the cell to make certain connections 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:27.019
 for example, produce more proteins 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.650
 But hormones can also make sure that the production of compounds in 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.650
 the cell is stopped 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.569
 The hormone system works slowly at a depth compared to the nervous system 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.720
 For example, you touch a hot iron 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.850
 then the nervous system reacts immediately and sends signals to the muscles like that 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.949
 that the hand is withdrawn 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:54.159
 in some 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.670
 one works together the nervous system in with the hormone system
