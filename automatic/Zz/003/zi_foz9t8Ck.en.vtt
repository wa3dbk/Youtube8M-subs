00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
PlayStation Move number of journalists

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.429 
PlayStation Move number of journalists
who<00:00:24.119> have<00:00:24.240> gotten<00:00:24.420> their<00:00:24.600> hands<00:00:24.810> on<00:00:25.019> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
who have gotten their hands on the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.500 
who have gotten their hands on the
PlayStation<00:00:25.980> Move<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.910> Sharpshooter

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
PlayStation Move and on the Sharpshooter

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.660 
PlayStation Move and on the Sharpshooter
I've<00:00:28.080> been<00:00:28.230> thinking<00:00:28.529> actually<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
I've been thinking actually this is the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.150 
I've been thinking actually this is the
killer<00:00:29.970> app<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.449> PlayStation<00:00:31.019> Move<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.470> we're

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
killer app for PlayStation Move so we're

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.530 
killer app for PlayStation Move so we're
going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.369> show<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.520> how<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.820> sharpshooter

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
going to show you how the sharpshooter

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.450 
going to show you how the sharpshooter
works<00:00:33.780> now<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.320> need<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.829> use<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.250> navigation

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
works now you need to use the navigation

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.819 
works now you need to use the navigation
controller<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.630> control<00:00:36.989> your<00:00:37.170> troopers<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.739> a

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
controller to control your troopers in a

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.280 
controller to control your troopers in a
first-person<00:00:38.370> shooter<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.870> actually

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
first-person shooter so that actually

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.319 
first-person shooter so that actually
just<00:00:40.500> snaps<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.160> right<00:00:41.370> here<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> real

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
just snaps in right here so the real

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.630 
just snaps in right here so the real
advantage<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.320> sharpshooter<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
advantage of the sharpshooter is the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.040 
advantage of the sharpshooter is the
fact<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.149> takes<00:00:45.329> advantage<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
fact that it takes advantage of the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.410 
fact that it takes advantage of the
extension<00:00:46.980> connector<00:00:47.489> that's<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:47.850> little

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
extension connector that's this little

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.360 
extension connector that's this little
port<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> bottom<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.530> your<00:00:49.620> PlayStation

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
port on the bottom of your PlayStation

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.740 
port on the bottom of your PlayStation
Lucent<00:00:50.670> oh<00:00:50.760> you're<00:00:50.940> by<00:00:51.059> wondering<00:00:51.600> what

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
Lucent oh you're by wondering what

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.209 
Lucent oh you're by wondering what
that's<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.739> first<00:00:52.949> time<00:00:53.100> it's

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
that's for is the first time it's

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.340 
that's for is the first time it's
actually<00:00:53.610> getting<00:00:53.879> used<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.690> goes<00:00:54.989> into<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
actually getting used that goes into the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.779 
actually getting used that goes into the
back<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.770> controller<00:00:56.129> so<00:01:01.640> games<00:01:02.640> like

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
back of the controller so games like

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.119 
back of the controller so games like
Killzone<00:01:03.120> 3<00:01:03.149> or<00:01:03.480> SOCOM<00:01:03.840> 4<00:01:04.140> they<00:01:04.350> utilize<00:01:04.830> all

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
Killzone 3 or SOCOM 4 they utilize all

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.230 
Killzone 3 or SOCOM 4 they utilize all
the<00:01:05.309> buttons<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> PlayStation<00:01:06.210> Move

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the buttons on the PlayStation Move

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.609 
the buttons on the PlayStation Move
controller<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.900> it'd<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.080> sort<00:01:07.530> of

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
controller and it'd be sort of

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.350 
controller and it'd be sort of
inconvenient<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.760> have<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.970> reach<00:01:09.180> on

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
inconvenient for you to have to reach on

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.910 
inconvenient for you to have to reach on
the<00:01:09.450> top<00:01:09.750> while<00:01:10.049> you're<00:01:10.200> trying<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.500> aim<00:01:10.680> and

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the top while you're trying to aim and

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.859 
the top while you're trying to aim and
shoot<00:01:11.040> at<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.250> same<00:01:11.430> time<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.330> extension

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
shoot at the same time so that extension

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.320 
shoot at the same time so that extension
connector<00:01:13.409> port<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:14.189> remaps<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.030> buttons

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
connector port that remaps the buttons

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
to other parts of the Sharpshooter now

to other parts of the Sharpshooter now
the<00:01:17.700> move<00:01:17.939> button<00:01:18.240> which<00:01:18.600> controls<00:01:19.259> going

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the move button which controls going

into and out of cover for Killzone 3 is

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.960 
into and out of cover for Killzone 3 is
mapped<00:01:22.140> underneath<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.159> trigger<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.729> can

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
mapped underneath the trigger so you can

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.700 
mapped underneath the trigger so you can
just<00:01:24.119> reach<00:01:24.330> under<00:01:24.509> there<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.350> want<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.590> go

just reach under there if you want to go

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.230 
just reach under there if you want to go
into<00:01:25.979> cover<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.310> then<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.759> use<00:01:26.909> your<00:01:27.060> thumb

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
into cover and then you use your thumb

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.480 
into cover and then you use your thumb
stick<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.720> keep<00:01:28.110> out<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.530> then<00:01:29.070> your<00:01:29.189> popping

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
stick to keep out and then your popping

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.020 
stick to keep out and then your popping
caps<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.420> really<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.290> said<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:34.610> it's<00:01:35.610> good<00:01:35.790> to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
caps so really I said that it's good to

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.420 
caps so really I said that it's good to
mention<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:36.600> also<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.020> placement<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.680> the
