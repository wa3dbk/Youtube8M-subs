00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.190
 blows after I finished 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.750
 throwing me counterattack and I turned 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.180
 it resulted from me kicking him back when 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.680
 he threw me the plane I got into his guard 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.000
 and I threw the right where I connected 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.340
