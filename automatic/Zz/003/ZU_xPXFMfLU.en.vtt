there<00:02:15.820> are<00:02:16.000> seven<00:02:16.480> hundred<00:02:16.810> meters<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.530> just

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
there are seven hundred meters that just

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.479 
there are seven hundred meters that just
that<00:02:18.040> little<00:02:18.340> burst<00:02:18.640> of<00:02:18.940> acceleration<00:02:20.489> the

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
that little burst of acceleration the

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.380 
that little burst of acceleration the
catch-up<00:02:21.730> game<00:02:22.180> from<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.540> Italians<00:02:23.019> I

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
catch-up game from the Italians I

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.670 
catch-up game from the Italians I
actually<00:02:25.390> think<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.019> New<00:02:26.170> Zealanders

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
actually think the New Zealanders

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.530 
actually think the New Zealanders
through<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.280> time<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:27.910> two<00:02:28.090> weeks<00:02:28.330> they

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
through that time that two weeks they

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.780 
through that time that two weeks they
had<00:02:28.780> while<00:02:29.050> Luna<00:02:29.800> Rossa<00:02:29.950> week<00:02:30.340> against

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
had while Luna Rossa week against

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.910 
had while Luna Rossa week against
Artemis<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.570> think<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.989> museum<00:02:32.140> just<00:02:32.500> stepped

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
Artemis I think the museum just stepped

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.650 
Artemis I think the museum just stepped
it<00:02:33.070> up<00:02:33.130> again<00:02:35.040> another<00:02:36.040> polished<00:02:37.000> performance

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
it up again another polished performance

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.340 
it up again another polished performance
by<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.739> Kiwis<00:02:39.160> as<00:02:40.060> they<00:02:40.269> come<00:02:40.480> in<00:02:40.600> to<00:02:40.630> mark<00:02:40.959> for

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
by the Kiwis as they come in to mark for

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.819 
by the Kiwis as they come in to mark for
now<00:02:41.739> make<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.190> right-hand<00:02:42.700> turn<00:02:43.620> sprint<00:02:44.620> across

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
now make a right-hand turn sprint across

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.800 
now make a right-hand turn sprint across
to<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.220> finish<00:02:45.549> I<00:02:45.880> think<00:02:46.720> they<00:02:47.019> just

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
to the finish I think they just

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.089 
to the finish I think they just
raising<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.900> standard<00:02:49.380> raising<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.890> bar

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
raising the standard raising the bar

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.240 
raising the standard raising the bar
internally

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
internally

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.070 
internally
we<00:02:52.520> talk<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:52.790> lot<00:02:53.000> about<00:02:53.060> making<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.720> boat<00:02:53.870> go

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
we talk a lot about making the boat go

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.570 
we talk a lot about making the boat go
faster<00:02:54.350> but<00:02:55.630> zeroing<00:02:56.630> in<00:02:56.750> on<00:02:56.990> it<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:58.250> crew

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
faster but zeroing in on it the crew

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.600 
faster but zeroing in on it the crew
work<00:02:58.820> is<00:02:59.120> accuracy

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
work is accuracy

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.580
