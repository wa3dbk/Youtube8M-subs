00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.990 
front I think it just adds a really
modern<00:03:38.629> touch<00:03:39.109> it's<00:03:39.650> sort<00:03:39.919> of<00:03:39.979> unique<00:03:40.400> and

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
gives it a little bit of edge but that's

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.460 
gives it a little bit of edge but that's
still<00:03:43.280> totally<00:03:43.790> appropriate<00:03:44.060> for<00:03:44.900> work<00:03:45.109> which
