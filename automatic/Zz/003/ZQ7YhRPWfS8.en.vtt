on<00:02:08.550> even<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.929> it's<00:02:10.349> not<00:02:10.560> that

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
on even so it's not that

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.880 
on even so it's not that
your<00:02:11.159> hair<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.519> damaged<00:02:12.030> or<00:02:12.150> anything<00:02:12.390> or<00:02:12.890> you

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
your hair is damaged or anything or you

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.399 
your hair is damaged or anything or you
have<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.129> thin<00:02:14.519> spot<00:02:14.909> let's<00:02:15.390> just<00:02:15.659> say<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.260> know

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
have a thin spot let's just say you know

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.780 
have a thin spot let's just say you know
that<00:02:16.620> you're<00:02:16.829> taking<00:02:17.069> good<00:02:17.340> care<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.670> your

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
that you're taking good care of your

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.940 
that you're taking good care of your
hair<00:02:18.090> it's<00:02:18.659> just<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:19.170> your<00:02:19.319> hair<00:02:19.530> grows<00:02:19.799> at

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
hair it's just that your hair grows at

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.740 
hair it's just that your hair grows at
different<00:02:19.980> rates<00:02:20.519> so<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:20.849> was<00:02:21.150> just<00:02:21.510> not

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
different rates so I was just not

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.660 
different rates so I was just not
cutting<00:02:22.200> your<00:02:22.349> hair<00:02:22.590> because<00:02:23.129> if<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.400> cut

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
cutting your hair because if you cut

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.940 
cutting your hair because if you cut
your<00:02:23.879> hair<00:02:24.120> it's<00:02:24.810> gonna<00:02:25.019> go<00:02:25.260> back<00:02:25.469> in<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.709> same

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
your hair it's gonna go back in the same

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.460 
your hair it's gonna go back in the same
way<00:02:26.159> no<00:02:26.370> matter<00:02:26.400> what<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:27.180> do<00:02:27.420> it's<00:02:28.260> gonna

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
way no matter what you do it's gonna

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.460 
way no matter what you do it's gonna
grow<00:02:28.709> back<00:02:28.799> you<00:02:29.400> know<00:02:29.549> faster<00:02:30.269> over<00:02:30.720> here<00:02:31.079> and

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
grow back you know faster over here and

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.589 
grow back you know faster over here and
you<00:02:32.069> know<00:02:32.159> a<00:02:32.189> little<00:02:32.459> bit<00:02:32.549> slower<00:02:32.849> over<00:02:33.269> here

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
you know a little bit slower over here

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.990 
you know a little bit slower over here
so<00:02:34.170> once<00:02:34.739> you<00:02:34.890> cut<00:02:35.129> it<00:02:35.159> it's<00:02:35.489> gonna<00:02:35.700> grow<00:02:35.909> back

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
so once you cut it it's gonna grow back

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.910 
so once you cut it it's gonna grow back
in<00:02:36.359> the<00:02:36.450> same<00:02:36.720> rate<00:02:36.959> that<00:02:36.989> it's<00:02:37.290> growing<00:02:37.560> it's

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
in the same rate that it's growing it's

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.849 
in the same rate that it's growing it's
gonna<00:02:38.069> show<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.489> little<00:02:38.730> capping<00:02:39.209> on<00:02:40.049> even

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
gonna show that little capping on even

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.800 
gonna show that little capping on even
groups<00:02:41.129> and<00:02:41.430> things<00:02:41.639> like<00:02:41.819> that<00:02:41.879> so<00:02:42.569> I<00:02:42.599> would

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
groups and things like that so I would

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.720 
groups and things like that so I would
suggest<00:02:42.989> that<00:02:43.349> you<00:02:43.470> not<00:02:43.920> cut<00:02:44.250> but<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.609> at

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
suggest that you not cut but you at

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.020 
suggest that you not cut but you at
least<00:02:44.909> dust<00:02:45.329> your<00:02:45.540> hair<00:02:46.430> dust<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.730> stretch

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
least dust your hair dust it stretch

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.509 
least dust your hair dust it stretch
keep<00:02:48.510> split<00:02:48.870> ends<00:02:49.260> from<00:02:49.439> four<00:02:49.799> men<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.250> just

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
keep split ends from four men and just

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.550 
keep split ends from four men and just
uh<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:51.180> could<00:02:51.510> dust<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.930> little<00:02:52.139> bit<00:02:52.349> just

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
uh you could dust it a little bit just

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.589 
uh you could dust it a little bit just
to<00:02:52.680> help<00:02:53.489> bring<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:56.489> short<00:02:56.849> ends<00:02:57.239> in<00:02:57.299> and<00:02:57.450> long

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
to help bring the short ends in and long

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.220 
to help bring the short ends in and long
ends<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:58.049> little<00:02:58.319> bit<00:02:58.500> closer<00:02:58.980> but<00:02:59.459> not<00:02:59.669> so<00:03:00.230> that

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
ends a little bit closer but not so that

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.250 
ends a little bit closer but not so that
it<00:03:01.379> looks<00:03:01.700> dramatically<00:03:02.700> uneven<00:03:03.569> so<00:03:04.049> I<00:03:04.109> would

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
it looks dramatically uneven so I would

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.050 
it looks dramatically uneven so I would
suggest<00:03:04.409> that<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:04.919> dust<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.459> just<00:03:05.669> to<00:03:05.790> help

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
suggest that you dust it just to help

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.240 
suggest that you dust it just to help
bring<00:03:06.329> it<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.689> little<00:03:06.959> bit<00:03:07.379> closer<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:08.099> each

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
bring it a little bit closer to each

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.149 
bring it a little bit closer to each
other<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.760> not<00:03:08.939> cutting<00:03:09.359> it<00:03:09.950> another<00:03:10.950> thing

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
other and not cutting it another thing

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.679 
other and not cutting it another thing
that<00:03:11.189> I<00:03:11.340> would<00:03:11.459> suggest<00:03:11.669> is<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.480> add<00:03:12.659> more

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
that I would suggest is to add more

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.800 
that I would suggest is to add more
proteins<00:03:13.439> to<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.769> ends<00:03:14.189> of<00:03:14.250> your<00:03:14.340> hair<00:03:14.810> like

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
proteins to the ends of your hair like

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.649 
proteins to the ends of your hair like
the<00:03:16.139> a<00:03:16.169> Fuji<00:03:16.760> green<00:03:17.760> tea<00:03:18.000> two-minute

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 
the a Fuji green tea two-minute

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.099 
the a Fuji green tea two-minute
Reconstructor<00:03:19.519> rise<00:03:20.519> in<00:03:20.819> green<00:03:21.599> tea<00:03:21.870> spray

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
Reconstructor rise in green tea spray

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.469 
Reconstructor rise in green tea spray
add<00:03:22.919> that<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.639> ends<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:24.000> hair<00:03:24.180> just<00:03:24.419> to

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:24.479 
add that to the ends of a hair just to

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.509 
add that to the ends of a hair just to
keep<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:24.930> strong<00:03:25.319> keep<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.859> from<00:03:25.979> breaking

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
keep it strong keep it from breaking

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.189 
keep it strong keep it from breaking
and<00:03:26.669> keep<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.120> thickness<00:03:27.569> side<00:03:27.780> does<00:03:28.019> not

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
and keep the thickness side does not

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.580 
and keep the thickness side does not
thin<00:03:28.739> away<00:03:29.069> also<00:03:29.819> add<00:03:30.299> protein<00:03:30.930> conditioners

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
thin away also add protein conditioners

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.800 
thin away also add protein conditioners
to<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:31.859> end<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.250> your<00:03:32.400> hair<00:03:32.669> whenever<00:03:33.180> your

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.099 
suggest is to actually do a stretch I
suggest<00:04:08.159> doing<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.430> stretch<00:04:08.729> maybe<00:04:09.359> five

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
suggest doing a stretch maybe five

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.819 
suggest doing a stretch maybe five
months<00:04:10.759> plus<00:04:11.759> or<00:04:12.180> four<00:04:12.870> months<00:04:13.199> plus<00:04:13.470> stretch

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
months plus or four months plus stretch

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.849 
months plus or four months plus stretch
on<00:04:14.189> the<00:04:14.759> nape<00:04:15.030> section<00:04:15.389> only<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:16.199> I<00:04:16.470> said<00:04:16.709> it's

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
on the nape section only and I said it's

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.879 
on the nape section only and I said it's
because<00:04:17.009> a<00:04:17.519> lot<00:04:17.970> of<00:04:18.449> people<00:04:19.109> who<00:04:19.320> are<00:04:19.469> relaxed

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
because a lot of people who are relaxed

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.640 
because a lot of people who are relaxed
or<00:04:20.190> natural<00:04:20.760> or<00:04:20.849> whatever<00:04:21.299> your<00:04:22.019> name<00:04:22.320> tends

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
or natural or whatever your name tends

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.950 
or natural or whatever your name tends
to

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
to

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.129 
to
very<00:04:23.620> very<00:04:23.800> slow<00:04:24.250> not<00:04:25.210> saying<00:04:25.479> that<00:04:25.570> everyone

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
very very slow not saying that everyone

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.969 
very very slow not saying that everyone
but<00:04:27.509> this<00:04:28.509> is<00:04:28.720> something<00:04:29.050> that<00:04:29.320> I<00:04:29.440> experienced

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
but this is something that I experienced

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.430 
but this is something that I experienced
my<00:04:30.520> knee<00:04:30.580> actually<00:04:31.090> grow<00:04:31.449> really<00:04:31.720> really<00:04:32.080> slow

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
my knee actually grow really really slow

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.650 
my knee actually grow really really slow
so<00:04:32.740> what<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.220> did<00:04:33.520> was<00:04:33.699> I<00:04:33.850> did<00:04:33.880> a<00:04:34.060> six-month

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
so what I did was I did a six-month

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.439 
so what I did was I did a six-month
stretch<00:04:34.930> on<00:04:35.139> my<00:04:35.289> name<00:04:35.500> and<00:04:35.740> that<00:04:36.430> just<00:04:37.000> helped

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
stretch on my name and that just helped

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.620 
stretch on my name and that just helped
everything<00:04:38.440> because<00:04:38.889> it<00:04:39.190> helped<00:04:39.490> my<00:04:39.610> Nate<00:04:40.090> to

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
everything because it helped my Nate to

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.020 
everything because it helped my Nate to
get<00:04:40.810> a<00:04:40.840> little<00:04:41.169> vacation<00:04:41.590> to<00:04:42.280> help<00:04:42.460> me<00:04:42.610> retain

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
get a little vacation to help me retain

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.210 
get a little vacation to help me retain
more<00:04:43.300> new<00:04:43.539> growth<00:04:43.810> as<00:04:43.990> much<00:04:44.229> as<00:04:44.410> possible<00:04:44.650> and

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
more new growth as much as possible and

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.310 
more new growth as much as possible and
then<00:04:45.280> when<00:04:45.910> it<00:04:46.030> was<00:04:46.150> time<00:04:46.360> for<00:04:46.389> me<00:04:46.630> to<00:04:46.750> relax

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
then when it was time for me to relax

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.790 
then when it was time for me to relax
I<00:04:47.470> had<00:04:48.280> retain<00:04:49.060> a<00:04:49.090> lot<00:04:49.479> of<00:04:49.630> length<00:04:49.840> so<00:04:50.110> that<00:04:50.139> the

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
I had retain a lot of length so that the

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.860 
I had retain a lot of length so that the
majority<00:04:51.400> of<00:04:51.430> my<00:04:51.639> neck<00:04:51.910> was<00:04:52.120> able<00:04:52.539> to<00:04:52.570> catch<00:04:52.840> up

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
majority of my neck was able to catch up

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.020 
majority of my neck was able to catch up
a<00:04:53.199> little<00:04:53.440> bit<00:04:53.650> with<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:53.889> rest<00:04:54.130> of<00:04:54.340> my<00:04:54.490> hair<00:04:54.820> so

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
a little bit with the rest of my hair so

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.240 
a little bit with the rest of my hair so
I<00:04:55.330> would<00:04:55.509> suggest<00:04:55.690> that<00:04:55.990> you<00:04:56.110> do<00:04:56.410> a<00:04:56.440> nape

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
I would suggest that you do a nape

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.890 
I would suggest that you do a nape
stretch<00:04:57.639> so<00:04:58.509> that<00:04:58.780> you<00:04:59.380> can<00:05:00.570> fill<00:05:01.570> in<00:05:01.720> that<00:05:01.840> gap

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
stretch so that you can fill in that gap

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.560 
stretch so that you can fill in that gap
that's<00:05:02.500> mostly<00:05:03.430> caused<00:05:03.669> by<00:05:03.699> your<00:05:04.000> knee<00:05:04.150> which

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
that's mostly caused by your knee which

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.300 
that's mostly caused by your knee which
makes<00:05:04.870> your<00:05:05.020> hair<00:05:05.229> to<00:05:05.320> look<00:05:05.380> like<00:05:05.470> it's<00:05:05.770> upside

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
makes your hair to look like it's upside

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.180 
makes your hair to look like it's upside
down<00:05:06.490> you<00:05:06.759> or<00:05:07.180> upside<00:05:07.720> down<00:05:07.930> w<00:05:08.410> or<00:05:08.560> whatever

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
down you or upside down w or whatever

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.400 
down you or upside down w or whatever
but<00:05:09.880> I<00:05:09.940> think<00:05:10.060> it's<00:05:10.449> definitely<00:05:10.720> you<00:05:11.289> know

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410
