 so here is today look what 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.250
 what we see a new weapon 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.740
 pacifier so this is new there 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.730
 the new two bo2 pack that gives 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.500
 go out and I will go to hurry up 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.000
 show you not both parties 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.200
 normal and parties that I did on 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.180
 on these maps 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.239
 so as you can see there is 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.040
 hydro then dronde inch 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.480
 I have no thanks to pronounce themselves well 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.640
 dirty and mirage i'm not sure that the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.920
 more than four but hey it's 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.180
 four that I have found that I come that 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.280
 I was happy just to make them 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.980
 so let's start with this one is 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.460
 so past I was pleasantly surprised 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.030
 in fact I found it was babes 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.930
 map 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.920
 I did not have too many 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.650
 worry with one or the other good good 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.500
 sure i did not do fabulous scores i 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.760
 do not know what I had in all 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:25.770
 I did not have to have much because 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.770
 that I have nothing output is so good here 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.590
 so there it was the last one 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:41.830
 I did so I had the I believe that 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.780
 I had camouflage of issue where 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.500
 this is you camouflage and I had 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.640
 already the laser sight 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.869
 so that was the last one I came 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.830
 do I always took this weapon is 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.759
 so bah when you see there when 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.759
 not bad corner rats 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.710
 so well this weapon I still like 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.450
 not bad 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.050
 she is not bad I like them well I 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.840
 think in the future when I 'm done 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.790
 of a little bit to bring up all 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.190
 my weapons I think maybe it's 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.660
 one of the weapons with which I am going 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.850
 I'm going to play a lot and it's perfect 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.540
 I like his original camouflage 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.340
 I put the autumn camouflage 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.739
 that we will have as founder but good 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:44.760
 I prefer almost camouflage 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:46.200
 original is not bad to open 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.459
 when we go down there we can world 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.459
 back up that one side of the other 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.750
 well, I'll leave you a little bit 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.720
 discover there is not much to say 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.370
 when all the good cases I have not really 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.360
 looked around me there but my show 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.100
 country she is bright she and that's 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.320
 a map that I enjoy because 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.400
 there is a lot of left passing at 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.140
 right 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.510
 and for those who will favor a 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.900
 little bit there speed running everywhere 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.200
 I think it's going to be a map that goes 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.340
 who will do it 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.990
 run a little bit everywhere for auch and 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.870
 it'll be a good maps for campers 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.430
 there they will not fizzle 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.710
 because there are so many ways to 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.400
 bypass and crossing in 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.170
 below per hour above that the 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.610
 campers they have they interest in doing 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.200
 Warning 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.930
 they will not be able to camp like leila 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:57.430
 opposite there in the small shop 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:57.430
 the v12 coming out some akismet 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.450
 after that I looked in the hole then 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.799
 I do not know if we can jump 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.569
 I did not dare to try I did not want 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:15.870
 to die that bah I guess he has that 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:17.760
 will say that if we die or not so here 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.810
 weary window not have them a 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.810
 little pale and there I thought 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.430
 so beat him with not much to 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.530
 I think I could leave one or 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.120
 two sessions but funny facebook to 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.600
 new points it's with grills 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.600
 ah good 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.539
 when you see full passage everywhere 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.120
 we can go back by 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.800
 ten and yes it's yes we did it we turned 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.289
 still remains in the part of this 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.559
 field and there really was the 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:28.569
 from below we actually come to 

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:31.710
 catch up with the other side or by group 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.710
 ares the other side there 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.990
 so good it goes a little better with 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:49.129
 bo dg a little less harm 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:51.710
 now is good so that's it 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:53.149
 what did I say you saw that 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:58.129
 it's a hardcore action she was 

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:59.360
 won for me but hey that's it 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:03.169
 the guy he had nothing to do they 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.089
 had lived in the corner and he had 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.939
 nothing to do and I introduced myself to 

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:08.930
 here he is you I did the action I 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:11.149
 I went to get him 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.740
 bah and it did not pay because 

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:14.569
 why not because it takes a lot 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.129
 of bullets to kill them while there 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:19.309
 you forgot about his snipe the other one there 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:21.830
 and put me half a ball and the 

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:23.089
 Chinese and that's with its appearance and then 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.849
 he was waiting almost to aim at the 

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:28.930
 Wii must Bonser's first all 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:32.300
 but it's tiring to have 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.370
 never miss the balls that I prefer 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.979
 play rare body besides me 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.169
 just I went to see the mode 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:40.939
 hardcore there on these maps there we can not 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:43.430
 choose if you want hardcore player on 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:49.129
 the maps there and it's a little bit 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:50.360
 pity but still good the excess pact 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:53.149
 we can never do what we want with 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.560
 Thursday maps to the game modes we 

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:56.900
 wants to everything as we want 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.350
 they put restrictions it does not take 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.350
 why besides 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.620
 we know about ben I was going to say yeah I 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:14.110
 in series of points I do not have my grand 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.710
 thing and everything but I do not know if on 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.949
 this map 

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:20.199
 we will make a big card the helicopters 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:24.760
 shelling because hey we can 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:27.639
 easily hide and that's it but 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.620
 rather I do not know what is going to be 

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:31.840
 good in a series of eliminations on this 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:35.530
 map may prefer rather the 

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:37.510
 drones or that kind of thing what to ag 

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:41.110
 but each time I have alas who 

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:45.130
 fell a formidable like cocks the 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:47.290
 little bit in the titan woods and 

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.590
 it was not bad I think it's like 

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:52.150
 it's the sewers 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.979
 she had on board I made myself 

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.330
 take 

00:07:52.979 --> 00:08:00.850
 and there it will be the last one he cam 

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:02.620
 final where we will take it also traveling 

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.360
 fires first he fired second 

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:07.120
 but hey it's a shame we will not see the 

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.070
 case of final final scabies in truth 

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.590
 low and the other one he's going to kill and I'm 

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.970
