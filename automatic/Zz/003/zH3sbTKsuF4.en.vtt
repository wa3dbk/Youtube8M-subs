00:00:07.403 --> 00:00:12.479
 David The Glory: The Throne 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.140
 (A woman behind the camera) Flanbda 

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:20.878
 (A man behind the camera) If 20 seconds of silence, please 

00:00:21.618 --> 00:00:23.309
 (A man behind the chimera) quiet 

00:00:26.322 --> 00:00:29.603
 (Glorification) I see the head as if he painted it 

00:00:29.603 --> 00:00:31.603
 Some sculptors carve the drawings 

00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:34.140
 And I make the head 

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:41.243
 Is just a way to use this framework 

00:00:42.347 --> 00:00:45.952
 Try to blend colors with materials 

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.079
 That's why I see them like cartoons 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.878
 I've always made them 

00:00:50.878 --> 00:00:53.941
 I've always been in Bali 

00:00:55.971 --> 00:00:59.241
 I think it's really the right size 

00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:02.403
 I also think it is the center of the universe 

00:01:02.602 --> 00:01:07.911
 I liked the idea that the universe was the size of a head 

00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:10.677
 By the greatest explosion 

00:01:14.622 --> 00:01:16.371
 When I was working on a TV program, 

00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:20.171
 I used to make heads of used materials 

00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:21.979
 In the main part 

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:27.652
 So every head I make belongs to the program in some way 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.573
 Then take the head, and put it here in the corner of the room 

00:01:33.573 --> 00:01:36.110
 And then to the other corner 

00:01:36.942 --> 00:01:40.881
 After a while I had formed his idea of ​​what I was looking for 

00:01:43.629 --> 00:01:49.811
 I love ideas that are inside and outside and not limited 

00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:54.503
 Unstretched and infinitely small, mind 

00:01:55.478 --> 00:01:57.541
 It is all in the head 

00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:03.280
 So I will leave it as a framework for my work 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.909
 I think, forever
