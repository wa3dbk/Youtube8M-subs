00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
I see this only happens when I am

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.149 
I see this only happens when I am
willing<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.840> part<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.440> lesson<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.799> says

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
willing the part of the lesson that says

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.830 
willing the part of the lesson that says
above<00:01:08.760> all<00:01:09.090> else<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.960> meaningful<00:01:10.650> here<00:01:11.100> unless

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
above all else is meaningful here unless

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.720 
above all else is meaningful here unless
I<00:01:12.840> really<00:01:13.380> want<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.980> see<00:01:14.190> things<00:01:14.430> differently

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
I really want to see things differently

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.410 
I really want to see things differently
I<00:01:15.300> will<00:01:15.660> bring<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.170> past<00:01:16.440> to<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.800> present

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
I will bring the past to the present

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.750 
I will bring the past to the present
right<00:01:18.420> now<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.960> am<00:01:19.170> working<00:01:19.470> with<00:01:19.650> above<00:01:20.400> all

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
right now I am working with above all

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
right now I am working with above all
else<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.560> find<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.800> often<00:01:23.370> it<00:01:23.940> isn't<00:01:24.240> above

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
else I find that often it isn't above

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.550 
else I find that often it isn't above
all<00:01:24.990> else

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
all else

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.890 
all else
but<00:01:26.190> today's<00:01:26.550> lesson<00:01:27.030> brings<00:01:27.330> me<00:01:27.570> closer

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
but today's lesson brings me closer

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.550 
but today's lesson brings me closer
through<00:01:28.890> consistent<00:01:29.370> practice<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:31.110> letting

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
through consistent practice to letting

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.700 
through consistent practice to letting
that<00:01:31.950> above<00:01:32.580> all<00:01:32.850> else<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.630> want<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.290> see<00:01:34.470> things

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
that above all else I want to see things

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.890 
that above all else I want to see things
differently<00:01:35.010> a<00:01:35.520> little<00:01:35.970> closer<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.750> my

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
knowing that this practice will lead me

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.870

can - I was struck by the reference to

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.690 
can - I was struck by the reference to
the<00:06:45.700> table<00:06:46.090> as<00:06:46.240> a<00:06:46.270> way<00:06:46.540> of<00:06:46.570> gaining<00:06:46.960> vision<00:06:47.700> it

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.700 
the table as a way of gaining vision it

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.210 
the table as a way of gaining vision it
may<00:06:49.000> not<00:06:49.240> be<00:06:49.450> particularly<00:06:50.010> flattering<00:06:51.010> that

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
may not be particularly flattering that

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.280 
may not be particularly flattering that
we<00:06:51.370> aren't<00:06:51.670> essentially<00:06:52.450> different<00:06:52.960> from<00:06:53.170> the

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290 
we aren't essentially different from the

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.590 
we aren't essentially different from the
table<00:06:53.680> in<00:06:53.830> sharing<00:06:54.640> the<00:06:54.760> purpose<00:06:55.210> of<00:06:55.420> the

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 
table in sharing the purpose of the

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.650 
table in sharing the purpose of the
universe<00:06:56.080> but<00:06:56.890> it<00:06:57.010> does<00:06:57.250> eliminate<00:06:58.000> a<00:06:58.210> lot<00:06:58.480> of

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:58.660 
universe but it does eliminate a lot of

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.010 
universe but it does eliminate a lot of
complications<00:06:59.290> I<00:06:59.790> think<00:07:00.790> the<00:07:00.940> point<00:07:01.240> is<00:07:01.600> that

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
complications I think the point is that

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.380 
complications I think the point is that
there<00:07:02.230> is<00:07:02.380> nothing<00:07:02.830> outside<00:07:03.370> of<00:07:03.430> our<00:07:03.700> mind<00:07:04.060> and

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.390 
there is nothing outside of our mind and

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.140 
there is nothing outside of our mind and
our<00:07:05.050> real<00:07:05.440> mind<00:07:05.800> is<00:07:06.070> the<00:07:06.250> one<00:07:06.490> mind<00:07:06.820> that

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.150 
our real mind is the one mind that

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.230 
our real mind is the one mind that
encompasses<00:07:07.900> all<00:07:08.170> that<00:07:08.440> is<00:07:09.030> we're<00:07:10.030> learning

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 
encompasses all that is we're learning

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.330 
encompasses all that is we're learning
that<00:07:10.600> there<00:07:10.840> isn't<00:07:11.230> someone<00:07:11.530> or<00:07:11.980> even

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.340 
that there isn't someone or even

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.940 
that there isn't someone or even
something<00:07:12.700> else<00:07:13.180> I'm<00:07:14.080> sure<00:07:14.530> I<00:07:14.560> haven't

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:14.950 
something else I'm sure I haven't

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.890 
something else I'm sure I haven't
learned<00:07:15.310> that<00:07:15.460> yet<00:07:15.880> but<00:07:16.210> I'm<00:07:16.360> very<00:07:16.570> grateful

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:16.900 
learned that yet but I'm very grateful

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:32.420 
learned that yet but I'm very grateful
that<00:07:17.260> I'm<00:07:17.530> willing<00:07:17.770> to<00:07:17.980> be<00:07:18.220> taught

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:32.430
