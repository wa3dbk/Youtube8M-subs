ones with the two dashes next to it that

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.469 
ones with the two dashes next to it that
this<00:04:32.900> allows<00:04:33.350> them<00:04:34.070> to<00:04:34.100> have<00:04:34.639> permission<00:04:35.240> to

this allows them to have permission to

this allows them to have permission to
that<00:04:35.990> command<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:36.710> in<00:04:37.220> some<00:04:37.930> situations<00:04:38.930> with

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
that command and in some situations with

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.810 
that command and in some situations with
factions<00:04:39.770> you<00:04:40.759> have<00:04:40.789> to<00:04:41.270> do<00:04:41.449> this<00:04:41.479> for<00:04:41.930> certain

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
factions you have to do this for certain

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.659 
factions you have to do this for certain
yet<00:04:43.820> for<00:04:44.240> certain<00:04:44.600> plugins<00:04:44.840> you'll<00:04:45.169> have<00:04:45.380> to

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
yet for certain plugins you'll have to

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.210 
yet for certain plugins you'll have to
completely<00:04:46.669> disallow<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.780> permission<00:04:48.530> so

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
completely disallow the permission so

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.080 
completely disallow the permission so
that's<00:04:49.400> why<00:04:49.580> there's<00:04:49.850> two<00:04:50.090> dashes<00:04:50.979> and<00:04:52.090> you

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
that's why there's two dashes and you

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.230 
that's why there's two dashes and you
can<00:04:53.270> change<00:04:53.509> all<00:04:53.690> this<00:04:53.900> if<00:04:54.139> you<00:04:54.259> want<00:04:54.470> to

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
can change all this if you want to

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:05.710 
can change all this if you want to
yourself<00:05:00.400> so<00:05:02.710> if<00:05:03.710> we<00:05:04.130> scroll<00:05:04.699> down<00:05:04.940> here<00:05:04.970> to

since<00:05:10.190> this<00:05:10.370> is<00:05:10.550> the<00:05:10.580> default<00:05:11.060> group<00:05:11.419> it

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
since this is the default group it

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.680 
since this is the default group it
doesn't<00:05:12.050> inherit<00:05:12.470> from<00:05:12.620> anything<00:05:13.330> so<00:05:14.330> let<00:05:14.660> me

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
doesn't inherit from anything so let me

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:21.659
