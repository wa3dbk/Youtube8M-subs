00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.860
 air in a combined vehicle class a 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.529
 I have to check that my brake is 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.449

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:17.789
 I also have to check that in me to 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:20.550

 the state is 360 review leakage stop 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.390
 be tanks I'm going to put the 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.680
