 opa s is the reopening of the 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.130
 fernando is from s central lake 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.900
 I can comment on a video today 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.480
 polverini of the permanent sheet and 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.250
 before a great cosima two days 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.570
 recent releases of the pane that still 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.599
 are in the bands for wolverine max o 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.850
 pot the following is the red is the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.730
 sole survivor of an air crash 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.370
 which affected his memory and forgot his 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.469
 claws of the healing factor forgot 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.940
 a mutant forgot even what 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.190
 Damn he was doing on that plane. 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.770
 and the plot of the magazine develops in 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.600
 two owari perspectives there trying 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.039
 discovering their identity and trying to 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.440
 find out what he's doing in that 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.640
 and also has flashbacks with 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.590
 saber teeth 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.960
 in fact they are the first meetings 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.329
 wolverine with him presents himself as a soul 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.219
 the logan twin saying that they are 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.320
 equal for him to assume his 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.479
 nature and that the destination was 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.520
 traced to people like them 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.939
 flashbacks they have different artists 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.150
 and the traits up a lot in quality 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.729
 although the main artist who the colombo 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.220
 bosh and I really like it, it 's cool to 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.140
 His death , here's the seal max 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.240
 even here it is inadvisable 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.070
 for those under 18 and I found that 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.420
 I would finally have something that I wanted 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.490
 long time 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.159
 The wolverine coming loose I thought the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.509
 magazine would have buckets of blood. 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.530
 I found that while reading the blood 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.530
 splashing in my face 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.480
 but it's not the case here and it's not that 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.730
 violence which leaves troubled that 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.320
 cause a feeling you know I actually 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.660
 I think it's okay, I think 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.350
 does not contribute much to shock the 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.720
 reader 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.430
 no more smell the weak history below 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.440
 the level of monthly 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.910
 wolverine taking for example that the 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.030
 jason aaron was making a character 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.860
 to the plot is so weak I have forgotten and 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.140
 I had to re-read so I could talk more 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.180
 the script has several 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.729
 elements of the stories of the 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.430
 Benin has the memory loss he has in 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.980
 Japan has a conflict in assuming the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.440
 wild nature but the text does not me 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.700
 convinced it seems that nothing works as 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.320
 should know 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.870
 not to mention that the explanation for the 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.910
 wolverine is on the plane I found it 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.100
 Too bad I think it's a 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.830
 That's a good war for those who did not 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.920
 often seen by a fan not so 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.720
 demanding but even with all this it made 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.400
 time that I did not see anything of the character, right? 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.590
 Since I left the monthly 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.780
 so I had fun in a way I 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.510
 would give a note 5 know but not too 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.610
 Well, well, I think it's going to win. 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.470
 more invest in water x than the company 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.390
 is launching soon that is a little 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.700
 story I have the American version 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.640
 But I'm looking forward to 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.650
 by the definitive edition 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.380
 ciman days wants a very good hq 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.570
 written by the creator of so read 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.300
 swamp monster and it's cool that in the 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.900
 The script follows what happens 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.570
 the old head and read it employs 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.120
 a vocabulary that is quite far-fetched 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.370
 is very cool because it characterizes well the 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.950
 character is what you expect from a guy 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.400
 extremely intelligent evolutionary 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.230
 simão and congratulations for the panini that 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.550
 translated this keeping well this is the 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.489
 script feature 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.019
 the art of the day he who is excellent and 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.670
 I think the differential is the 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.800
 layout of pages that have a 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.580
 circle merging with the frames 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.470
 normal 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.050
 I do not know if there's a name for it's a 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.550
 but the combination is very 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.290
 color is also very good 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.080
 the trot is as follows eleven mondial 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.330
 decides to make an auto biography for 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.480
 to record and explain everything that 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.069
 to the plan to reunite nations and 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.069
 history picks up since childhood 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.469
 even him funny at school 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.790
 vocabulary of the old compared to the 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.769
 of normal children 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.439
 He was already a scholarly guy 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.540
 and also his relationship with parents there is 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:07.840
 construction of his character the motivations 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.180
 his training to reach a limit 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.489
 of human capacity would be an all by 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.219
 a great and by American history 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.799
 in the fascinating perspective of the simão days 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:20.859
 and the old man said analyzing the 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.320
 of the minutemen heroes his relationship 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.150
 with the government and several meetings of his 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.340
 also with the characters of a great 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.340
 including very good comedian 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.280
 writer that he was editor of the 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.650
 great original he shows that 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.479
 really know the work he knows what 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.729
 he is talking and funny that in a 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.830
 certain moment of the plot people 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.930
 knows the inspiration of the old jett for 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.330
 forge an alien invasion and 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.639
 inspiration do not worry you do not 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.699
 technically in the spoiler but in the 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.949
 truth vert inspiration is in life 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.320
 real gold extraction at the end of the 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.750
 great that sells an American series of 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.430
 halter's 60's limits to fifth 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.729
 Dimension here in Brazil that is crazy to me 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.159
 talk but curiosity is that neither love 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.590
 at the time of the creation of the original work 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:11.560
 they disagreed because I like huh 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.599
 editor of the work he wanted something new in the 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.280
 end not something that had already been written 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.259
 and wanted the wall to use his 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.599
 creativity to conceive something new 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:21.610
 although the world has believed the series 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:24.370
 original TV show within the very 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.320
 at the end when the spectral and owls 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.449
 are saying goodbye to the series in the asylum 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.789
 so it stays there it 's possible to pretend state 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.419
 of the river in for putting this in the new magnet 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.759
 days 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:36.099
 this edition also closes some 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:38.289
 of the series itself before optimum 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:39.880
 has its own mythology knows zinha 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.680
 At least you can say that the guys 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.479
 had good editorial planning 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.240
 to do this series is a great thing 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.669
 is that the old man who hurts him can 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.320
 like a hero from the start and you 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.419
 You see, I say that as a point. 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.270
 positive because I thought the 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:58.180
 Batman movie ozymandias was very 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.370
 Originally evil featured he cries 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.500
 when the plan materializes and in the film 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.310
 does he look like a generic villain with 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.190
 that pose of superiority 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.390
 finally face is the selection for me was worth the 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.760
 entire project 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.230
 if I were one that to all that I left 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.770
 I would say that it comes in second place 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.520
 very close to the shaq donor was that I 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.100
 more like 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.320
 but by the creative team involved 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.060
 I'm very fond of the text of the bake and the 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.280
 art of the leader even these were the 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.410
 my thoughts on simon days 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.120
 I hope it was useful, I think 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.100
 I will remember for a long time this 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.620
 reading experience and I come get 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:37.220
 happy with that dirty face read comments he 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:41.120
 A hug is a good thing, another thing. 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:43.940
 great is that an old, sick and other 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.250
 It's a good thing that the vate is waiting Wednesday 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.230
 4 My god is the movie most wrote the 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.620
 and can not even speak to the 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:54.070
 phrase sequence one old donkey ta 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.070
 Crazy
