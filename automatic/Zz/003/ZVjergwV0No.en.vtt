00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
into the shoe so I'm gonna do a quick

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.590 
into the shoe so I'm gonna do a quick
review<00:00:31.830> on<00:00:32.039> those<00:00:32.309> there's<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.149> little<00:00:33.360> bit<00:00:33.539> of

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
review on those there's a little bit of

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.720 
review on those there's a little bit of
snow<00:00:33.840> still<00:00:34.469> left<00:00:34.710> here<00:00:34.800> outside<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.550> if<00:00:35.610> you

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
snow still left here outside and if you

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.030 
snow still left here outside and if you
can<00:00:35.850> see<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> ground<00:00:36.539> and<00:00:36.840> but<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.770> think

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
can see it on the ground and but I think

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.390 
can see it on the ground and but I think
they'll<00:00:38.340> also<00:00:38.489> be<00:00:38.850> one<00:00:39.570> or<00:00:39.690> two<00:00:39.980> places<00:00:40.980> up<00:00:41.280> in

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
they'll also be one or two places up in

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.650 
they'll also be one or two places up in
these<00:00:41.520> hills<00:00:41.579> where<00:00:42.060> there's<00:00:42.270> some<00:00:42.450> fairly

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660

these hills where there's some fairly
deep<00:00:42.899> snow<00:00:43.200> still<00:00:43.500> or<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.770> mention<00:00:44.220> it's<00:00:44.340> fairly

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
deep snow still or I mention it's fairly
