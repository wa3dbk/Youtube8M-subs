Raceway it's obviously been repaved the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.410 
Raceway it's obviously been repaved the
last<00:00:45.710> two<00:00:45.860> years<00:00:46.040> which<00:00:46.790> has<00:00:46.910> been<00:00:47.090> something

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
last two years which has been something

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.580 
last two years which has been something
a<00:00:47.480> lot<00:00:47.630> of<00:00:47.720> teams<00:00:47.900> are<00:00:48.050> trying<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:48.290> keep<00:00:48.380> up

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
a lot of teams are trying to keep up

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.530 
a lot of teams are trying to keep up
with<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:48.980> get<00:00:49.100> used<00:00:49.250> to<00:00:49.490> is<00:00:49.670> we<00:00:49.910> don't<00:00:50.030> we<00:00:50.420> all

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
with and get used to is we don't we all

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.360 
with and get used to is we don't we all
don't<00:00:50.750> have<00:00:50.870> a<00:00:50.900> big<00:00:51.140> notebook<00:00:52.010> in<00:00:52.160> for<00:00:52.310> this

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
don't have a big notebook in for this

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.480 
don't have a big notebook in for this
place<00:00:52.610> so<00:00:52.820> we<00:00:53.570> struggle<00:00:53.990> to<00:00:54.170> say<00:00:54.980> that<00:00:55.250> the

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.490 
place so we struggle to say that the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.980 
place so we struggle to say that the
figure<00:00:55.730> it<00:00:55.790> all<00:00:55.880> out<00:00:55.910> right<00:00:56.210> up<00:00:56.360> ahead<00:00:56.600> of<00:00:56.810> time

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
figure it all out right up ahead of time

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.540 
figure it all out right up ahead of time
so<00:00:57.020> today's<00:00:57.470> practice<00:00:57.740> is<00:00:58.100> really<00:00:58.370> pivotal

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
so today's practice is really pivotal

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.330 
so today's practice is really pivotal
for<00:00:59.270> the<00:00:59.360> race<00:00:59.480> tomorrow<00:00:59.920> really<00:01:00.920> table<00:01:01.190> for

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
for the race tomorrow really table for

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.740 
for the race tomorrow really table for
qualified<00:01:01.790> which<00:01:02.000> qualifies<00:01:02.390> really

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
qualified which qualifies really

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.469 
qualified which qualifies really
