 mass literally good to do this 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.740
 you will need two colors of one 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.290

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.140
 there was a varnish faucet and a good brush 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.420

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.509
 tips 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.729
 fold in equal sizes the two ends 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.220
 taking each one to the middle but without 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.560
 push too hard to get fatter x 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.280

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:32.569
 ant to fold the remaining part to the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.060
 point there and now just do the part 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.920
 end of the murder that 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.190
 from another cut to give a 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.190
 Spotlight 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:57.260

 Reminding you, it was a ball. 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:14.790

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:24.000
 make sure that pulling on the other hand 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.000
 final part like this 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.500

 good now it 's just stay you can leave it 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.660
 that they leave naturally or lead to 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.030
 10 minutes non-Jewish oven and 10 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.010
 average temperature of 180 degrees but this 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.319
