00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.289
In this video we must another method to
find prime numbers

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.909
The method is called "The Screen of Eratosthenes"

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:14.269
This method is easier than the previous one that I showed you

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.000
Since in this we will not have to find the divisors of each number

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.510
It is called a screen of Eratosthenes in honor of Eratosthenes, who was a Greek mathematician of the third century BC.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.010
let's find all the numbers
cousins ​​less than 50

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:44.250
for this the first thing we do is
write the numbers from 1 to 50, in a table

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.060
First we cross the 1

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.330
and to the next number that this one without
cross out so we'll leave it

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.880
we square it

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.300
we cross the square and, from
there, all the multiples that follow

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:10.300
let's do this with each number, until we get to the number that comes closest to the square root of the last number in the table

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.520
50, in this case, since we're looking for cousins ​​less than 50

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.660
then we cross out to 1, we leave to 2

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.609
then we raise the 2 to
square (gives us 4)

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:23.990
cross out the 4

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.450
and then all multiples of 2 that
are all numbers that end in 2, 4, 6, 8, 0

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.040
(for what we already saw in another video)

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.640
next, we look at the
next number without crossing

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.440
we leave it like this

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.120
we raise it to the square (it gives us 9)

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.440
and cross out the 9

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.520
and from there, all multiples of 3

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:55.610
which are 9, 15, 21, some were already crossed out as 12, 24

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.770
the next unchecked number is 5

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.610
we leave the 5, we raise it to the square it gives us 25, we cross it out

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.030
and we cross out all the multiples of 5 from there, which are those that end in 5 or 0

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.349
all that end in zero are already
crossed out

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:20.340
Now there is nothing else to cross out
that end in 5, which are 25 and 35

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.700
finally, the next unchecked number is 7

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:35.639
It's the last one we're going to
fix, since root of 50 is approximately 7 (7x7 = 49)

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:44.739
we leave the 7 without crossing, we square, 7x7 = 49, crossed out 49

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:51.209
all the numbers that were left unchecked are cousins ​​less than 50

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.729
therefore, prime numbers less than 50 are:

00:02:55.869 --> 00:03:07.149
2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43 and 47

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:12.769
with this method can you
find the prime numbers smaller than any number they want

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:18.469
try to find the cousins
less than 100, and cousins ​​less than 200

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:24.069
already in a later video, I will put the results
