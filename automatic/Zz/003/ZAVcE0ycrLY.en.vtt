 so you'll be able to barrel 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.840
 but by then 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.840
 horatio and if there was no point in the map 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.570
 or not 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.870

 suddenly the press on Tuesday the artist on the first 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.280
 morals I do not want to say 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.570
 go he is suffering 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.390

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.200
 so madam 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.200
 I was elected I was trying to Montreal 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.060
 how can you explain why 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.650
 so I understand ballistics 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.010
 in speed dating not required 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.130
 I want to react and prevent cullum 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.670
 the cigarettes 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.969
 it's not called 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:34.100
 it's just 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.860
 an odyssey 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.250
 so in fact in order to die there too 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.590
 - it is necessary 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.060
 skip that's not sure you just have to run hard 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.480
 possible 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.480
 support for the economy 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.800
 me and finally France will leave Friday 26 at the gardener 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.200

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.280
 there right next to my house 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.430
 and you tell yourself naked in the breach until loeb or at least 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.380
 ballistic that were troubling 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.839
 note that the 6 xx xx x 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:12.559
 it's like that 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:15.559
 ramon slowly from his shop 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:19.279
 alaa to continue to trust his team 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.299
 John Smith 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.930
 the office is going to you have to tell you until where do I validate it is not 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.809
 excluded to the public from the stadium 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:37.809
 he supported so far for all 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.569
 that's why the most 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.789
 here you are after I fight against the post 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:50.449
 yes the music the bill said the father a chest gently gently 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:54.029
 ap the press that his deficit 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:57.119
 but we're not because we're here so here I think it's if we 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:00.529
 succeeds brigitte bardot foundation does not prevent 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.529
 but you can not turn into a point in your pool 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:13.089
 some 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:16.979
 finally I arrive 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.979
 this posture 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.119
 the device 

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:24.639
 its prey 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.129
 after your return 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.679
 even if necessary 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:31.059
 mr 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:32.959
 since that by others 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.959
 here it is to get money out of taxpayers 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.039
 a little trick 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.079
 a little trick 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.079
 I love my job because they do not know 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.429
 we are usually the most technical and more 

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:49.559
 so the second season in September 

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:52.559
 so his amendment has everything 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:56.399
 the course is opposite 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:59.399
 karin drunkard 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.389
 the goal is reached 

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:09.339
 7 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:12.709
 the medina that advance we can bet in a week 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.419

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.419
 fantastic oven and so exceptional 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.039
 Bernard, you take a little weird 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.949

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.780

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.360

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.529
 earlier m 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.830

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.830
 the decree is oubliettes 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.069
 apparently I was almost 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.099
 supporting the fact that I'm moving 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.099
 this implies 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.990
 we love the mystic phocaean club 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.860
 although not yet sealed 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.180
 any 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.930

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.930

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:14.199
 on the other hand you have to point fingers after a corner at hand 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.460
 said 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.529
 support from his director of the pascal omg lamy small pool 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:20.969

 we get to the big mix so my win here 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.990
 do not go into the basket and in some places mine 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.210
