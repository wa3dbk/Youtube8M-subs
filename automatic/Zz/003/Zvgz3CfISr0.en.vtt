properly<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:23.639> table<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.090> can<00:03:24.209> actually

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
properly to the table you can actually

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.659 
properly to the table you can actually
just<00:03:24.599> lift<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:24.900> up<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.430> without<00:03:26.430> actually

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
just lift it up and without actually

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:27.979 
just lift it up and without actually

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
can see it actually kind of twisted it

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.559 
can see it actually kind of twisted it
back<00:03:29.489> into<00:03:29.699> place<00:03:31.010> there<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.129> go<00:03:32.540> now<00:03:33.540> this

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
back into place there you go now this

you you can actually feel it sort of

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.250 
you you can actually feel it sort of
fine<00:03:44.940> that's<00:03:45.180> right<00:03:45.389> spying<00:03:45.720> just<00:03:45.959> move<00:03:46.139> it

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
fine that's right spying just move it

of place it somewhere toward the middle

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.009 
of place it somewhere toward the middle
and<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.879> does<00:03:54.030> have<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.239> magnetic<00:03:54.690> attraction

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
and it does have a magnetic attraction

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.110 
and it does have a magnetic attraction
does<00:03:55.409> help<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.739> find<00:03:56.129> the<00:03:56.340> center<00:03:56.760> of<00:03:56.970> the

Nexus<00:04:02.310> charger<00:04:02.790> this<00:04:02.970> one<00:04:03.150> is<00:04:03.299> much<00:04:03.689> smaller

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
Nexus charger this one is much smaller

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.080 
Nexus charger this one is much smaller
much<00:04:04.439> more<00:04:04.470> lower<00:04:04.919> profile<00:04:05.549> as<00:04:05.699> you<00:04:05.790> can<00:04:05.909> see

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
much more lower profile as you can see

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.390 
much more lower profile as you can see
it<00:04:06.209> lays<00:04:06.449> flat<00:04:06.500> so<00:04:07.500> your<00:04:07.620> device<00:04:07.739> lays<00:04:08.099> flat

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
it lays flat so your device lays flat

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.460 
it lays flat so your device lays flat
this<00:04:08.729> would<00:04:09.090> prop<00:04:09.389> it<00:04:09.599> up<00:04:09.720> of<00:04:09.900> course<00:04:09.930> this<00:04:10.259> was

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
this would prop it up of course this was

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.740 
this would prop it up of course this was
not<00:04:10.620> tablet<00:04:10.949> friendly<00:04:11.250> because<00:04:12.150> it<00:04:12.479> was<00:04:12.569> too

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
not tablet friendly because it was too

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.210 
not tablet friendly because it was too
steep<00:04:12.959> laying<00:04:13.199> all<00:04:13.439> this<00:04:13.530> work<00:04:13.739> good<00:04:13.949> for<00:04:13.979> the

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
steep laying all this work good for the

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.159 
steep laying all this work good for the
phone<00:04:14.430> but<00:04:14.639> nothing<00:04:14.909> else<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:15.629> we<00:04:15.780> now<00:04:15.900> have<00:04:16.139> a

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
phone but nothing else so we now have a

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.749 
phone but nothing else so we now have a
solution<00:04:16.500> that's<00:04:16.769> thinner<00:04:17.099> lighter<00:04:17.430> more

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 
solution that's thinner lighter more

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.360 
solution that's thinner lighter more

you can take a look at that you can see

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:26.000 
you can take a look at that you can see
just<00:04:24.870> how<00:04:25.020> much<00:04:25.110> bigger<00:04:25.380> and<00:04:25.529> bulkier<00:04:25.650> this

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
just how much bigger and bulkier this

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.390 
just how much bigger and bulkier this
was<00:04:26.190> this<00:04:26.370> was<00:04:26.520> definitely<00:04:26.909> not

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
was this was definitely not

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.189 
was this was definitely not
as<00:04:27.460> portable<00:04:28.030> now<00:04:28.540> in<00:04:28.630> case<00:04:28.810> you're<00:04:28.930> wondering

material<00:04:36.400> now<00:04:37.090> I<00:04:37.120> can't<00:04:37.389> guarantee<00:04:37.600> that<00:04:37.960> will

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
material now I can't guarantee that will

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.110 
material now I can't guarantee that will
work<00:04:38.350> for<00:04:38.710> every<00:04:38.949> case<00:04:39.130> but<00:04:39.370> a<00:04:39.400> lot<00:04:39.639> of<00:04:39.669> cases

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
work for every case but a lot of cases

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.260 
work for every case but a lot of cases
such<00:04:40.360> as<00:04:40.389> this<00:04:40.660> which<00:04:40.870> is<00:04:41.020> a<00:04:41.139> fairly<00:04:41.530> thin

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270

such as this which is a fairly thin
plastic<00:04:43.270> case<00:04:43.720> most<00:04:44.380> cases<00:04:44.740> like<00:04:44.889> it<00:04:45.100> should

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
plastic case most cases like it should

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.070 
plastic case most cases like it should
work<00:04:45.430> just<00:04:45.490> fine<00:04:45.850> with<00:04:46.030> the<00:04:46.060> charger<00:04:46.479> now

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
work just fine with the charger now

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.719 
work just fine with the charger now
wireless<00:04:47.500> charging<00:04:47.770> is<00:04:48.009> slightly<00:04:48.280> slower

wireless charging is slightly slower

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.400 
wireless charging is slightly slower
than<00:04:48.850> just<00:04:49.180> connecting<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:49.690> USB<00:04:49.720> cable<00:04:50.380> to

than just connecting the USB cable to

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.740 
than just connecting the USB cable to
your<00:04:50.500> phone<00:04:50.830> or<00:04:50.860> tablet<00:04:51.100> it's<00:04:51.910> maybe<00:04:52.060> 10<00:04:52.330> to<00:04:52.509> 20

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750

your phone or tablet it's maybe 10 to 20
percent<00:04:52.840> slower<00:04:53.289> so<00:04:53.500> not<00:04:53.680> a<00:04:53.710> big<00:04:53.979> difference

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
percent slower so not a big difference

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.830 
percent slower so not a big difference
there<00:04:54.520> it's<00:04:54.669> actually<00:04:54.789> imperceptible<00:04:55.570> to<00:04:55.630> me

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
there it's actually imperceptible to me

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.990 
there it's actually imperceptible to me
actually<00:04:56.289> don't<00:04:56.590> really<00:04:56.770> mind<00:04:57.039> it<00:04:57.220> now<00:04:57.729> as<00:04:57.850> you

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
actually don't really mind it now as you

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.490 
actually don't really mind it now as you
can<00:04:58.090> see<00:04:58.150> because<00:04:58.389> we<00:04:58.509> have<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:58.930> sticky<00:04:59.289> foot

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
can see because we have the sticky foot

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.080 
can see because we have the sticky foot
it<00:04:59.620> does<00:04:59.800> like<00:05:00.010> to<00:05:00.190> pick<00:05:00.400> up<00:05:00.580> dust<00:05:00.820> but<00:05:01.030> of

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
it does like to pick up dust but of

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.640 
it does like to pick up dust but of
course<00:05:01.270> you<00:05:01.360> can<00:05:01.539> clean<00:05:01.780> this<00:05:01.930> pretty<00:05:02.289> easily

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
course you can clean this pretty easily

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.500

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
but it's nice that we have the slick

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.689 
but it's nice that we have the slick
glassy<00:05:05.229> surface<00:05:05.530> on<00:05:05.860> top<00:05:05.889> which<00:05:06.370> gives<00:05:06.580> you<00:05:06.639> a

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:06.699 
glassy surface on top which gives you a

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:08.550 
glassy surface on top which gives you a
nicer<00:05:07.060> higher-quality<00:05:07.600> look<00:05:08.020> than<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.410> old

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560
