additionally with the energy model the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.789 
additionally with the energy model the
heel<00:01:27.760> area<00:01:28.760> is<00:01:29.060> a<00:01:29.090> very<00:01:29.479> very<00:01:30.170> soft<00:01:30.619> material

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
the snowshoe in action and I'm gonna go

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.330 
the snowshoe in action and I'm gonna go
in<00:03:32.420> slow<00:03:32.720> motion<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:33.170> show<00:03:33.709> you<00:03:33.770> what<00:03:33.980> happens

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
in slow motion to show you what happens

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.420 
in slow motion to show you what happens
so<00:03:34.400> I<00:03:34.430> take<00:03:34.700> my<00:03:34.730> step<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.840> heel<00:03:36.110> lands<00:03:36.650> my

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
so I take my step the heel lands my

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.520 
so I take my step the heel lands my
weight<00:03:37.670> hits<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.570> chute<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.020> tail<00:03:39.290> will

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
weight hits the chute and the tail will

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.030 
weight hits the chute and the tail will
flex<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.220> I<00:03:40.550> kind<00:03:40.820> of<00:03:40.880> roll<00:03:41.330> into<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.650> step

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
flex and I kind of roll into the step

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.940 
flex and I kind of roll into the step
and<00:03:43.310> that<00:03:43.580> really<00:03:44.000> reduces<00:03:44.450> heel<00:03:44.900> strike<00:03:45.260> in

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
and that really reduces heel strike in

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.000 
and that really reduces heel strike in
the<00:03:46.070> fatigue<00:03:46.430> on<00:03:46.580> my<00:03:46.730> joints<00:03:47.000> so<00:03:47.890> it's<00:03:48.890> no

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
the fatigue on my joints so it's no

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.840 
the fatigue on my joints so it's no
crack

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850
