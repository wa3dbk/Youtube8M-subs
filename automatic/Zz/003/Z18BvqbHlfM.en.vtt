and the great thing with the pad is the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.499 
and the great thing with the pad is the
performance<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.369> there<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.909> it's<00:01:45.270> also

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
considered a low dust option so it

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.910 
considered a low dust option so it
doesn't<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.720> same<00:01:49.020> dust<00:01:49.409> qualities

doesn't have the same dust qualities
that<00:01:50.159> other<00:01:50.490> high<00:01:50.759> performance<00:01:50.820> pads<00:01:51.540> have<00:01:51.840> in

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
that other high performance pads have in

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.870 
that other high performance pads have in
that<00:01:52.350> range<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:52.860> we're<00:01:53.189> very<00:01:53.369> excited<00:01:53.460> about

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
that range so we're very excited about

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.690 
that range so we're very excited about
that<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.360> 2013<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.710> how<00:01:55.829> about<00:01:55.920> these<00:01:56.219> systems

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
that for 2013 so how about these systems

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.090 
that for 2013 so how about these systems
in<00:01:56.820> comparison<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.390> this

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
in comparison to this

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.219 
in comparison to this
these<00:01:58.340> are<00:01:58.490> consider<00:01:58.790> our<00:01:59.000> GT<00:01:59.390> lines<00:01:59.720> to<00:01:59.990> Gran

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
these are consider our GT lines to Gran

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
system and also your place the calipers

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.219 
system and also your place the calipers
with<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.830> high<00:02:07.040> performance<00:02:07.729> either<00:02:08.030> four<00:02:08.570> six

or eight piston caliper and this is

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.510 
or eight piston caliper and this is
really<00:02:12.080> for<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.290> customer<00:02:12.740> that's<00:02:12.920> upgrading

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
really for the customer that's upgrading

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.310 
really for the customer that's upgrading
their<00:02:13.640> wheels<00:02:13.850> there's<00:02:14.600> more<00:02:14.900> demand<00:02:15.080> on

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
their wheels there's more demand on

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.050 
their wheels there's more demand on
their<00:02:15.500> vehicle<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.100> they<00:02:16.550> want<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.880> increase

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
their vehicle and they want to increase

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.890 
their vehicle and they want to increase
their<00:02:17.180> braking

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
their braking

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.780 
their braking
even<00:02:18.500> though<00:02:18.620> these<00:02:18.740> are<00:02:18.920> larger<00:02:19.370> on<00:02:19.580> the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
even though these are larger on the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.460 
even though these are larger on the
majority<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.270> vehicles<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.840> actually<00:02:21.260> end<00:02:21.410> up

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
majority of vehicles you actually end up

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.540 
majority of vehicles you actually end up
saving<00:02:21.770> weight

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
saving weight

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.630 
saving weight
so<00:02:22.790> with<00:02:23.330> this<00:02:23.480> intersection<00:02:24.250> it's<00:02:25.250> important

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
so with this intersection it's important

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.090 
so with this intersection it's important
for<00:02:25.700> everyone<00:02:26.000> better<00:02:26.510> handling<00:02:27.080> control<00:02:27.740> and

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
for everyone better handling control and

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.940 
for everyone better handling control and
better<00:02:28.310> braking<00:02:29.230> amazing<00:02:30.230> down<00:02:30.440> here<00:02:30.500> we<00:02:30.830> have

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
better braking amazing down here we have

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.890 
better braking amazing down here we have
some<00:02:31.130> of<00:02:31.250> our<00:02:31.370> larger<00:02:31.700> systems<00:02:32.150> ending<00:02:32.780> up

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
some of our larger systems ending up
