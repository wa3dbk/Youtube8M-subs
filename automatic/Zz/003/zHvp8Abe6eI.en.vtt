understand compass directions I put this

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.779 
understand compass directions I put this
in<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:26.010> side<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.279> wall-e<00:00:28.039> to<00:00:29.039> begin<00:00:29.340> using<00:00:29.580> your

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
in a side of wall-e to begin using your

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.010 
in a side of wall-e to begin using your
compass<00:00:30.060> module<00:00:30.449> select<00:00:31.289> add<00:00:31.679> control<00:00:32.250> and

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
compass module select add control and

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.130 
compass module select add control and
choose<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.260> i2c<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.329> stir<00:00:36.329> dual<00:00:36.600> access

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
choose the i2c and stir dual access

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.680 
choose the i2c and stir dual access
compass<00:00:37.680> module<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:39.000> you're<00:00:39.120> now<00:00:39.329> going<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.629> be

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
compass module so you're now going to be

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.569 
compass module so you're now going to be
able<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.930> see<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.469> direction<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
able to see the direction that the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.369 
able to see the direction that the
robots<00:00:41.910> facing<00:00:42.510> now<00:00:42.840> as<00:00:43.020> actually<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
robots facing now as actually the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.560 
robots facing now as actually the
direction<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.829> compass<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.250> facing<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:44.969> my

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
direction the compass is facing so my

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.930 
direction the compass is facing so my
compass<00:00:46.050> inside<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.680> Wally<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.280> currently<00:00:47.670> 80

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
compass inside of Wally is currently 80

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.860 
compass inside of Wally is currently 80
degrees<00:00:48.329> out<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.500> if<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.680> still<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.870> now

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
degrees out so if I still like that now

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.049 
degrees out so if I still like that now
we're<00:00:52.110> locked<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.190> I'll<00:00:53.309> just<00:00:53.460> move<00:00:53.640> him

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
we're locked in and I'll just move him

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.340 
we're locked in and I'll just move him
so<00:00:54.930> he's<00:00:55.079> facing<00:00:55.350> north<00:00:55.770> there<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.550> go<00:00:56.699> now<00:00:57.629> we

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
so he's facing north there you go now we

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.810 
so he's facing north there you go now we
have<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> couple<00:00:58.680> commands<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.250> can<00:00:59.370> assault

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
have a couple commands we can assault

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.389 
have a couple commands we can assault
your<00:01:00.120> speech<00:01:00.420> recognition<00:01:01.190> choose<00:01:02.190> configure

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
your speech recognition choose configure

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.539 
your speech recognition choose configure
and<00:01:02.940> I'm<00:01:03.690> going<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.989> select<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.799> command<00:01:05.369> i'm

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
and I'm going to select a command i'm

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.050 
and I'm going to select a command i'm
going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> say<00:01:05.939> robot<00:01:06.750> turn<00:01:07.290> east<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.820> we're

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
going to say robot turn east and we're

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.960 
going to say robot turn east and we're
going<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.210> say<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> compass<00:01:09.900> turn<00:01:10.619> 90<00:01:11.610> degrees

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
going to say a compass turn 90 degrees

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.160 
going to say a compass turn 90 degrees
with<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.990> 10<00:01:13.590> degree<00:01:14.390> resolution<00:01:15.390> for<00:01:15.720> failure

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
with a 10 degree resolution for failure

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.280 
with a 10 degree resolution for failure
and<00:01:17.009> then<00:01:17.130> i'm<00:01:17.220> going<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.549> say<00:01:17.759> robot<00:01:18.290> drive

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
and then i'm going to say robot drive

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.520 
and then i'm going to say robot drive
north<00:01:20.600> compass<00:01:21.650> forward<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:24.000> we'll<00:01:24.180> say<00:01:24.530> 0

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
north compass forward and we'll say 0

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.700 
north compass forward and we'll say 0
degrees<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.400> will<00:01:27.210> specify<00:01:27.450> 10<00:01:28.290> degrees

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
degrees and will specify 10 degrees

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.510 
degrees and will specify 10 degrees
