experience<00:01:33.540> points<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.320> Ken<00:01:34.530> actually<00:01:34.650> found

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
experience points so Ken actually found

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.490 
experience points so Ken actually found
the<00:01:35.220> secret<00:01:35.549> cave<00:01:35.729> here<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.210> he's<00:01:37.110> going<00:01:37.409> to

look for a medal and that's actually the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.109 
look for a medal and that's actually the
Sun<00:01:40.290> medal<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.590> he<00:01:40.710> found<00:01:40.920> which<00:01:41.430> unlocks<00:01:41.880> a

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
daytime stage okay there's lots of

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.770 
daytime stage okay there's lots of
secret<00:01:44.399> level<00:01:44.640> lots<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.000> secret<00:01:45.299> little<00:01:45.509> looks

secret level lots of secret little looks

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.510 
secret level lots of secret little looks
and<00:01:45.869> crannies<00:01:45.990> absolutely<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.369> really

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
and crannies absolutely so it's really

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.310 
and crannies absolutely so it's really
good<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.939> just<00:01:48.180> really<00:01:48.689> explore<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
good to just really explore the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.899 
good to just really explore the
environments<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.040> see<00:01:50.399> what<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.700> find

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
environments and see what you can find

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.700 
environments and see what you can find
so<00:01:51.509> tell<00:01:51.750> me<00:01:51.840> about<00:01:51.960> what's<00:01:52.290> different<00:01:52.470> about

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
so tell me about what's different about

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.649 
so tell me about what's different about
Sonic<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.430> his<00:01:53.490> werehog<00:01:53.970> form<00:01:54.329> seems<00:01:54.630> a

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
Sonic and his werehog form seems a

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.789 
Sonic and his werehog form seems a
little<00:01:54.810> bit<00:01:54.899> slower<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:55.380> probably<00:01:55.680> more

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
little bit slower but probably more

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.289 
little bit slower but probably more
probably<00:01:56.219> stronger<00:01:56.579> too<00:01:56.729> right<00:01:56.969> yes

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
probably stronger too right yes

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.630 
probably stronger too right yes
absolutely<00:01:57.840> stronger<00:01:58.350> he<00:01:58.560> actually<00:01:58.890> has<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.159> -

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
absolutely stronger he actually has a -

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.480 
absolutely stronger he actually has a -
so<00:02:00.090> he<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.659> run<00:02:00.899> still<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.189> just<00:02:02.219> kind<00:02:02.460> of

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
so he can run still and just kind of

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.240 
so he can run still and just kind of
maintain<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:02.969> there<00:02:03.299> he<00:02:03.420> goes<00:02:03.630> right<00:02:03.750> there

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
maintain that there he goes right there

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.110 
maintain that there he goes right there
but<00:02:05.250> she<00:02:05.490> definitely<00:02:05.670> does<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> lot<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.390> combat

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
but she definitely does a lot of combat

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.090 
but she definitely does a lot of combat

you'll see some great combo moves that

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.790 
you'll see some great combo moves that
he'll<00:02:09.220> be<00:02:09.369> able<00:02:09.430> to<00:02:09.610> do<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.810> it's<00:02:11.650> great

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
he'll be able to do and it's great

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.560

climbing reaching for things
how<00:02:16.930> are<00:02:17.050> you<00:02:17.110> splitting<00:02:17.380> it<00:02:17.530> up<00:02:17.590> in<00:02:17.770> terms<00:02:17.920> of

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
how are you splitting it up in terms of

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.600 
how are you splitting it up in terms of

he actually can do some great combo
moves<00:02:57.610> there's<00:02:57.850> one<00:02:58.060> that's<00:02:58.240> called<00:02:58.390> the

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
tornado uppercut so you just imagine he

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.530 
tornado uppercut so you just imagine he
was<00:03:01.900> this<00:03:02.050> great<00:03:02.350> move<00:03:02.940> there's<00:03:03.940> also<00:03:04.150> some

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
great environmental elements that he can

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.990 
great environmental elements that he can
use<00:03:07.590> right<00:03:08.590> now<00:03:08.740> he's<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.250> know<00:03:09.340> pass<00:03:09.610> down

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
use right now he's you know pass down

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.400 
use right now he's you know pass down
that<00:03:10.150> path<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:10.540> if<00:03:10.660> he<00:03:10.750> goes<00:03:10.930> into<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.230> water

actually a good question

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.820 
actually a good question
the<00:05:06.550> storyline<00:05:07.150> definitely<00:05:07.750> has<00:05:08.110> a<00:05:08.470> lot<00:05:08.740> of

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
the storyline definitely has a lot of

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.560 
the storyline definitely has a lot of
the<00:05:08.949> sonic<00:05:09.460> characters<00:05:09.849> included<00:05:10.300> in<00:05:10.419> that

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
the sonic characters included in that

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.339 
the sonic characters included in that
they're<00:05:10.960> very<00:05:11.050> integral<00:05:11.500> to<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.860> storyline

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
they're very integral to the storyline

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:17.159 
they're very integral to the storyline
we<00:05:14.349> have<00:05:15.120> some<00:05:16.120> mini<00:05:16.240> games<00:05:16.479> and<00:05:16.780> whatnot<00:05:16.900> but

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
we have some mini games and whatnot but

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.390 
we have some mini games and whatnot but
again<00:05:17.410> I<00:05:17.440> can't<00:05:17.710> really<00:05:17.860> go<00:05:18.039> into<00:05:18.220> too<00:05:18.370> much

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
again I can't really go into too much

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.800 
again I can't really go into too much
detail<00:05:18.849> about<00:05:18.880> that<00:05:19.180> there's<00:05:19.330> still<00:05:19.479> more<00:05:19.690> to

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
detail about that there's still more to

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.550 
detail about that there's still more to
learn<00:05:21.180> okay<00:05:22.180> you'll<00:05:22.419> find<00:05:22.660> out<00:05:22.810> so<00:05:23.260> how<00:05:23.470> are

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
learn okay you'll find out so how are

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.409 
learn okay you'll find out so how are
you<00:05:23.680> dealing<00:05:23.919> with<00:05:24.190> if<00:05:24.580> you<00:05:24.760> fail<00:05:25.210> in<00:05:25.360> a

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
you dealing with if you fail in a

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:26.969 
you dealing with if you fail in a
certain<00:05:25.690> part<00:05:25.870> of<00:05:25.930> a<00:05:26.020> course<00:05:26.320> how<00:05:26.530> far<00:05:26.710> back<00:05:26.830> in

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
certain part of a course how far back in

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.020 
certain part of a course how far back in
your<00:05:27.010> long<00:05:27.220> are<00:05:27.340> there<00:05:27.430> checkpoints<00:05:27.849> that<00:05:27.940> you

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
your long are there checkpoints that you

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.000 
your long are there checkpoints that you
read<00:05:28.210> absolutely<00:05:28.750> times<00:05:29.229> the<00:05:29.349> checkpoints<00:05:29.830> so

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
read absolutely times the checkpoints so

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.189 
read absolutely times the checkpoints so
you're<00:05:30.430> never<00:05:30.550> penalized<00:05:31.240> for<00:05:31.599> you<00:05:32.080> know

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 
you're never penalized for you know

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.870 
you're never penalized for you know
falling<00:05:33.010> or<00:05:33.190> anything<00:05:33.340> like<00:05:33.520> that<00:05:33.580> and<00:05:33.820> this

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
falling or anything like that and this

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.790 
falling or anything like that and this
game<00:05:34.090> actually<00:05:34.270> has<00:05:34.539> a<00:05:34.570> lot<00:05:34.780> of<00:05:34.810> branching

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
game actually has a lot of branching

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.770 
game actually has a lot of branching
pathways<00:05:36.310> no<00:05:36.669> you<00:05:37.180> know<00:05:37.270> if<00:05:37.360> you<00:05:37.419> happen<00:05:37.599> to

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
pathways no you know if you happen to

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.719 
pathways no you know if you happen to
make<00:05:38.139> it<00:05:38.199> on<00:05:38.380> one<00:05:38.560> level<00:05:38.770> and<00:05:39.099> not<00:05:39.220> the<00:05:39.370> next

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
make it on one level and not the next

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:41.189 
make it on one level and not the next
sometimes<00:05:40.180> there'll<00:05:40.360> be<00:05:40.389> another<00:05:40.630> path<00:05:40.870> below

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 
sometimes there'll be another path below

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.029 
sometimes there'll be another path below
you<00:05:41.409> or<00:05:41.770> above<00:05:42.070> you<00:05:42.280> so<00:05:42.729> you<00:05:42.820> can<00:05:42.940> continuously

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
you or above you so you can continuously

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:47.270 
you or above you so you can continuously
progress<00:05:45.039> through<00:05:45.310> the<00:05:45.400> game

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
progress through the game

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.980 
progress through the game
a<00:05:49.250> little<00:05:50.250> swinging<00:05:50.550> here<00:05:50.850> absolutely<00:05:51.570> how

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
a little swinging here absolutely how

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.090 
a little swinging here absolutely how
you<00:05:53.570> has<00:05:54.570> it<00:05:54.720> mixed<00:05:54.960> between<00:05:55.110> gameplays<00:05:55.860> that

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
you has it mixed between gameplays that

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.780 
you has it mixed between gameplays that
you<00:05:56.870> in<00:05:57.870> terms<00:05:58.080> of<00:05:58.290> swinging<00:05:59.130> and<00:05:59.400> jumping<00:05:59.700> is

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
you in terms of swinging and jumping is

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.370 
you in terms of swinging and jumping is
that<00:05:59.940> every<00:06:00.300> level<00:06:00.450> have<00:06:00.750> that<00:06:00.960> or<00:06:01.139> is<00:06:01.230> it<00:06:01.320> just

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
that every level have that or is it just

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.200 
that every level have that or is it just
sort<00:06:01.889> of<00:06:01.919> mixing<00:06:02.280> it<00:06:02.370> up<00:06:02.460> right<00:06:02.760> certain

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
sort of mixing it up right certain

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.730 
sort of mixing it up right certain
levels<00:06:03.540> actually<00:06:03.690> concentrate<00:06:04.410> on<00:06:04.530> certain

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
levels actually concentrate on certain

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.159 
levels actually concentrate on certain
mechanics<00:06:05.340> so<00:06:05.580> of<00:06:06.360> course<00:06:06.600> it<00:06:06.720> has<00:06:06.900> a<00:06:06.930> little

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
mechanics so of course it has a little

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.409 
mechanics so of course it has a little
bit<00:06:07.230> of<00:06:07.350> everything<00:06:07.530> on<00:06:07.770> each<00:06:07.950> but<00:06:08.639> this<00:06:09.240> one

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
bit of everything on each but this one

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.240 
bit of everything on each but this one
in<00:06:09.480> particular<00:06:09.570> where<00:06:09.870> you<00:06:09.990> sing<00:06:10.200> now<00:06:10.250> you'll

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
in particular where you sing now you'll

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.700 
in particular where you sing now you'll
see<00:06:11.430> a<00:06:11.460> lot<00:06:11.700> of<00:06:11.730> sidestepping<00:06:12.389> well<00:06:13.260> he<00:06:13.410> where

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
see a lot of sidestepping well he where

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.620 
see a lot of sidestepping well he where
he'll<00:06:14.010> have<00:06:14.040> to<00:06:14.340> actually<00:06:14.700> instantaneously

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
he'll have to actually instantaneously

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.020 
he'll have to actually instantaneously
dodge<00:06:16.230> obstacles<00:06:16.530> and<00:06:17.100> that<00:06:17.490> actually<00:06:17.790> allows

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
dodge obstacles and that actually allows

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.570 
dodge obstacles and that actually allows
funding<00:06:18.389> to<00:06:18.480> continuously<00:06:19.169> go<00:06:19.470> fast<00:06:19.770> very

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
funding to continuously go fast very

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.860 
funding to continuously go fast very
cool<00:06:20.790> what's<00:06:21.150> the<00:06:21.270> control<00:06:21.540> there<00:06:21.690> for

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
cool what's the control there for

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.930 
cool what's the control there for
swinging<00:06:22.250> the<00:06:23.250> control<00:06:23.550> there<00:06:23.700> can<00:06:23.880> you

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
swinging the control there can you

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.360 
swinging the control there can you
anything<00:06:24.330> sure<00:06:24.960> it's<00:06:25.200> natural<00:06:26.070> you<00:06:26.100> can<00:06:26.190> use

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
anything sure it's natural you can use

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.180 
anything sure it's natural you can use
the<00:06:26.490> homing<00:06:26.730> attack<00:06:27.000> or<00:06:27.240> you<00:06:28.050> can<00:06:28.380> just<00:06:28.560> you

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
the homing attack or you can just you

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.890 
the homing attack or you can just you
know<00:06:29.310> go<00:06:29.580> towards<00:06:29.910> the<00:06:30.120> the<00:06:30.360> poles<00:06:30.570> and<00:06:30.720> it'll

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
know go towards the the poles and it'll

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.090 
know go towards the the poles and it'll
automatically<00:06:31.350> swing<00:06:31.560> for<00:06:31.770> you<00:06:31.860> I<00:06:31.919> think<00:06:31.980> I

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
automatically swing for you I think I

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.070 
automatically swing for you I think I
saw<00:06:32.250> some<00:06:32.400> wall<00:06:32.550> running<00:06:32.910> -<00:06:33.060> yes<00:06:33.540> you'll<00:06:33.900> see

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
saw some wall running - yes you'll see

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.680 
saw some wall running - yes you'll see
that<00:06:34.290> in<00:06:34.410> just<00:06:34.530> a<00:06:34.650> little<00:06:34.680> bit<00:06:34.860> actually<00:06:35.690> all

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
that in just a little bit actually all

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.840 
that in just a little bit actually all
right<00:06:36.870> so<00:06:37.620> the<00:06:38.130> last<00:06:38.250> question<00:06:38.400> of<00:06:38.640> course<00:06:38.790> is

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
right so the last question of course is

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.520 
right so the last question of course is
when<00:06:39.120> is<00:06:39.300> this<00:06:39.419> game<00:06:39.600> coming<00:06:39.840> out<00:06:40.020> holiday
