00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
the Bernard Hopkins as we all know is a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
very experienced so the experience could

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.810 
very experienced so the experience could
play<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> big<00:01:34.979> difference<00:01:35.340> against<00:01:35.549> out<00:01:35.700> of

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
play a big difference against out of

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.100 
play a big difference against out of
mech<00:01:35.970> he<00:01:36.180> hasn't<00:01:36.479> been<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> water<00:01:36.930> as

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
mech he hasn't been in the water as

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.100 
mech he hasn't been in the water as
deepers<00:01:37.439> but<00:01:37.619> not<00:01:37.740> Aquajet<00:01:38.780> exactly<00:01:39.780> there's

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
deepers but not Aquajet exactly there's

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.020 
deepers but not Aquajet exactly there's
no<00:01:40.290> way<00:01:40.439> it's<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.829> new<00:01:40.979> weight<00:01:41.159> class<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.880> know

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
no way it's a new weight class you know

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.270 
no way it's a new weight class you know
I<00:01:42.060> mean<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.570> always<00:01:42.720> plays<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> factor<00:01:43.439> you

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
I mean so that always plays a factor you

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.859 
I mean so that always plays a factor you
know<00:01:44.399> Bernards<00:01:44.790> not<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> cruiserweight<00:01:45.450> he's

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
know Bernards not a cruiserweight he's

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.649 
know Bernards not a cruiserweight he's
not<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.229> big<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.470> man<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:47.460> he<00:01:47.610> very<00:01:47.880> smart<00:01:48.479> man

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
not that big a man but he very smart man

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
so you see how it plays out you know if

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.810 
so you see how it plays out you know if
he<00:01:52.170> does<00:01:52.350> get<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.619> cause<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.979> get<00:01:53.159> rematch<00:01:53.430> what
