00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.460
 hello today I want to teach you a very idea 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.059
 flirty that will help you take care of your 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.059
 headphones 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.230
 all you need is felt 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.200
 and the pearl that you can substitute for the 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:31.100
 you have at home needle 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.100
 scissors something to mark 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.120
 and a key ring like this one 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.400
 you do not need to do the same 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.350
 figure that I but if you liked me I leave you 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.050
 the patterns in the information box 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.420
 once you download them and the cuts 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.940
 you have to mark all the pieces in the 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.280
 sky in this piece draws some lines 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.090
 similar will be the part where to put 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.769
 to these hearing aids and now with a lot 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.769
 Care cuts all the pieces 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.790
 do not forget to cut the vegetable, I decided 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.630
 that would look better on this side so 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.630
 strong here 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.420
 and it was time to sew in sharp the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.000
 thread on the needle leaving one more thread 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.500
 longer than the other and in that which is more 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.500
 long to its nudite at the end 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.979
 The first thing we are going to get if this 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.930
 part really is not necessary but you 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.790
 Give a different style whenever you go 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.370
 to sew remember that the world of the thread 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.020
 should be left behind and we're going to do the 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.190
 same stitch as in the pen of the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.070
 previous video 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.119
 first you put the needle you pass the thread by 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.119
 back and pull 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.720
 so that you stay super well do not do 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.490
 the stitches close together one another and 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.490
 the cells very close to the shore 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.520
 i 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.520
 it will be like that 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.899
 this circle will be the mouth of the bear 

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:13.210
 draw an ice a head triangle and 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.400
 it's a line like this 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.019
 ah 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.239
 You can leave it like that or sew with this 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.780
 super simple stitch to fill the 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.780
 spaces 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.550
 ah 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.650
 now you have to mark the eyes of the 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.690
 that you can still know about it 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.510
 way that the nose or just to put 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.730
 buttons or whatever you can think Czech 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.739
 that if you decide to sew to fill the 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.739
 Stitches must be super-stitched 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.230
 and the time has come to unite all 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.760
 the pieces 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.530
 I decided to sew them using the same 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.050
 stitch of the beginning but if you do not 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.760
 you want to sew do not worry you can 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.270
 paste with silicon and they will also 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.270
 look good 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.440
 and good 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.440
 to 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.250
 and before closing the bag do not forget 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.110
 put the arish again used the 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.150
 stitch in the beginning that is the same 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.500
 stitch that we use in the pen for 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.500
 sew all around 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.540
 if you want to check the stitch in detail 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.420
 that you use click on the video of 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.320
 final and now you just need to decide 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.320
 where to hang all 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.560
 I hope you liked this video and 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.209

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.900
 if you do, I assure you that your hearing aids 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:10.269
 they will not get tangled again, do not leave without
