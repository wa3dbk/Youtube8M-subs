00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
how it works there's a circle in the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.560 
how it works there's a circle in the
middle<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> screen<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.699> if<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:21.330> rotate

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
middle of the screen and if we rotate

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.560 
middle of the screen and if we rotate
the<00:00:21.930> phone<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.980> rotate<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:23.490> circle<00:00:23.939> we<00:00:24.390> got

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
the phone you rotate this circle we got

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.130 
the phone you rotate this circle we got
to<00:00:24.689> pick<00:00:25.019> up<00:00:25.199> all<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.560> Rings<00:00:25.910> so<00:00:26.910> if<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.840> do

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
to pick up all the Rings so if we do

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.910 
to pick up all the Rings so if we do
that<00:00:28.519> we<00:00:29.519> kind<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.970> find<00:00:30.330> ourselves<00:00:30.920> moving

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
that we kind of find ourselves moving

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.670 
that we kind of find ourselves moving
our<00:00:32.219> arms<00:00:32.750> okay<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:33.809> that's<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> first<00:00:34.500> part

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
our arms okay so that's the first part

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.799 
our arms okay so that's the first part
the<00:00:34.980> second<00:00:35.280> part<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:36.210> circle<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:36.719> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
the second part is the circle in the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.040 
the second part is the circle in the
middle<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.290> has<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> gap<00:00:37.890> from<00:00:38.129> one<00:00:38.399> side<00:00:39.050> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
middle it has a gap from one side the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.889 
middle it has a gap from one side the
ring<00:00:40.290> also<00:00:40.649> has<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> gap<00:00:41.250> from<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:42.000> side<00:00:42.210> what

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
ring also has a gap from this side what

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.600 
ring also has a gap from this side what
we<00:00:42.930> need<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.170> do<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.440> rotate<00:00:43.710> around<00:00:44.280> each

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
we need to do is rotate around each

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.760 
we need to do is rotate around each
other<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.570> gaps<00:00:45.809> align<00:00:48.350> exactly<00:00:49.350> so

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
other so that the gaps align exactly so

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.110 
other so that the gaps align exactly so
we're<00:00:50.010> rotating<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.489> circle<00:00:50.820> around<00:00:50.879> each

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
we're rotating a circle around each

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.459 
we're rotating a circle around each
other<00:00:51.329> very<00:00:51.780> interesting<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
other very interesting with the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.010 
other very interesting with the
microphone<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.070> your<00:00:53.100> face<00:00:53.399> okay<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.660> that's

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
microphone in your face okay so that's

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.139 
microphone in your face okay so that's
the<00:00:55.170> basics<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.739> game<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.250> now<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:56.820> just

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the basics of the game and now we just

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.420 
the basics of the game and now we just
follow<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.710> markers

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
follow the markers
