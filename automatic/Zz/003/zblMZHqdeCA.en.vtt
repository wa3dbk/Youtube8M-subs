figure this situation out and they did
figure<00:02:12.290> it<00:02:12.440> out<00:02:12.620> I<00:02:12.940> think<00:02:13.940> what<00:02:14.060> happened<00:02:14.420> was

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
figure it out I think what happened was

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.030 
figure it out I think what happened was
this<00:02:14.600> fellow<00:02:14.870> was<00:02:15.050> in<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.230> middle<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.620> bay

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
this fellow was in the middle of the bay

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.070 
this fellow was in the middle of the bay
he<00:02:16.520> saw<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.790> front<00:02:17.180> comet<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.690> he<00:02:17.750> started

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
he saw the front comet and he started

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.380 
he saw the front comet and he started
riding<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.590> waves<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:19.130> safety<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:20.120> when<00:02:20.269> he

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
riding the waves to safety and when he

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.120 
riding the waves to safety and when he
got<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.989> pound<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.410> bank<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:21.800> was<00:02:21.860> being

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
got to the pound the bank that was being

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.500 
got to the pound the bank that was being
pounded<00:02:22.340> he<00:02:22.670> didn't<00:02:22.850> know<00:02:22.940> what<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.150> do<00:02:23.300> and

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
pounded he didn't know what to do and

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.360 
pounded he didn't know what to do and
they<00:02:23.600> just<00:02:23.630> shoved<00:02:24.110> them<00:02:24.320> in<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.650> structure<00:02:25.190> I

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
they just shoved them in the structure I

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.810 
they just shoved them in the structure I
think<00:02:26.180> had<00:02:26.420> he<00:02:26.660> rolled<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.530> gone<00:02:28.130> against<00:02:28.760> the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
think had he rolled the gone against the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.670 
think had he rolled the gone against the
waves<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.390> headed<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.930> leeward<00:02:30.170> side<00:02:30.410> of

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
waves and headed to the leeward side of

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.500 
waves and headed to the leeward side of
the<00:02:30.890> island<00:02:30.980> he<00:02:31.850> could<00:02:32.000> have<00:02:32.090> found<00:02:32.360> a

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
the island he could have found a

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.960 
the island he could have found a
protecting<00:02:33.080> inlet<00:02:33.800> of<00:02:33.980> some<00:02:34.459> fun<00:02:34.760> so

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
protecting inlet of some fun so

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.500 
protecting inlet of some fun so
neighborhood<00:02:35.420> canals<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:35.989> got<00:02:36.140> in<00:02:36.320> there<00:02:36.560> so

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
neighborhood canals and got in there so

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.810 
neighborhood canals and got in there so
go<00:02:38.510> against<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.110> grain<00:02:39.340> go<00:02:40.340> against<00:02:40.640> the

side<00:02:43.040> don't<00:02:43.489> ride<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.150> waves<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.630> safety<00:02:46.150> seem

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
side don't ride the waves to safety seem

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.580 
side don't ride the waves to safety seem
like<00:02:47.300> an<00:02:47.420> eternity<00:02:47.780> but<00:02:47.840> finally<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.410> Coast

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
like an eternity but finally the Coast

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.229 
like an eternity but finally the Coast
Guard<00:02:48.800> realized<00:02:49.160> that<00:02:49.430> they<00:02:49.550> could<00:02:49.730> that<00:02:50.180> they

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
Guard realized that they could that they
