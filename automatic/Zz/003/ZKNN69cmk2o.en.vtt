very<00:02:16.770> much<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.970> MCU<00:02:18.240> is<00:02:18.480> updating<00:02:18.870> itself

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
very much so the MCU is updating itself

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.810 
very much so the MCU is updating itself
and<00:02:19.440> as<00:02:19.590> soon<00:02:19.770> as<00:02:19.860> it's<00:02:20.010> done<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.310> device<00:02:20.580> will

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
and as soon as it's done the device will

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.220 
and as soon as it's done the device will
shut<00:02:21.060> itself<00:02:21.330> down<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:23.600> will<00:02:24.600> restart<00:02:25.140> the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
shut itself down and will restart the

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.960 
shut itself down and will restart the
device<00:02:25.380> by<00:02:25.830> holding<00:02:26.310> down<00:02:26.340> any<00:02:26.670> one<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:26.850> the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.020 
holding down the volume button that will
turn<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.110> device<00:02:31.230> back<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.040> as<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:32.880> can

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
turn the device back on and as you can

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.520 
turn the device back on and as you can
see<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.480> update<00:02:33.840> process<00:02:34.020> starts

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
see the update process starts

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.770 
see the update process starts
automatically<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:36.150> whole<00:02:36.270> process<00:02:36.510> from

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
start to finish shouldn't take you more

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.199 
start to finish shouldn't take you more
than<00:02:38.010> five<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.430> ten<00:02:38.580> minutes<00:02:38.880> of<00:02:39.030> course

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
than five to ten minutes of course

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.670 
than five to ten minutes of course
depending<00:02:39.660> on<00:02:39.780> how<00:02:39.930> many<00:02:39.990> apps<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.440> have<00:02:40.560> to

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
depending on how many apps you have to

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.180 
depending on how many apps you have to
back<00:02:40.830> up<00:02:41.240> but<00:02:42.240> once<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.660> restarts<00:02:43.110> you'll<00:02:43.709> see

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
back up but once it restarts you'll see

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.680 
back up but once it restarts you'll see
that<00:02:44.490> we've<00:02:44.700> gone<00:02:44.880> back<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.420> factory

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
that we've gone back to the factory

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.150 
that we've gone back to the factory
settings<00:02:46.080> we'll<00:02:46.320> have<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.590> redo<00:02:46.980> the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
settings we'll have to redo the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.610 
settings we'll have to redo the
touchscreen<00:02:47.550> calibration<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.420> once<00:02:49.410> we<00:02:49.500> get

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
touchscreen calibration and once we get

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.930 
touchscreen calibration and once we get

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
back to the home screen you'll see that

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.030 
back to the home screen you'll see that
it's<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.450> basic<00:02:52.020> home<00:02:52.170> screen<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:52.800> unit

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
it's the basic home screen that the unit

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.230

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
see that we now have upgraded MCU

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.979 
see that we now have upgraded MCU
version<00:03:05.730> 2.0<00:03:06.690> point<00:03:07.170> 6<00:03:07.560> -<00:03:07.830> 1<00:03:08.280> -<00:03:08.970> 10<00:03:09.270> -<00:03:09.480> 1<00:03:09.720> and

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
version 2.0 point 6 - 1 - 10 - 1 and

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.270 
version 2.0 point 6 - 1 - 10 - 1 and
system<00:03:10.920> version<00:03:11.220> 2.12<00:03:11.940> point<00:03:12.239> 3<00:03:12.480> -<00:03:13.040> so<00:03:14.040> that's

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
system version 2.12 point 3 - so that's

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.070 
system version 2.12 point 3 - so that's
it<00:03:14.430> for<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.880> upgrade<00:03:15.180> video<00:03:15.480> if<00:03:15.720> you've<00:03:15.900> got
