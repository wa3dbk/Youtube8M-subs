thinner<00:05:13.539> yeah<00:05:14.539> so<00:05:14.840> you<00:05:14.900> includes<00:05:15.349> the

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
thinner yeah so you includes the

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.650

Sokka<00:05:21.260> so<00:05:21.590> I'm<00:05:22.340> not<00:05:22.610> for<00:05:22.849> sure<00:05:22.880> if<00:05:23.120> it's<00:05:23.570> the

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
Sokka so I'm not for sure if it's the

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.710 
Sokka so I'm not for sure if it's the
same<00:05:24.080> one<00:05:24.349> but<00:05:24.620> it<00:05:24.889> looks<00:05:25.400> like<00:05:25.490> it<00:05:25.820> might<00:05:26.690> be

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
same one but it looks like it might be

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.770 
same one but it looks like it might be
the<00:05:27.050> same<00:05:27.490> backpack<00:05:28.490> that<00:05:29.150> came<00:05:29.360> with<00:05:29.510> ahsoka

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
and it's removable but it is kind of

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.240 
and it's removable but it is kind of
difficult<00:05:35.539> to<00:05:35.960> get<00:05:36.110> back<00:05:36.289> on<00:05:36.500> so<00:05:36.889> I'm<00:05:37.070> just

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250
