00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.700 
you'll see why here in a second and we
put<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.780> king<00:02:19.020> in<00:02:19.200> check<00:02:19.230> with<00:02:19.920> pawn<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.690> f2

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
put the king in check with pawn to f2

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.830 
put the king in check with pawn to f2
now<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.770> King<00:02:23.130> takes<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.460> pawn<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:24.060> take<00:02:24.570> the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
now the King takes the pawn we take the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.070 
now the King takes the pawn we take the
Queen<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.320> game<00:02:25.470> is<00:02:25.560> pretty<00:02:25.680> much<00:02:25.800> over
