00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 now that we have youtube I'm sergio 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.060
 Moreno and in this new video tutorial 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.179
 let's learn how to download the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.110
 game the words paris book of shadows 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.210
 for your feet 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.330
 well this game has been at the request of 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.490
 a Facebook user already passed it and 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.050
 I already added it to the blog but I have not had 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.810
 time to make the video until now 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.970
 obviously if they burn or if they want to see it 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.090
 in the blog I leave the blog link 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.160
 in the description of this good video 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.920
 let's go with the specifications of 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.820
 good game the game is uploaded to mega 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.730
 divided into seven parts are 6 250 mb and 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.820
 the last about 78 megabytes and if bad 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.969
 I remember the game in total weighs more or 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.100
 minus 1.42 gigabyte so it's full or 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.260
 until he has given you nothing and only 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.449
 is in English because there is no 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.420
 reaction in Spanish but would notice in 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.580
 Spanish 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.700
 So, well, we already have all the 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:02.020
 information to this format did so 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.020
 well let's start 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.399
 [Music] 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.270
 ok what we are going to do is go to link 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.460
 of description of the video 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.109
 although good as there are seven parts there will be 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.850
 seven innings but I'm going to show the 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:27.340
 process of downloading the first league 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.259
 since it is exactly the same for 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.789
 all once you click on 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.860
 anyone will appear to this 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.960
 page and wait five seconds here 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.060
 up once the five are over 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.250
 seconds this motorola will come out and yellow 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.990
 that says jump advertising we're going to 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.340
 Give a click and it will start charging what 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.719
 is the page in the middle as they are 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.719
 watching on your screen 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.240
 well let's be here load that already 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.119
 uploaded and will appear download pp files 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.409
 which will be the core pair and book of shadows 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.119
 under sergio part of 1,250 miles a 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.829
 Once here we click on download and 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.439
 started automatically what the 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.670
 download and good speed and 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.519
 obviously the download time 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.099
 It will depend entirely on your internet 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.319
 well I pause because obviously already 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.269
 I have the parts so good once 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.790
 download all parts of the 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.740
 week or have not saved them in my 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.630
 I have them in this folder 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.140
 here once we have seven 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.270
 parts as you see the last 78 mb we go 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.250
 to do is going to resist parts like 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.230
 they are on your screen 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.170
 and we're going to right click on some of 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.260
 you are selected 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.390
 this box will appear and we will give 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.150
 this file will be exceeded here is what 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.099
 same but I'm extra files for 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.890
 select a style folder that 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:51.830
 it would be desk not accept and it will come out 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.390
 this box that will be extracted from 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.430
 search engine and how you will see it is in format 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.980
 disc and we 're really going to expect the 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.830
 15 processed garbage bar arrives 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.950
 up to 100% and good at what arrives 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.790
 accelerated the video for the video to not 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.790
 lengthen so much 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.530
 well here it is almost to end well 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.530
 who waits a few seconds 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.600
 and here it ended well once 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.640
 I finished 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.400
 take off the fire let's go when 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.830
 we have chosen to extract in my case from 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.270
 desktop and we'll see two files one 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.030
 which is a text document that says 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:57.020

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.760

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.370

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.720
 here of the thanks and then pages or 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.240
 places where you can find the 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.340
 sources 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.860
 good but what matters is this other 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.810
 folder that is called 7 book of shadows 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:15.830

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:20.870

 ct uxÃ³ snacks and opposition this as they see 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.950
 if we have in the installed boulevard 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.590
 will probably disappear with the 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.750
 little books but this one just copied 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.110
