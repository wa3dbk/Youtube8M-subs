doing your own thing and there's a lot

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.590 
doing your own thing and there's a lot
of<00:00:59.010> games<00:00:59.280> would<00:00:59.399> say<00:00:59.640> oh<00:00:59.879> well<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.539> a

of games would say oh well you have a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.029 
of games would say oh well you have a
lot<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.809> choice<00:01:01.050> but<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.440> really<00:01:01.559> only<00:01:01.770> two

choices and the choice would be very

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.149 
choices and the choice would be very
linear<00:01:03.629> depending<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.589> which<00:01:04.710> road<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.949> take

makes<00:01:41.070> for<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.280> good<00:01:41.400> dynamic<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:42.060> really<00:01:42.630> like

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
makes for a good dynamic I really like

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.139 
makes for a good dynamic I really like
the<00:01:43.049> combat<00:01:43.850> especially<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
the combat especially like the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.910 
the combat especially like the
counter-attacks<00:01:45.840> they're<00:01:46.140> really<00:01:46.560> really

satisfying<00:01:47.130> especially<00:01:48.030> when<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.299> pull<00:01:48.509> them

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
satisfying especially when you pull them

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.469 
satisfying especially when you pull them
off<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.619> kind<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.159> it's<00:01:50.520> challenging<00:01:51.299> in
