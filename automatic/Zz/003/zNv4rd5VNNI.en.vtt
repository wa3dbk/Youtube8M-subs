probably been using something that was

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.680 
probably been using something that was
shiny<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.670> was<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.820> dull<00:02:18.060> ball<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.540> it

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
shiny and it was a dull ball and it

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.790 
shiny and it was a dull ball and it
worked<00:02:19.550> after<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.820> rear<00:02:20.970> rack<00:02:21.650> she<00:02:22.650> has

the price leaves the 2 8 and nearly had

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
some company in the 10 pin that ball

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.090 
some company in the 10 pin that ball
didn't<00:02:32.940> break<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.330> sharply<00:02:33.720> as<00:02:34.050> she<00:02:34.650> wanted<00:02:34.920> it

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
didn't break it sharply as she wanted it

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.310 
didn't break it sharply as she wanted it
and<00:02:35.280> 2<00:02:35.820> 8<00:02:35.970> 10<00:02:36.210> wouldn't<00:02:36.540> have<00:02:36.630> been<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.900> nice<00:02:37.170> way

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
and 2 8 10 wouldn't have been a nice way

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.220 
and 2 8 10 wouldn't have been a nice way
to<00:02:37.440> start<00:02:37.970> she<00:02:38.970> shot<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.210> ball<00:02:39.510> out<00:02:39.750> there<00:02:39.780> on

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
to start she shot the ball out there on

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.170 
to start she shot the ball out there on
the<00:02:40.380> 10th<00:02:40.620> frame<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.310> last<00:02:41.520> game<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.030> she

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
the 10th frame of the last game and she

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.140 
the 10th frame of the last game and she
got<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.450> same<00:02:42.660> reaction<00:02:43.220> so<00:02:44.220> my<00:02:44.850> guess<00:02:45.120> is

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
got the same reaction so my guess is

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.300 
got the same reaction so my guess is
that<00:02:45.330> she<00:02:45.660> didn't<00:02:45.930> intentionally<00:02:46.560> do<00:02:47.010> at<00:02:47.160> that

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
that she didn't intentionally do at that

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.130 
that she didn't intentionally do at that
time<00:02:47.340> she<00:02:48.000> probably<00:02:48.209> just<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.690> got<00:02:48.870> away<00:02:49.080> from

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
time she probably just it got away from

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.920 
time she probably just it got away from
her<00:02:49.410> she<00:02:50.040> might<00:02:50.220> be<00:02:50.430> feeling<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.910> effects<00:02:51.810> of

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
her she might be feeling the effects of

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.960 
her she might be feeling the effects of
some<00:02:52.170> stress<00:02:52.500> here<00:02:52.800> she's<00:02:53.459> climbing<00:02:53.700> the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
some stress here she's climbing the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.490 
some stress here she's climbing the

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
why she's playing 16 about three or four

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.390 
why she's playing 16 about three or four

boards further to the right than she did

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.710

when she had her most success on that

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.870 
when she had her most success on that
length<00:03:14.050> I<00:03:14.380> don't<00:03:15.160> know<00:03:15.280> if<00:03:15.370> she's<00:03:15.550> doing<00:03:15.760> that

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
length I don't know if she's doing that

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.699 
length I don't know if she's doing that
on<00:03:16.000> purpose<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.569> really<00:03:17.050> don't<00:03:17.230> think<00:03:17.290> she's

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
on purpose I really don't think she's

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.260 
on purpose I really don't think she's
missing<00:03:17.860> by<00:03:18.160> four<00:03:18.400> boards<00:03:18.700> that's<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.120> narrow

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
missing by four boards that's a narrow

missing by four boards that's a narrow
Chris<00:03:19.599> well<00:03:19.989> it's<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.319> narrow<00:03:20.560> but<00:03:20.830> alright

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430

though like Vickie is to a certain
degree<00:03:24.430> I<00:03:24.610> guess<00:03:24.910> you're<00:03:25.030> gonna<00:03:25.150> miss<00:03:25.360> a

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
degree I guess you're gonna miss a

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.000 
degree I guess you're gonna miss a
little<00:03:25.599> once<00:03:25.810> in<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:25.959> while<00:03:26.140> when<00:03:26.650> you<00:03:26.739> have<00:03:26.860> the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
little once in a while when you have the

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.440 
little once in a while when you have the
kind<00:03:27.190> of<00:03:27.280> rotation<00:03:27.580> on<00:03:27.849> the<00:03:27.940> ball<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.239> when<00:03:28.360> it

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
kind of rotation on the ball and when it

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.880 
kind of rotation on the ball and when it
comes<00:03:28.599> back<00:03:28.870> as<00:03:29.050> hard<00:03:29.260> as<00:03:29.410> hers<00:03:29.620> does

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
comes back as hard as hers does

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.890 
comes back as hard as hers does
sometimes<00:03:30.760> you<00:03:30.910> can<00:03:31.180> get<00:03:31.360> away<00:03:31.450> with<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.840> and

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
sometimes you can get away with it and

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.750 
sometimes you can get away with it and
that's<00:03:32.019> why<00:03:32.380> she's<00:03:32.410> as<00:03:32.860> successful<00:03:33.430> as<00:03:33.519> she<00:03:33.670> is

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
that's why she's as successful as she is

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.699 
that's why she's as successful as she is
because<00:03:33.970> she<00:03:34.090> can<00:03:34.360> make<00:03:34.569> a<00:03:34.599> few<00:03:34.900> mistakes<00:03:35.019> and

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
because she can make a few mistakes and

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.590 
because she can make a few mistakes and
still<00:03:36.190> get<00:03:36.340> away<00:03:36.430> with<00:03:36.700> them<00:03:36.819> no<00:03:37.120> question

good<00:04:50.680> breaks<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:51.099> bad<00:04:51.250> breaks<00:04:51.490> if<00:04:51.639> you<00:04:51.729> don't

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
good breaks and bad breaks if you don't

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.640 
good breaks and bad breaks if you don't
watch<00:04:52.090> it<00:04:52.120> all<00:04:52.479> you<00:04:52.660> have<00:04:52.780> no<00:04:52.990> idea<00:04:53.380> what's

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
happened and if you watch it could

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.230 
happened and if you watch it could
affect<00:04:55.960> you<00:04:56.110> I<00:04:56.550> think<00:04:57.550> if<00:04:57.669> you<00:04:57.789> watched<00:04:58.000> you

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240
