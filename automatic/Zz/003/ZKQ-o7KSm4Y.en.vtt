00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.240
 hello friends here we are again in the 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.759
 field and pole resort and we will do 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.980
 a functional exercise that is going to 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.410
 involve the belly and it will start from 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.800
 your back so get ready grab a 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.800
 pad 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.180
 your initial to do sit-ups 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.280
 good attention the waist against the step 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.079
 the heels near the tail try not to 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.960
 lift the tips of the feet 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.690
 they carry their arms back 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.690
 extension of co2 air intakes 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.329
 this participates not only the 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.000
 abdominal but also the hip and the 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.310
 arms 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.900
 here comes the back 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:10.090
 abdominal in fact I do not work to chest 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.090
 but it is here chest blows and low 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.990
 remember that you have to have a good 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.659
 technique to achieve the goal and vary 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.690
 in the weight can be two and a half can 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.880
 being 5 depends on your physical attitude a 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.940
 very common mistake is to raise the tail to 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.920
 compensate and lift up or be like a 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.740
 movement this coordinated you have to 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.530
 try not to raise the tail and 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.570
 extend but that initials of the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.369
 back and follow the movement but 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.050
 they share until I get up is very 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.380
 important that the heels are close 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.140
 of the tail and not far away almost spreading 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.390
 the hip 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.920
 to try to why that causes you 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.600
 you bend in the back so 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.130
 it does not have to be almost extended 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.130
 heels but bending 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.769
 or 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.150
 in recreational football what can you 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.480
 happen as common injuries are 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.300
 problems in the knees or aches 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.870
 tears contractures and distension is 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.000
 the contracture is that aggression that suffers 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.950
 the muscle with a kick for example and 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.930
 that the pain comes when when 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.270
 you're cold an extension is when 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.490
 you have that pull cited that we go beyond 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.620
 which may be due to muscle shortening 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.880
 and a tear already when there is rupture 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.880
 fibrillar you have to be very careful
