00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
honestly how it can change the dynamic

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.709 
honestly how it can change the dynamic
of<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.200> weapon<00:01:58.469> but<00:01:59.210> let's<00:02:00.210> get<00:02:00.299> started<00:02:00.450> with

attacks<00:02:18.570> which<00:02:18.840> as<00:02:18.990> I<00:02:19.110> mentioned<00:02:19.530> for<00:02:20.070> some<00:02:20.280> of

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
attacks which as I mentioned for some of

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.520 
attacks which as I mentioned for some of
the<00:02:20.520> fights<00:02:20.760> I

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
the fights I

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.620 
the fights I
I'm<00:02:21.590> using<00:02:21.860> thrusting<00:02:22.520> damage<00:02:23.150> increasing

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
I'm using thrusting damage increasing

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.990 
I'm using thrusting damage increasing
blood<00:02:23.810> gems<00:02:24.110> so<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.310> rest<00:02:25.550> of<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.730> damage

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
blood gems so the rest of the damage

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.980 
blood gems so the rest of the damage
will<00:02:26.150> appear<00:02:26.420> weak

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
will appear weak

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.170 
will appear weak
however<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:28.069> thrusting<00:02:28.490> damage<00:02:28.790> will<00:02:29.000> hit

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
however the thrusting damage will hit

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.650 
however the thrusting damage will hit
very<00:02:29.690> high<00:02:29.990> easy<00:02:30.910> 500s<00:02:31.910> with<00:02:32.030> uncharged

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
very high easy 500s with uncharged

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.610 
very high easy 500s with uncharged
Artoo's<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:34.120> even<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.300> 700<00:02:35.870> or<00:02:35.990> -<00:02:36.200> at<00:02:36.350> some

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
Artoo's and even a 700 or - at some

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.410 
Artoo's and even a 700 or - at some
points<00:02:36.920> throughout<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.400> video<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:38.030> it<00:02:38.060> really

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
points throughout the video so it really

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.260 
points throughout the video so it really
goes<00:02:38.600> to<00:02:38.660> show<00:02:39.130> thrusting<00:02:40.130> blood<00:02:40.520> gems<00:02:40.790> can<00:02:41.120> be

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
goes to show thrusting blood gems can be

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.530 
goes to show thrusting blood gems can be
quite<00:02:41.569> good<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:42.860> there's<00:02:43.069> that

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
quite good so there's that

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.750 
quite good so there's that
now<00:02:44.540> with<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.739> thrusting<00:02:46.100> attacks<00:02:46.430> for<00:02:46.670> your

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
now with the thrusting attacks for your

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.270 
now with the thrusting attacks for your
Artoo's<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.989> can<00:02:48.140> do<00:02:48.319> a<00:02:48.350> regular<00:02:48.530> r2<00:02:48.980> you<00:02:49.160> can

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
Artoo's you can do a regular r2 you can

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.220 
Artoo's you can do a regular r2 you can
do<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.400> charged<00:02:49.730> r2<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:50.720> can<00:02:50.840> also<00:02:50.989> do<00:02:51.200> a

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
do a charged r2 and you can also do a

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.990 
do a charged r2 and you can also do a
running<00:02:51.530> r2<00:02:51.860> which<00:02:52.040> is<00:02:52.160> also<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.520> thrust<00:02:52.850> which

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
running r2 which is also a thrust which

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.970 
running r2 which is also a thrust which
is<00:02:53.030> very<00:02:53.390> good<00:02:53.600> for<00:02:53.690> people<00:02:53.750> who<00:02:54.110> back<00:02:54.650> off<00:02:54.860> in

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
is very good for people who back off in

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.860 
is very good for people who back off in
a<00:02:55.070> linear<00:02:55.220> fashion<00:02:55.489> if<00:02:56.180> anyone<00:02:56.510> is<00:02:56.690> running

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
a linear fashion if anyone is running

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.390 
a linear fashion if anyone is running
backwards<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:57.530> runs<00:02:57.769> at<00:02:57.920> an<00:02:58.010> angle<00:02:58.310> though

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
backwards and runs at an angle though

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.949 
backwards and runs at an angle though
you<00:02:58.459> want<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.760> go<00:02:58.850> for<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.030> running<00:02:59.300> r1<00:02:59.660> because

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
you want to go for a running r1 because

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.720 
you want to go for a running r1 because
that<00:03:00.110> is<00:03:00.230> a<00:03:00.260> sweep<00:03:00.680> as<00:03:00.890> opposed<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.370> thrust

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
that is a sweep as opposed to a thrust

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.410 
that is a sweep as opposed to a thrust
and<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.239> will<00:03:02.390> work<00:03:02.630> better<00:03:02.900> for<00:03:03.170> you<00:03:03.230> so

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
and it will work better for you so

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.920 
and it will work better for you so
that's<00:03:05.420> that<00:03:05.720> now<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:07.430> first<00:03:07.670> form<00:03:07.970> charged

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
that's that now the first form charged

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.350 
that's that now the first form charged
r2<00:03:09.319> it's<00:03:09.650> got<00:03:09.800> a<00:03:09.830> one<00:03:10.040> point<00:03:10.220> two<00:03:10.400> times<00:03:10.550> one

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
r2 it's got a one point two times one

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.690 
r2 it's got a one point two times one
point<00:03:11.630> two<00:03:11.870> times<00:03:12.080> damage<00:03:12.860> multiplier<00:03:13.370> so<00:03:13.580> it

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
point two times damage multiplier so it

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.820 
point two times damage multiplier so it
will<00:03:13.819> do<00:03:14.000> some<00:03:14.209> pretty<00:03:14.450> fair<00:03:14.750> damage<00:03:15.140> it's<00:03:15.620> not

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
will do some pretty fair damage it's not

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.080 
will do some pretty fair damage it's not
something<00:03:16.130> you<00:03:16.250> really<00:03:16.280> want<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:16.880> mess<00:03:17.060> with

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
something you really want to mess with

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.610 
something you really want to mess with
although<00:03:17.420> it's<00:03:17.660> still<00:03:17.930> not<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.350> highest

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
although it's still not the highest

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.530 
although it's still not the highest
damaging<00:03:19.250> thing<00:03:19.459> that<00:03:19.610> there<00:03:19.760> is<00:03:19.790> with<00:03:20.420> the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
damaging thing that there is with the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.660 
damaging thing that there is with the
weapon<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.530> highest<00:03:21.830> damaging<00:03:22.280> attack<00:03:22.519> that

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
weapon the highest damaging attack that

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.840

than<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.579> first<00:03:43.790> form<00:03:44.060> its<00:03:44.810> l2<00:03:45.380> attacks<00:03:45.739> are<00:03:46.100> a

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
than the first form its l2 attacks are a

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.750 
than the first form its l2 attacks are a
wide<00:03:46.730> sweep<00:03:47.570> which<00:03:48.290> I<00:03:48.440> find<00:03:48.739> very<00:03:48.860> useful<00:03:49.579> for

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
wide sweep which I find very useful for

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.420 
wide sweep which I find very useful for
hitting<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.030> lot<00:03:50.329> of<00:03:50.630> people<00:03:51.170> and<00:03:51.380> I<00:03:51.560> mean<00:03:51.799> a<00:03:51.950> lot

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
hitting a lot of people and I mean a lot

well and that's really all I've got for
the<00:04:09.680> pros<00:04:09.950> cons<00:04:10.790> of<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.060> weapon<00:04:11.329> in<00:04:11.480> the<00:04:11.930> first

form its damage is a bit lacking at

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.729 
form its damage is a bit lacking at
times<00:04:15.769> and<00:04:16.600> you<00:04:17.600> know<00:04:17.690> it<00:04:17.840> is<00:04:17.959> what<00:04:18.109> it<00:04:18.140> is<00:04:18.289> it

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
times and you know it is what it is it

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:19.900 
times and you know it is what it is it
should<00:04:18.919> be<00:04:18.950> expected<00:04:19.310> it<00:04:19.579> could<00:04:19.700> use<00:04:19.820> a<00:04:19.850> little

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
should be expected it could use a little

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.409 
should be expected it could use a little
bit<00:04:20.239> more<00:04:20.419> damage<00:04:20.950> but<00:04:21.950> oh<00:04:22.220> well<00:04:22.760> in<00:04:22.940> the

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
bit more damage but oh well in the

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.260 
bit more damage but oh well in the
secondary<00:04:23.810> form<00:04:24.169> however<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.850> damage<00:04:26.180> is

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
secondary form however the damage is

secondary form however the damage is
very<00:04:26.750> good<00:04:26.990> it's<00:04:27.260> very<00:04:27.560> solid<00:04:28.599> however<00:04:29.599> you're

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
very good it's very solid however you're

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.390 
very good it's very solid however you're
lacking<00:04:30.020> in<00:04:30.380> the<00:04:30.530> speed<00:04:30.800> Department<00:04:31.310> which

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
lacking in the speed Department which

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.519 
lacking in the speed Department which
makes<00:04:31.669> sense<00:04:31.909> because<00:04:32.090> you

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:32.529 
makes sense because you

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:35.729 
makes sense because you
using<00:04:32.709> a<00:04:32.799> giant<00:04:33.309> hammer<00:04:33.759> so<00:04:34.209> it's<00:04:35.079> just<00:04:35.499> what

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:35.739 
using a giant hammer so it's just what

00:04:35.739 --> 00:04:37.139 
using a giant hammer so it's just what
comes<00:04:35.889> with<00:04:36.069> the<00:04:36.129> territory<00:04:36.369> it<00:04:36.849> makes

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:37.149 
comes with the territory it makes

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:39.299 
comes with the territory it makes
complete<00:04:37.389> sense<00:04:37.599> for<00:04:38.169> what<00:04:38.289> the<00:04:38.379> weapon<00:04:38.649> is<00:04:38.889> so

00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:39.309 
complete sense for what the weapon is so

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:40.409 
complete sense for what the weapon is so
there's<00:04:39.489> that<00:04:39.669> and<00:04:39.789> I'm<00:04:39.879> sorry<00:04:40.059> if<00:04:40.239> you<00:04:40.299> can

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
there's that and I'm sorry if you can

hear LaCie barking I do apologize now as

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.259 
hear LaCie barking I do apologize now as
I<00:04:44.649> was<00:04:44.739> saying<00:04:44.979> earlier<00:04:45.129> about<00:04:45.429> the<00:04:45.909> secondary

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:46.269 
I was saying earlier about the secondary

00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:49.289 
I was saying earlier about the secondary
form<00:04:46.539> and<00:04:46.719> its<00:04:46.989> l2<00:04:47.529> attacks<00:04:47.889> it<00:04:48.759> has<00:04:48.999> a<00:04:49.029> very

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:49.299 
form and its l2 attacks it has a very

00:04:49.299 --> 00:04:52.499 
form and its l2 attacks it has a very
wide<00:04:49.509> damaging<00:04:50.229> a<00:04:50.469> very<00:04:51.129> wide<00:04:51.399> and<00:04:51.699> damaging

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
wide damaging a very wide and damaging

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.979 
wide damaging a very wide and damaging
sweep<00:04:52.869> attack<00:04:53.169> so<00:04:54.129> that<00:04:54.999> attack<00:04:55.419> will<00:04:55.659> hit<00:04:55.929> a

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:55.989 
sweep attack so that attack will hit a

00:04:55.989 --> 00:04:57.779 
sweep attack so that attack will hit a
lot<00:04:56.199> of<00:04:56.229> people<00:04:56.589> if<00:04:56.799> you<00:04:56.979> can<00:04:57.129> bait<00:04:57.309> them<00:04:57.489> into

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
lot of people if you can bait them into

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:58.079 
lot of people if you can bait them into
it

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:58.089 
it

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:00.419 
it
so<00:04:58.299> what<00:04:58.419> I<00:04:58.449> recommend<00:04:58.929> doing<00:04:59.019> is<00:04:59.529> missing<00:05:00.309> on

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:00.429 
so what I recommend doing is missing on

00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:02.699 
so what I recommend doing is missing on
purpose<00:05:00.879> with<00:05:01.059> an<00:05:01.149> r1<00:05:01.539> attack<00:05:01.809> and<00:05:02.049> following

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:02.709 
purpose with an r1 attack and following

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:04.829 
purpose with an r1 attack and following
it<00:05:02.799> up<00:05:02.829> with<00:05:02.889> an<00:05:03.069> l2<00:05:03.369> people<00:05:04.209> will<00:05:04.389> run<00:05:04.599> into

00:05:04.829 --> 00:05:04.839 
it up with an l2 people will run into

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:06.689 
it up with an l2 people will run into
that<00:05:04.929> on<00:05:05.139> their<00:05:05.289> own<00:05:05.409> all<00:05:05.589> the<00:05:05.949> time<00:05:06.189> works

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:06.699 
that on their own all the time works

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.569 
that on their own all the time works
like<00:05:06.789> a<00:05:06.909> charm<00:05:07.409> also<00:05:08.409> another<00:05:08.859> very<00:05:09.189> good<00:05:09.399> bait

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:09.579 
like a charm also another very good bait

00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:11.489 
like a charm also another very good bait
that<00:05:09.759> works<00:05:09.939> in<00:05:10.149> in<00:05:10.269> a<00:05:10.539> similar<00:05:10.929> manner<00:05:11.199> is

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:11.499 
that works in in a similar manner is
