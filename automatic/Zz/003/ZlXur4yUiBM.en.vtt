00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.619 

in<00:00:01.530> this<00:00:01.800> video<00:00:02.010> we<00:00:02.490> are<00:00:02.550> going<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:03.060> explain

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
in this video we are going to explain

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:12.350 
in this video we are going to explain
the<00:00:03.840> concept<00:00:04.500> of<00:00:04.910> memory<00:00:06.170> indirection<00:00:11.360> now

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
the concept of memory indirection now

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.430 
the concept of memory indirection now
memory<00:00:13.110> indirection<00:00:13.710> assumes<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.639> following

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
memory indirection assumes the following

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.920 
memory indirection assumes the following
first<00:00:16.440> let's<00:00:17.070> think<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.460> memory<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.690> we're

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
first let's think of a memory and we're

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.120 
first let's think of a memory and we're
gonna<00:00:19.080> represent<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.770> such<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.279> each<00:00:22.130> cell

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
gonna represent it such that each cell

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.560 
gonna represent it such that each cell
we're<00:00:23.369> gonna<00:00:23.490> draw<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:23.970> memory<00:00:24.300> is

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
we're gonna draw in this memory is

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.589 
we're gonna draw in this memory is
actually<00:00:24.840> made<00:00:25.289> out<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.590> four<00:00:26.070> bytes<00:00:26.390> so<00:00:27.390> this

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
actually made out of four bytes so this

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.080 
actually made out of four bytes so this
cell<00:00:27.840> over<00:00:28.050> here<00:00:28.130> contains<00:00:29.130> four<00:00:29.429> bytes<00:00:29.699> let's

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
cell over here contains four bytes let's

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.010 
cell over here contains four bytes let's
assume<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.170> position<00:00:31.679> 100<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.020> it

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
assume that is in position 100 and it

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.290 
assume that is in position 100 and it
contains<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:35.130> number<00:00:35.430> three<00:00:35.640> thousand<00:00:36.090> six

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
contains the number three thousand six

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.690 
contains the number three thousand six
hundred<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.870> eighty-one<00:00:37.260> now<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.219> with<00:00:38.489> all

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
hundred and eighty-one now this with all

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.490 
hundred and eighty-one now this with all
memories<00:00:39.180> what<00:00:39.420> we<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.750> they<00:00:39.899> are<00:00:40.020> stored

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
memories what we have they are stored

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.540 
memories what we have they are stored
values<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.420> each<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.200> these<00:00:43.350> cells<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:44.399> be

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
values and each of these cells can be

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.130 
values and each of these cells can be
referred<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.590> with<00:00:46.590> an<00:00:46.829> address<00:00:48.020> we're<00:00:49.020> gonna

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
referred to with an address we're gonna

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.380 
referred to with an address we're gonna
make<00:00:49.350> one<00:00:49.590> more<00:00:49.800> assumption<00:00:50.129> which<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.149> that

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
make one more assumption which is that

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.680 
make one more assumption which is that
the<00:00:51.510> addresses<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.680> memory<00:00:53.160> are

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
the addresses of this memory are

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.270 
the addresses of this memory are
represented<00:00:54.690> using<00:00:57.379> numbers<00:00:58.379> encoded<00:00:59.100> with

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
represented using numbers encoded with

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.030 
represented using numbers encoded with
four<00:00:59.789> bytes<00:01:02.000> okay<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:03.180> these<00:01:03.300> assumptions

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
four bytes okay with these assumptions

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
four bytes okay with these assumptions
what<00:01:05.040> we<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.369> state<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.420> 100<00:01:07.430> is<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
what we can state is that 100 is the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.310 
what we can state is that 100 is the
address<00:01:09.600> at<00:01:09.979> which<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.280> value<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.930> 3680<00:01:12.930> 1<00:01:13.170> is

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
address at which the value of 3680 1 is

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.600 
address at which the value of 3680 1 is
a<00:01:13.350> store<00:01:13.799> or<00:01:14.360> simply<00:01:15.360> 100<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.650> address<00:01:17.310> of

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
a store or simply 100 is the address of

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.010 
a store or simply 100 is the address of
value<00:01:18.150> 3<00:01:18.869> 6<00:01:19.140> 8<00:01:19.290> 1<00:01:20.210> very<00:01:21.210> trivial<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.900> is

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
value 3 6 8 1 very trivial and this is

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.380 
value 3 6 8 1 very trivial and this is
what<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.470> been<00:01:22.619> seen<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.100> far<00:01:23.340> now<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
what we have been seen so far now the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.330 
what we have been seen so far now the
interaction<00:01:24.689> appears<00:01:25.320> because<00:01:25.500> at<00:01:25.979> some

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
interaction appears because at some

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.060 
interaction appears because at some
other<00:01:26.520> location<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:27.210> memory<00:01:27.740> let's<00:01:28.740> say<00:01:28.890> for

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
other location in memory let's say for

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.240 
other location in memory let's say for
example<00:01:29.100> position<00:01:30.140> 200<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.619> store<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
example position 200 we can store the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.240 
example position 200 we can store the
natural<00:01:32.700> number<00:01:33.000> 100<00:01:33.770> itself<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> number

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
natural number 100 itself is a number

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.609 
natural number 100 itself is a number
and<00:01:35.369> therefore<00:01:35.520> can<00:01:35.909> be<00:01:35.939> stored<00:01:36.360> there<00:01:36.619> with

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
and therefore can be stored there with

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.170 
and therefore can be stored there with
four<00:01:37.829> bytes<00:01:38.070> now<00:01:38.340> what<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.729> happening<00:01:39.150> that

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
four bytes now what is happening that

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.130 
four bytes now what is happening that
this<00:01:39.540> 100<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.590> address<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.340> data

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
this 100 is the address of the data

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.380 
this 100 is the address of the data
therefore<00:01:43.140> what<00:01:43.290> we<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.470> say<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.390> 200

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
therefore what we can say is that 200

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.770 
therefore what we can say is that 200
years<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:46.140> address<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:50.270> not<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> value

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
years the address of not the value

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.179 
years the address of not the value
because<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.170> are<00:01:52.259> not<00:01:52.380> accessing<00:01:52.740> directly

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
because we are not accessing directly

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.590 
because we are not accessing directly
the<00:01:53.310> value<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.030> address<00:01:55.700> of<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.360> value

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
the value but the address of the value

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.870 
the value but the address of the value
3,680<00:02:00.600> 1<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.829> we<00:02:01.979> can<00:02:02.159> see<00:02:02.399> here<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.850> that

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
3,680 1 so we can see here is that

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.789 
3,680 1 so we can see here is that
rather<00:02:03.210> than<00:02:03.329> accessing<00:02:04.079> directly<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.680> this

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
rather than accessing directly to this

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.440 
rather than accessing directly to this
data<00:02:05.130> what<00:02:05.610> we're<00:02:05.759> making<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.270> an<00:02:06.450> indirection

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
data what we're making is an indirection

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.950 
data what we're making is an indirection
instead<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.539> accessing<00:02:09.989> directly<00:02:10.970> 3691

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
instead of accessing directly 3691

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.080 
instead of accessing directly 3691
in<00:02:13.020> this<00:02:13.170> position<00:02:13.650> 100<00:02:14.190> we<00:02:14.610> go<00:02:14.730> first<00:02:14.970> to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
in this position 100 we go first to

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.570 
in this position 100 we go first to
position<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.750> our<00:02:15.840> 200<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:17.010> what<00:02:17.250> we<00:02:17.370> find

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
position to our 200 and what we find

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.790 
position to our 200 and what we find
there<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:17.820> not<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.480> data<00:02:18.810> but<00:02:19.620> the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
there is not that that data but the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.770 
there is not that that data but the
address<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.640> data<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.270> we<00:02:21.300> make<00:02:21.630> the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
address of the data and we make the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.010 
address of the data and we make the
indirection<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.970> we<00:02:24.090> go<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.660> final

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
indirection and we go to the final

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.700 
indirection and we go to the final
destination

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
destination

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.230 
destination
in<00:02:25.770> which<00:02:26.010> we<00:02:26.190> find<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.460> data<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.090> what

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
in which we find the data this is what

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.990 
in which we find the data this is what
is<00:02:27.330> called<00:02:27.510> an<00:02:27.630> indirection

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
is called an indirection

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.840 
is called an indirection
now<00:02:30.000> this<00:02:30.210> indirection<00:02:31.280> can<00:02:32.280> actually<00:02:32.700> be

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
now this indirection can actually be

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.210 
now this indirection can actually be
done<00:02:33.030> multiple<00:02:33.870> times<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.710> this<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:34.890> what<00:02:35.130> it

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
done multiple times and this is what it

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.700 
done multiple times and this is what it
gets<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.520> little<00:02:35.610> bit<00:02:35.820> confusing<00:02:36.240> so<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:37.530> same

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
gets a little bit confusing so the same

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.710 
gets a little bit confusing so the same
rationale<00:02:38.130> can<00:02:38.370> be<00:02:38.490> apply<00:02:38.760> again<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.570> the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
rationale can be apply again to the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.050 
rationale can be apply again to the
number<00:02:40.050> 200<00:02:40.710> so<00:02:41.010> for<00:02:41.190> example<00:02:41.550> in<00:02:41.640> position

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
number 200 so for example in position

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.940 
number 200 so for example in position
300<00:02:42.750> we<00:02:43.380> can<00:02:43.560> store<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.220> value<00:02:44.580> 200<00:02:45.560> now<00:02:46.560> what

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
300 we can store the value 200 now what

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.970 
300 we can store the value 200 now what
we<00:02:47.100> can<00:02:47.250> say<00:02:47.520> is<00:02:47.580> 300<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.540> an<00:02:48.690> address<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.440> in

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
we can say is 300 is an address and in

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.860 
we can say is 300 is an address and in
fact<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.460> the<00:02:50.820> address<00:02:51.710> off<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:54.540> we<00:02:54.660> write

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
fact is the address off and we write

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.290 
fact is the address off and we write
what<00:02:55.080> we<00:02:55.110> wrote<00:02:55.470> Road<00:02:55.920> up<00:02:56.130> there<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.640> the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
what we wrote Road up there of the

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.670 
what we wrote Road up there of the
address<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:59.040> address<00:03:00.890> of<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.430> value

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
address of the address of the value

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.140 
address of the address of the value
three<00:03:04.680> thousand<00:03:05.280> six<00:03:05.490> hundred<00:03:05.670> and

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
three thousand six hundred and

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.240 
three thousand six hundred and
eighty-one<00:03:06.630> so<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.350> is<00:03:07.470> called<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.740> multiple

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
eighty-one so this is called a multiple

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.520 
eighty-one so this is called a multiple
indirection<00:03:08.910> because<00:03:09.540> again<00:03:10.200> rather<00:03:10.440> than

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
indirection because again rather than

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.100 
indirection because again rather than
accessing<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.370> data<00:03:11.580> directly<00:03:12.120> what<00:03:12.840> we<00:03:12.960> do

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
accessing the data directly what we do

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.370 
accessing the data directly what we do
is<00:03:13.290> first<00:03:13.590> we<00:03:13.740> go<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:13.980> position<00:03:14.370> 300<00:03:15.090> we<00:03:16.080> find

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
is first we go to position 300 we find

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.250 
is first we go to position 300 we find
the<00:03:16.470> address<00:03:20.390> 200<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.480> value<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.840> handle<00:03:22.140> with

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
the address 200 the value to handle with

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.140 
the address 200 the value to handle with
which<00:03:22.710> is<00:03:22.860> itself<00:03:23.190> an<00:03:23.430> address<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:26.220> then<00:03:26.490> we

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
which is itself an address and then we

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.520 
which is itself an address and then we
make<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.570> double<00:03:27.870> indirection<00:03:30.380> until<00:03:31.380> we

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
make a double indirection until we

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.620 
make a double indirection until we
finally<00:03:32.840> reach<00:03:34.190> from<00:03:35.190> position<00:03:35.610> 200<00:03:36.120> we'll

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
finally reach from position 200 we'll

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.690 
finally reach from position 200 we'll
obtain<00:03:36.960> the<00:03:37.290> value<00:03:37.590> 100<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.340> we<00:03:38.550> reach

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
obtain the value 100 and we reach

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.230 
obtain the value 100 and we reach
eventually<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.690> value<00:03:43.670> now<00:03:44.670> one<00:03:44.880> final<00:03:45.060> thing

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
eventually the value now one final thing

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.810 
eventually the value now one final thing
about<00:03:45.630> in<00:03:45.900> directions<00:03:46.230> they<00:03:47.130> may<00:03:47.430> seem

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
about in directions they may seem

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.490 
about in directions they may seem
totally<00:03:48.270> counterintuitive

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
totally counterintuitive

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.610 
totally counterintuitive
however<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:51.270> interaction<00:03:51.990> is<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.140> mechanism

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
however the interaction is a mechanism

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.250 
however the interaction is a mechanism
that<00:03:53.460> is<00:03:53.610> used<00:03:53.880> very<00:03:54.120> very<00:03:54.840> very<00:03:55.590> often<00:03:57.260> when

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
that is used very very very often when

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.940 
that is used very very very often when
using<00:03:58.710> programming<00:03:59.400> languages<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:01.620> problem

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
using programming languages the problem

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.470 
using programming languages the problem
is<00:04:02.070> that<00:04:02.370> this<00:04:02.490> programming<00:04:02.970> language<00:04:03.270> is

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
is that this programming language is

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.540 
is that this programming language is
high<00:04:03.840> these<00:04:03.900> details<00:04:04.560> but<00:04:04.860> inside<00:04:05.250> underneath

high these details but inside underneath

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.410
