00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.090
 what can we think of today because of 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.030
 that they have televisions in the 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.710
 maternity 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.419
 on the one hand I do not know of 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.180
 maternity where he no television in 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:19.510
 the rooms of patients who are going 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.790
 give birth or who have just given birth 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.590
 so it's a problem in itself that we 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.300
 indicates that everything is happening as if 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.290
 it was normal now that has a 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.520
 TV in the room at the hospital 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.430
 finally it's true that we can understand 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.730
 only in the room of a senior 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.690
 or there is television because risk 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.670
 bored all the time in that 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.840
 the hospital but when it comes to a 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.460
 someone who has just had a baby 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.900
 we can not think that it did not 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.470
 influenced on what will unfold 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.180
 after I discuss regularly and 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.100
 pediatricians in different circumstances 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.360
 and I realize that for 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.370
 pediatricians who pass through the 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.840
 maternities examine the baby the same day 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:06.170
 of the birth of this baby 15 years ago 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.350
 and at 10 years old it is very often that he 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.389
 asked the mom too we could 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.030
 turn off the television to examine the 

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:15.590
 baby the first day of his life and so 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.869
 the moms totally agreed 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.429
 there was no problem these 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.639
 last years pediatricians do not 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:24.950
 tells that moms often ask 

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:26.420
 that the pediatrician spends another moment 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.060
 when the missions they are in 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.829
 watching will be over then he 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.270
 it's not about turning that into judgment 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.189
 moral is not to say that it is 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.569
 good or bad it's all about 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.240
 question of what can be 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.369
 influence it from those in this media 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.979
 particular about what will happen in 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.630
 the interaction between a baby and his mother 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.740
 and his dad who also comes to watch the 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.549
 television in the bedroom of the 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.349
 maternity in its development 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:54.799
 so I think it's very 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:56.479
 interesting to think from the 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.409
 quality of interactions between a baby 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.349
 and his mom 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.430
 a baby that has just been born it is put 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:04.730
 within 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.830
 in the east in the minutes that follow 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.649
 for this famous welcome tt and 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.970
 and then he'll be there often in 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.320
 his cradle and then in the arms of his 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.000
 mum 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.670
 but as soon as they wake up this baby is 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.970
 will offer him the saint and press 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.540
 the baby monkey will watch he will dive 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.010
 in the look of his mom so what 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.640
 is happening with respect to this television 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.070
 it is if the look of his mom in 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.970
 which in which he must dive he 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.130
 must he can dive to meet 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.650
 the humanity of his mother from the first 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.080
 day of his life and that in fact his mom has 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.720
 eyes turned towards this very object 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.250
 attractive than television well 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.260
 maybe this baby there he will land 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.930
 the question 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:54.020
 his way to him or is he the 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.300
 moments look there there is a whole 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.680
 very interesting concept that we study in 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.540
 general later in the development 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.170
 of the child she that of the tension 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.459
 joint 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:07.940
 we spoke at 18 months of the importance that 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.709
 a baby can direct his attention to 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.840
 something he intrigues who 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.090
 interest him for which he is curious 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.250
 and that they converge towards this 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.500
 object the look of his mom and dad 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.380
 this is called attention 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.299
 together an object and that allows the 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.340
 funds to prepare this baby any 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.860
 importance after dialogue around 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.380
 this object this object does not trigger a 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.350
 emotion and what do you think 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.370
 firmly that the sherpas not that but 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.739
 we did not ask ourselves the question 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.269
 so much to know the joint tension 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.930
 if it did not start much sooner 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.400
 that in life 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.959
 so probably it starts 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.480
 much earlier in other words 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.930
 and that maybe this interesting to himself 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.760
 ask what effect 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.980
 ten tractors the television comes to play 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.320
 in this very complex circuit of 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.000
 the interrelation of a baby and his mother 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.970
 the day of his birth and in the 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.280
 days that follow and at that moment I 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:05.150
 believe we can ask ourselves the question 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.299
 to know how the mom she the 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.160
 whether or not the TV is 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.490
 lit in his room it will lead 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.040
 at her house something that is 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.440
 a kind of attraction maybe despite 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.370
 she towards this very attractive object 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.360
 what is television 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.810
 and it will necessarily be to the detriment 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.630
 of the tension she must bring to 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.940
 her baby who has just been born 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.350
 so probably a mom when she 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.780
 is in the early days of the 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.730
 birth of her baby she is protected 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.440
 because winnicott had described 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.600
 calls the maternal preoccupation 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.850
 primary ie basically the fact 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.840
 that all the mom's attention is 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.920
 attracted to this story of 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.070
 to take an interest in his baby because he 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.930
 goes from its survival but often when one 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.300
 talk about it we talk about survival 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.940
 physiological give the breast of neil 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.100
 will live caring for him in a way to 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.640
 what they can sleep to be well 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.190
 in shape 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.560
 but are we paying enough attention to 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.150
 the psychic part of the attention 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.400
 must bring within the framework of the 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.830
 primary maternal concern when 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.140
 we are a mother to her baby and I believe 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.090
 that on this plane there is no 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.110
 doubt a much larger effect 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.560
 we want to recognize him 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.560
 today
