sets the autopilot to all of its takeoff
settings<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.920> will<00:01:22.950> set<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> thrust<00:01:24.000> for

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
settings it will set the thrust for

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.690 
settings it will set the thrust for
takeoff<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.229> active<00:01:25.680> here<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.549> will

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
takeoff on the active here it will

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.030 
takeoff on the active here it will
monitor<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.390> airspeed<00:01:27.869> etc<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.680> adjust

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
monitor the airspeed etc and adjust

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.330 
monitor the airspeed etc and adjust
accordingly<00:01:30.259> so<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.560> will<00:01:31.680> also<00:01:31.829> give<00:01:32.100> us<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
accordingly so it will also give us the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.550 
accordingly so it will also give us the
correct<00:01:32.549> flight<00:01:32.850> director<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.659> fly<00:01:34.229> off<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
correct flight director to fly off the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:45.310 
correct flight director to fly off the
runway

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.319 

okay<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.380> we're<00:01:46.829> just<00:01:46.859> lining<00:01:47.520> up<00:01:47.609> here<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.030> to

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
okay so we're just lining up here on to

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.919 
okay so we're just lining up here on to
five<00:01:48.630> ak10<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:51.030> aircraft<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.630> kind<00:01:51.840> of

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
five ak10 and this aircraft you kind of

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.480 
five ak10 and this aircraft you kind of
overshoot<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.710> centreline<00:01:53.219> a<00:01:53.250> little<00:01:53.549> bit

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
overshoot the centreline a little bit

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.249 
overshoot the centreline a little bit
because<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.729> nosewheel<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.569> quite<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.929> ways

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
because the nosewheel is quite a ways

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:08.410 
because the nosewheel is quite a ways
behind<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.829> flight<00:01:59.039> deck

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420

you're going to hear the first officer

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.220 
you're going to hear the first officer
call<00:02:15.880> takeoff<00:02:16.880> thrust<00:02:17.090> set<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.720> from<00:02:18.080> that

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
call takeoff thrust set and from that

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.930 
call takeoff thrust set and from that
point<00:02:18.470> on<00:02:18.680> it's<00:02:19.010> going<00:02:19.490> to<00:02:19.580> be<00:02:19.670> just

ahead<00:03:47.300> and<00:03:47.980> turn<00:03:48.980> off<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.340> auto<00:03:49.490> brakes<00:03:49.850> and

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
ahead and turn off the auto brakes and

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
ahead and turn off the auto brakes and
disarm<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.570> spoilers<00:03:52.480> as<00:03:53.480> you<00:03:53.660> can<00:03:53.780> see<00:03:53.930> on

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
disarm the spoilers as you can see on

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.230 
disarm the spoilers as you can see on
the<00:03:54.260> primary<00:03:54.710> flight<00:03:54.980> display<00:03:55.240> it's

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
the primary flight display it's

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.440 
the primary flight display it's
controlling<00:03:57.200> our<00:03:57.350> pitch<00:03:57.620> nap<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.640> is<00:03:58.940> the

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
controlling our pitch nap to is the

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.300 
controlling our pitch nap to is the
selected<00:03:59.960> source<00:04:00.230> in<00:04:00.680> switched<00:04:01.070> out<00:04:01.220> without

selected source in switched out without

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.870 
selected source in switched out without
a<00:04:01.490> flight<00:04:01.820> when<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.060> snap<00:04:02.330> one<00:04:02.570> or<00:04:02.840> NAB<00:04:03.020> two

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
a flight when you snap one or NAB two

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.320 
a flight when you snap one or NAB two
and<00:04:04.880> climb<00:04:05.360> thrust<00:04:05.750> is<00:04:06.020> set<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:06.800> we're<00:04:07.790> headed

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
and climb thrust is set and we're headed

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.950 
and climb thrust is set and we're headed
for<00:04:08.360> an<00:04:08.570> altitude<00:04:08.870> of<00:04:09.200> 35,000<00:04:10.190> feet<00:04:13.810> so<00:04:14.810> the

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
for an altitude of 35,000 feet so the

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.500 
for an altitude of 35,000 feet so the
aircraft<00:04:15.110> will<00:04:15.730> control<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:16.940> pitch<00:04:17.150> attitude

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
aircraft will control the pitch attitude

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.259 
aircraft will control the pitch attitude
and<00:04:18.170> the<00:04:18.380> thrust<00:04:18.650> all<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.790> way<00:04:19.880> up<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:20.150> the

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
and the thrust all the way up to the

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.150 
and the thrust all the way up to the
assigned<00:04:20.600> altitude<00:04:20.840> giving<00:04:21.830> you<00:04:21.920> the<00:04:22.010> best

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
assigned altitude giving you the best

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.180 
assigned altitude giving you the best
rate<00:04:22.520> of<00:04:22.670> climb<00:04:23.140> for<00:04:24.140> the<00:04:24.350> given<00:04:24.650> conditions

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
rate of climb for the given conditions

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.560 
rate of climb for the given conditions
and<00:04:25.370> it<00:04:25.460> actually<00:04:25.820> does<00:04:25.970> a<00:04:26.000> really<00:04:26.090> good<00:04:26.510> job

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
and it actually does a really good job

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.630 
and it actually does a really good job
pmdg<00:04:27.410> has<00:04:27.620> done<00:04:27.800> an<00:04:27.950> extremely<00:04:28.780> good<00:04:29.780> job<00:04:29.840> of

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
pmdg has done an extremely good job of

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:44.070 
pmdg has done an extremely good job of
coding<00:04:31.640> the<00:04:31.790> autopilot

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.839 

so<00:04:44.680> once<00:04:44.889> we<00:04:45.039> come<00:04:45.220> up<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.400> that<00:04:47.370> 229<00:04:48.370> I'm<00:04:48.729> going

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
so once we come up to that 229 I'm going

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:59.560 
so once we come up to that 229 I'm going
to<00:04:48.940> bring<00:04:49.060> the<00:04:49.180> flaps<00:04:49.419> up<00:04:49.720> one<00:04:49.960> notch

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:09.720 

go<00:05:00.570> ahead<00:05:00.720> and<00:05:00.840> turn<00:05:01.080> off<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.560> landing<00:05:02.310> lights

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.850 

once<00:05:10.360> you're<00:05:10.480> above<00:05:10.660> 10,000<00:05:11.320> here<00:05:11.500> I'll<00:05:11.620> raise

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
once you're above 10,000 here I'll raise

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.160 
once you're above 10,000 here I'll raise
the<00:05:12.100> slats<00:05:13.030> on<00:05:13.420> the<00:05:13.510> leading<00:05:13.810> edge<00:05:13.930> of<00:05:14.050> the

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
the slats on the leading edge of the

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:22.480 
the slats on the leading edge of the
wings

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.999 

so<00:05:23.060> as<00:05:23.270> we<00:05:23.419> can<00:05:23.539> see<00:05:23.600> or<00:05:24.020> this<00:05:24.139> purple<00:05:24.560> dot<00:05:24.770> is

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:25.009 
so as we can see or this purple dot is

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:28.629 
so as we can see or this purple dot is
the<00:05:25.310> aircraft<00:05:25.729> is<00:05:25.970> pitching<00:05:26.620> for<00:05:27.620> instance<00:05:28.550> it

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
the aircraft is pitching for instance it

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.670 
the aircraft is pitching for instance it
just<00:05:28.850> moved<00:05:29.060> it<00:05:29.360> just<00:05:29.389> disappeared<00:05:30.080> it<00:05:30.500> would

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
just moved it just disappeared it would

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.370 
just moved it just disappeared it would
be<00:05:30.830> aiming<00:05:31.280> for<00:05:31.360> 350<00:05:32.360> knots<00:05:32.599> indicated<00:05:32.900> air

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
be aiming for 350 knots indicated air

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.900 
be aiming for 350 knots indicated air
speed<00:05:33.440> and<00:05:34.930> it<00:05:35.930> is<00:05:36.110> aiming<00:05:36.440> for<00:05:36.759> 35,000<00:05:37.759> feet

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
speed and it is aiming for 35,000 feet

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.309 
speed and it is aiming for 35,000 feet
under<00:05:38.419> climb<00:05:38.720> thrust<00:05:39.639> which<00:05:40.639> is<00:05:40.669> usually<00:05:41.319> with

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319 
under climb thrust which is usually with

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:45.189 
under climb thrust which is usually with
a<00:05:42.349> cost<00:05:42.620> index<00:05:43.009> of<00:05:43.190> 100<00:05:43.580> that<00:05:43.759> we<00:05:43.880> set<00:05:44.199> the

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
a cost index of 100 that we set the

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.379 
a cost index of 100 that we set the
absolute<00:05:45.710> maximum<00:05:46.220> thrust<00:05:46.550> the<00:05:46.699> aircraft<00:05:47.120> can

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
absolute maximum thrust the aircraft can

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.969 
absolute maximum thrust the aircraft can
muster<00:05:48.080> at<00:05:48.229> the<00:05:48.410> given<00:05:48.710> altitude<00:05:49.630> so<00:05:50.860> that<00:05:51.860> was

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
muster at the given altitude so that was

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:57.999 
muster at the given altitude so that was
a<00:05:52.009> simple<00:05:52.880> takeoff<00:05:53.330> roll<00:05:53.660> and<00:05:56.020> climb<00:05:57.020> from<00:05:57.740> the

source<00:06:12.199> the<00:06:12.560> FMC<00:06:13.220> is<00:06:13.400> drawing<00:06:13.699> from<00:06:13.880> so<00:06:14.870> we're

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
source the FMC is drawing from so we're

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.100 
source the FMC is drawing from so we're
260<00:06:16.009> degrees<00:06:16.370> on<00:06:16.610> the<00:06:16.729> radial<00:06:17.150> from<00:06:17.630> the<00:06:17.870> vor
