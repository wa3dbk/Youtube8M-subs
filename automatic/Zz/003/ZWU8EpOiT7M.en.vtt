00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 problem youtube now that we have the 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.879
 samsung galaxy with reference to 63 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.290
 science of that room I will teach you 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.540
 about the configurations of 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.580
 keyboard basically important options 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.440
 to configure this keyboard is the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.900
 language basically suddenly activate and 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.369
 turn off predictive text not 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.650
 forget to subscribe to my channel here 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.270
 subscribe so they can do 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.680
 leaving comments questions that 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.560
 they came in second with the oldest of the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.269
 likes to activate suddenly to see 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.699
 the keyboard configuration options 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.669
 There are two shapes enter through 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.880
 this option of 5 figuration and we go down and 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.800
 we search for language and introduction here in 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.020
 introduction language we can already 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.870
 set the text input language 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.050
 here but they contain several options for 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.550
 income language and also when 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.559
 enter here to the keyboard option 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.449
 which is entering by this incognito 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.090
 here we can activate or deactivate 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.730
 the predictive text select the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.280
 language the predictive text and basically 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.129
 that the most important thing to activate or not the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.570
 input of sounds keys view 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.799
 first of characters 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.450
 we are going to carry out a survey 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.670
 text entry 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.770
 what we did for example here in the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.380
 text option let's say how to send a 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.179
 text message as you will see here 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.729
 automatically exits the keyboard 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:21.710
 keyboard is fully tactile style 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.790
 hubert and for you to sing the blackberry 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.159
 if we want we can write here hello 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.710
 together 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.420
 is obviously the easiest option to 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.640
 introduction of long texts too 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.920
 We can enter text using 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.869
 voice commands for this we have to 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.600
 be connected to the internet connecting 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.069
 internet quickly since the commands 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.509
 of 22 use through the 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:49.709
 handwritten google voice tool 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.709
 in which quickly internet 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.890
 so that voice commands work 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.520
 connecting connected authentic we're going 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.010
 to use command 2 the right thing 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.840
 we activate 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.040
 we use the small microphone that 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.040
 appears there and we talk 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.500
 hello world 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.150
 Hello World 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.330
 as you will see twice now grows world 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.330
 hi love world there will be another test 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.110
 and this is a test of introduction of 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.110
 text 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.659
 let's see what income this is a 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.480
 proof of text introduction 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:56.819
 effectively enter the text 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.200
 by voice commands another option to 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.750
 introduction of texts and little 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.830
 hard 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.450
 is to enter text by not 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.410
 have entered after the option to 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.020
 configuration and we select the tf with 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.150
 a pen that appears there of that 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.310
 we can enter the texts 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.860
 drawing the for example 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.860
 It's a night game 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.420
 Hello 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.519
 slowly 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.989
 one 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.969
 with the world at what point there is 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.530
 learn to use this option too 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:47.379
 is another interesting third option 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.780
 text introduction now what are we going 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.340
 to do is to activate the text 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.230
 predictive to be those of travel 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.960
 which is the predictive text to help 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.030
 a lot of configuration 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.550
 we activate predictive text us 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.740
 we go back and start writing as 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.190
 they were up to make a little bar 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.350
 new amusco 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.650
 immediately predict what I want with your 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.040
 Hollywood style hello hello like 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:17.980
 lowercase 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.980
 a world world 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.660
 and so 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.660
 d 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.960
 it's that easy these configurations 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.400
 options that there are to configure in this 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.410
 phone that has to do with the 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.400
 keyboard language before or projective 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.290
 translation by eggs or by drawing 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.420
