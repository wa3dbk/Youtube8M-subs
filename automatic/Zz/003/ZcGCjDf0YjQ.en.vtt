00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
interesting about this is that it

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.010 
interesting about this is that it
actually<00:00:41.160> has<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> microphone<00:00:42.360> this

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
probably what you're used to which is

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.010 
probably what you're used to which is
more<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.950> headset<00:00:47.399> piece<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:48.420> microphone

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
more of a headset piece this microphone

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.260 
more of a headset piece this microphone
is<00:00:49.289> like<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> group<00:00:50.160> microphone<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.149> would

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
is like a group microphone so you would

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.240 
is like a group microphone so you would
put<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.539> by<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.719> TV<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.680> do<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> wonder

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
put it by the TV but I do have to wonder

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.520 
put it by the TV but I do have to wonder
what's<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.760> length<00:00:53.969> limit<00:00:54.420> from<00:00:55.020> where<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
what's the length limit from where the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.350 
what's the length limit from where the
microphone<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:56.160> actually<00:00:56.489> hear<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.239> it

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
microphone can actually hear you so it

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.000 
microphone can actually hear you so it
just<00:00:57.390> leaves<00:00:57.780> more<00:00:57.989> questions<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> whole

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
just leaves more questions to the whole

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.979 
just leaves more questions to the whole
mystery<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.640> animal<00:00:59.969> crossing<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.809> never

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
thought that animal crossing would have

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.009 
thought that animal crossing would have
any<00:01:02.730> mysteries<00:01:03.120> but<00:01:03.300> apparently<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.870> does

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
the bird's eye view and it's all 2d long

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.649 
the bird's eye view and it's all 2d long
crap<00:01:53.189> those<00:01:53.640> games<00:01:53.880> weren't<00:01:54.119> good<00:01:54.420> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
crap those games weren't good the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.840 
crap those games weren't good the
question<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.710> they<00:01:55.890> replicate<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.490> on

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
question is can they replicate that on

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.120 
question is can they replicate that on
the<00:01:56.969> DS<00:01:57.149> or<00:01:57.869> will<00:01:58.140> they<00:01:58.259> have<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.439> go<00:01:58.710> back<00:01:58.890> to

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
the DS or will they have to go back to

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.880 
the DS or will they have to go back to
the<00:01:59.280> 2d<00:01:59.610> roots<00:01:59.909> who<00:02:00.780> knows<00:02:01.020> because<00:02:01.590> all<00:02:01.740> they

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the 2d roots who knows because all they

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.770 
the 2d roots who knows because all they
showed<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.369> intended<00:02:02.939> conference<00:02:03.509> was

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
showed that the intended conference was

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
these ideas I don't necessarily see the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.200 
these ideas I don't necessarily see the
d/s<00:02:34.050> wanting<00:02:34.710> to<00:02:34.860> be<00:02:35.010> my<00:02:35.190> companion<00:02:35.580> when<00:02:36.090> the

d/s wanting to be my companion when the
screen<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:36.810> small<00:02:37.080> it'll<00:02:37.500> be<00:02:37.590> cool<00:02:37.800> for

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
screen is so small it'll be cool for

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.680 
screen is so small it'll be cool for
future<00:02:38.400> hardware<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:39.090> know<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.240> have<00:02:39.510> to

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
future hardware you know you have to

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.540 
future hardware you know you have to
compete<00:02:39.990> with<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.290> iphone<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.250> have<00:02:41.400> to

compete with the iphone and you have to

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.640 
compete with the iphone and you have to
compete<00:02:41.820> with<00:02:41.880> other<00:02:42.180> PDA<00:02:42.630> like<00:02:43.110> platforms

because this is a handout and we are

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.590 
because this is a handout and we are
coming<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.380> future<00:02:46.860> where<00:02:47.600> everything's

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
coming to the future where everything's

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.660 
coming to the future where everything's
going<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.900> be<00:02:49.050> all<00:02:49.290> in<00:02:49.560> one<00:02:49.590> on<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.280> hardware

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
going to be all in one on the hardware

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.940 
going to be all in one on the hardware
side<00:02:50.730> Nintendo<00:02:51.600> also<00:02:51.780> unveiled<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.650> wii

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
side Nintendo also unveiled a wii

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.949 
side Nintendo also unveiled a wii
motionplus<00:02:53.400> so<00:02:53.970> this<00:02:54.120> is<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.239> little<00:02:54.360> adapter

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
motionplus so this is a little adapter

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.600 
motionplus so this is a little adapter
that<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.380> stick<00:02:55.620> into<00:02:55.800> your<00:02:56.010> we<00:02:56.130> know<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.520> it

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
that you stick into your we know and it

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.120 
that you stick into your we know and it
gives<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:56.940> one-to-one<00:02:57.600> ratio<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:58.470> movement

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
gives you a one-to-one ratio of movement

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.810 
gives you a one-to-one ratio of movement
so<00:02:59.370> it'll<00:02:59.760> pick<00:02:59.970> up<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.660> movements<00:03:01.290> even<00:03:01.820> more

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
so it'll pick up the movements even more

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.210 
so it'll pick up the movements even more
so<00:03:03.630> then<00:03:04.020> what<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.770> wiimote<00:03:05.190> currently<00:03:05.850> does

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
so then what the wiimote currently does

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.520 
so then what the wiimote currently does
huh<00:03:08.220> I'm<00:03:08.550> sure<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.209> improves<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:10.200> accuracy

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
huh I'm sure it improves the accuracy

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.370 
huh I'm sure it improves the accuracy
but<00:03:11.340> they<00:03:11.640> didn't<00:03:11.940> really<00:03:12.060> compare<00:03:12.720> the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
but they didn't really compare the

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.650 
but they didn't really compare the
before<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.160> after<00:03:14.430> versions<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:15.540> know

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
before and the after versions you know

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.320 
before and the after versions you know
