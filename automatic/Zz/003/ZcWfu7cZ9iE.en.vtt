you guys already know this I will find

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.660 
you guys already know this I will find
out<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:34.890> very<00:00:35.340> short<00:00:35.910> moments<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:37.190> very<00:00:38.190> short

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
out in very short moments in very short

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.910 
out in very short moments in very short
time<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.180> guess<00:00:39.420> yeah<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.320> I'm<00:00:40.620> going<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.829> be

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
time I guess yeah and so I'm going to be

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.860 
time I guess yeah and so I'm going to be
doing<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.190> normal<00:00:41.280> builder<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.820> guess<00:00:42.090> basically

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
doing a normal builder I guess basically

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.840 
doing a normal builder I guess basically
the<00:00:43.350> best<00:00:43.469> thing<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.829> do<00:00:43.950> against<00:00:44.250> random<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.820> a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
the best thing to do against random is a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.389 
the best thing to do against random is a
troll<00:00:45.149> hatch<00:00:45.329> build<00:00:45.629> because<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.370> only

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
troll hatch build because it's the only

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.369 
troll hatch build because it's the only
the<00:00:47.910> only<00:00:47.940> race<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.420> not<00:00:48.570> safe<00:00:48.840> against<00:00:49.230> is

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
the only race it's not safe against is

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.319 
the only race it's not safe against is
there<00:00:49.739> except<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.489> can<00:00:50.700> still<00:00:50.940> pull<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.210> off

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
there except you can still pull it off

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.020 
there except you can still pull it off
against<00:00:51.629> zerg<00:00:52.160> it's<00:00:53.160> not<00:00:53.340> recommended

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
against zerg it's not recommended

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.270 
against zerg it's not recommended
berserk<00:00:54.660> although<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.199> stay<00:00:55.680> random<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.250> I

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
berserk although I stay random that I

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.510 
berserk although I stay random that I
guess<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.640> still<00:00:56.879> does<00:00:57.059> work<00:00:58.219> it's<00:00:59.219> really

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
guess it still does work it's really

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.770 
guess it still does work it's really
good<00:00:59.640> against<00:00:59.850> protoss<00:01:00.120> really<00:01:00.390> good<00:01:00.510> against

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
good against protoss really good against

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.470 
good against protoss really good against
ran<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.440> only<00:01:01.590> race<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:02.340> not<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:03.120> iffy

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
ran the only race it's not it's iffy

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.539 
ran the only race it's not it's iffy
against<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.019> zerg<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.650> I'm<00:01:05.189> going<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.400> be<00:01:05.489> doing

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
against a zerg so I'm going to be doing

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.460 
against a zerg so I'm going to be doing
a<00:01:05.700> 12-match<00:01:06.000> do<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> little<00:01:06.840> bit<00:01:06.990> risk<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.320> guess

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
a 12-match do a little bit risk I guess

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.359 
a 12-match do a little bit risk I guess
they're<00:01:07.619> probably<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.920> safest<00:01:08.100> thing<00:01:08.340> would

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
they're probably the safest thing would

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.359 
they're probably the safest thing would
be<00:01:08.580> 9<00:01:08.760> pool<00:01:09.000> 12<00:01:09.390> pool<00:01:09.630> or<00:01:09.960> /<00:01:10.470> pool<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.950> when<00:01:11.340> I

this already in previous videos except
i'll<00:01:38.880> say<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.180> again<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.570> reason<00:01:39.720> for<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.049> is

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
i'll say it again the reason for this is

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.289 
i'll say it again the reason for this is
because<00:01:40.290> i<00:01:40.680> guarantee<00:01:40.979> all<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.610> guys<00:01:41.759> watch

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
because i guarantee all you guys watch

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.179 
because i guarantee all you guys watch
this<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:43.229> main<00:01:43.380> lap<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.649> go<00:01:43.770> play<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.070> his

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
this the main lap you go play on his

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.069 
this the main lap you go play on his
Python<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:45.240> because<00:01:45.509> it's<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.899> most

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
Python just because it's the most

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.499 
Python just because it's the most
standard<00:01:46.409> map<00:01:46.560> these<00:01:46.710> days<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.640> rather<00:01:48.240> have

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
standard map these days so I rather have

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.969 
standard map these days so I rather have
most<00:01:48.780> more<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.140> my<00:01:49.229> videos<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.740> because

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
most more of my videos on that because

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.649 
most more of my videos on that because
it<00:01:50.100> really<00:01:50.220> helps<00:01:50.310> people<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:50.790> better<00:01:50.939> it's

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
it really helps people get better it's

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.560 
it really helps people get better it's
it's<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.890> prefer<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.670> hope<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.210> guys<00:01:54.360> that

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
it's just I prefer to hope you guys that

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.569 
it's just I prefer to hope you guys that
way<00:01:54.720> rather<00:01:54.930> than<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.680> don't<00:01:56.219> want<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.399> say<00:01:56.490> I'm

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
way rather than I don't want to say I'm

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.359 
way rather than I don't want to say I'm
like<00:01:56.759> whether<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.750> heights<00:01:58.219> because<00:01:59.219> I

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
like whether in heights because I

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.530 
like whether in heights because I
guarantee<00:01:59.520> like<00:01:59.850> no<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.060> guys<00:02:00.210> play<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.450> that

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
guarantee like no you guys play on that

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.670 
guarantee like no you guys play on that
map<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.020> watch<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.290> guys<00:02:01.380> probably<00:02:01.530> don't

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
map and watch you guys probably don't

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.719 
map and watch you guys probably don't
even<00:02:01.829> all<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:01.979> map<00:02:02.219> I'm<00:02:02.399> not<00:02:02.520> going<00:02:02.640> to

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
even all that map I'm not going to

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.709 
even all that map I'm not going to
bother<00:02:02.790> explaining<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.479> one<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.630> those

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
bother explaining it's just one of those

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.990 
bother explaining it's just one of those
new<00:02:03.960> maps<00:02:04.170> that's<00:02:04.439> well<00:02:05.340> probably<00:02:05.759> not<00:02:05.820> new

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
new maps that's well probably not new

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.520 
new maps that's well probably not new
when<00:02:06.180> i'm<00:02:06.270> posting<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.600> video<00:02:06.810> but<00:02:07.140> it's<00:02:07.290> new

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
when i'm posting this video but it's new

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.839 
when i'm posting this video but it's new
well<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.009> might<00:02:08.129> be<00:02:08.160> new<00:02:08.399> i'm<00:02:08.489> not<00:02:08.640> really<00:02:08.729> sure

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
well it might be new i'm not really sure

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.910 
well it might be new i'm not really sure
but<00:02:09.149> yeah<00:02:09.360> it's<00:02:09.539> new<00:02:09.750> these<00:02:09.959> days<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.500> as<00:02:10.830> you

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
but yeah it's new these days and as you

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.850 
but yeah it's new these days and as you
can<00:02:11.039> see<00:02:11.069> he's<00:02:11.459> protest<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.330> is

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
can see he's protest so this is

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.530 
can see he's protest so this is
protoss<00:02:13.310> on<00:02:13.580> Lost<00:02:14.570> Temple<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:15.400> so<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:16.790> played

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
protoss on Lost Temple and so I played

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.450 
protoss on Lost Temple and so I played
no<00:02:18.170> race<00:02:18.470> actually<00:02:18.830> gets<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.040> advantage<00:02:19.160> of

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
no race actually gets the advantage of

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.340 
no race actually gets the advantage of
this<00:02:19.580> map<00:02:19.760> I<00:02:20.060> if<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.540> had<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.900> say<00:02:21.050> I'd<00:02:21.140> probably

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
this map I if I had to say I'd probably

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.220 
this map I if I had to say I'd probably
say<00:02:21.880> actually<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:22.910> can't<00:02:23.120> say<00:02:23.270> I<00:02:23.300> both<00:02:23.840> ways<00:02:24.050> are

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
say actually I can't say I both ways are

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.540 
say actually I can't say I both ways are
pretty<00:02:24.380> much<00:02:24.500> even<00:02:24.710> on<00:02:24.920> this<00:02:25.010> map<00:02:25.190> because

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
pretty much even on this map because

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.340 
pretty much even on this map because
they<00:02:26.150> can<00:02:26.270> both<00:02:26.390> use<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.600> ledge<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:27.110> their<00:02:27.290> own

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
they can both use the ledge to their own

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.070 
they can both use the ledge to their own
advantage<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:29.060> it's<00:02:29.450> not<00:02:29.570> really<00:02:29.630> big<00:02:29.930> for

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
advantage so it's not really big for

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.870 
advantage so it's not really big for
either<00:02:30.170> race<00:02:30.440> Tony<00:02:30.740> Rick<00:02:30.920> Fortran<00:02:31.310> which<00:02:31.670> is

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
either race Tony Rick Fortran which is

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.550 
either race Tony Rick Fortran which is
not<00:02:32.030> in<00:02:32.150> this<00:02:32.240> case<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.780> this<00:02:32.930> drone<00:02:33.290> is

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
not in this case and this drone is

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.560 
not in this case and this drone is
stupid<00:02:34.880> drone<00:02:35.060> doesn't<00:02:35.450> run

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
stupid drone doesn't run

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.320 
stupid drone doesn't run
properly<00:02:35.960> oh<00:02:36.830> well<00:02:37.250> tip<00:02:37.640> thought<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:38.120> died

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
properly oh well tip thought it died

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.810 
properly oh well tip thought it died
suck<00:02:39.320> sure<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.770> but<00:02:40.130> anyways<00:02:40.490> um<00:02:41.110> yeah<00:02:42.110> so<00:02:42.820> I'm

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
suck sure it but anyways um yeah so I'm

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.520 
suck sure it but anyways um yeah so I'm
getting<00:02:44.090> at<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.270> triple<00:02:44.660> expand<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.200> triple

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
getting at the triple expand and triple

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.410 
getting at the triple expand and triple
expands<00:02:45.800> really<00:02:46.010> good<00:02:46.160> versus<00:02:46.850> fastest<00:02:47.180> event

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
expands really good versus fastest event

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.270 
expands really good versus fastest event
although<00:02:47.660> if<00:02:48.290> you<00:02:48.530> want<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:48.770> do<00:02:48.860> this<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.160> want

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
although if you want to do this you want

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.470 
although if you want to do this you want
to<00:02:49.340> keep<00:02:49.430> an<00:02:49.580> eye<00:02:49.670> on<00:02:49.700> where<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.090> probe<00:02:50.330> is

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
to keep an eye on where the probe is

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.390 
to keep an eye on where the probe is
because<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:51.470> best<00:02:51.650> counter<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.130> triple

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
because the best counter to triple

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.670 
because the best counter to triple
expand<00:02:52.730> is<00:02:53.000> Protoss<00:02:53.870> player<00:02:54.110> just<00:02:54.350> gets<00:02:54.530> the

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
expand is Protoss player just gets the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.380 
expand is Protoss player just gets the
probing<00:02:55.100> cannons<00:02:55.489> your<00:02:55.670> base<00:02:55.850> or<00:02:56.150> your

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
probing cannons your base or your

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.600 
probing cannons your base or your
expansion<00:02:56.690> or<00:02:56.959> wherever<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.410> that's<00:02:58.340> cause

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
expansion or wherever and that's cause

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.590 
expansion or wherever and that's cause
you're<00:02:58.760> pretty<00:02:58.970> badly<00:02:59.180> because<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.510> have

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
you're pretty badly because you have

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.000 
you're pretty badly because you have
nothing<00:02:59.810> to<00:02:59.900> kill<00:03:00.050> it<00:03:00.170> besides<00:03:00.410> probes<00:03:00.739> or

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
nothing to kill it besides probes or

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.670 
nothing to kill it besides probes or
sorry<00:03:01.310> drones<00:03:01.610> so<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:03.230> really<00:03:03.410> want<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.590> keep

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
sorry drones so you really want to keep

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.300 
sorry drones so you really want to keep
an<00:03:03.739> eye<00:03:03.860> on<00:03:03.890> their<00:03:04.130> scouting<00:03:04.370> probe<00:03:04.610> once<00:03:04.910> your

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
an eye on their scouting probe once your

an eye on their scouting probe once your
one's<00:03:07.310> here<00:03:07.489> what<00:03:07.790> do<00:03:07.850> you<00:03:07.910> call<00:03:08.000> it<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.360> totally

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
goons and you spend

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.600 
goons and you spend
in<00:04:26.289> some<00:04:26.500> cones<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:26.860> you<00:04:26.919> spend<00:04:27.159> money<00:04:27.310> in<00:04:27.490> the

get<00:04:45.639> +1<00:04:45.879> carapace<00:04:46.419> then<00:04:46.689> it<00:04:46.930> it<00:04:47.669> what<00:04:48.669> do<00:04:48.729> you

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
get +1 carapace then it it what do you

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.260 
get +1 carapace then it it what do you
call<00:04:48.849> it<00:04:48.909> it<00:04:49.599> it<00:04:50.349> neutralizes<00:04:50.919> the<00:04:51.129> +1<00:04:51.759> weapons

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
call it it it neutralizes the +1 weapons

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.950 
call it it it neutralizes the +1 weapons
and<00:04:52.599> so<00:04:52.930> you<00:04:53.740> are<00:04:54.159> pretty<00:04:54.520> much<00:04:54.669> in<00:04:54.969> part<00:04:55.419> when

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
and so you are pretty much in part when

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.240 
and so you are pretty much in part when
you<00:04:56.050> when<00:04:56.289> it<00:04:56.379> comes<00:04:56.530> to<00:04:56.650> upgrades<00:04:56.949> with<00:04:57.069> your

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
you when it comes to upgrades with your

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.619 
you when it comes to upgrades with your
opponent<00:04:57.580> and<00:04:57.789> that<00:04:58.090> really<00:04:58.210> helps<00:04:58.479> out

00:04:58.619 --> 00:04:58.629 
opponent and that really helps out

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:00.240 
opponent and that really helps out
because<00:04:58.990> then<00:04:59.229> you<00:04:59.319> can<00:04:59.500> master<00:04:59.740> goings<00:05:00.099> and

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
because then you can master goings and

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.100 
because then you can master goings and
your<00:05:00.879> opponent<00:05:01.120> can't<00:05:01.509> do<00:05:01.629> much<00:05:01.840> about<00:05:01.870> it

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
your opponent can't do much about it

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.749 
your opponent can't do much about it
because<00:05:02.379> master<00:05:02.830> goons<00:05:03.129> does<00:05:03.340> beat<00:05:03.520> mass<00:05:03.729> a

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
because master goons does beat mass a

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.209 
because master goons does beat mass a

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.249 
that's what i'll be doing and triple
expands<00:05:12.969> so<00:05:13.150> i<00:05:13.449> did<00:05:13.719> a<00:05:13.750> triple<00:05:13.990> x<00:05:14.139> prime

over<00:06:23.349> when<00:06:23.680> I'm<00:06:23.830> pro<00:06:24.009> to<00:06:24.069> us<00:06:24.219> and<00:06:24.520> then<00:06:24.580> I'm

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:24.729 
over when I'm pro to us and then I'm

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:26.279 
over when I'm pro to us and then I'm
like<00:06:24.759> okay<00:06:25.300> this<00:06:25.479> screws<00:06:25.750> me<00:06:25.900> over<00:06:25.930> when<00:06:26.199> I

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:26.289 
like okay this screws me over when I

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:28.409 
like okay this screws me over when I
brought<00:06:26.529> to<00:06:26.620> us<00:06:26.710> and<00:06:26.979> so<00:06:27.400> that's<00:06:28.089> what<00:06:28.240> I<00:06:28.300> do

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
brought to us and so that's what I do

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.320 
brought to us and so that's what I do
and<00:06:28.779> it's<00:06:29.349> pretty<00:06:30.099> much<00:06:30.250> like<00:06:30.550> common<00:06:31.300> sense

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
and it's pretty much like common sense

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.570 
and it's pretty much like common sense
when<00:06:31.870> it<00:06:31.960> comes<00:06:32.110> down<00:06:32.289> to<00:06:32.349> it<00:06:32.589> like<00:06:32.800> if<00:06:33.370> you're

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
when it comes down to it like if you're

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.100 
when it comes down to it like if you're
a<00:06:33.610> jerk<00:06:33.879> player<00:06:34.120> you<00:06:34.330> find<00:06:34.599> what<00:06:34.750> screws<00:06:34.990> you

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
a jerk player you find what screws you

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.329 
a jerk player you find what screws you
over<00:06:35.139> when<00:06:35.440> you're<00:06:35.560> playing<00:06:35.740> zerg<00:06:36.009> and<00:06:36.190> then

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:36.339 
over when you're playing zerg and then

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:37.559 
over when you're playing zerg and then
you<00:06:36.430> do<00:06:36.580> it<00:06:36.610> while<00:06:36.880> you're<00:06:36.909> playing<00:06:37.060> pro<00:06:37.330> to<00:06:37.389> us

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:37.569 
you do it while you're playing pro to us

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:38.580 
you do it while you're playing pro to us
and

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
and

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.410 
and
again<00:06:39.010> it<00:06:39.220> helps<00:06:39.370> you<00:06:39.610> out<00:06:39.640> because<00:06:39.940> obviously

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:40.420 
again it helps you out because obviously

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.000 
again it helps you out because obviously
if<00:06:40.750> you<00:06:40.840> can't<00:06:41.050> defend<00:06:41.290> it<00:06:41.500> then<00:06:41.770> your

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
if you can't defend it then your

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.650 
if you can't defend it then your
opponent<00:06:42.400> it's<00:06:43.000> gonna<00:06:43.120> he's<00:06:43.420> going<00:06:43.600> to

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 
opponent it's gonna he's going to

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.630 
opponent it's gonna he's going to
struggle<00:06:43.810> defending<00:06:44.260> it<00:06:44.350> also<00:06:44.620> and<00:06:44.860> as<00:06:45.550> you

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:45.640 
struggle defending it also and as you

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.910 
struggle defending it also and as you
can<00:06:45.760> see<00:06:45.790> his<00:06:46.300> poor<00:06:46.690> came<00:06:46.900> his<00:06:47.200> car<00:06:47.590> sir<00:06:47.740> came

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:47.920 
can see his poor came his car sir came

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.270 
can see his poor came his car sir came
out<00:06:48.040> right<00:06:48.160> when<00:06:48.310> Miss<00:06:48.460> Ferrara<00:06:48.580> was<00:06:48.700> done<00:06:48.940> so

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:54.760 
that basically yeah its timing like it

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.950 
that basically yeah its timing like it
comes<00:06:54.970> down<00:06:55.120> to<00:06:55.270> it<00:06:55.390> when<00:06:55.480> it<00:06:55.540> comes<00:06:55.720> down<00:06:55.810> to

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 
comes down to it when it comes down to

comes down to it when it comes down to
it<00:06:56.080> it's<00:06:56.170> just<00:06:56.230> timing<00:06:56.530> and<00:06:56.890> now<00:06:57.040> i'm<00:06:57.130> getting

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
it it's just timing and now i'm getting

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.180 
it it's just timing and now i'm getting
my<00:06:57.400> second<00:06:57.670> evolution<00:06:58.000> chamber<00:06:58.360> because

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.190 
my second evolution chamber because

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.440 
my second evolution chamber because
obviously<00:07:00.190> i<00:07:00.490> want<00:07:00.700> to<00:07:00.760> get<00:07:00.910> upgrades<00:07:01.270> and
