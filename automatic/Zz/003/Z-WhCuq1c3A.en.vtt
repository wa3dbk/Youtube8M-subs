00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520

be any tickets available at the door

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.490 
be any tickets available at the door
right<00:01:53.909> now<00:01:54.119> because<00:01:54.869> it's<00:01:55.020> looking<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.350> we

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
right now because it's looking like we

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.319 
right now because it's looking like we
are<00:01:55.619> hitting<00:01:55.860> going<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.189> hit<00:01:56.280> capacity<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.060> I

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
are hitting going to hit capacity so I
