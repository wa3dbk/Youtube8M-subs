00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.330
 to tell you how was the event 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:21.460
 bags I played on the page 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.410
 gaming tv3 to make direct and 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.960
 we were playing charros of humor 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.790
 in this game that I like so much and in 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.320
 summary was this 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.650
 you have noticed the summary of the 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.650
 departure 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.530
 I 'm going to put you in slow motion on 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.530
 cologne and perfectly 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.430
 it may be I did not throw a bar if 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.860
 they are part of a huge farm and did not come 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.840
 the youngest we watched did not last were three 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.970
 minutes of departure came some Poles 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.160
 that they were super heavy that they played 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.710
 super good we were super clouds 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.690
 apart a member of the group is also 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.760
 fell another had no experience because at 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.580
 it seemed like the brother's account etc 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.830
 etc etc conclusion the truth that we 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.869
 We laughed a lot, we had a great time in the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.479
 streaming or with a lot of people went through 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.270
 streaming a lot of people and I liked it 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.910
 and as I liked it, I want to repeat it a lot 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.440
 more times as we would do it from here 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.479

 youtube they would fly that you interpret and 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.740
 patricia with all the people who are to 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.470

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.100
 that we are talking as he says 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.080
 service for the cai because it was the last 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.510
 hour but I do not want it to be because I fell 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.490
 because I am personally for them 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.130
 example I had to reject a couple of 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.800
 people and eliminate and block another 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.330
 because he started telling me nonsense 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.920
 it was not the people who participate in 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.450
 me but were others who 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:50.030
 according to that they will have come good only 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.209
 I want to leave that happened a short video 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.340
 without giving much desire I wait but 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.700
