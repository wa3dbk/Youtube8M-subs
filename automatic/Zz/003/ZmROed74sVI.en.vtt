 Hi, I'm Javier Guardian of Culture 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.670
 liderman peru and ecuador 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.430
 September 2012 thanks for 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:22.419
 join us in this leading net program 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.730
 It is a monthly communication program 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:28.989
 who has the address of this company 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.940
 to convey themes of culture themes 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:35.950
 Learning 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:40.510
 that this month I wanted to touch two points 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:44.740
 the theme of the relay the importance of 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:48.130
 relief in terms of the danger to the 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.560
 open the doors recently we have 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.910
 aware of an assault an instruction 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.360
 that there was a company 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.610
 where criminals expect 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.550
 the relay arrives and the door opens 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.770
 then they hide near the door 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.420
 They expect the outgoing to open the 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:11.810
 fourth slow before push it reduce and 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.899
 get a truck and go be real 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.470
 is what it means to lead them 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:22.820
 we must be aware that the hours of 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.729
 relays are high 10 hours 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.280
 I repeat the hours and we'll see some of 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.909
 very high risk that it has to be the 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:35.630
 language identify the person very well 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:40.100
 who lives for that the system sct month there 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.350
 grids there are intercoms there 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.420
 ways that the leader sees his partner 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:50.479
 outside and can see towards the ends and 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.740
 realize that these guys are clean 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.020
 of instructions usually already 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.440
 weekends or holidays when there's no 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.920
 no one 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.440
 I do not know please remember this to the bear 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.300
 loved ones and more from peru sees with a lot 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.020
 careful now open the door to the 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.630
 relay hours 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.349
 if any client in your infrastructure 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.480
 of the doors there are not days 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.660
 mirrors that allow us to see the outside 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.300
 there are no CCTV cameras 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.629
 communicators there is no way to see 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:26.080
 nor is it outside please include not in 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:29.769
 Annex 3 as a possible risk of 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.319
 external theft and apart from including it ask 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:35.170
 to the client that please put the 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:39.010
 means for you to see towards 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.400
 outside and identify people in 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.489
 total 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.769
 that is the first point the second point 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.519
 is that we have a word 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:52.790
 key to assault cases in Peru 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.280
 like the equator I will not give it for 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.530
 security reasons in this net leader or 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.959
 that this Friday is published on the website of 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.170
 public knowledge but you the 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.510
 books that are properly trained 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.049
 very familiar with the keyword 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.680
 this keyword is requested by the centers 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:15.579
 control for each hour in the 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.189
 reports to know what's new 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.720
 inside the premises and when there is 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.239
 an emergency 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.090
 there is a secret little word that liberman 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:30.170
 has to say the so that on the other side 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.930
 know is a very disguised way that 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.120
 is the language that is impeded and is a 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.670
 very covert way because that word 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.280
 key can be said being the 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.160
 delinquent inside and being even 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.870
 pointing you 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.959
 it takes a lot of courage 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.069
 decision is required and it is required 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.390
 knowledge to know the key word 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.849
 knowledge to the one who says it and 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.739
 knowledge of who receives it because 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:01.519
 who receives it can not be 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:05.200
 but should immediately asking 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:07.990
 dispatch to help patrols and so on 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.130
 we will avoid 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.410
 that means being prepared 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.200
 it can not be that we have a theft or a 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.270
 induction and we find out when it arrives 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.660
 to the client or we were just there when 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.880
 the most followed book to untie no no 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.940
 we should not find out about the 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.420
 procedures that we have of the word 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:34.050
 key of course that the one who says the 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.960
 keyword and the one that receives it are very 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.390
 well rewarded and recognized by 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.490
 us because in the operatives that 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.100
 we have had several opportunities 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.750
 given excellent results we have 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:50.760
 captured and we have avoided robberies or 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:54.960
 so thank you very much for following us and 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:58.640
 Have a nice month of spring 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.640
