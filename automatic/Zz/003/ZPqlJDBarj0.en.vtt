possibly<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.439> cards<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.740> his<00:00:25.800> hand<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.390> could

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
possibly the cards in his hand I could

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.939 
possibly the cards in his hand I could
be<00:00:27.539> reasons<00:00:27.869> why<00:00:27.990> he<00:00:28.109> didn't<00:00:28.320> add<00:00:28.410> heavy<00:00:28.619> storm

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949

be reasons why he didn't add heavy storm
and<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.220> thing<00:00:29.640> when<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.849> add<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> heavy<00:00:30.240> storm

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
and the thing when you add a heavy storm

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.600 
and the thing when you add a heavy storm
of<00:00:30.539> duality<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.960> first<00:00:31.260> turn<00:00:31.500> or<00:00:31.740> adding<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.520> in

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
of duality a first turn or adding it in

general when your plant doesn't have any
back<00:00:34.230> row<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:35.340> really<00:00:35.520> just<00:00:35.730> sets<00:00:35.910> your

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
back row it really just sets your

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.610 
back row it really just sets your
opponent<00:00:36.329> up<00:00:36.390> for<00:00:36.630> not<00:00:36.960> sending<00:00:37.200> multiple

Gayle is going to come out Gail with and

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.389 
Gayle is going to come out Gail with and
a<00:02:06.079> half<00:02:06.289> and<00:02:06.619> safe<00:02:07.070> something's<00:02:07.310> really

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
a half and safe something's really

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.740 
a half and safe something's really
interesting<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:08.720> see<00:02:08.929> in<00:02:09.170> glads<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:10.759> the

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
interesting to see in glads and the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.370 
interesting to see in glads and the
thing<00:02:11.959> is<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:13.220> was<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:13.730> weak<00:02:14.180> against<00:02:15.110> any

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
thing is it was so weak against any

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.440 
thing is it was so weak against any
cloudier<00:02:15.920> these<00:02:18.340> so<00:02:19.340> what<00:02:20.090> is<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.269> that<00:02:20.390> is

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
cloudier these so what is that that is

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.890 
cloudier these so what is that that is
kind<00:02:20.720> of<00:02:20.810> hard<00:02:20.959> bath<00:02:21.190> on<00:02:22.190> that<00:02:22.610> be<00:02:22.790> uh<00:02:25.120> yeah<00:02:26.120> 850

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
kind of hard bath on that be uh yeah 850

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.490 
kind of hard bath on that be uh yeah 850
I<00:02:27.310> believe<00:02:28.310> he'd<00:02:28.489> be<00:02:28.670> in<00:02:28.910> he<00:02:29.360> be<00:02:29.480> 850<00:02:30.260> attack

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
I believe he'd be in he be 850 attack

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.699 
I believe he'd be in he be 850 attack
and<00:02:30.799> so<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:32.150> think<00:02:32.989> they<00:02:33.170> should<00:02:33.319> bust<00:02:33.470> out<00:02:33.620> the

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
and so I think they should bust out the

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.400 
and so I think they should bust out the
math<00:02:34.060> calculator<00:02:35.060> someone<00:02:35.360> well<00:02:35.510> hopefully

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
math calculator someone well hopefully

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:45.580 
math calculator someone well hopefully
oh<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:41.750> get<00:02:41.900> 850<00:02:43.420> no<00:02:44.420> I'll<00:02:44.989> take<00:02:45.140> out<00:02:45.290> my<00:02:45.380> cake

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
oh you get 850 no I'll take out my cake

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.660 
oh you get 850 no I'll take out my cake
here<00:02:45.920> so<00:02:46.069> that<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.670> half<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.209> 17<00:02:47.720> is<00:02:48.489> 850<00:02:49.489> I<00:02:49.519> was

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
here so that a half a 17 is 850 I was

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.120 
here so that a half a 17 is 850 I was
correct<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.060> then<00:02:50.480> take<00:02:51.200> 1300<00:02:51.590> from<00:02:51.799> Yale<00:02:51.980> and

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
correct and then take 1300 from Yale and

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.820 
correct and then take 1300 from Yale and
so<00:02:52.489> that<00:02:52.640> is<00:02:52.760> 450

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.960 

so<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:04.500> there<00:03:04.710> we<00:03:04.800> go<00:03:04.830> so<00:03:05.340> even<00:03:05.700> Eyes<00:03:05.790> White

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
so so there we go so even Eyes White

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.640 
so so there we go so even Eyes White

everything<00:03:12.360> gets<00:03:12.690> over<00:03:13.140> Galen<00:03:13.530> glads<00:03:13.770> at<00:03:14.730> 1700

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
everything gets over Galen glads at 1700

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:23.570 
everything gets over Galen glads at 1700
yes<00:03:15.690> but<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:15.990> is<00:03:16.170> half<00:03:21.410> it's<00:03:22.410> fine<00:03:22.680> i<00:03:22.950> got<00:03:23.520> the

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
yes but it is half it's fine i got the

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.510 
yes but it is half it's fine i got the
math<00:03:23.850> right<00:03:27.620> ok<00:03:28.620> so<00:03:28.740> maybe<00:03:28.860> phase<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.220> eat<00:03:29.370> if

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
math right ok so maybe phase to eat if

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.880 
math right ok so maybe phase to eat if
he<00:03:29.640> does<00:03:31.970> actually<00:03:32.970> it's<00:03:33.210> only<00:03:33.540> 450<00:03:34.050> I<00:03:34.410> believe

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
he does actually it's only 450 I believe

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.260 
he does actually it's only 450 I believe
I<00:03:34.950> was<00:03:35.160> personally<00:03:35.550> I<00:03:35.580> don't<00:03:35.820> think<00:03:36.030> it's<00:03:36.120> kind

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
I was personally I don't think it's kind

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.840 
I was personally I don't think it's kind
of<00:03:36.300> matter<00:03:36.480> 100<00:03:36.840> Life<00:03:36.930> Points<00:03:37.760> shouldn't<00:03:38.760> make

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
of matter 100 Life Points shouldn't make

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:39.830 
of matter 100 Life Points shouldn't make
the<00:03:38.970> difference<00:03:39.120> in<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.360> game<00:03:39.420> but<00:03:39.630> if<00:03:39.750> it

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
the difference in the game but if it

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.660 
the difference in the game but if it
does<00:03:39.990> happen<00:03:40.170> make<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.010> difference<00:03:41.340> I'll<00:03:41.490> try

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
does happen make a difference I'll try

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.060 
does happen make a difference I'll try

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
and he will be a 0 reborn so yeah that

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.539 
and he will be a 0 reborn so yeah that
safe<00:04:15.660> zone<00:04:15.900> with<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.140> msu<00:04:16.620> was<00:04:16.799> quite<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.310> big

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
safe zone with the msu was quite a big

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.000 
safe zone with the msu was quite a big
thing<00:04:17.580> I<00:04:17.970> mean<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.180> was<00:04:18.269> definitely<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:18.660> plus
