00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
chunky or too blonde because she still

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.450 
chunky or too blonde because she still
wanted<00:01:41.079> a<00:01:41.319> little<00:01:41.649> bit<00:01:41.770> of<00:01:41.859> her<00:01:41.979> natural<00:01:42.130> hair

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
color so right there you saw that I

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.319 
color so right there you saw that I
split<00:01:44.289> a<00:01:44.500> piece<00:01:44.859> of<00:01:44.920> hair<00:01:45.250> and<00:01:45.490> I<00:01:45.609> didn't

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
split a piece of hair and I didn't

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.800 
split a piece of hair and I didn't
highlight<00:01:46.539> it<00:01:46.810> so<00:01:47.799> I<00:01:47.890> weaved<00:01:48.759> it<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.479> section

that I was going to do I weaved it out

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.800 
that I was going to do I weaved it out
just<00:01:51.459> so<00:01:51.700> it<00:01:51.759> wouldn't<00:01:52.030> be<00:01:52.119> chunky<00:01:52.359> and<00:01:52.810> I<00:01:54.810> made

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
just so it wouldn't be chunky and I made

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.660

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
sure to leave it really thin and then I

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.770

entire<00:02:31.870> section<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:33.609> do<00:02:34.239> want<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.510> stress

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
entire section and I do want to stress

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.960 
entire section and I do want to stress
that<00:02:34.750> her<00:02:35.590> hair<00:02:35.829> did<00:02:35.980> not<00:02:36.250> get<00:02:36.430> damaged<00:02:36.790> from

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
that her hair did not get damaged from

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.280 
that her hair did not get damaged from
doing<00:02:37.239> this<00:02:37.359> if<00:02:37.569> they<00:02:37.690> actually<00:02:37.840> wasn't

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
doing this if they actually wasn't

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.479 
doing this if they actually wasn't
damaged<00:02:38.560> at<00:02:38.799> all<00:02:39.040> which<00:02:39.280> is<00:02:39.310> really

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
damaged at all which is really

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.490 
damaged at all which is really
surprising<00:02:39.940> because<00:02:40.389> you<00:02:40.959> know<00:02:41.049> anytime<00:02:41.230> you

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
surprising because you know anytime you

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.960 
surprising because you know anytime you
use<00:02:41.530> bleach<00:02:41.920> obviously<00:02:42.549> you're<00:02:42.670> here<00:02:42.760> think

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
use bleach obviously you're here think

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:55.850 
use bleach obviously you're here think
again

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.950 

so<00:02:56.860> like<00:02:57.070> I<00:02:57.220> said<00:02:57.280> I<00:02:57.580> used<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.390> same<00:02:58.570> exact

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
so like I said I used the same exact

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.350 
so like I said I used the same exact
technique<00:02:59.410> in<00:02:59.590> every<00:03:00.430> section<00:03:00.700> of<00:03:00.970> hair<00:03:01.210> that

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
technique in every section of hair that

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.450 
technique in every section of hair that
I<00:03:01.420> did<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:02.890> just<00:03:03.490> keep<00:03:03.670> watching<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.480> you<00:03:05.020> know

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
I did so just keep watching and you know

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.320 
I did so just keep watching and you know
obviously<00:03:06.460> if<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:06.670> don't<00:03:06.820> feel<00:03:07.030> that

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
obviously if you don't feel that

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.910 
obviously if you don't feel that
confident<00:03:07.870> in<00:03:07.930> doing<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:08.410> then<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.680> would

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
confident in doing it then I would

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.220 
confident in doing it then I would
suggest<00:03:09.070> going<00:03:09.460> to<00:03:09.640> a<00:03:09.670> salon<00:03:10.000> or<00:03:10.360> you<00:03:11.140> know

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
suggest going to a salon or you know

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.010 
suggest going to a salon or you know
asking<00:03:11.590> someone<00:03:11.920> that<00:03:12.100> does<00:03:12.700> but<00:03:13.360> like<00:03:13.840> I<00:03:13.960> said

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
asking someone that does but like I said

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.280

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
for probably like 20 minutes because we

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.290 
for probably like 20 minutes because we
don't<00:05:37.560> want<00:05:37.710> to<00:05:37.770> use<00:05:37.890> him<00:05:38.130> right<00:05:38.460> away<00:05:38.610> and<00:05:38.730> she

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
had just bleached her hair so it would

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.560 
had just bleached her hair so it would
have<00:05:41.190> damaged<00:05:41.640> it<00:05:41.760> so<00:05:41.910> we<00:05:42.030> waited<00:05:42.210> a<00:05:42.360> little

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
have damaged it so we waited a little

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.590 
have damaged it so we waited a little
bit<00:05:42.750> and<00:05:42.900> then<00:05:43.440> I<00:05:43.470> just<00:05:43.710> curled<00:05:44.400> it<00:05:44.610> and<00:05:44.820> you'll
