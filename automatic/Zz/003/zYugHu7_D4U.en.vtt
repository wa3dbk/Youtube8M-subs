00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.390
 I want to tell you 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.709
 the architectural path also this great car 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:17.140
 new requirements therefore one of the concepts a true evolution of the same uric 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.419
 need for ergonomics close habitability have created this new 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.119
 ford focus year architecture a life car 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.980
 to use this space according to your needs 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.800
 These dimensions have stimulated us to create an elegant fluid style 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.730
 an aerodynamic front 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.850
 an important radiator grille that has personality 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.510
 the rounded plan view 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.930
 the headlights that slender towards the grille 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.530
 for this rounding up, I made myself create a group of boys 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.810
 new pedara or dynamic 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.880
 the two ribs on the oven dresser converge on the grille 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.640
 accentuating the feeling of strength and the dynamic setting of the front 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.870
 we talk about the side 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.060
 this very inclined fender that connects 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.520
 on the windshield 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.510
 a line 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.510
 q Rome up to the year from the back 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.000
 broken line a dihedral that lightens the whole part 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.480
 of the side 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.500
 It is a chromed handle modeled on the shape 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.939
 this is important to me too, there is no mail for you lucia 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.640
 than aluminum located inside 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.900
 let's talk about the genza's rear bag 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.200
 generous volumes but balances the upright that connects the rear window 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.010
 panoramic optical groups many expenses that it splits in two 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.830
 the mass of the latter this goodbye 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.190
 large door 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.620
 which facilitates the entry of baggage 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.340
 these two are two important elements of writing that enrich painting 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.399
 longitudinal bars 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:16.330
 the glass sunroof which gives an extraordinary sensation 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.959
 especially when you have teeth 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.409
 the innovative chroma formula is born from the position of the passengers 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.490
 in the second row 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.259
 entering the chroma 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:28.659
 I can't even forget an episode 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.049
 d gianni agnelli who tried a prototype that I had a seat 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.040
 higher height than that which was the new car 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.220
 read in designing acrobat I have taken over the accessibility quotas ed 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.399
 habitability of that prototype 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:47.519
 the lower part obviously and privileged tonsillitis 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:53.279
 adjustable so I can aspire with the wide spaces that are there for you soon. 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:55.039
 comfort 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:58.039
 beyond the ease of entry we find ample space 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.259
 a refined environment 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:02.519
 an interior 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.639
 two-tone important plank and an important console 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.189
 rich in elements 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:15.530
 seats de estudiar serve only then armrest key milk of 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:20.709
 ignition no longer on the steering wheel but on the tumblr so every detail a lot 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.669
 refined very careful those who are the needs 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.489
 today we taste 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.129
 what you have also seen the guest 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.870
 of a new reading of a large epicondyle fracture reading 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:35.489
 different needs 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.489
 this is the fiat croma 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:40.099
