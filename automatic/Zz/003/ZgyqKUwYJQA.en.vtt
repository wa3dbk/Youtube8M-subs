00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello from caldo blog.it congress at 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.889
 the asus exposure is here we have the two 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.490
 transform the little ones into the t100 book 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.020
 chip 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.150
 a 10.1 inch and a 90 also gives us a 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.550
 adorable 8 9 inches 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.260
 let's start with the 10 poles surely 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.240
 these are convertible devices 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.880
 this is the successor of the t100 one of the 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.900
 most sold devices one of the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.539
 probably the best 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.940
 windows 8 device that came out there 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.520
 last year this new version a lot 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.700
 thinner much lighter than 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.000
 to the previous one but above all much more 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.829
 more finished much more high end 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.250
 in fact we say the price goes up for the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.420
 duo up to 399 euros which are 100 euros in 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.860
 more than the model model 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.320
 previous but in short the quality 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.360
 constructive and finishes I assure you 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.680
 that live are of a completely different kind 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.230
 a completely different level if this finish 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.270
 anti rough fingerprint slightly rough 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.690
 very nice double scratch proof 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.309
 front camera and rear attack 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.619
 for the dock below but the doc 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.210
 unlike the previous model of 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.010
 last year and bluetooth 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.689
 so this means that it is more 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.790
 light means that it sticks can 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.680
 also be used separate from 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.200
 tablet away from the tablet but 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.790
 also means that he cannot have one 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.740
 spare battery for the tablet can not 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.110
 contain an internal hard drive and cannot 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.450
 having an additional usb benefits e 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.180
 in short, disadvantages of a technology that 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.659
 it is perhaps more suited to less mobility 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.920
 for use as a fixed pc pc which i am 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.600
 just touching the keyboard for the first 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.920
 time and I feel it practically identical to 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.240
 that of the last year model the keys 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.770
 they are not very low 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.479
 there is a good run and it is enough 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.229
 stand for this kind of devices 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.540
 small button on off micro usb for the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.590
 charging once who is connected here 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.869
 that becomes practically 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.250
 a netbook the opening of the hinge that 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.560
 the thing that we write for us 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.770
 probably more important part than 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.119
 this model has some is not 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.979
 not very stable but I think it depends 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.560
 just from the example they are exposed to 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.509
 which every man is abused every 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.149
 minute from the present to present 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:14.440
 fair I said the angle is not 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.150
 maximum you see we are still the corner here 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.489
 maximum just as a model of the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.340
 last year there are problems with 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.049
 balance the screen clearly with the 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.730
 so you can't push keyboard 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.280
 the corner too 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.890
 anyway so i'm writing 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.519
 standing looks like an ips good screen 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.019
 1060 own one hundred pixel brightness 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.849
 we are now at most is not 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.370
 very high and sufficient but not 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.290
 very high compared to the tito meaning chi 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.390
 that you do not see what is next 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.400
 it is much less bright but all in all 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.120
 this remains a device for the 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.860
 mobility and I repeat pretty 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.110
 let's say mega for those who don't want to 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.099
 an ultrabook but at the same time not 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.660
 he doesn't even want anything too much 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:00.820
 cheap t 90c instead 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.300
 8.9 inches the same the same concept 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.330
 of convertible 2 in 1 procured weight 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.090
 total of the duo is only 700 grams 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.510
 together it is a type 400 and 300 one thing 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.790
 similar 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.260
 the thickness is as you really see 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.680
 really ridiculous especially that 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.750
 of the tablet part which is thinner than the 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.910
 8 9 inch tablets that are found 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.360
 usually at this resolution a little 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.130
 a bit particular 1080 x 800 pixels though 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.510
 see the format in upstream 16 nori 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.910
 so on the tablet like this is 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.130
 absolutely multimedia let's say a 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.660
 unproductive the keyboard also here in 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.120
 a mechanical coupling so you can 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.130
 connect it close it and transform it 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.890
 perhaps I have already said it on other occasions 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.180
 really in a couple new pd 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.920
 new generation 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.000
 I tried I also use the 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.410
 keyboard is clearly small because from 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.720
 they are attached they are compact there is 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.000
 also of a certain kind of a course 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.860
 It's not really taste the lower steps 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.690
 what I liked least is the app 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.650
 this is the opening angle you see 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.390
 it's the maximum 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.980
 here due to its own speech 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.300
 to balance the weight because we will have 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:10.540
 too much would be to overturn it so I 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.820
 it seemed true we say that it is not is not the 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.709
 more comfortable it could be suitable but 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.230
 may also be from behind from 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.790
 invest long for a long time with 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.980
 this with this level keyboard 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.300
 hardware level software sorry 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.160
 we have two products that are 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.500
 virtually identical both are 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.849
 based on the intel processor of the three 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.629
 the have an atom z 37 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:36.029
 75 if I'm not mistaken with ram music 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:38.669
 and 32 or 64 gb of internal space now 

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:40.379
 compared to most of the intel 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.029
 like low cost trail tablet we have 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:45.749
 tried felt over the past few months 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:47.659
 this use of the atoms that are 37 75 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:50.969
 much more powerful than the classic 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:51.959
 37 35 f today we haven't used it alone 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:53.639
 which we saw recently 

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:56.099
 this means that they will have performance 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:59.639
 however best same teeth yes 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:02.069
 consumption will always go on your shoulders six 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.439
 at eight, even ten real hours 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:06.240
 there is a way to truly believe it 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:08.669
 despite battery so small then 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.889
 devices absolutely suitable for 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.689
 connectivity to portability on the other 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.490
 in two way connectivity 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:16.349
 both have wifi a c is one 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.229
 extra feature that differentiates them 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:22.019
 a bit to rival prices 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.389
 this game 299 but here too there is a 

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:26.189
 a bit complicated speech that depends 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.229
 from configurations why get involved 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:31.199
 of ram music and 16GB of space 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:35.069
 interior and 32gb of interior space while 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:37.619
 here we start from 499 only with two 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:39.779
 search for ram and 32 64 gb of space 

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:41.279
 internal I say complicated speech because 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:42.719
 still asus italia not them a 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:44.279
 then made official in our country 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:46.619
 we do not know exactly what they will be 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:47.849
 the final configurations that 

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:49.379
 will arrive in Italy accordingly 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:51.569
 what the prices will be the prices of 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:54.719
 departure for each way but summarizing 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:57.240
 t100 who absolutely recommended us 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:59.550
 as a t100 upgrade at least for those who have 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.219
 found the t100 a little awkward for the 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.320
 portability also a bit ugly from 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:06.230
 to touch 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.720
 some in some parts t 90c 90 c from 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.760
 review I love this format 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.110
 I have no intention of 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.000
 deepen the discussion because I would like 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.830
 use it myself personally for 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.740
 write try to understand if it can be 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:21.320
 really a device capable of 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.120
 replace those that ideas concepts 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.570
 of the line and lace so I will try to 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.040
 deepen a little a bit of talk and 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:32.320
 we'll let you know find everything online like 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.320
 at the usual hdblog regional point
