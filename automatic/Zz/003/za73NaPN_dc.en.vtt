what<00:00:03.200> we<00:00:03.380> found<00:00:03.620> in<00:00:03.949> these<00:00:04.100> papers<00:00:04.609> is<00:00:04.819> very

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.090 
what we found in these papers is very

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.360 
what we found in these papers is very
exciting<00:00:05.630> we<00:00:05.899> basically<00:00:06.290> use<00:00:06.439> the<00:00:06.649> nematode<00:00:07.160> C

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:07.370 
exciting we basically use the nematode C

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.089 
exciting we basically use the nematode C
elegans<00:00:07.519> to<00:00:08.000> gain<00:00:08.269> insight<00:00:08.540> into<00:00:09.320> metabolism

elegans to gain insight into metabolism

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.400 
elegans to gain insight into metabolism
and<00:00:10.250> how<00:00:10.820> it<00:00:10.880> is<00:00:11.060> connected<00:00:11.630> to<00:00:11.750> diet<00:00:12.050> which

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
and how it is connected to diet which

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.380 
and how it is connected to diet which
has<00:00:12.590> major<00:00:12.860> implications<00:00:13.070> for<00:00:13.790> human<00:00:14.000> health

has major implications for human health
we<00:00:15.260> briefly<00:00:15.650> found<00:00:16.100> that<00:00:16.550> C<00:00:16.939> elegans<00:00:17.090> which<00:00:17.599> is

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
we briefly found that C elegans which is

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.470 
we briefly found that C elegans which is
a<00:00:17.840> bacteria<00:00:18.530> or<00:00:18.710> can<00:00:19.369> eat<00:00:19.580> different<00:00:19.910> bacteria

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
a bacteria or can eat different bacteria

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.600 
a bacteria or can eat different bacteria
and<00:00:20.690> can<00:00:20.930> respond<00:00:21.440> to<00:00:21.590> that<00:00:21.740> by<00:00:22.039> dramatically

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
and can respond to that by dramatically

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.939 
and can respond to that by dramatically
changing<00:00:23.300> its<00:00:23.480> gene<00:00:23.750> expression<00:00:24.230> program<00:00:24.710> and

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
changing its gene expression program and

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.400 
changing its gene expression program and
that<00:00:25.550> then<00:00:25.760> leads<00:00:26.090> to<00:00:26.330> dramatic<00:00:26.960> changes<00:00:27.350> in

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
that then leads to dramatic changes in

laboratory diet of e.coli we started by

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:43.599 
laboratory diet of e.coli we started by
asking<00:00:41.510> how<00:00:41.989> diet<00:00:42.289> exerts<00:00:42.829> physiological

effects<00:00:43.909> on<00:00:44.149> an<00:00:44.269> animal<00:00:44.600> we<00:00:45.350> fed<00:00:45.589> the<00:00:45.710> worm<00:00:45.859> C

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039

elegans to different bacterial diets and

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.709 
elegans to different bacterial diets and
we<00:00:48.469> discovered<00:00:48.799> the<00:00:49.159> diet<00:00:49.429> affects<00:00:49.719> regulator

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
we discovered the diet affects regulator

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.139 
we discovered the diet affects regulator
that<00:00:50.899> controls<00:00:51.319> molting<00:00:51.769> and<00:00:52.010> in<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:52.969> worm

that controls molting and in the worm

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.149 
that controls molting and in the worm
molting<00:00:53.839> determines<00:00:54.289> developmental<00:00:54.979> rate

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
molting determines developmental rate

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.059 
molting determines developmental rate
but<00:00:55.940> importantly<00:00:56.569> the<00:00:56.989> same<00:00:57.260> regulator<00:00:57.799> in

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:58.069 
but importantly the same regulator in

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:00.969 
but importantly the same regulator in
humans<00:00:58.489> control<00:00:58.999> circadian<00:00:59.389> rhythms<00:00:59.979> which

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
humans control circadian rhythms which

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:03.789 
humans control circadian rhythms which
is<00:01:01.280> also<00:01:01.549> affected<00:01:02.059> by<00:01:02.179> diet<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:02.679> this<00:01:03.679> is

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
is also affected by diet and this is

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.039 
is also affected by diet and this is
just<00:01:03.920> one<00:01:04.010> example<00:01:04.190> of<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:05.360> insights<00:01:05.720> we<00:01:05.869> can

example of a question that can be

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.580 
example of a question that can be

we found remarkably is that when you

we found remarkably is that when you

perturb genes involved in metabolism

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.070 
perturb genes involved in metabolism
this<00:01:27.890> leads<00:01:28.190> to<00:01:28.280> metabolic<00:01:28.880> imbalances<00:01:29.840> that

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
this leads to metabolic imbalances that

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.740 
this leads to metabolic imbalances that

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.490 
started out with asking a dietary
question<00:02:04.340> in<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:04.729> worm<00:02:04.940> and<00:02:05.300> got<00:02:05.990> an<00:02:06.110> answer

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
question in the worm and got an answer

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.859 
question in the worm and got an answer
that<00:02:06.530> directly<00:02:06.979> relates<00:02:07.850> to<00:02:08.090> disease<00:02:08.629> and

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
that directly relates to disease and

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.830 
that directly relates to disease and
dietary<00:02:09.709> treatment<00:02:10.250> in<00:02:10.399> humans<00:02:10.849> we<00:02:11.269> now<00:02:11.480> have

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
dietary treatment in humans we now have

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.360 
dietary treatment in humans we now have
a<00:02:12.139> very<00:02:12.439> tractable<00:02:13.060> system

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
a very tractable system

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.220 
a very tractable system
namely<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.879> nematode<00:02:15.299> C<00:02:15.480> elegans<00:02:15.629> to<00:02:16.049> ask

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
namely the nematode C elegans to ask

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.890 
namely the nematode C elegans to ask
precise<00:02:16.769> questions<00:02:17.400> as<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.940> which<00:02:18.209> components

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
precise questions as to which components

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.440 
precise questions as to which components
in<00:02:19.019> diet<00:02:19.319> can<00:02:20.069> affect<00:02:20.400> gene<00:02:20.610> expression<00:02:21.239> and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
in diet can affect gene expression and

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.750 
in diet can affect gene expression and
life<00:02:22.080> history<00:02:22.290> traits<00:02:22.560> or<00:02:23.129> as<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.370> for<00:02:23.580> the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
life history traits or as the for the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.170 
life history traits or as the for the
physiological<00:02:24.450> traits<00:02:24.780> how<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.980> works<00:02:26.340> this

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
physiological traits how this works this

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.390 
physiological traits how this works this
is<00:02:27.360> much<00:02:27.629> harder<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.230> do<00:02:28.349> in<00:02:28.500> humans<00:02:29.010> where<00:02:29.250> we

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
is much harder to do in humans where we

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.210 
is much harder to do in humans where we
don't<00:02:29.670> have<00:02:29.970> large<00:02:30.620> populations<00:02:31.620> such<00:02:31.829> as<00:02:31.890> we

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
don't have large populations such as we

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.250 
don't have large populations such as we
do<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.549> worm<00:02:32.819> where<00:02:33.510> there's<00:02:33.690> lots<00:02:34.110> of
