00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 good morning I'm elena let's do a little 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.770
 stretching after the race 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.300
 then the race is a traumatic sport 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.250
 in which they are fundamentally used at 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.490
 legs then we start to lengthen the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.960
 lower limb musculature 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.990
 first of all the musculature of the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.359
 bang comes particularly 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.130
 urged during the race 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:26.359
 stretching it like this he found 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.439
 the obstacle on which to rest the leg 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.720
 anterior mib rods of the leg 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.180
 back tried to keep 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.550
 always the heel in contact with the theme 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.610
 that way you should hear one 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.890
 slight muscle tension of the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.890
 calf of the leg that my expulsion 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.840
 any position of static starace but 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.550
 you should keep for at least twenty o 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.750
 thirty seconds to get involved 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.190
 other muscle particularly 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.070
 urged to the quadriceps 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.050
 therefore the lengthening of the quadriceps 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.109
 other than collecting calls account 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.570
 balloon towards the flood trying to 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.720
 keep more tight and therefore not tie 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.960
 a thing like that knees the most 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.670
 together possible support legs 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.810
 slightly bent to safeguard the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.450
 health the position of your back and 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.100

 feeling a vision here in everything 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:51.350
 proper of the musculature of the jute fu 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:53.180
 tip stereo or walking discounts 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.920

 our health in the exhibition 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.450
 neckline we always do healthy
