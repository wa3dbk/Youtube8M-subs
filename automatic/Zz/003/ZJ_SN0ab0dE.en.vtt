the school shrink we saw on the
multiplier<00:02:09.209> trailer<00:02:09.599> it's<00:02:10.020> basically<00:02:10.530> a

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
multiplier trailer it's basically a

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.040 
multiplier trailer it's basically a

the<00:02:14.100> next<00:02:14.370> one<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.700> hellstorm<00:02:15.030> missile

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
the next one is a hellstorm missile

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.560 
the next one is a hellstorm missile

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
to get multi kills easily so that's

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.630 
to get multi kills easily so that's
awesome<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:24.090> would<00:02:24.210> recommend<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:25.640> the
