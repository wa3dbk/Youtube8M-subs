00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.089 
braids going close together so that I
could<00:02:13.269> just<00:02:14.269> wear<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.810> come<00:02:15.319> in<00:02:15.530> with<00:02:15.739> a<00:02:15.769> side

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
could just wear it come in with a side

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.729 
could just wear it come in with a side
part<00:02:16.489> here<00:02:16.849> but<00:02:17.510> I'll<00:02:17.720> be<00:02:17.900> able<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.230> split<00:02:18.530> it

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
part here but I'll be able to split it

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.330 
part here but I'll be able to split it
up<00:02:19.840> because<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:20.989> how<00:02:21.200> this<00:02:21.470> is<00:02:21.709> I<00:02:22.010> don't<00:02:22.099> know

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
up because I how this is I don't know

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.309 
up because I how this is I don't know
how<00:02:22.730> these<00:02:22.940> are<00:02:23.180> going<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.420> work<00:02:23.540> out<00:02:23.750> yet<00:02:24.019> but

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
how these are going to work out yet but

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.559 
how these are going to work out yet but
the<00:02:25.099> thought<00:02:25.310> is<00:02:25.340> that<00:02:25.549> hair<00:02:26.150> will<00:02:26.239> go<00:02:26.360> this

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
the thought is that hair will go this

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.559 
the thought is that hair will go this
way<00:02:26.780> in<00:02:27.049> this<00:02:27.260> way<00:02:27.470> in<00:02:27.590> my<00:02:27.739> face<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.880> back<00:02:29.090> I

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
that's how it falls it kind of falls

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.460 
that's how it falls it kind of falls
into<00:05:08.370> my<00:05:08.640> face<00:05:08.880> and<00:05:09.090> then<00:05:09.630> another<00:05:09.930> thing<00:05:10.290> that

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
into my face and then another thing that

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.190 
into my face and then another thing that
i<00:05:10.500> will<00:05:10.980> not<00:05:11.190> do<00:05:11.430> when<00:05:12.000> i<00:05:12.030> do<00:05:12.330> this<00:05:12.600> again<00:05:12.930> is

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
i will not do when i do this again is

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.940 
i will not do when i do this again is
this<00:05:13.730> pattern<00:05:14.730> here<00:05:15.150> it's<00:05:15.810> that<00:05:16.110> cool<00:05:16.410> so<00:05:16.919> I

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
this pattern here it's that cool so I

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.550 
this pattern here it's that cool so I
cannot<00:05:17.520> do<00:05:17.760> anything<00:05:18.150> but<00:05:18.990> where<00:05:19.320> it<00:05:19.530> the

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
cannot do anything but where it the

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.600 
cannot do anything but where it the
length<00:05:19.919> that<00:05:20.610> it<00:05:21.180> is<00:05:21.930> now<00:05:22.320> released<00:05:22.950> because

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
length that it is now released because

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.260 
length that it is now released because
of<00:05:24.030> how<00:05:24.540> that<00:05:24.840> falls<00:05:25.169> so<00:05:25.919> I<00:05:26.400> didn't<00:05:27.240> really

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
of how that falls so I didn't really

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.520 
of how that falls so I didn't really
like<00:05:27.660> it<00:05:27.720> necessarily<00:05:29.150> when<00:05:30.150> I<00:05:30.180> finished<00:05:30.500> so<00:05:31.500> I

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
like it necessarily when I finished so I

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.780 
like it necessarily when I finished so I
actually<00:05:32.100> went<00:05:32.790> back<00:05:33.030> from

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
actually went back from

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.570 
actually went back from
added<00:05:34.330> more<00:05:34.570> pieces<00:05:35.110> around<00:05:35.290> front<00:05:36.070> I<00:05:36.310> hit

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
added more pieces around front I hit

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.010 
added more pieces around front I hit
close<00:05:37.360> this<00:05:37.690> middle<00:05:38.110> part<00:05:38.350> puts<00:05:39.100> more<00:05:40.020> funky

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
close this middle part puts more funky

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.830 
close this middle part puts more funky

chunks off of hookah rose to kind of

two weeks at the least maybe three maybe
four<00:06:17.860> if<00:06:18.430> I<00:06:18.550> keep<00:06:18.760> the<00:06:18.880> same<00:06:19.060> prefer<00:06:19.360> ways<00:06:19.540> i'd

four if I keep the same prefer ways i'd

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.320 
four if I keep the same prefer ways i'd
be<00:06:20.080> surprised<00:06:20.530> i<00:06:21.220> changed<00:06:21.820> my<00:06:21.910> hair<00:06:22.120> all<00:06:22.300> the

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
be surprised i changed my hair all the

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.770 
be surprised i changed my hair all the
time<00:06:22.510> but<00:06:23.200> i<00:06:23.530> like<00:06:24.370> it<00:06:24.400> it's<00:06:24.760> easy<00:06:25.120> it's<00:06:25.510> really

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
time but i like it it's easy it's really

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.470 
time but i like it it's easy it's really
easy<00:06:25.990> to<00:06:26.170> access<00:06:26.710> my<00:06:27.010> braids<00:06:27.400> and<00:06:27.670> my<00:06:27.760> scalp<00:06:28.210> in

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480 
easy to access my braids and my scalp in

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.690 
easy to access my braids and my scalp in
between<00:06:28.900> so<00:06:29.410> I<00:06:29.470> think<00:06:29.740> I<00:06:29.830> like<00:06:30.010> this<00:06:30.070> option

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:30.700 
between so I think I like this option

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.920 
between so I think I like this option
over<00:06:31.120> a<00:06:31.390> sew-in<00:06:32.040> I<00:06:33.060> think<00:06:34.060> I'll<00:06:34.180> actually<00:06:34.390> like

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
over a sew-in I think I'll actually like

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.920 
over a sew-in I think I'll actually like
this<00:06:35.170> more<00:06:35.680> and<00:06:35.800> more<00:06:35.890> as<00:06:36.190> older<00:06:36.910> my<00:06:37.420> hair<00:06:37.720> gets

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:37.930 
this more and more as older my hair gets

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.630 
this more and more as older my hair gets
because<00:06:38.230> then<00:06:38.440> this<00:06:38.860> part<00:06:39.160> will<00:06:39.340> be<00:06:39.370> more

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:39.640 
because then this part will be more

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.730 
because then this part will be more
fuzzy<00:06:40.210> and<00:06:40.690> it<00:06:40.900> will<00:06:41.020> really<00:06:41.230> look<00:06:41.470> more

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
fuzzy and it will really look more

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.070 
fuzzy and it will really look more
natural<00:06:42.280> so<00:06:42.910> I'm<00:06:43.000> going<00:06:43.180> to<00:06:43.210> maintain<00:06:43.750> this

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
natural so I'm going to maintain this

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.850 
natural so I'm going to maintain this
hair<00:06:44.500> with<00:06:44.920> some<00:06:45.390> big<00:06:46.390> spray<00:06:46.900> to<00:06:47.410> keep<00:06:47.620> it

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
hair with some big spray to keep it

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.640 
hair with some big spray to keep it
smelling<00:06:48.130> good<00:06:48.460> shiny<00:06:49.150> and<00:06:49.450> keep<00:06:50.260> the<00:06:50.410> frizz

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.650 
smelling good shiny and keep the frizz

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.470 
smelling good shiny and keep the frizz
out<00:06:50.920> I'll<00:06:51.220> cut<00:06:51.400> the<00:06:51.520> frizz<00:06:51.760> out<00:06:51.970> when<00:06:52.300> it<00:06:52.450> gets

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480 
out I'll cut the frizz out when it gets

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.400 
out I'll cut the frizz out when it gets
there<00:06:53.140> and<00:06:53.500> then<00:06:54.040> I've<00:06:54.310> been<00:06:54.370> spraying<00:06:55.230> just<00:06:56.230> a

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:56.410 
there and then I've been spraying just a

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.160 
there and then I've been spraying just a
leave-in<00:06:56.680> mixture<00:06:57.640> on<00:06:58.180> my<00:06:58.360> scalp<00:06:58.690> and<00:06:58.930> on<00:06:59.020> the

00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.170 
leave-in mixture on my scalp and on the

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.650 
leave-in mixture on my scalp and on the
braids<00:06:59.470> and<00:07:00.190> I'm<00:07:00.310> going<00:07:00.580> to<00:07:00.670> oil<00:07:01.060> my<00:07:01.360> scalp

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:01.660 
braids and I'm going to oil my scalp

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.030 
braids and I'm going to oil my scalp
with<00:07:01.810> tea<00:07:01.990> tree<00:07:02.020> oil<00:07:02.290> because<00:07:02.830> I<00:07:02.890> actually

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:03.040 
with tea tree oil because I actually

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.790 
with tea tree oil because I actually
think<00:07:03.400> I'm<00:07:03.580> allergic<00:07:03.940> to<00:07:04.210> the<00:07:04.690> frame<00:07:04.960> here<00:07:05.290> so
