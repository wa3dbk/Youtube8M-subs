00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.920 

I'm<00:00:02.960> going<00:00:03.200> to<00:00:03.260> be<00:00:03.350> discharging<00:00:04.070> the<00:00:04.310> cat<00:00:04.930> into

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
I'm going to be discharging the cat into

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.030 
I'm going to be discharging the cat into
the<00:00:05.960> ignition<00:00:06.230> cool<00:00:08.620> alright<00:00:09.620> i'ma<00:00:09.830> charge

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
the ignition cool alright i'ma charge

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.400 
the ignition cool alright i'ma charge
the<00:00:10.339> circuit<00:00:10.790> I'm<00:00:11.480> towards<00:00:11.929> on<00:00:12.019> the<00:00:12.110> circuit

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
the circuit I'm towards on the circuit

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.109 
the circuit I'm towards on the circuit
with<00:00:12.499> a<00:00:12.530> double<00:00:12.889> a<00:00:13.009> battery<00:00:15.700> all<00:00:16.700> right<00:00:16.910> now

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
with a double a battery all right now

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.730 
with a double a battery all right now
I'm<00:00:17.240> going<00:00:17.420> to<00:00:17.480> discharge<00:00:18.109> it<00:00:18.349> into<00:00:18.560> the

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
I'm going to discharge it into the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:25.540 
I'm going to discharge it into the
ignition<00:00:18.890> cool<00:00:24.220> you'll<00:00:25.220> see<00:00:25.429> the

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
ignition cool you'll see the

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.339 
ignition cool you'll see the
high-voltage<00:00:26.000> come<00:00:26.480> from<00:00:26.689> right<00:00:26.900> here<00:00:27.080> I'm<00:00:27.320> a

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
high-voltage come from right here I'm a

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:34.330 
high-voltage come from right here I'm a
zoom<00:00:27.650> in<00:00:27.859> on<00:00:28.099> it<00:00:28.220> i<00:00:32.590> charged<00:00:33.590> it<00:00:33.680> up<00:00:33.829> right<00:00:34.129> now

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
zoom in on it i charged it up right now

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:46.960 
zoom in on it i charged it up right now
still<00:00:34.879> charging<00:00:35.649> now<00:00:36.649> I'm<00:00:36.739> a<00:00:36.829> discharge

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.510 

i<00:00:47.060> can<00:00:47.750> get<00:00:47.870> at<00:00:47.960> least<00:00:47.990> four<00:00:48.410> good<00:00:48.770> sports<00:00:49.220> out

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
i can get at least four good sports out

00:00:49.520 --> 00:01:06.850 
i can get at least four good sports out
of<00:00:49.700> it<00:00:50.800> so<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:51.980> ignition<00:00:52.100> cool<00:00:57.010> three<00:00:58.010> hat<00:00:58.220> Tom

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.190 

now<00:01:07.860> when<00:01:08.070> i'll<00:01:08.160> show<00:01:08.190> you<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.960> same

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
now when i'll show you is a the same

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.560 
now when i'll show you is a the same
circuit<00:01:10.800> but<00:01:11.430> i<00:01:11.550> want<00:01:11.730> to<00:01:11.790> show<00:01:11.940> you<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.180> spark

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
circuit but i want to show you the spark

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.110 
circuit but i want to show you the spark
side<00:01:12.870> i'm<00:01:13.050> charging<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.620> up<00:01:13.800> right<00:01:14.010> now<00:01:14.250> will

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
side i'm charging it up right now will

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.370 
side i'm charging it up right now will
it<00:01:15.240> be<00:01:15.330> discharging<00:01:15.870> it<00:01:16.020> through<00:01:16.230> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
it be discharging it through the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.690 
it be discharging it through the
ignition<00:01:16.890> coil<00:01:17.100> making<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.550> high<00:01:17.670> voltage

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
ignition coil making the high voltage

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.730 
ignition coil making the high voltage
and<00:01:18.330> here<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.380> making<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.250> hydrogen<00:01:21.740> so

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
and here it is making the hydrogen so

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.930 
and here it is making the hydrogen so
one<00:01:22.890> sport<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.880> sport<00:01:24.110> three<00:01:25.110> sport<00:01:25.520> for<00:01:26.520> sport

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
one sport to sport three sport for sport

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.720 
one sport to sport three sport for sport
five<00:01:27.690> sport<00:01:28.170> now<00:01:29.040> I'm<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.220> going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.430> hold<00:01:29.580> it

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
five sport now I'm just going to hold it

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.650 
five sport now I'm just going to hold it
to<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:31.700> ok<00:01:32.700> I'll<00:01:32.910> try<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.090> again<00:01:33.390> I'm

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
to it ok I'll try that again I'm

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.160 
to it ok I'll try that again I'm
torching<00:01:34.050> it<00:01:34.230> up<00:01:35.660> whenever<00:01:36.660> I'm<00:01:36.900> discharging

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
torching it up whenever I'm discharging

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.240 
torching it up whenever I'm discharging
it<00:01:37.770> through<00:01:37.980> the<00:01:38.100> sport<00:01:39.920> or<00:01:40.920> through<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
it through the sport or through the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.740 
it through the sport or through the
ignition<00:01:41.670> coil<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.000> also<00:01:42.150> making<00:01:42.510> this

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
ignition coil it's also making this

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.930 
ignition coil it's also making this
hydrogen<00:01:43.910> here<00:01:44.910> it<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:46.250> food<00:01:47.250> there<00:01:47.550> was<00:01:47.790> the

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
hydrogen here it is food there was the

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.840 
hydrogen here it is food there was the
sport<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:48.690> right<00:01:48.930> there<00:01:49.670> but<00:01:50.670> here's

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
sport that I like right there but here's

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.340 
sport that I like right there but here's
another<00:01:51.090> one<00:01:51.390> little<00:01:51.780> short<00:01:52.020> bursts<00:01:54.050> ok<00:01:55.050> hold

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
another one little short bursts ok hold

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.300 
another one little short bursts ok hold
on<00:01:55.560> i'ma<00:01:55.770> keep<00:01:56.010> charging<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:58.220> there's<00:01:59.220> a

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
on i'ma keep charging it there's a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.190 
on i'ma keep charging it there's a
phenomenon<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.880> happens<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:00.720> that<00:02:00.750> where

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
phenomenon that happens like that where

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.440 
phenomenon that happens like that where
you<00:02:01.590> know<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.040> good<00:02:02.070> art<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:02.940> I<00:02:03.000> can't<00:02:03.270> get

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
you know it's a good art but I can't get

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.030 
you know it's a good art but I can't get
it<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.660> do<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.050> don't<00:02:04.200> know<00:02:04.260> what<00:02:04.620> makes<00:02:04.860> it

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
it to do it I don't know what makes it

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.370 
it to do it I don't know what makes it
stable<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.610> do<00:02:05.760> it<00:02:05.940> I'm<00:02:06.780> gonna<00:02:06.900> try<00:02:07.050> to<00:02:07.140> figure

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
stable to do it I'm gonna try to figure

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:17.630 
stable to do it I'm gonna try to figure
it<00:02:07.560> out<00:02:07.650> there

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.700
