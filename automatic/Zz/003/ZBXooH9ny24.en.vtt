we've got a real special treat for train
fans<00:00:17.150> if<00:00:17.450> you<00:00:17.810> have<00:00:18.050> the<00:00:18.259> Emerald<00:00:18.410> night<00:00:18.770> or

fans if you have the Emerald night or
the<00:00:19.189> mayor's<00:00:19.430> train<00:00:19.790> which<00:00:20.390> maybe<00:00:20.599> is<00:00:20.720> a

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
the mayor's train which maybe is a

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.540 
the mayor's train which maybe is a
little<00:00:20.899> bit<00:00:21.169> old-fashioned<00:00:21.950> or<00:00:22.130> a<00:00:22.160> little<00:00:22.340> bit

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
little bit old-fashioned or a little bit

little bit old-fashioned or a little bit
industrial<00:00:23.090> we're<00:00:23.750> going<00:00:23.960> full<00:00:24.200> speed<00:00:24.349> ahead

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
industrial we're going full speed ahead

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.920 
industrial we're going full speed ahead
into<00:00:24.950> the<00:00:24.980> future<00:00:25.450> with<00:00:26.450> our<00:00:26.599> first

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
into the future with our first

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.170 
into the future with our first
high-speed<00:00:27.230> passenger<00:00:28.040> train<00:00:28.399> called<00:00:28.970> the

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
high-speed passenger train called the

high-speed passenger train called the
horizon<00:00:29.779> Express<00:00:30.230> and<00:00:30.470> this<00:00:31.460> is<00:00:31.610> the<00:00:31.730> January

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
horizon Express and this is the January

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.090 
horizon Express and this is the January
exclusive<00:00:32.750> or<00:00:32.930> what<00:00:33.530> we<00:00:33.620> call<00:00:33.649> now<00:00:34.040> the

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
exclusive or what we call now the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.730 
exclusive or what we call now the
Creator<00:00:34.670> expert<00:00:35.030> model<00:00:35.990> and<00:00:36.170> we're<00:00:36.590> very

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:36.740 
Creator expert model and we're very

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.320 
Creator expert model and we're very
excited<00:00:36.860> about<00:00:37.160> it<00:00:37.340> because<00:00:37.520> traditionally

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
excited about it because traditionally

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.150 
excited about it because traditionally
we've<00:00:38.510> kind<00:00:38.720> of<00:00:38.780> avoided<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:39.650> high-speed

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
we've kind of avoided the high-speed

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.280 
we've kind of avoided the high-speed
angle<00:00:41.060> because<00:00:41.330> that's<00:00:41.480> usually<00:00:41.600> where<00:00:41.990> city

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
angle because that's usually where city

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.440 
angle because that's usually where city
goes<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:42.740> that<00:00:43.430> tends<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:43.760> go<00:00:43.970> towards<00:00:44.390> a

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
goes and that tends to go towards a

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.270 
goes and that tends to go towards a
younger<00:00:44.630> crowd<00:00:44.900> so<00:00:45.470> the<00:00:45.680> building<00:00:45.830> experience

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
younger crowd so the building experience

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.280 
younger crowd so the building experience
is<00:00:46.580> a<00:00:46.610> little<00:00:46.880> bit<00:00:46.970> more<00:00:47.090> simple<00:00:47.360> and<00:00:47.690> a<00:00:48.079> little

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
is a little bit more simple and a little

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.080 
is a little bit more simple and a little
more<00:00:48.410> basic<00:00:48.829> but<00:00:49.370> with<00:00:49.490> this<00:00:49.610> train<00:00:49.910> we<00:00:50.060> can

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
more basic but with this train we can

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.000 
more basic but with this train we can
assure<00:00:50.450> you<00:00:50.480> that<00:00:50.810> there<00:00:51.020> are<00:00:51.079> lots<00:00:51.560> of<00:00:51.829> clever

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
assure you that there are lots of clever

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.650 
assure you that there are lots of clever
and<00:00:52.310> fun<00:00:52.490> building<00:00:52.850> techniques<00:00:53.240> and<00:00:53.480> you're

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
and fun building techniques and you're

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.030 
and fun building techniques and you're
going<00:00:53.810> to<00:00:53.900> have<00:00:53.990> a<00:00:54.020> real<00:00:54.260> treat<00:00:54.500> building<00:00:54.920> it

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
going to have a real treat building it

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.680 
going to have a real treat building it
so<00:00:55.670> basically<00:00:55.850> I'm<00:00:56.239> just<00:00:56.300> going<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:56.570> go

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
so basically I'm just going to go

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.180 
so basically I'm just going to go
through<00:00:56.840> some<00:00:56.930> of<00:00:57.260> these<00:00:57.350> parts<00:00:57.680> because

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
through some of these parts because

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.870 
through some of these parts because
we're<00:00:58.579> very<00:00:58.610> excited<00:00:58.910> to<00:00:59.329> show<00:00:59.510> you<00:00:59.540> them<00:01:00.880> if

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
we're very excited to show you them if

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.550 
we're very excited to show you them if
we<00:01:02.060> start<00:01:02.300> with<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.450> main<00:01:02.690> engine<00:01:03.020> I<00:01:03.170> think

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
we start with the main engine I think

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.109 
we start with the main engine I think
there's<00:01:03.739> some<00:01:03.920> really<00:01:04.220> fun<00:01:04.549> building

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
there's some really fun building

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.940 
there's some really fun building
techniques<00:01:05.509> in<00:01:05.659> here<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:05.990> that's<00:01:06.470> surprising

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
techniques in here and that's surprising

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.649 
techniques in here and that's surprising
because<00:01:07.100> these<00:01:07.490> trains<00:01:07.820> are<00:01:08.060> traditionally

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
because these trains are traditionally

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.170 
because these trains are traditionally
very<00:01:09.170> aerodynamic<00:01:09.560> which<00:01:10.190> could<00:01:10.760> mean<00:01:11.000> that

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
very aerodynamic which could mean that

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.850 
very aerodynamic which could mean that
they're<00:01:11.330> a<00:01:11.360> bit<00:01:11.540> simple<00:01:11.900> but<00:01:12.409> we<00:01:12.500> found<00:01:12.650> some

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
they're a bit simple but we found some

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.410 
they're a bit simple but we found some
wonderful<00:01:13.220> opportunities<00:01:13.760> to<00:01:13.909> surprise<00:01:14.240> you

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
wonderful opportunities to surprise you

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.300 
wonderful opportunities to surprise you
with<00:01:14.600> some<00:01:14.870> building<00:01:15.140> techniques<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:16.100> first

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
with some building techniques the first

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.890 
with some building techniques the first
of<00:01:16.490> issue<00:01:16.610> which<00:01:17.060> you<00:01:17.210> would<00:01:17.300> probably<00:01:17.630> see<00:01:17.659> is

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
of issue which you would probably see is

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.600 
of issue which you would probably see is
on<00:01:18.050> the<00:01:18.140> frontier<00:01:18.500> and<00:01:18.860> we<00:01:19.159> had<00:01:19.250> to<00:01:19.340> do<00:01:19.460> some

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
on the frontier and we had to do some

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.820 
on the frontier and we had to do some
upside<00:01:19.940> down<00:01:20.090> building<00:01:20.510> to<00:01:21.170> try<00:01:21.409> to<00:01:21.470> keep<00:01:21.650> this

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
upside down building to try to keep this

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.710 
upside down building to try to keep this
nice<00:01:22.040> smooth<00:01:22.370> shape<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:22.880> you'll<00:01:23.360> see<00:01:23.479> that<00:01:23.600> it

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
nice smooth shape and you'll see that it

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.210 
nice smooth shape and you'll see that it
continues<00:01:24.080> up<00:01:24.110> into<00:01:24.500> this<00:01:24.590> windshield<00:01:24.890> and

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
continues up into this windshield and

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.680 
continues up into this windshield and
that's<00:01:25.549> actually<00:01:25.700> a<00:01:25.909> printed<00:01:26.299> windshield

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
that's actually a printed windshield

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.030 
that's actually a printed windshield
which<00:01:26.870> is<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.110> first<00:01:27.260> time<00:01:27.470> we've<00:01:27.650> printed<00:01:27.830> on

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
which is the first time we've printed on

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.380 
which is the first time we've printed on
that<00:01:28.190> element<00:01:28.400> which<00:01:28.850> we're<00:01:29.120> pretty<00:01:29.270> excited

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
that element which we're pretty excited

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.899 
that element which we're pretty excited
about<00:01:29.690> we<00:01:30.380> also<00:01:30.530> have<00:01:30.740> printing<00:01:31.100> on<00:01:31.220> this<00:01:31.400> tile

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
about we also have printing on this tile

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.390 
about we also have printing on this tile
here<00:01:32.210> which<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:32.630> quite<00:01:32.780> nice<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.260> then<00:01:33.950> we

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
here which is quite nice and then we

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
here which is quite nice and then we
wanted<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:34.670> go<00:01:34.790> a<00:01:34.820> little<00:01:34.970> bit<00:01:35.119> beyond

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
wanted to go a little bit beyond

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.940 
wanted to go a little bit beyond
printing<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:35.990> we<00:01:36.080> wanted<00:01:36.320> to<00:01:36.380> try<00:01:36.590> to<00:01:36.680> avoid

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
printing and we wanted to try to avoid

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.070 
printing and we wanted to try to avoid
labels<00:01:37.369> wherever<00:01:37.670> possible<00:01:37.820> so<00:01:38.720> this<00:01:38.869> back

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
labels wherever possible so this back

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.899 
labels wherever possible so this back
area<00:01:39.350> here<00:01:39.740> is<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:39.920> really<00:01:40.310> fun<00:01:40.460> section

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
area here is a really fun section

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.730 
area here is a really fun section
because<00:01:41.150> the<00:01:41.540> chevron<00:01:41.930> or<00:01:42.140> these<00:01:42.290> arrows<00:01:42.710> are

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
because the chevron or these arrows are

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.460 
because the chevron or these arrows are
all<00:01:43.520> brick<00:01:43.820> built<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:44.690> there<00:01:44.840> are<00:01:44.960> tiny<00:01:45.200> little

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
all brick built so there are tiny little

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.380 
all brick built so there are tiny little
pieces<00:01:45.770> little<00:01:46.369> slopes<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:46.790> actually<00:01:47.240> make

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
pieces little slopes that actually make

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.660 
pieces little slopes that actually make
up<00:01:47.420> each<00:01:47.720> part<00:01:48.229> of<00:01:48.380> that<00:01:48.530> which<00:01:49.280> we<00:01:49.400> think<00:01:49.520> you

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
up each part of that which we think you

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.190 
up each part of that which we think you
really<00:01:49.970> have<00:01:50.119> fun<00:01:50.240> exploring<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:50.900> building

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
really have fun exploring and building

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.990 
really have fun exploring and building
then<00:01:51.890> of<00:01:51.979> course<00:01:52.010> we<00:01:52.340> have<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.490> functionality

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
then of course we have the functionality

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.789 
then of course we have the functionality
with<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.450> pantographs<00:01:53.930> they<00:01:54.320> can<00:01:54.470> go<00:01:54.560> up<00:01:54.680> and

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
with the pantographs they can go up and

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.620 
with the pantographs they can go up and
down<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.189> they<00:01:55.580> both<00:01:55.760> work<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:56.240> depending<00:01:56.630> on

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
down and they both work so depending on

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.270 
down and they both work so depending on
the<00:01:56.810> direction<00:01:56.960> of<00:01:57.260> travel<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:57.860> can<00:01:58.010> decide

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
the direction of travel you can decide

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.370 
the direction of travel you can decide
which<00:01:58.400> way<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:58.640> go<00:01:58.760> and<00:01:59.090> then<00:01:59.750> of<00:01:59.869> course<00:02:00.080> the

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
which way to go and then of course the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.950 
which way to go and then of course the
trained<00:02:00.650> opens<00:02:00.920> up<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:02.450> when<00:02:02.720> you<00:02:02.810> look

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
trained opens up and when you look

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.550 
trained opens up and when you look
inside<00:02:03.189> we<00:02:04.189> have<00:02:04.220> a<00:02:04.729> removable<00:02:05.560> electric

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
inside we have a removable electric

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.899 
inside we have a removable electric
motor<00:02:06.770> which<00:02:07.100> is<00:02:07.250> like<00:02:07.400> on<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.580> real<00:02:07.729> train

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
motor which is like on the real train

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.130 
motor which is like on the real train
except<00:02:08.239> I<00:02:08.330> don't<00:02:08.420> think<00:02:08.689> on<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.840> real<00:02:08.959> train

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
except I don't think on the real train

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.530 
except I don't think on the real train
it<00:02:09.259> says<00:02:09.379> easily<00:02:09.799> removable<00:02:10.310> but<00:02:11.269> you<00:02:11.389> can

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
it says easily removable but you can

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.789 
it says easily removable but you can
take<00:02:11.689> that<00:02:11.719> out<00:02:11.959> actually<00:02:12.139> and<00:02:12.499> add<00:02:12.590> power

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
take that out actually and add power

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.559 
take that out actually and add power
functions<00:02:13.219> because<00:02:13.849> just<00:02:13.879> by<00:02:14.120> inserting<00:02:14.419> a

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
functions because just by inserting a

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.559 
functions because just by inserting a
battery<00:02:14.810> box<00:02:15.049> in<00:02:15.349> a<00:02:15.469> receiver<00:02:15.799> and<00:02:16.099> a<00:02:16.310> motor

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
battery box in a receiver and a motor

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.780 
battery box in a receiver and a motor
you<00:02:16.930> can<00:02:17.079> power<00:02:17.260> this<00:02:17.469> and<00:02:17.739> then<00:02:18.370> on<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.609> front

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
you can power this and then on the front

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.360 
you can power this and then on the front
we<00:02:18.879> also<00:02:19.060> have<00:02:19.359> a<00:02:19.769> conductor<00:02:20.769> or<00:02:21.069> a<00:02:21.099> driver

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
we also have a conductor or a driver

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.610 
we also have a conductor or a driver
which<00:02:21.999> is<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.209> female<00:02:22.540> driver<00:02:22.810> which<00:02:23.260> has<00:02:23.469> been

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
which is a female driver which has been

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.199 
which is a female driver which has been
long<00:02:23.920> overdue<00:02:24.249> since<00:02:24.579> we've<00:02:24.700> done<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.879> and

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
long overdue since we've done that and

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.399 
long overdue since we've done that and
we<00:02:25.719> thought<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:25.930> would<00:02:26.079> be<00:02:26.139> a<00:02:26.170> great

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
we thought it would be a great

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.199 
we thought it would be a great
opportunity<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.950> include<00:02:27.670> her<00:02:27.760> in<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:27.879> set

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
opportunity to include her in this set

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.209 
opportunity to include her in this set
so<00:02:28.749> lots<00:02:28.989> of<00:02:29.200> fun<00:02:29.319> things<00:02:29.469> to<00:02:29.680> explore<00:02:29.980> when

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:30.219 
so lots of fun things to explore when

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:32.879 
so lots of fun things to explore when
you're<00:02:30.340> building<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:31.120> engine<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:32.650> if<00:02:32.769> we

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:32.889 
you're building the engine so if we

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.099 
you're building the engine so if we
continue<00:02:33.310> down<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.579> Train<00:02:33.849> we<00:02:34.719> pull<00:02:34.959> the

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
continue down the Train we pull the

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.229 
continue down the Train we pull the
wagons<00:02:35.799> out<00:02:35.889> here<00:02:36.129> and<00:02:36.280> one<00:02:36.819> of<00:02:36.909> the<00:02:37.000> first

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
wagons out here and one of the first

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.640 
wagons out here and one of the first
things<00:02:37.329> that<00:02:37.480> you'll<00:02:37.689> notice<00:02:37.719> is<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.230> the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
things that you'll notice is that the

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.199 
things that you'll notice is that the
trains<00:02:38.920> are<00:02:39.129> actually<00:02:39.489> joined<00:02:39.760> they<00:02:40.060> have<00:02:40.180> a

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
trains are actually joined they have a

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.440 
trains are actually joined they have a
co<00:02:40.420> joined<00:02:40.719> wheelset<00:02:41.439> there<00:02:41.680> bogie<00:02:42.609> we

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
co joined wheelset there bogie we

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.849 
co joined wheelset there bogie we
actually<00:02:43.629> don't<00:02:43.930> get<00:02:44.109> to<00:02:44.200> do<00:02:44.319> this<00:02:44.349> very<00:02:44.590> often

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
actually don't get to do this very often

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.110 
actually don't get to do this very often
in<00:02:45.129> fact<00:02:45.280> I<00:02:45.370> think<00:02:45.549> we've<00:02:45.639> only<00:02:45.790> done<00:02:45.969> it<00:02:46.030> once

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
in fact I think we've only done it once

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.300 
in fact I think we've only done it once
before<00:02:46.419> but<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.349> really<00:02:47.499> gives<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.829> nice<00:02:47.950> sleek

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
before but it really gives a nice sleek

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.009 
before but it really gives a nice sleek
look<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.269> train<00:02:49.510> that<00:02:49.629> we<00:02:49.750> think<00:02:49.959> is

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
look to the train that we think is

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.319 
look to the train that we think is
rather<00:02:50.169> exciting<00:02:50.799> in<00:02:50.950> addition<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.969> that<00:02:52.120> we

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
rather exciting in addition to that we

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.629 
rather exciting in addition to that we
have<00:02:52.359> working<00:02:52.719> doors<00:02:53.079> and<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:54.310> can<00:02:54.459> see<00:02:54.609> the

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
have working doors and you can see the

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.220 
have working doors and you can see the
doors<00:02:54.969> actually<00:02:55.329> function<00:02:55.719> on<00:02:55.840> both<00:02:55.989> sides

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
doors actually function on both sides

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.170 
doors actually function on both sides
and<00:02:56.379> these<00:02:56.919> are<00:02:57.069> brick-built<00:02:57.370> doors<00:02:57.699> which<00:02:58.030> we

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
and these are brick-built doors which we

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.759 
and these are brick-built doors which we
think<00:02:58.299> adds<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.659> really<00:02:58.780> nice<00:02:59.019> detail<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.650> look

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
think adds a really nice detail and look

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.379 
think adds a really nice detail and look
and<00:02:59.980> then<00:03:00.579> of<00:03:00.669> course<00:03:00.909> you<00:03:01.030> want<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.239> play<00:03:01.359> with

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:01.389 
and then of course you want to play with

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.000 
and then of course you want to play with
the<00:03:01.540> train<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.349> we<00:03:02.469> want<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.650> make<00:03:02.739> it<00:03:02.919> show

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
the train so we want to make it show

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.979 
the train so we want to make it show
that<00:03:03.040> way<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.400> roofs<00:03:03.609> come<00:03:03.849> off<00:03:04.000> when<00:03:04.900> the

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
that way the roofs come off when the

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.539 
that way the roofs come off when the
roof<00:03:05.139> comes<00:03:05.379> off<00:03:05.530> here<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:06.219> can<00:03:06.340> see<00:03:06.459> is

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
roof comes off here you can see is

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.939 
roof comes off here you can see is
actually<00:03:06.699> a<00:03:06.939> really<00:03:07.150> nice<00:03:07.389> split<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:08.260> divides

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:08.949 
actually a really nice split it divides

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.220 
actually a really nice split it divides
it<00:03:09.219> at<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.430> midpoint<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:10.599> can<00:03:10.719> see<00:03:10.870> most<00:03:11.049> of

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
it at a midpoint and you can see most of

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.409 
it at a midpoint and you can see most of
this<00:03:11.349> actually<00:03:11.590> comes<00:03:11.919> off<00:03:12.129> on<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.669> roof<00:03:12.849> and

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:13.419 
this actually comes off on the roof and

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:15.300 
this actually comes off on the roof and
what<00:03:13.569> that<00:03:13.599> does<00:03:13.870> is<00:03:13.930> it<00:03:14.169> allows<00:03:14.199> you<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.829> lot

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
what that does is it allows you a lot

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.770 
what that does is it allows you a lot
more<00:03:15.430> access<00:03:15.849> to<00:03:15.879> get<00:03:16.150> in<00:03:16.239> on<00:03:16.359> the<00:03:16.419> play<00:03:16.629> and

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
more access to get in on the play and

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.809 
more access to get in on the play and
play<00:03:17.109> with<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.349> minifigures<00:03:17.859> and<00:03:18.069> as<00:03:18.669> you

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
play with the minifigures and as you

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.339 
play with the minifigures and as you
look<00:03:18.849> inside<00:03:19.239> on<00:03:19.419> the<00:03:19.510> minifigures<00:03:19.959> one<00:03:20.169> thing

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
look inside on the minifigures one thing

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.170 
look inside on the minifigures one thing
that<00:03:20.469> might<00:03:20.620> stand<00:03:20.829> out<00:03:21.040> is<00:03:21.189> actually<00:03:21.699> we<00:03:22.030> have

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
that might stand out is actually we have

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.789 
that might stand out is actually we have
one<00:03:22.870> of<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.079> passengers<00:03:23.379> has<00:03:23.650> already

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
one of the passengers has already

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.159 
one of the passengers has already
decided<00:03:24.159> to<00:03:24.340> use<00:03:24.549> the<00:03:24.699> restroom<00:03:24.819> I<00:03:25.239> guess<00:03:26.019> you

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
the cool features of this part and

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.069 
the cool features of this part and
actually<00:04:09.489> both<00:04:09.669> of<00:04:09.849> these<00:04:09.969> wagons<00:04:10.389> are<00:04:10.750> these

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
actually both of these wagons are these

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.289 
actually both of these wagons are these
windows<00:04:11.469> these<00:04:11.919> windows<00:04:12.280> you<00:04:12.489> may<00:04:12.789> recognize

windows these windows you may recognize

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.059 
windows these windows you may recognize
because<00:04:13.750> they<00:04:13.930> normally<00:04:14.289> go<00:04:14.349> vertical<00:04:14.889> and

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
because they normally go vertical and

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.770 
because they normally go vertical and
we've<00:04:15.459> chosen<00:04:15.699> to<00:04:15.879> lay<00:04:16.090> them<00:04:16.269> on<00:04:16.359> their<00:04:16.570> side

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
we've chosen to lay them on their side

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.390 
we've chosen to lay them on their side
and<00:04:16.989> that<00:04:17.079> gives<00:04:17.229> the<00:04:17.380> train<00:04:17.620> a<00:04:17.650> really<00:04:18.130> sleek

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
and that gives the train a really sleek

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.310 
and that gives the train a really sleek
fast<00:04:18.669> look<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:19.329> also<00:04:19.750> a<00:04:19.870> different<00:04:20.049> building

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
fast look and also a different building

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.240 
fast look and also a different building
