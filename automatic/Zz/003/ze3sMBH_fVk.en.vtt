not<00:00:41.370> all<00:00:41.520> cars<00:00:41.730> have<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.360> however<00:00:42.840> if<00:00:43.379> you

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
not all cars have this however if you

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.610 
not all cars have this however if you
replace<00:00:44.700> your<00:00:44.730> radio<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.629> most<00:00:45.930> cases<00:00:46.230> you

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
replace your radio in most cases you

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.520 
replace your radio in most cases you
typically<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.670> past<00:00:47.910> lost<00:00:48.840> all<00:00:49.200> that

typically have in the past lost all that

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.110 
typically have in the past lost all that
information<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.190> lot<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.640> people<00:00:50.850> aren't<00:00:51.030> happy

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
information a lot of people aren't happy

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.240 
information a lot of people aren't happy
about<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.690> because<00:00:52.020> they<00:00:52.350> like<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.680> factory

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
about that because they like the factory

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.490 
about that because they like the factory
info<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:54.300> they<00:00:54.420> get<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.899> stock<00:00:55.140> radio

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
info that they get on the stock radio

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.750 
info that they get on the stock radio
however<00:00:55.829> they've<00:00:56.039> come<00:00:56.280> up<00:00:56.309> with<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.579> solution

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
however they've come up with a solution

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.860 
however they've come up with a solution
that<00:00:57.239> they're<00:00:57.780> calling<00:00:58.170> DD<00:00:58.859> DD<00:00:59.550> r<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.329> no<00:01:00.629> not

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
that they're calling DD DD r and no not

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.979 
that they're calling DD DD r and no not

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
retention so everything's all in one box

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.080 
retention so everything's all in one box
they<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.979> few<00:01:08.369> vehicles<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.970> they're

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
they have a few vehicles that they're

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.210 
they have a few vehicles that they're
covering<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.350> said<00:01:10.409> earlier<00:01:10.740> it

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
covering and like I said earlier it

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.859 
covering and like I said earlier it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
will consist of backup cameras backup

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.640 
will consist of backup cameras backup

parking brake reverse trigger does

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.399 
parking brake reverse trigger does
everything<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.420> all<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.780> other<00:01:24.930> interfaces

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
everything that all the other interfaces

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.890 
everything that all the other interfaces
typically<00:01:25.920> did<00:01:26.100> however<00:01:26.340> they've<00:01:27.299> added<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
typically did however they've added the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.960 
typically did however they've added the
display<00:01:28.350> retention<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.610> as<00:01:29.700> well<00:01:29.729> and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
display retention to it as well and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.640 
display retention to it as well and
basically<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.450> way<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.689> works<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.229> once

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
basically the way it works is once

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.260 
basically the way it works is once
you've<00:01:31.860> wired<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.220> adapter<00:01:32.729> up<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.150> like

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
you've wired this adapter up just like

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.760 
you've wired this adapter up just like
you<00:01:33.600> normally<00:01:33.750> would<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.320> any<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.619> their

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
you normally would with any of their

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.160 
you normally would with any of their
other<00:01:34.799> adapters<00:01:35.430> there's<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.060> video<00:01:36.390> output

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
other adapters there's a video output

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.249 
other adapters there's a video output
that<00:01:37.710> will<00:01:37.860> plug<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.150> video<00:01:39.479> input<00:01:40.110> of

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
that will plug in to the video input of

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.039 
that will plug in to the video input of
one<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.070> these<00:01:41.130> aftermarket<00:01:41.549> radios<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.479> so

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
one of these aftermarket radios and so

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.080 
one of these aftermarket radios and so
basically<00:01:43.829> all<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.490> would<00:01:44.610> do<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.909> get<00:01:45.060> to

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
basically all you would do to get to

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.910 
basically all you would do to get to
that<00:01:45.210> information<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.079> go<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.290> one<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
that information is go to one of the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.280 
that information is go to one of the
video<00:01:47.250> inputs<00:01:47.820> on<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.119> aftermarket<00:01:48.960> radio

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
video inputs on the aftermarket radio

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.639 
video inputs on the aftermarket radio
and<00:01:49.770> you'll<00:01:50.340> see<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.939> original<00:01:51.270> display<00:01:51.960> that

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
and you'll see the original display that

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.020 
and you'll see the original display that
you<00:01:52.799> would<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:52.979> seen<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.369> your<00:01:53.549> original

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you would have seen on your original

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.940 
you would have seen on your original
radio<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:55.049> all<00:01:55.229> those<00:01:55.350> cool<00:01:55.590> things<00:01:55.619> that

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
radio with all those cool things that

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.410 
radio with all those cool things that
you<00:01:56.100> would<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.340> lost<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.210> way<00:01:57.360> you

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
you would have lost and the way you

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.600 
you would have lost and the way you
would<00:01:57.659> actually<00:01:57.840> access<00:01:58.590> them<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.040> through

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
would actually access them is through
