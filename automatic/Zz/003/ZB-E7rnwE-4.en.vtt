just built so cut out all of the pieces
and<00:01:55.750> then<00:01:56.140> assemble<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.649> box<00:01:56.860> using<00:01:57.310> some

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
and then assemble the box using some

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.029 
and then assemble the box using some
screws<00:01:57.819> then<00:01:58.630> cut<00:01:58.840> a<00:01:58.869> one-inch<00:01:59.110> hole<00:01:59.440> in<00:01:59.710> one

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
screws then cut a one-inch hole in one

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.100 
screws then cut a one-inch hole in one
side<00:02:00.369> reason<00:02:00.759> a<00:02:00.850> hole<00:02:01.119> saw<00:02:01.479> this<00:02:01.720> will<00:02:01.899> serve

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
side reason a hole saw this will serve

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.919 
side reason a hole saw this will serve
as<00:02:02.140> our<00:02:02.470> vacuum<00:02:02.770> port<00:02:03.399> now<00:02:04.330> our<00:02:04.479> top<00:02:04.690> piece

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
as our vacuum port now our top piece

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.960 
as our vacuum port now our top piece
will<00:02:05.110> be<00:02:05.229> made<00:02:05.380> out<00:02:05.530> of<00:02:05.560> pegboard<00:02:06.280> so<00:02:06.640> cut<00:02:06.940> a

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
will be made out of pegboard so cut a

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.059 
will be made out of pegboard so cut a
piece<00:02:07.179> to<00:02:07.390> fit<00:02:07.569> the<00:02:07.690> vacuum<00:02:08.080> box<00:02:08.319> and<00:02:08.619> then

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
piece to fit the vacuum box and then

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.610 
piece to fit the vacuum box and then
screw<00:02:09.459> that<00:02:09.700> in<00:02:09.940> place<00:02:10.300> now<00:02:11.260> you'll<00:02:11.410> need<00:02:11.590> a

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
screw that in place now you'll need a

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.350 
screw that in place now you'll need a
floor<00:02:11.920> adapter<00:02:12.459> that<00:02:12.580> fits<00:02:12.640> your<00:02:13.030> shop<00:02:13.330> vac

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
floor adapter that fits your shop vac

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.449 
floor adapter that fits your shop vac
because<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.350> will<00:02:14.500> be<00:02:14.620> used<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.890> create<00:02:15.100> our

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
because that will be used to create our

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.240 
because that will be used to create our
vacuum<00:02:15.850> suction<00:02:16.720> mount<00:02:17.319> that<00:02:17.590> adapter

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
vacuum suction mount that adapter

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.130 
vacuum suction mount that adapter
securely<00:02:18.730> over<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.209> hole<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.600> drilled<00:02:19.750> in

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
securely over the hole you drilled in

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.740 
securely over the hole you drilled in
the<00:02:20.260> side<00:02:20.500> now<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.430> can<00:02:21.640> use<00:02:21.760> duct<00:02:22.090> tape<00:02:22.330> but<00:02:22.569> I

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
the side now you can use duct tape but I

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.870 
the side now you can use duct tape but I
try<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.200> avoid<00:02:23.530> using<00:02:23.800> that<00:02:23.980> stuff<00:02:24.280> any<00:02:24.550> chance

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
try to avoid using that stuff any chance

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.390 
try to avoid using that stuff any chance
I<00:02:25.060> get<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:25.600> I<00:02:25.630> chose<00:02:26.050> aluminum<00:02:26.709> foil<00:02:27.069> tape

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
I get so I chose aluminum foil tape

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.490 
I get so I chose aluminum foil tape
that's<00:02:27.640> used<00:02:27.850> for<00:02:27.940> insulation<00:02:28.360> it's<00:02:29.170> much

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
that's used for insulation it's much

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.680 
that's used for insulation it's much
easier<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:29.950> work<00:02:30.220> with<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.760> it's<00:02:31.209> got<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.450> nice

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
easier to work with and it's got a nice

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.410 
easier to work with and it's got a nice
look<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:31.990> it<00:02:32.290> completely<00:02:33.010> tape<00:02:33.459> all<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.730> edges

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
look to it completely tape all the edges

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.870 
look to it completely tape all the edges
and<00:02:34.450> be<00:02:34.690> sure<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.900> tape<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.410> top<00:02:35.650> smaller<00:02:36.400> than

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
and be sure to tape the top smaller than

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.720 
and be sure to tape the top smaller than
the<00:02:37.000> frame<00:02:37.300> we<00:02:37.630> built<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.140> idea<00:02:38.470> is<00:02:38.709> for<00:02:39.640> the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
the frame we built the idea is for the

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.630 
the frame we built the idea is for the
frame<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.270> fit<00:02:40.450> over<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:41.620> pegboard<00:02:42.040> holes

you can use just about anything to make
a<00:02:47.620> form<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.310> could<00:02:48.459> use<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.670> styrofoam<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:49.930> cut

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
a form you could use a styrofoam and cut

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.410 
a form you could use a styrofoam and cut
a<00:02:50.319> shape<00:02:50.650> out<00:02:50.920> of<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.190> you<00:02:51.310> could<00:02:51.459> use<00:02:51.490> a<00:02:51.670> little

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
a shape out of it you could use a little

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.570 
a shape out of it you could use a little
bit<00:02:52.510> heavier<00:02:52.870> duty<00:02:53.230> urethane<00:02:53.800> foam<00:02:54.190> and

actually mold something out of that you

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.670 
actually mold something out of that you
could<00:02:57.490> use<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:57.670> form<00:02:58.000> out<00:02:58.209> of<00:02:58.240> some<00:02:58.510> toys<00:02:58.810> form

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
could use a form out of some toys form
