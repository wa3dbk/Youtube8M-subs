00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.680
armful of love from MÃ¼tevazi Lezzetler kitchen

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.920
in this episode we will prepare a regional flavor

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.440
"Kilis Kebab"

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.960
but let's learn the ingredients list first

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.480
400 gram chop meat

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.760
1 teaglass bread crumps

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.280
3 eggplants

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.560
3 - 4 tomato

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.560
2 pepper

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.640
1 onion

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.680
half tablespoon pepper paste and half table spoon tomato paste

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.960
4 tablespoon sunflower oil

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.960
black pepper

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.920
and salt

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.760
after ingredients list...

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.360
we start with peeling and chopping the eggplants

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.120
we always peel eggplants striped...

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.000
but in this recipe we will peel fully

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.480
now we cut eggplants lengthwise to four first

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.200
after that, we chop two fingers width

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.960
and we put it into salt water we prepared for half hour

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.080
while bitter taste of eggplants coming out, let'S continue with kneading meatballs

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.840
we transfer chop meat to kneading bowl

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.800
add bread crumps...

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.720
about half tablespoon salt...

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.040
about 1 teaspoon black pepper onto it 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.040
we knead until it concreted

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.760
filling concreted

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.680
now we can give shapes

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.840
we will make balls smaller than walnut and a little bigger than hazelnut

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.920
actually in origina recipe; it is aligned as one eggplant slice and one meatball 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.000
and cooked in grill, we make like this to become practical

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.040
and we will cook in oven

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.600
after giving shapes to meatballs...

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.240
we put aside the eggplants...

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.960
which we waited in salt water and filtered

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.600
now we put the tray into oven we heated before in 200 degree

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.080
cook 20 - 25 minutes

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.840
let's chop onion while meatballs and eggplants cooking

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.720
we chop onion thinly

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.880
let's chop peppers too

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.360
after peppers, let's chop tomatoes we peeled before

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.720
don't chop too thinly

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.240
we leave oil to cooker

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.240
after it warmed up a little we add onion

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.560
and cook until they became transparent

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.960
let's add pepper and tomato paste

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.440
let's turn it a few minutes until scent of tomato paste gone

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.640
now let's add pepper

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.200
we can add salt too

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.760
and black pepper

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.360
after peppers became yellow we can add tomatoes

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:33.560
we will cook with lid until tomatoes lost their shapes

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.000
yes, tomatoes lost their shapes

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.840
and became watery a little , but we add...

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.760
about one waterglass hot water 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.920
we add cooked meatballs first into boiling sauce...

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.960
then we add eggplants

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
mix in this way

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.040
we will close the lid, we can take from fire 5 - 6 minutes later

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.880
Kilis Kebab cooked, we took it to service plate

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.600
now we can take it to table

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.600
in this episode of Mutevazi Lezzetler, we shared a regional flavor

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.520
"Kilis Kebab"

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.840
it became very healthy and delicious kebab

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.840
hopefully you try as soon as possible and remember us

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.200
