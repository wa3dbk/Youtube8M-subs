00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
once that's all mixed together you just

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.690 
once that's all mixed together you just
need<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.980> pour<00:02:28.980> into<00:02:29.129> your<00:02:29.310> food<00:02:29.459> processor

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
need to pour into your food processor

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.690 
need to pour into your food processor
and<00:02:30.299> keep<00:02:30.989> a<00:02:31.079> long<00:02:31.440> steady<00:02:31.769> stream<00:02:32.220> but<00:02:32.400> pulse

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
and keep a long steady stream but pulse

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.309 
and keep a long steady stream but pulse
at<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.120> same<00:02:33.299> time<00:02:33.569> until<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:33.959> clumps

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
at the same time until it clumps

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.060 
at the same time until it clumps
together

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.160 

all<00:02:41.070> right<00:02:41.160> so<00:02:41.370> my<00:02:41.550> dough<00:02:42.150> has<00:02:42.450> come<00:02:42.990> together

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
all right so my dough has come together

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.780 
all right so my dough has come together
in<00:02:43.620> kind<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.160> clumps

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
in kind of clumps

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.010 
in kind of clumps
so<00:02:45.180> I'm<00:02:45.270> now<00:02:45.360> just<00:02:45.450> going<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.690> turn<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:45.990> out

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
so I'm now just going to turn it out

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.390 
so I'm now just going to turn it out
into<00:02:46.260> my<00:02:46.380> work<00:02:46.560> top<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:46.980> can<00:02:47.100> use<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.250> big

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.710 
into my work top you can use a big
chopping<00:02:47.670> board<00:02:47.850> if<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:47.970> don't<00:02:48.090> want<00:02:48.210> to<00:02:48.270> make

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
chopping board if you don't want to make

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.930

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
one solid thing and then just give it a

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:09.170 
one solid thing and then just give it a
really<00:03:02.010> brief<00:03:02.460> need<00:03:07.640> now<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.670> just<00:03:08.790> need<00:03:09.030> to

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
really brief need now I just need to

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.730 
really brief need now I just need to
chill<00:03:09.420> this<00:03:09.630> for<00:03:09.840> about<00:03:09.900> 15<00:03:10.140> minutes<00:03:10.620> I'm

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
chill this for about 15 minutes I'm

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.290 
chill this for about 15 minutes I'm
going<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:10.950> split<00:03:11.130> it<00:03:11.310> into<00:03:11.430> two<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:11.970> it's<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.150> bit

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
going to split it into two so it's a bit

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.570 
going to split it into two so it's a bit
smaller<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:12.840> easier<00:03:13.050> to<00:03:13.080> work<00:03:13.200> with<00:03:13.430> wrap<00:03:14.430> it

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
smaller and easier to work with wrap it

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.740 
smaller and easier to work with wrap it
in<00:03:14.670> cling<00:03:14.700> film<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.240> pop<00:03:15.420> it<00:03:15.510> in<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.630> fridge

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
in cling film and pop it in the fridge

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.780 
in cling film and pop it in the fridge
for<00:03:15.780> 15<00:03:15.990> minutes<00:03:16.440> give<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.250> little<00:03:17.370> smash

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
for 15 minutes give it a little smash

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.160 
for 15 minutes give it a little smash
down<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:18.540> that<00:03:18.690> it's<00:03:18.840> easier<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.470> roll<00:03:19.710> out<00:03:19.740> I

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170
