00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.449
 9 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.449
 you 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.449

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:04.270
 far shots we need them 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.270
 being turbidity 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.729
 It's a good map for far shots 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.120
 collar I think it 's that map only worth 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.120
 for that 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.780
 I'm missing a shovel 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.780
 a bloodthirsty 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.870
 this was I was thinking that I say that 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.990
 Give a little straw 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.699
 rachid to say here the most 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.430
 bloodthirsty is that we're just going to the 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:42.630
 departure 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:45.620
 well I think that if he has given me of him 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.620
 Progress 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:54.119
 from our xp come rum and I already 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:56.990
 we had and the double meanness that we have 

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:59.810
 done at the beginning of the game 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.910
 this we already have two admired of ten 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.940
 seminars come back and we have five left 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:07.280
 low and five losses without advantages and without 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.160
 accessories and zero curious distant shots 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.920
 but we need turbine or some map of 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.060
 these five casualties without accessories 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.590

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.510
 five losses with the class without advantages and 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.640
 accessories and we will look for the 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.200
 far shots and the bloodthirsty and already 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.760

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.590
