00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.509
 Good day to all you are 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.490
 on yutuber channel my name is joe paradise i 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.650
 prepared for you another program 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.570
 for android this program is needed to 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.660
 block unwanted inbox 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.100
 calls and according to the message if 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.529
 my english is just a little bit 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.539
 like real pronunciation here 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.180
 this phrase is a program 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.949
 called background varic open it and already 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.170
 we will look before us appeared 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.240
 all sorts of numbers this is on the call log then 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.279
 there is where we called who called us 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.050
 last time and so on can 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.120
 block right from here any 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.879
 number but i want to show you others 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.070
 ways are they present here and let's 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.500
 let's see you need to click on the running 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.360
 a man with a spear is in the top 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.280
 the left corner here it appears here 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.510
 This menu and we are interested in the tab 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.250
 blacklist 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.230
 here in theory there will be all the numbers 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.449
 which are blacklisted and 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.520
 now no so let's add 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.250
 one of them and try to call 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.960
 Of course we will check the performance 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.329
 try to call let's add 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.100
 any number this is exactly that pro 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.140
 what I told you you can take 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.420
 number from the contact by can add it 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.060
 manually you can take it from inbox 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.250
 sms or from the same call log 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.439
 which we saw at the very beginning 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.540
 let's use this list 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.850
 contacts because it's easiest and 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.920
 we are very fit we need to choose from 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.229
 contacts some number which we 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.689
 want to block and for example let 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.909
 this will be mom number nothing personal 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.530
 just phones and i'm here at hand 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.930
 and we can test 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.820
 so choose it appears such 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.070
 window where we need to choose what 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.500
 we want to block everything completely 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.040
 either only with s or only calls 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.320
 let's choose the full package and try 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.329
 already and so we made our contact black 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.210
 the list is now from this number no one 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.399
 can call us and send sms 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.530
 but he can send a text message to us 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.299
 it will not reach also black 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.370
 list if you want my look 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.560
 read but her eyes callus to us already 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.080
 won't let's try to call with 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:10.170
 of this number to my number accordingly 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:12.570
 as we can see the incoming call is seen 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.150
 before the call came in half a second and right there 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.860
 no ringing sound was dropped i'm even 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.870
 not heard let's try again 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.880
 again he just threw off the challenge and i even 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.650
 didn't notice anything if the phone was in 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.420
 in my pocket I would not even know that someone 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.550
 called let's see how will 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.490
 I am already blocked from SMS 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:36.410
 prepared a text message here with the word hello 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.900
 and let's try to send it 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:45.000
 being sent we are waiting 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:48.810
 waiting for what will be a message left on 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.820
 how much did I understand so the message came 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.640
 mom writes hi 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.700
 strange I conclude that this program 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.430
 does not block sms messages in free 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.170
 versions possible in paid it blocks 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.959
 but not going to buy anything not 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.840
 just so much so but if you want 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.720
 use this as call blocker 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.940
 then it works very well you yourself 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.730
 saw it perfectly blocks incoming 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.010
 challenges and know what to tell you i think in 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.530
 future and be sure to find free 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.290
 an application that blocks exactly with m 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.270
 with on all friends put your fingers on top 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.400
 thumbs down at your will 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.800
 but just be sure to subscribe to 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.080
