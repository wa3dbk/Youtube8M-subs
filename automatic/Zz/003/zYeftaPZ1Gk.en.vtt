but<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> main<00:01:28.439> basis<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> episode<00:01:29.640> is

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
but the main basis of the episode is

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.880 
but the main basis of the episode is
that<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> lot<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:30.990> characters<00:01:31.439> are<00:01:31.590> returning

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
that a lot of characters are returning

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.350 
that a lot of characters are returning
from<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.250> mission<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.790> they<00:01:32.939> decide<00:01:33.210> they're

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
from a mission and they decide they're

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.969 
from a mission and they decide they're
going<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.630> go<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.960> bathhouse<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.619> recover

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
it's sort of a parallel to it but we'll

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.230 
it's sort of a parallel to it but we'll
get<00:02:05.100> into<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.340> stuff<00:02:05.729> later

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
was really ready to hate this episode

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.770 
was really ready to hate this episode
but<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.459> know<00:04:14.579> what<00:04:14.790> I<00:04:14.940> think<00:04:15.030> this<00:04:15.419> one<00:04:15.599> was

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
but you know what I think this one was

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.659 
but you know what I think this one was
better<00:04:16.019> than<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.349> very<00:04:16.560> first<00:04:16.889> tie<00:04:17.160> into<00:04:17.489> road

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
better than the very first tie into road

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:18.199 
better than the very first tie into road
to<00:04:17.849> ninja

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
to ninja

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.449 
to ninja
this<00:04:18.720> one<00:04:18.900> felt<00:04:19.169> like<00:04:19.470> it<00:04:19.650> flowed<00:04:19.979> into<00:04:20.250> the

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
this one felt like it flowed into the

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.039 
this one felt like it flowed into the
movie<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:20.789> lot<00:04:21.000> better<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.539> other<00:04:21.690> one

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
movie a lot better and the other one

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.350 
movie a lot better and the other one
just<00:04:22.229> like<00:04:22.319> I<00:04:22.440> kept<00:04:22.680> asking<00:04:22.800> myself<00:04:23.069> what<00:04:23.520> huh

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
just like I kept asking myself what huh

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.850 
just like I kept asking myself what huh
this<00:04:24.960> makes<00:04:25.199> no<00:04:25.349> sense

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
this makes no sense

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.129 
this makes no sense
also<00:04:26.520> this<00:04:26.789> was<00:04:26.970> a<00:04:27.000> pretty<00:04:27.270> well<00:04:27.539> animated

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
also this was a pretty well animated

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.719 
also this was a pretty well animated
episode<00:04:28.500> I'm<00:04:28.650> not<00:04:28.800> saying<00:04:29.099> like<00:04:29.340> it's<00:04:29.580> the

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
episode I'm not saying like it's the

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.490 
episode I'm not saying like it's the
best<00:04:30.000> thing<00:04:30.180> in<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.330> world<00:04:30.449> or<00:04:30.900> anything<00:04:31.080> but

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
best thing in the world or anything but

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.159 
best thing in the world or anything but
for<00:04:32.159> an<00:04:32.220> average<00:04:32.460> episode<00:04:32.879> it<00:04:33.569> was<00:04:33.750> pretty

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
for an average episode it was pretty

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.930 
for an average episode it was pretty
good<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:34.740> it<00:04:34.919> was<00:04:35.069> definitely<00:04:35.520> better<00:04:35.699> than

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
good and it was definitely better than

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.360 
good and it was definitely better than
some<00:04:36.150> of<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.330> canon<00:04:36.720> episodes<00:04:37.169> i've<00:04:37.379> seen<00:04:37.650> you

if you haven't seen a road to ninja I

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:48.680 
if you haven't seen a road to ninja I
would<00:04:47.520> actually<00:04:47.789> watch<00:04:47.970> this<00:04:48.180> maybe<00:04:48.419> right

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
would actually watch this maybe right

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.999 
would actually watch this maybe right
before<00:04:49.020> he<00:04:49.110> walks<00:04:49.349> that<00:04:49.530> it<00:04:49.740> might<00:04:49.889> actually

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
before he walks that it might actually

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.339 
before he walks that it might actually
help<00:04:50.370> a<00:04:50.490> little<00:04:50.610> bit<00:04:50.819> and<00:04:51.030> maybe<00:04:51.930> even<00:04:52.199> watch

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
help a little bit and maybe even watch

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.379 
help a little bit and maybe even watch
that<00:04:52.379> other<00:04:52.770> road<00:04:53.400> to<00:04:53.520> Sakura<00:04:53.909> episode

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
that other road to Sakura episode

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:55.820 
that other road to Sakura episode
because<00:04:54.569> everything<00:04:54.960> does<00:04:55.169> sort<00:04:55.409> of<00:04:55.500> tie<00:04:55.650> in

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
because everything does sort of tie in

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.080 
because everything does sort of tie in
now<00:04:56.009> you<00:04:56.069> see<00:04:56.400> all<00:04:56.430> these<00:04:56.639> things<00:04:56.909> together

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
now you see all these things together

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.180 
now you see all these things together
and<00:04:57.389> it<00:04:57.509> is<00:04:57.629> pretty<00:04:57.900> interesting<00:04:58.110> I<00:04:58.590> mean<00:04:59.039> it

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
and it is pretty interesting I mean it

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.740 
and it is pretty interesting I mean it
is<00:04:59.340> all<00:04:59.520> filler<00:04:59.759> but<00:05:00.000> you<00:05:00.120> know<00:05:00.210> take<00:05:00.449> it<00:05:00.569> for

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
is all filler but you know take it for

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.100 
is all filler but you know take it for
what<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:00.930> is

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
what it is

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.839 
what it is
so<00:05:01.800> I'm<00:05:02.129> actually<00:05:02.280> going<00:05:02.580> to<00:05:02.639> get<00:05:02.759> this

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849 
so I'm actually going to get this

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:04.969 
so I'm actually going to get this
episode<00:05:03.270> a<00:05:03.300> 9<00:05:03.599> out<00:05:03.840> of<00:05:03.870> 10<00:05:04.199> I'd<00:05:04.650> give<00:05:04.710> it<00:05:04.919> a

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
episode a 9 out of 10 I'd give it a

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.770 
episode a 9 out of 10 I'd give it a
higher<00:05:05.159> score<00:05:05.520> if<00:05:05.789> a<00:05:05.909> little<00:05:06.180> bit<00:05:06.270> more<00:05:06.449> happen

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
higher score if a little bit more happen

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.619 
higher score if a little bit more happen
than<00:05:06.930> just<00:05:07.080> a<00:05:07.199> giant<00:05:07.500> hot<00:05:07.680> springs<00:05:08.009> adventure

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:08.629 
than just a giant hot springs adventure

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:11.270 
than just a giant hot springs adventure
but<00:05:09.629> still<00:05:09.960> this<00:05:10.289> was<00:05:10.409> a<00:05:10.440> pretty<00:05:10.710> good<00:05:10.860> tie<00:05:11.069> in

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
but still this was a pretty good tie in

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.860 
but still this was a pretty good tie in
and<00:05:11.430> like<00:05:11.550> I<00:05:11.639> said<00:05:11.699> I<00:05:12.030> think<00:05:12.509> a<00:05:12.539> much<00:05:12.719> better

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
and like I said I think a much better

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.480 
and like I said I think a much better
time<00:05:13.139> than<00:05:13.409> the<00:05:13.500> first<00:05:13.530> world<00:05:13.919> into<00:05:14.219> episode

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
time than the first world into episode

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.689 
time than the first world into episode
so<00:05:14.940> 9<00:05:15.629> out<00:05:15.780> of<00:05:15.870> 10<00:05:16.050> check<00:05:16.319> it<00:05:16.440> out<00:05:16.530> guys<00:05:16.740> so<00:05:17.580> did
