00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.190
 this time we are going to the islands 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.360
 canary completely santa cruz de 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.250
 tenerife tacoronte I do not know it but yes 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.500
 I know there are great people like 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.440
 embodies and her sister peeling which has 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.050
 made one of my coquinas recipes in 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.840
 sauce but she made it with mussels 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.879
 I feel obliged to do something 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.910
 that land that can not be anything else 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.750
 that mojo picÃ³n we already know that there are many 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.780
 variants 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.379
 this time I will do as the cousin told me 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.699
 embodies and bill and benedicta I dedicate it 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.699
 to these three people 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.330
 here is the question of mojo the 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.790
 spicy I have three variants the 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.630
 chilli or cayena this other that is the 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.980
 pepper picona dry but incredibly 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:04.130
 I got a pepper spike now from the 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.960
 natural palm I could not get with 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.960
 which makes the potatoes wrinkled 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.850
 so I'll use these little ones that 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.450
 they will know more quickly the mojo elaborate 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.600
 hot pepper with garlic cloves to 6 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.060
 paprika taste of course of the vera 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.670
 olive oil half a spoonful of 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.100
 cumin salt a red pepper that 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.650
 incorporate e at the end to do both 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.170
 types of mojo picÃ³n that I will make and vinegar 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.270
 clean the potatoes well with a cloth that 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.270
 I have reserved only for vegetables 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.490
 in a pot I put the potatoes and I've 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:46.250
 I miss a little less than half the water 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.460
 height of potatoes and I have salt 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.460
 fat woman 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.340
 cut the garlic into pieces the smallest 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.340
 possible to make it easier for me 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.649
 crush so they do not go away I made 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.979
 an improvisation by cutting a lid 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.660
 plastic making such a hole 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.210
 way that garlic will not come out 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.780
 I forgot to say that you also 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.240
 They usually toss toasted bread or fried cut 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.810
 the pepper pikes in half and you 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.170
 remove the seeds although it is not seen I tried 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.560
 a bit and I know why it's called 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.560
 up to the mother 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:48.660
 I throw a well-filled teaspoon of 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:52.080
 sweet spicy paprika to taste in a 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.989
 150 milliliter glass I throw a part 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.440
 of vinegar for three of oil but what 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:02.000
 better is to eye according to thickness and taste of 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.000
 vinegar or oil you want 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.939
 and we keep beating 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.140
 they also usually throw toast or 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.140
 fried in pan with oil 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.660
 so the father or the mother of the 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.120
 because we are going to chop 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.390
 the other way is by placing a pepper 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.910
 red in this way the 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.880
 volume of the mojo and also lowers 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.400
 a little bit that bit too much we cut 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.870
 we remove the seeds and the target of 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.870
 inside so that it does not bitter 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.180
 we toss the mojo and the red pepper in a 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.760
 glass if you want thinner you beat a lot 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.420
 or you can also strain with a Chinese or 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.420
 pasapurÃ© 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.340
 the potatoes as you see evaporated all the 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.100
 water then I set the fire to 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.459
 maximum and I gave him some movements so that 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.880
 they will wrinkle a little here it looks like 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.420
 has grabbed the salt to the potatoes color 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.910
 a little white 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.350
 Cut some potatoes in half and 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.060
 I took the mojo 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.010
 the remaining mucus hit him in a 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.240
 recipient to be served one at 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.400
 taste 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.310
 it came out rich and it lowered a little 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.710
 spicy when you pepper it I hope you 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.590
 I liked to click on the finger if 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.800
 It was correct and you liked it and you can
