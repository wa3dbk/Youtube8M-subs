00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.300
 wanted to see the compact are up 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.070
 in the market that you already know but why 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.719
 Are they so successful? 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.490
 do they deliver much more than 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.780
 the traditional medium sedans 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.600
 that's what we'll find out now 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.000
 in the car online we put together a new 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.580
 leader of the round utilities category 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.780
 hgv and his civic cousin 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.380
 both are in their versions 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.989
 this intermediate x LXR 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.149
 setting the hgv and three thousand reais more 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.609
 expensive and the insurance quote also weighs 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.440
 more in the consumer's pocket but the total 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:43.320
 the first three revisions is 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.670
 strictly the same in those versions 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.620
 the two have a level of 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.390
 practically equal equipment 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.719
 they have stability controls and 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.609
 power steering traction air conditioning 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.460
 multimedia central trio with 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.839
 autopilot usb or steering wheel input 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.809
 multifunctional with 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.350
 isofix preparation depth and camera 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.239
 back 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.640
 the hgv and stands out by the brake of 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.680
 electric parking and brick function 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.360
 road that dispenses the pedal pressure 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.579
 brake when the car is stopped 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.920
 if not cost benefit, the two are almost 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.610
 equal in size they continue 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.610
 look alike 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.780
 the civic features a wheelbase 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.420
 five centimeters larger than hr ver 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.640
 which is roughly the same width 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.170
 but hgv can still accommodate 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.880
 better people 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.549
 so much that the sum of the measures 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.890
 inside it is higher than in the civic 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.659
 the reason is the more vertical layout 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.630
 of seats that increases the comfort both 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.460
 for the legs and for the head and this 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.830
 also makes it easier to enter and exit 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.630
 because it requires less effort and the 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.030
 larger videos they also increase the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.740
 sense of space here inside the cabin 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.350
 the civic carrier according to the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.509
 technique is also larger but the difference 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.700
 does not reach 10 liters capacity 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.100
 This does not mean that it is more 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:12.690
 consumer friendly because access to 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:15.480
 it is less comfortable than in hmv in 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.120
 hr see the trunk is a little more 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.890
 the top of the luggage compartment door gives access to the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.769
 which makes it much easier to use 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.410
 of the space with the folded seats 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.239
 in addition they rebound and stay in the 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.299
 height of the floor forming a 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.690
 flat surface is at the wheel that the 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.010
 proposal of the two is enough distance 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.320
 possible that it delivers a more 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.660
 sports the driver to accommodate a 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.060
 slightly below the legs and the 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.950
 more inclined backs for those who like 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.680
 of a more emotive driving it 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.930
 will certainly please even more 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.280
 performance of the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.090
 motor 2.0 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.209
 are 155 horses working with exchange 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.310
 five-speed automatic transmission and 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.980
 siv cabin that it transmits a 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.359
 environment even higher than the 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.519
 hiv 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:08.280
 the hiv view has a simpler cabin 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.780
 even though the finish is well done 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.670
 the problem is the onboard computer 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.680
 because it only provides the most 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.519
 that any popular it costs 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.230
 50 thousand reais less has someone from hgv 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.810
 it is clear that he targets a more 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.870
 comprehensive approach to driving is 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.120
 high and more vertical it passes a 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.250
 greater sense of security and a 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.409
 greater car control also up to 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.549
 on account of the visibility that is best 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.900
 than in the civic 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.290
 for performance 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.400
 it has a good power- to-weight ratio 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.079
 but I feel like I'm missing a bit of 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.670
 touch him are 17.4 pounds but at the time 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.220
 but he suffers a little in the hour of 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.620
 to pack the car nothing that would 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.689
 pleasure to drive because in fact in the 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.629
 acceleration test from 0 to 100 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.909
 kilometers per hour it was only less than 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.519
 a second slower than the civic 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.439
 even with the difference in performance the 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.590
 level of consumption of the two is practically 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:08.190
 equal to an average of 8.2 kilometers per 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.319
 liter in the hmv and 8.1 of the civic 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.659
 both with ethanol in mixed route of 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.459
 city ​​and road although at the 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.799
 pencil it may be a little more 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.539
 advantageous that the hiv is no longer 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.410
 difficult to understand his success in 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.880
 Marketplace 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.100
 the wave managed to extract the whole 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.710
 potential a space still offering 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.720
 more versatility a smaller platform 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.970
 that it is possible that all this in the package 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.740
 more compact and yummy to guide
