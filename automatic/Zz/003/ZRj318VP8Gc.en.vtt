00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.920
 design that is perfect to use it 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.289
 in autumn because they have the colors 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.240
 autumnal but also has a very touch 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.130

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.260
 how to draw is very easy it looks very 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.030
 elaborated but the truth is very easy 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.860
 I will explain them step by step to 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.989
 that they do and they will see that they will be able to 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.390
 do it and they will not fight a 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.670
 little bit good if they want to learn to 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.200
 make this cute design stay with 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.280
 me and we go with the tutorial 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:53.470
 for this tutorial we will need enamel 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:57.940
 transparent white coffee or dark gold 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:02.630
 green dark orange dark green 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.000
 black chopsticks and a thin brush 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.190
 you have to buy one i use this 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.590
 brush of a liquid eyeliner that 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.810
 I ended up just clean very well the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.360
 brush with olive oil and you have 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.090
 your brush to decorate your nails so 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.040
 easy the first thing we will do is put 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.290
 a layer of transparent enamel for 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.840
 protect our nails and we hope that 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.630
 dry very well 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.659
 then we will put two layers of enamel 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.640
 white on all our nails waits for 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.960
 that the first layer dries very well 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.960
 before applying the second 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.530
 then with the brush we will take a little 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:45.109
 the brown or gold enamel and we will make a 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.780
 little leaf on the index finger of the next 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:49.789
 way we make a small line and 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.459
 then one inclined on each side 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.920
 then a horizontal on each side and 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:57.380
 finally we will make a line 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.450
 thin under the leaf so that 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.569
 be the stem of the leaf after 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.479
 we will take light green enamel and we will 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:07.939
 a normal leaf just slides the brush 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.050
 curving it a bit and make a line 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:14.410
 thin below to make the stem 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.390
 then with orange enamel we will make 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.940
 a leaf following the steps that 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.850
 we use to make the coffee leaf you make 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.770
 a vertical line one inclined and then 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.070
 a horizontal and a line to make the 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.070
 stem 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.440
 then with the brush we will take enamel 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.660
 dark green and we will make a little leaf 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.820
 following the steps we use to 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.400
 make the green leaf we slide the 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.420
 brush curving it and we put a line 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.420
 thin for the stem 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.430
 and with orange enamel we will make some 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.590
 curved lines to simulate more leaves 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.719
 draw the ones where you want 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.730
 these little leaves will help us to give the 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:00.730
 effect of many falling leaves 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.780
 draw the leaves on the thumb 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.060
 index and little finger or little finger in 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.610
 our middle finger let's draw to 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.920
 our nice little fox first 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.650
 we will draw the head of the fox 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.890
 we will put an orange line in the 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.650
 center of our nail later we will do 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.980
 some lines curved in this way will go 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.350
 from the center of the nail outwards 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.290
 then we will lengthen the line we made 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.120
 in the center to the sides and 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.150
 we will fill everything with color 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.070
 orange leaves a small space between 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.140
 the borders of tuÃ±a and the color 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.220
 orange to show through the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.220
 cheeks of the fox 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.120
 two 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.430
 now we will draw two triangles 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.879
 above the little head to do their 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.879
 ears 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:05.060
 then we will make a curved line for 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:07.670
 make your chin and from below we will make two 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.220
 chubby lines with orange so that 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.580
 appear your little body leaves a space 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.700
 white in the middle to be your pechito 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.430
 then with a toothpick we will take enamel 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.760
 black and we'll make two dots to make 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.690
 the eyes and one in the middle below for 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.360
 make your nose 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.060
 and on the edge of our nail we will do 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.870
 three dots on each side to simulate 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.170
 the fingers of his paws 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.780
 then with gray color enamel we will 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.620
 a small triangle in each ear for 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:45.949
 make them look more detailed and real 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.350
 now we will draw the fluffy tail of 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:51.229
 our fox with orange enamel 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.139
 we will make two curved lines that join 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:57.440
 at a tip at the top to 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.540
 make a very fluffy tail 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.100
 and we will fill it with enamel 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.370
 orange 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:09.620
 then with white enamel we will paint the 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.620
 tip of the tail in this way 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:22.210
 and so we finished our cute little fox 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.210
 or ternurite 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:29.000
 finally we will apply a layer of 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.160
 Transparent base on our nails for 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.770
 that last us longer and have a 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:38.990
 cute shine and ready 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.660
 it's that easy we have a beautiful design 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.340
 perfect for autumn and with a touch of 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:48.970
 lindura thanks to our friendly 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.970
 zorrito di bye fox goodbye 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.210
 As you can see, it is very easy to do 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.700
 true if you take a little time but it's worth 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.070
 It's a shame because this cute little fox is going 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:03.010
 to see very beautiful in her nails and unveil 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.950

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.560

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.390
 It looks very elaborate but with the steps that 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.150
 I explained to them I hope I made them 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.730
