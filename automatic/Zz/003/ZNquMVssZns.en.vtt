00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.540
 important for any kind of 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.719
 makeup I am going to be born 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.849
 neil art a basic makeup with your 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.760
 favorite glaze make a very good 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.740
 cleaning then step on a file leave 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.720
 even to your nails as you like later 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.579
 of this they spend with alcohol a cloth and 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.040
 you clean them very well from all the fat 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:31.099
 that accumulate in the corners in 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.190
 the cuticle and in the end use a base 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.809
 appropriate for your nails if they are 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.329
 crisp xixon grooved as a 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:42.000
 strengthening base to make the 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:45.050
 makeup last much longer 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.910
 for our third design we are going to do 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.060
 one of the favorites at this time and 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.040
 they are the whiskers 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.900
 for this case we will use all the 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.130
 light tones that brings us from meeting in 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.430
 this collection 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:03.330
 the second step of this design is to make 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.040
 two points followed in each nail I use 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.520
 this tool that is a embossers 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.780
 of card but you can use a 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.090
 spheres or these hair clips 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.670
 to finish our mustache I'm going to 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.070
 get my most skinny brush I have 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.510
 and I'm going to make some arcs around 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.510
 the points I made 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.790
 from outside the point you make 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.790
 one with the point 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.990
 if it happens to them that they spend the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.890
 enamel fell out of space can 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.890
 make a correction 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.670
 with the background color 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.299
 above all very good this design I 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.719
 I wanted to add something very interesting and 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.020
 is this enamel so amazing that it has 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.020
 reason 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.340
 with very very beautiful colors 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.209
 and finally remember to apply the 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.940
 shine very carefully so that all 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.750
 the tones that in well placed and 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.750
 brilliant
