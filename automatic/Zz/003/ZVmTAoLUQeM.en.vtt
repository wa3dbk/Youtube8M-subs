00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.929 
inside pictures of a I don't know it
looks<00:01:48.810> like<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.259> tank<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.700> lot<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.850> people

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
looks like a tank that a lot of people

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.999 
looks like a tank that a lot of people
in<00:01:51.149> talking<00:01:51.540> about<00:01:51.750> before<00:01:52.020> these<00:01:52.409> pictures

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
in talking about before these pictures

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.249 
in talking about before these pictures
in<00:01:53.159> came<00:01:53.340> out<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.759> looks<00:01:53.939> as<00:01:54.060> if<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.479> don't

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
in came out but it looks as if I don't

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.990 
in came out but it looks as if I don't
know<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.500> looks<00:01:56.070> like<00:01:56.189> there's<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.460> gun<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:56.640> top

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
know it looks like there's a gun on top

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.469 
know it looks like there's a gun on top
but<00:01:57.210> then<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.899> more<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.200> look<00:01:58.820> it<00:01:59.820> might<00:02:00.329> not

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
but then the more you look it might not

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.090 
but then the more you look it might not
be<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.689> I'm<00:02:01.049> pretty<00:02:01.350> sure<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.710> though<00:02:01.890> and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
be a I'm pretty sure it is though and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.789 
be a I'm pretty sure it is though and
the<00:02:02.759> helicopter<00:02:03.110> looks<00:02:04.110> as<00:02:04.259> if<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.530> doesn't

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
the helicopter looks as if it doesn't

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.389 
the helicopter looks as if it doesn't
really<00:02:04.920> have<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:06.290> gun<00:02:07.290> on<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.619> which<00:02:07.950> could

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
really have a gun on it which could

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.920 
really have a gun on it which could
possibly<00:02:08.910> mean<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.479> they're<00:02:10.319> going<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
possibly mean that they're going to

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:12.910 
possibly mean that they're going to
that<00:02:12.109> they're<00:02:12.260> going<00:02:12.379> to<00:02:12.469> be<00:02:12.620> just<00:02:12.799> for

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
that they're going to be just for

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.429 
that they're going to be just for
transporting<00:02:13.489> people<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.090> another<00:02:14.780> rumor<00:02:15.260> is

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
transporting people and another rumor is

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:16.300 
transporting people and another rumor is
that<00:02:15.469> the<00:02:15.680> maps<00:02:15.890> are<00:02:16.010> going<00:02:16.159> to<00:02:16.219> be

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
that the maps are going to be

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.729 
that the maps are going to be
significantly<00:02:16.909> bigger<00:02:17.090> just<00:02:17.420> like

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
significantly bigger just like

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.390 
significantly bigger just like
battlefield<00:02:18.739> 3<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:20.950> that's<00:02:21.950> something<00:02:22.280> to

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
battlefield 3 so that's something to

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.890 
battlefield 3 so that's something to
definitely<00:02:22.670> keep<00:02:23.209> in<00:02:23.450> mind<00:02:25.269> it<00:02:26.269> goes<00:02:26.450> over<00:02:26.629> all

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
more sales just because it doesn't have

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.939 
more sales just because it doesn't have
