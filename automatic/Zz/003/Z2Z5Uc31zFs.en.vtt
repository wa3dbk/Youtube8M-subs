this way you can see this is all about

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.109 
this way you can see this is all about
mathematics<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.659> have<00:01:39.869> up<00:01:40.229> down<00:01:40.799> up<00:01:41.220> down

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
mathematics you have up down up down

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.030 
mathematics you have up down up down
Mountain<00:01:42.540> Valley<00:01:42.780> Mountain<00:01:43.020> Valley<00:01:43.530> Mountain

Mountain Valley Mountain Valley Mountain

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.749 
Mountain Valley Mountain Valley Mountain
Valley<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:45.390> only<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:46.530> way<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.189> have<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.549> do

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
Valley so only this way you have to do

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.999 
Valley so only this way you have to do
if<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.780> do<00:01:49.020> tacos<00:01:50.630> in<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.689> colorful<00:01:52.530> side

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
then you need to do the hot dog on the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.940 
then you need to do the hot dog on the
white<00:01:56.399> side<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.060> will<00:01:57.719> not<00:01:58.020> waste<00:01:58.500> too<00:01:58.920> much

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
white side I will not waste too much

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.840 
white side I will not waste too much
time<00:01:59.159> on<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.909> now<00:02:00.810> we<00:02:01.409> put<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:02.070> paper<00:02:02.430> like

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
time on this now we put this paper like

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.550 
time on this now we put this paper like
this<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:04.380> pull<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:05.210> diagonal<00:02:06.350> pull<00:02:07.350> this

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
this you pull this diagonal pull this

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.270 
this you pull this diagonal pull this
very<00:02:07.890> long<00:02:08.450> diagonal<00:02:09.450> line<00:02:10.020> push<00:02:10.830> push<00:02:11.250> push

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
very long diagonal line push push push

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.309 
very long diagonal line push push push
push<00:02:11.670> push<00:02:12.030> push<00:02:12.420> push

push push push push
naturally<00:02:14.219> it<00:02:14.610> will<00:02:15.110> form<00:02:16.110> these<00:02:16.379> shapes

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
naturally it will form these shapes

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.349 
naturally it will form these shapes
if<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:18.000> cannot<00:02:18.689> push<00:02:19.379> it<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:19.980> it's<00:02:20.700> because

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
if you cannot push it in it's because

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.979 
if you cannot push it in it's because
maybe<00:02:22.109> you<00:02:22.650> didn't<00:02:23.069> put<00:02:23.400> different<00:02:24.390> color<00:02:24.689> of

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.140

and<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:01.349> same<00:03:01.620> thing<00:03:02.010> happened<00:03:02.519> on<00:03:02.639> the<00:03:02.730> left

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
and the same thing happened on the left

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.670 
and the same thing happened on the left
side<00:03:03.540> in<00:03:04.169> origami<00:03:04.859> is<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:06.439> symmetric<00:03:07.439> it's

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
side in origami is so symmetric it's

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.119 
side in origami is so symmetric it's
always<00:03:08.549> symmetric<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.840> walk<00:03:10.530> on<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:10.950> left

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
always symmetric you walk on the left

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.250 
always symmetric you walk on the left
side<00:03:11.579> and<00:03:11.970> then<00:03:12.239> you<00:03:12.389> need<00:03:12.599> to<00:03:12.720> walk<00:03:12.930> on<00:03:13.109> the

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
side and then you need to walk on the

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.339 
side and then you need to walk on the
right<00:03:13.470> side<00:03:13.859> you<00:03:14.669> walk<00:03:15.030> on<00:03:15.359> the<00:03:15.659> left<00:03:15.900> side

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:23.270 
right side and this one is not exactly
symmetric<00:03:21.479> because<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:22.079> do<00:03:22.260> not<00:03:22.440> lift<00:03:22.919> it<00:03:23.099> up

tip<00:03:55.829> over<00:03:56.760> not<00:03:57.419> too<00:03:58.049> short<00:03:58.379> because<00:03:58.979> if<00:03:59.400> it<00:03:59.609> is

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
tip over not too short because if it is

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.589 
tip over not too short because if it is
too<00:04:00.030> short<00:04:00.299> it<00:04:00.599> will<00:04:00.870> not<00:04:01.109> hold<00:04:02.010> if<00:04:02.699> it<00:04:02.879> is<00:04:03.030> too

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
too short it will not hold if it is too

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.899

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
much it is not pretty so use your common

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:13.580 
much it is not pretty so use your common
sense<00:04:08.939> use<00:04:09.750> your<00:04:10.879> ascetic<00:04:11.879> sense<00:04:12.269> to<00:04:12.930> judge

sense use your ascetic sense to judge

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.370 
sense use your ascetic sense to judge
that<00:04:14.189> is<00:04:14.400> right<00:04:14.759> so<00:04:15.540> when<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.900> pull<00:04:16.199> it<00:04:16.349> back

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
that is right so when you pull it back

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.940 
that is right so when you pull it back
and<00:04:17.690> use<00:04:18.690> your<00:04:18.720> finger<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.979> touch<00:04:20.729> it<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.950> pinch

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
and use your finger to touch it to pinch

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.650 
and use your finger to touch it to pinch
it's<00:04:23.580> very<00:04:24.060> very<00:04:24.599> strong

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
it's very very strong

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.990 
it's very very strong
and<00:04:25.750> then<00:04:25.990> you<00:04:26.170> can<00:04:26.410> put<00:04:26.650> your<00:04:26.980> finger<00:04:27.430> inside

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
and then you can put your finger inside

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.160 
and then you can put your finger inside
to<00:04:28.300> make<00:04:28.510> it<00:04:28.540> loose<00:04:29.200> and<00:04:29.530> comfortable<00:04:29.860> now

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170
