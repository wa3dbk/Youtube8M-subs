 Soon it is well liquefied once 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.739
 that is the ready mass we leave it 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:07.759

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.040
 45 minutes for our stuffed ham 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.690
 and cheese and we started to do first 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.690
 long cuts 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.850

 we put a good fist of grated cheese 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.540
 very little salt because the cheese has the 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.190
 flavor of ham also then little 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.940
 salt and a little bit of pepper two eggs 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.940

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.909
 minimum speed 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.490
 you're only pulling 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.090
 once the mass is resting on the 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.740
 refrigerator 45 minutes 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.130
 we stopped a little in the same pan and 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.920
 where we melted the butter, let's go 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.869
 putting together a small movie 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.530
 over the mass we add it from 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.879
 turn the ladle and there we will cook 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.170
 more or less one minute a minute and a half 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.910

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.470
 combo grill then to use the combo 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.780
 green has the height of the legs of 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.989
 the tray so that it is in less 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.330
 distance the tray of the grill itself is 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.300
 our stuffing and we help each other with a 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.160
 little cold water always cold water 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:16.740
 so that we do not stick everything in the hand 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.740
 we add a little we go to the middle 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.560
