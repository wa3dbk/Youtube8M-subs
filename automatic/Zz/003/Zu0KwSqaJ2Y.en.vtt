that we get to see for two fighters

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.100 
that we get to see for two fighters
fight<00:01:01.890> four<00:01:02.219> times<00:01:02.809> hopefully<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
fight four times hopefully this is the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.560 
fight four times hopefully this is the
last<00:01:04.170> time<00:01:04.619> all<00:01:05.400> fights<00:01:05.820> were<00:01:06.090> all<00:01:06.210> closed

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
last time all fights were all closed

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.800 
last time all fights were all closed
closed<00:01:07.140> fights<00:01:07.909> like<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.060> said<00:01:09.119> before<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.600> happy

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
closed fights like I said before I happy

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.620 
closed fights like I said before I happy
that<00:01:09.930> draw<00:01:10.229> first<00:01:11.130> fight<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.670> consider<00:01:12.510> that

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
that draw first fight I consider that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.530 
that draw first fight I consider that
the<00:01:12.840> draw<00:01:13.400> second<00:01:14.400> fighting<00:01:14.790> pocket<00:01:15.119> one<00:01:15.330> I

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
the draw second fighting pocket one I

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.240 
the draw second fighting pocket one I
think<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.409> knockout<00:01:16.710> was<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> difference

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
think the knockout was a difference

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.800 
think the knockout was a difference
third<00:01:17.460> fighting<00:01:17.880> Marquez<00:01:18.180> what<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.450> think<00:01:18.720> was

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
third fighting Marquez what I think was

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.770 
third fighting Marquez what I think was
that<00:01:19.850> more<00:01:20.850> effective<00:01:21.210> fighting<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.600> fight

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
that more effective fighting that fight

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.890 
that more effective fighting that fight
but<00:01:22.590> for<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.100> for<00:01:23.340> fight<00:01:23.549> whoever<00:01:24.299> wins<00:01:24.570> I

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
but for this for fight whoever wins I

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.859 
but for this for fight whoever wins I
don't<00:01:25.530> really<00:01:25.619> care<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.979> someone<00:01:26.159> wins

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
don't really care of someone wins

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.840 
don't really care of someone wins
decisively<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.259> I've<00:01:28.409> said<00:01:28.590> before<00:01:28.850> or

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
decisively like I've said before or

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.160 
decisively like I've said before or

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
someone gets knocked out I don't really

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.310

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.530 
after the third one so to me this is the
greatest<00:02:16.680> rivalry<00:02:17.680> had<00:02:17.799> seen<00:02:18.329> back<00:02:19.329> in<00:02:19.450> the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
greatest rivalry had seen back in the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.600 
greatest rivalry had seen back in the
day<00:02:19.689> there<00:02:19.959> were<00:02:20.049> fighters<00:02:20.319> that<00:02:20.620> fought<00:02:20.860> it

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
day there were fighters that fought it

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.729 
day there were fighters that fought it
shattered<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.209> much<00:02:22.480> but<00:02:22.810> we<00:02:23.379> don't<00:02:23.560> see

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
shattered this much but we don't see

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.229 
shattered this much but we don't see
that<00:02:23.829> much<00:02:24.010> anymore<00:02:24.069> we<00:02:24.610> don't<00:02:24.790> see<00:02:24.939> that<00:02:25.120> much

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
that much anymore we don't see that much

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.960 
that much anymore we don't see that much
anymore<00:02:25.299> and<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.810> lot<00:02:25.959> of<00:02:25.989> people<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.970> really

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
anymore and a lot of people I really

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.039 
anymore and a lot of people I really
hating<00:02:28.209> on<00:02:28.239> this<00:02:28.390> fight<00:02:28.569> because<00:02:28.720> this

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
hating on this fight because this

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.130 
hating on this fight because this
they're<00:02:29.409> seeing<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.860> for<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.069> fourth<00:02:30.280> time

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
they're seeing it for the fourth time

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.300 
they're seeing it for the fourth time
like<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.260> said<00:02:32.319> I<00:02:32.470> think<00:02:32.530> this<00:02:32.799> fight<00:02:33.010> would<00:02:33.159> be

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
like I said I think this fight would be

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.640 
like I said I think this fight would be
another<00:02:33.519> close<00:02:33.819> fight<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:34.810> probably<00:02:35.409> going<00:02:35.590> to

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
another close fight so probably going to

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.319 
another close fight so probably going to
be<00:02:35.739> like<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.950> replay<00:02:36.370> but<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:36.790> never<00:02:36.970> know<00:02:37.180> what

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
be like a replay but you never know what

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:38.640 
be like a replay but you never know what
will<00:02:37.360> happen<00:02:37.540> in<00:02:37.780> boxing<00:02:38.079> anything<00:02:38.500> can

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
will happen in boxing anything can

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.039 
will happen in boxing anything can
happen<00:02:38.799> and<00:02:39.269> that's<00:02:40.269> one<00:02:40.510> of<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.690> reasons<00:02:40.930> why

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
happen and that's one of the reasons why

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.380 
happen and that's one of the reasons why
I'm<00:02:41.140> excited<00:02:41.590> for<00:02:41.620> this<00:02:41.769> fight<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:45.060> yeah<00:02:46.060> to
