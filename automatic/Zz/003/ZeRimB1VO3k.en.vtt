00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.969
 on 8 point 8 hectares thrive vegetables in the new greenhouse of bio-heat 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.680
 Rinse GmbH about 350000 formats plants 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.830
 In April last year, the construction of the state-of-the-art facility was started and 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.199
 already in January 2010 the first tomatoes were planted 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.970
 Now the new greenhouse plant with an investment of about 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.820
 eleven million euros solemnly opened completely clear that the big Papke the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.339
 Tomato could not be missing 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.839
 In the new greenhouse, three different types of tomatoes are grown 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.329
 the draftsman Reto brand Norton Troester i Unio a tenant and the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.530
 Cocktail tomatoes petition son 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.070
 only the company Lidl is delivered 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.610
 The new facility is six meters high and thus offers enough space for the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.660
 Plants snake upwards 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.020
 Almost 70 employees take care of the proper care 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.860
 from an automatic pallet truck making its way through the tomato rows of webs 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.660
 the works and the rat 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.350
 another employee harvested tomatoes 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.740
 In that regard, and to do so, the entire trott is cut Dr more 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.050
 October despite tomatoes 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.310
 Arno Declair is working now 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.409
 of different 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.200
 essentially that is one 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.400
 The plants not only to the corner and thereby compensate for the side shoots 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.160
 and at home 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.270
 while below the oldest cut off better and also would tire 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.440
 tomatoes 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.160
 Furthermore, workers call to go hanging on a string with one 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.520
 Take a disturbance 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.380
 and everyone will still be drained afterwards why grow and always 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.040
 stronger and fade victim 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.220
 so she changes again 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.520
 12 to 40 meters long 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.680
 a lot of tomato crop 5 5 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.920
 the total production area is 90,000 square meters, which corresponds to approx 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.460
 twelve soccer fields 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.310
 The heat for the plants is from the adjacent biomass heating plant 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.660
 Provided 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.810
 Biowärme Gemüse GmbH expects a total harvest of 2800 this year 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.450
 metric tons 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.909
 This has nothing to do with a greenhouse in the backyard 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.760
 we work there very much on modern percent 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.420
 Of course the technical conditions may well know regulations 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.030
 around the greenhouse is absolutely clean yes that's nothing to do with earlier 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.729
 Compare where you are with watering can or funny would be a change so 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.819
 had to work 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.849
 we cultivate the tomato still open seems extremely rare that they grow 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.590
 So not the ground is also related to that we still there 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.739
 So ensuring optimal account management can be disease free 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.629
 also refrain from the use of chemical pesticides 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.819
 actually an idyllic workplace but just in the summer, the rise 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.279
 Temperatures are working nicely book 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.849
 there was Carter that RWE worldwide comparison 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.689
 when the sun is shining but 25 to 30 degrees at the house the sun is shining 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.019
 less of an average air humidity of 80 percent 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:40.829
 and that is really a lot to do 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.230
 until the end of the year, the tomato plants grow before they in December 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:45.650
 be composted 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.880
 and in January of next year everything starts all over again
