something from the refined feline so

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.730 
something from the refined feline so
without<00:00:15.990> further<00:00:16.289> ado<00:00:16.740> I've<00:00:17.550> already<00:00:18.740> opened

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
without further ado I've already opened

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.460 
without further ado I've already opened
it<00:00:20.100> up<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.300> can<00:00:21.449> be<00:00:21.570> easier<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.199> see

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
it up so that it can be easier to see

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.410 
it up so that it can be easier to see
and<00:00:22.920> then<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:25.820> want<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.910> show<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.150> how<00:00:27.269> it's

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
and then I want to show you how it's

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.920 
and then I want to show you how it's
packed

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
packed

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.529 
packed
so<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.260> has<00:00:28.380> styrofoam<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.400> all<00:00:29.609> sides<00:00:30.000> and

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
so it has styrofoam on all sides and

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.750 
so it has styrofoam on all sides and
then<00:00:32.210> the<00:00:33.210> actual<00:00:33.630> ball<00:00:34.430> which<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.550> need<00:00:35.700> to

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
then the actual ball which I need to

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.220 
then the actual ball which I need to
stand<00:00:36.059> up<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.239> lift<00:00:36.600> out<00:00:38.750> it's<00:00:39.750> wrapped<00:00:40.050> in

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
stand up to lift out it's wrapped in

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.139 
stand up to lift out it's wrapped in
plastic<00:00:40.790> so<00:00:42.469> looks<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:43.620> that's<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.789> just

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
plastic so looks like that's it is just

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.410 
plastic so looks like that's it is just
pulling<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> ball<00:00:45.780> out<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:47.210> then<00:00:48.210> there's

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
pulling the ball out and then there's

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.590 
pulling the ball out and then there's
instructions<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:49.110> how<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.379> put<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.800> together

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
instructions on how to put it together

00:00:50.600 --> 00:01:01.110 
instructions on how to put it together
so<00:00:51.600> we'll<00:00:51.780> go<00:00:52.170> ahead<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.410> open<00:00:52.680> it

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.050

watch<00:02:35.660> it<00:02:35.690> in<00:02:35.989> there<00:02:37.209> okay<00:02:38.209> so<00:02:41.980> see<00:02:42.980> he's<00:02:43.160> in

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
watch it in there okay so see he's in

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.150 
watch it in there okay so see he's in
the<00:02:43.430> tilter<00:02:43.940> world<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:45.140> this<00:02:45.260> is<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.620> base<00:02:45.830> and

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
the tilter world so this is the base and

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.140 
the tilter world so this is the base and
then<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.310> want<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.670> attach<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:49.150> trigger

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
then you want to attach the trigger

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.530 
then you want to attach the trigger
using<00:02:50.450> those<00:02:50.600> nails<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.940> want<00:02:53.090> to<00:02:53.180> attach

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
using those nails you want to attach

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.020 
using those nails you want to attach
what<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.019> part<00:02:54.290> that<00:02:54.440> triggers<00:02:54.830> in<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.880> the

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
what the part that triggers in to the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.570 
what the part that triggers in to the
base<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:57.290> there's<00:02:57.650> instructions<00:02:57.980> on<00:02:58.340> how<00:02:58.519> to

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
base and there's instructions on how to

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.520 
base and there's instructions on how to
do<00:02:58.820> that<00:02:59.200> and<00:03:00.200> then<00:03:00.410> this<00:03:01.190> pillow<00:03:02.260> comes<00:03:03.260> with

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
do that and then this pillow comes with

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.159 
do that and then this pillow comes with
it<00:03:03.739> and<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:04.580> goes<00:03:04.730> inside<00:03:05.209> of<00:03:05.269> it<00:03:05.600> so<00:03:05.900> we'll<00:03:06.019> go

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:06.169 
it and it goes inside of it so we'll go

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:07.300 
it and it goes inside of it so we'll go
ahead<00:03:06.200> I'll<00:03:06.560> go<00:03:06.709> ahead<00:03:06.889> and<00:03:06.980> put<00:03:07.160> all<00:03:07.280> that

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
ahead I'll go ahead and put all that

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.920 
ahead I'll go ahead and put all that
together<00:03:07.669> and<00:03:08.150> we'll<00:03:09.079> do<00:03:09.200> another<00:03:09.410> video<00:03:10.930> with

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
together and we'll do another video with

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.560 
together and we'll do another video with
that<00:03:12.200> but<00:03:12.560> so<00:03:13.310> far<00:03:13.519> it<00:03:13.880> looks<00:03:13.910> like<00:03:14.150> he<00:03:14.389> likes

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
that but so far it looks like he likes
