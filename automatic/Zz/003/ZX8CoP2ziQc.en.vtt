00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.200 
let's go ahead and turn the display up
on<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.300> and<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.570> can<00:01:06.600> get<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.899> brightness

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
on this and you can get the brightness

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.950 
on this and you can get the brightness
up<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:10.430> okay<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.490> basically<00:01:11.820> both<00:01:12.780> of

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
up on this okay so basically both of

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.150 
up on this okay so basically both of
these<00:01:13.020> devices<00:01:13.229> are<00:01:13.619> pretty<00:01:13.800> much<00:01:13.890> exactly

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
these devices are pretty much exactly

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.480 
these devices are pretty much exactly
the<00:01:14.340> same<00:01:14.430> one<00:01:14.759> of<00:01:14.850> them<00:01:14.940> notice<00:01:15.300> noticeable

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
the same one of them notice noticeable

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.710 
the same one of them notice noticeable
differences<00:01:17.490> between<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.970> two<00:01:18.090> devices<00:01:18.390> is

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
differences between the two devices is

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.660 
differences between the two devices is
actually<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> build<00:01:19.440> materials<00:01:19.619> being<00:01:20.520> that

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
actually the build materials being that

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.469 
actually the build materials being that
the<00:01:20.790> z1<00:01:23.240> uses<00:01:24.290> metal<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:26.280> z1<00:01:26.670> s<00:01:26.850> uses

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the z1 uses metal and the z1 s uses

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.650 
the z1 uses metal and the z1 s uses
plastic<00:01:27.810> now<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.289> can<00:01:28.560> see<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.539> see

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
plastic now you can see that you can see

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.150 
plastic now you can see that you can see
the<00:01:30.750> difference<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.319> tone<00:01:31.560> between<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
the difference in tone between the

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.760 
the difference in tone between the
actual<00:01:32.429> steel<00:01:32.789> on<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.209> left<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.690> the<00:01:34.050> plastic

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
actual steel on the left and the plastic

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.340 
actual steel on the left and the plastic
on<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.039> right<00:01:35.220> overall<00:01:36.119> they're<00:01:36.450> exactly<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
on the right overall they're exactly the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.930 
on the right overall they're exactly the
same<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.830> wouldn't<00:01:38.100> notice<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.640> wouldn't

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
same you wouldn't notice you wouldn't

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.279 
same you wouldn't notice you wouldn't
know<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.149> this<00:01:39.479> device<00:01:39.780> was<00:01:39.990> made<00:01:40.020> of

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
know that this device was made of

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.919 
know that this device was made of
plastic<00:01:40.830> they<00:01:41.640> weigh<00:01:42.240> about<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.690> same

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
plastic they weigh about the same

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.290 
plastic they weigh about the same
they're<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> little<00:01:43.770> bit<00:01:43.950> lighter<00:01:44.300> in

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
they're a little bit lighter in

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.690 
they're a little bit lighter in
difference<00:01:46.020> between<00:01:46.410> the<00:01:46.500> two<00:01:46.679> devices<00:01:46.950> but

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
difference between the two devices but

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.770 
difference between the two devices but
overall<00:01:48.590> they<00:01:49.590> are<00:01:49.920> exactly<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> same<00:01:50.880> so

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
overall they are exactly the same so

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.109 
overall they are exactly the same so
just<00:01:52.740> wanted<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.069> go<00:01:53.160> over<00:01:53.190> mean<00:01:53.640> software<00:01:54.060> is

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
just wanted to go over mean software is

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.820 
just wanted to go over mean software is
exactly<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.630> same<00:01:54.840> again<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.349> biggest<00:01:55.560> thing

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
exactly the same again the biggest thing

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.990
