00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
so with all the recent changes to the

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.720 
so with all the recent changes to the
channel<00:00:01.709> I<00:00:01.800> thought<00:00:01.979> it<00:00:02.100> would<00:00:02.190> be<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.370> good

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
channel I thought it would be a good

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.030 
channel I thought it would be a good
idea<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:03.179> start<00:00:03.629> up<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:03.899> patreon<00:00:04.319> page<00:00:04.560> and<00:00:04.830> let

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
idea to start up a patreon page and let

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:15.230 
idea to start up a patreon page and let
me<00:00:05.160> tell<00:00:05.339> you<00:00:05.400> why

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.370 

so<00:00:16.240> a<00:00:16.270> lot<00:00:16.450> of<00:00:16.480> you<00:00:16.600> probably<00:00:16.810> don't<00:00:17.110> know<00:00:17.260> what

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
so a lot of you probably don't know what

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.950 
so a lot of you probably don't know what
patreon<00:00:17.830> is<00:00:18.190> and<00:00:18.670> if<00:00:18.910> i<00:00:19.150> was<00:00:19.300> to<00:00:19.330> explain<00:00:19.720> it<00:00:19.870> it

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
patreon is and if i was to explain it it

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.300 
patreon is and if i was to explain it it

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
from a lot of places so I figured I

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.940 
from a lot of places so I figured I
would<00:01:01.030> accept<00:01:01.420> it<00:01:01.600> and<00:01:01.720> now<00:01:02.200> fast<00:01:02.470> forward<00:01:02.590> a

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
would accept it and now fast forward a

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.619
