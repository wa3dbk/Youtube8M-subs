I<00:00:29.580> think<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.119> dual-core<00:00:31.430> this<00:00:32.430> game<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.880> on

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
I think it's dual-core this game is on

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.590 
I think it's dual-core this game is on
ultra<00:00:33.660> settings<00:00:34.280> but<00:00:35.280> I've<00:00:35.399> turned<00:00:35.610> off<00:00:35.880> until

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
ultra settings but I've turned off until

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.319 
ultra settings but I've turned off until
the<00:00:36.780> icing<00:00:36.899> because<00:00:38.090> it<00:00:39.090> reduces<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.780> frames

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
the icing because it reduces the frames

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.840 
the icing because it reduces the frames
that's<00:00:42.329> why<00:00:42.480> I've<00:00:42.570> turned<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.899> off<00:00:43.460> and<00:00:44.460> yeah

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
that's why I've turned it off and yeah

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.479 
that's why I've turned it off and yeah
