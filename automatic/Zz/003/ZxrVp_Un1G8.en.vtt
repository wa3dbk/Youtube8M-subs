00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
thinking about occupying because the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.750 
thinking about occupying because the

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
city being so big a lot of times there

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.220

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
different directions so just that you

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.680

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.510 
might see one fire truck behind you
doesn't<00:02:09.320> mean<00:02:09.500> that<00:02:09.619> there<00:02:09.800> isn't<00:02:09.830> another

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
doesn't mean that there isn't another
