00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.349 

we<00:00:01.290> have<00:00:01.500> a<00:00:01.530> complex<00:00:02.270> number<00:00:04.250> here<00:00:05.250> we<00:00:05.970> trying

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
we have a complex number here we trying

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.589 
we have a complex number here we trying
to<00:00:06.480> divide<00:00:07.170> or<00:00:07.710> simplify<00:00:08.340> let's<00:00:09.030> go<00:00:09.210> over<00:00:09.570> it

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
to divide or simplify let's go over it

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:21.109 
to divide or simplify let's go over it
this<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.139> 2<00:00:10.410> over<00:00:16.340> 2<00:00:17.340> minus<00:00:18.060> 8i<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.910> the<00:00:20.910> way<00:00:21.060> to

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
this is 2 over 2 minus 8i and the way to

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.800 
this is 2 over 2 minus 8i and the way to
simplify<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.859> multiply<00:00:23.460> up<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.600> down

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
simplify this is to multiply up and down

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.620 
simplify this is to multiply up and down
by<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:26.930> conjugate<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.920> denominator<00:00:29.630> okay

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
by the conjugate of the denominator okay

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.110 
by the conjugate of the denominator okay
so<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.439> other<00:00:31.619> words<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.279> can<00:00:32.430> divide<00:00:32.820> these

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
so in other words we can divide these

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.310 
so in other words we can divide these
complex<00:00:33.750> numbers<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:35.450> multiply<00:00:36.450> both<00:00:36.899> sides

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
complex numbers and multiply both sides

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.889 
complex numbers and multiply both sides
by<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.710> conjugate<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> conjugate<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.570> 2

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
by the conjugate and the conjugate of 2

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.760 
by the conjugate and the conjugate of 2
minus<00:00:40.530> 8i<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.730> 2<00:00:42.719> plus<00:00:42.989> 8i<00:00:43.760> so<00:00:44.760> that's<00:00:45.620> what<00:00:46.620> we

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
minus 8i is 2 plus 8i so that's what we

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.459 
minus 8i is 2 plus 8i so that's what we
call<00:00:47.039> conjugates<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.090> let's<00:00:48.270> multiply<00:00:48.420> up<00:00:49.140> and

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
call conjugates so let's multiply up and

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.720 
call conjugates so let's multiply up and
down<00:00:49.680> by<00:00:50.129> 2<00:00:50.190> plus<00:00:50.760> 8i<00:00:51.530> when<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.649> multiply<00:00:53.190> we<00:00:53.550> go

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
down by 2 plus 8i when we multiply we go

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.220 
down by 2 plus 8i when we multiply we go
straight<00:00:54.090> forward<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.230> we're<00:00:55.860> gonna<00:00:55.980> multiply

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
straight forward so we're gonna multiply

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.709 
straight forward so we're gonna multiply
numerator<00:00:58.230> by<00:00:58.590> numerator<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:59.719> denominator

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
numerator by numerator and denominator

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.579 
numerator by numerator and denominator
by<00:01:00.930> denominator<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.980> would<00:01:02.219> be<00:01:02.399> 2<00:01:02.699> times<00:01:03.030> 2

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
by denominator this would be 2 times 2

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:09.440 
by denominator this would be 2 times 2
plus<00:01:04.820> 8i<00:01:07.220> now<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.280> denominator<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.060> nothing

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
plus 8i now the denominator is nothing

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.690 
plus 8i now the denominator is nothing
but<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.930> minus<00:01:10.710> B<00:01:11.689> times<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:13.170> plus<00:01:13.320> B<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.490> that's

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
but a minus B times a plus B and that's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.429 
but a minus B times a plus B and that's
what<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.060> call<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.450> difference<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.200> two

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
what we call the difference of two

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.550 
what we call the difference of two
squares<00:01:16.549> this<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:18.030> squared<00:01:18.540> minus<00:01:19.290> B

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
squares this is a squared minus B

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.890 
squares this is a squared minus B
squared<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.220> let's<00:01:20.400> apply<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> squared

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
squared so let's apply this to a squared

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.730 
squared so let's apply this to a squared
would<00:01:22.140> be<00:01:22.200> 4<00:01:23.150> minus<00:01:24.150> B<00:01:24.450> squared<00:01:24.900> would<00:01:25.290> be<00:01:27.200> 64<00:01:28.200> I

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
would be 4 minus B squared would be 64 I

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.010 
would be 4 minus B squared would be 64 I
squirt<00:01:30.350> okay<00:01:31.640> 64<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.880> squared<00:01:33.299> remember<00:01:33.479> I

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
squirt okay 64 I squared remember I

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.600 
squirt okay 64 I squared remember I
squared<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.829> equal<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.909> negative<00:01:36.390> 1<00:01:37.610> okay

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
squared is equal to negative 1 okay

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.460 
squared is equal to negative 1 okay
let's<00:01:38.640> keep<00:01:39.000> going<00:01:39.060> now<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.110> going<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.320> be

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
let's keep going now this is going to be

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.539 
let's keep going now this is going to be
equal<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.310> 2<00:01:41.640> times<00:01:41.880> 2<00:01:42.270> 4<00:01:43.259> plus<00:01:44.009> 2<00:01:44.430> times<00:01:44.460> 8<00:01:45.680> 16<00:01:46.680> I

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
equal to 2 times 2 4 plus 2 times 8 16 I

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.120 
equal to 2 times 2 4 plus 2 times 8 16 I
that's<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.390> numerator<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.500> distributed

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
that's a numerator I just distributed

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.819 
that's a numerator I just distributed
the<00:01:50.189> two<00:01:50.990> denominator<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.409> 4<00:01:52.920> minus<00:01:53.909> 64<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.140> I

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the two denominator is 4 minus 64 and I

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.569 
the two denominator is 4 minus 64 and I
squared<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.640> negative<00:01:56.670> 1<00:01:58.369> again<00:01:59.369> the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
squared is negative 1 again the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.160 
squared is negative 1 again the
numerator<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.450> 4<00:02:00.869> plus<00:02:01.259> 16<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:03.450> denominator

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
numerator is 4 plus 16 I the denominator

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.139 
numerator is 4 plus 16 I the denominator
would<00:02:04.530> be<00:02:04.590> 4<00:02:04.969> plus<00:02:05.969> 64<00:02:06.810> because<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.619> negative

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
would be 4 plus 64 because a negative

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.650 
would be 4 plus 64 because a negative
times<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.420> negative<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:10.140> positive<00:02:11.450> let's<00:02:12.450> keep

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
times a negative is positive let's keep

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.970 
times a negative is positive let's keep
going<00:02:13.140> we<00:02:13.319> have

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
going we have

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.610 
going we have
I'm<00:02:14.520> gonna<00:02:14.700> take<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> for<00:02:15.420> common<00:02:15.810> factor<00:02:16.470> in

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
I'm gonna take a for common factor in

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.040 
I'm gonna take a for common factor in
the<00:02:16.740> numerator<00:02:16.770> so<00:02:17.460> I<00:02:17.730> get<00:02:18.000> 1<00:02:18.300> plus<00:02:19.190> 4i<00:02:20.930> in<00:02:21.930> the

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
the numerator so I get 1 plus 4i in the

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.780 
the numerator so I get 1 plus 4i in the
denominator<00:02:23.360> I'm<00:02:24.360> gonna<00:02:24.630> also<00:02:25.410> add<00:02:25.860> which

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
denominator I'm gonna also add which

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.730 
denominator I'm gonna also add which
would<00:02:27.030> be<00:02:27.209> 68<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:29.570> let's<00:02:30.570> see<00:02:30.900> it's<00:02:31.170> 68

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
would be 68 and let's see it's 68

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.440 
would be 68 and let's see it's 68
divisible<00:02:32.580> by<00:02:32.640> 4

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
divisible by 4

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.040 
divisible by 4
yes<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:34.800> 4<00:02:35.160> by<00:02:35.400> 4<00:02:35.760> is<00:02:36.030> 1<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.950> 68<00:02:37.950> by<00:02:38.250> 4<00:02:38.700> is

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
yes it is so 4 by 4 is 1 and 68 by 4 is

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.640 
yes it is so 4 by 4 is 1 and 68 by 4 is
128<00:02:40.050> by<00:02:40.470> 4<00:02:40.800> is<00:02:41.040> 7<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.570> final<00:02:43.020> answer<00:02:43.140> would

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
128 by 4 is 7 so the final answer would

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:51.320 
128 by 4 is 7 so the final answer would
be<00:02:43.950> 1<00:02:44.819> over<00:02:45.380> 17<00:02:46.730> plus<00:02:47.730> 4<00:02:48.600> over<00:02:49.550> 17<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:50.850> so

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
be 1 over 17 plus 4 over 17 I so

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.320 
be 1 over 17 plus 4 over 17 I so
remember<00:02:51.840> we<00:02:52.019> always<00:02:52.500> have<00:02:52.769> to<00:02:53.010> write<00:02:53.330> the

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
remember we always have to write the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.570 
remember we always have to write the
complex<00:02:54.959> number<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.890> form<00:02:56.220> of<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:58.880> plus<00:02:59.930> B<00:03:00.930> I

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
complex number in the form of a plus B I

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.940 
complex number in the form of a plus B I
okay<00:03:02.580> so<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.360> 1<00:03:03.390> over<00:03:04.110> 17<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.100> B<00:03:05.940> over<00:03:06.269> B<00:03:06.810> is<00:03:07.560> 4
