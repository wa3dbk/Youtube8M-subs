00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.620
 hello here françois rose bushes 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.840
 lauzon workshops I have the pleasure of you 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.609
 present the brand new nor condé 800 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.680
 it's a device we've been waiting for since 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.730
 already long 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.859
 mainly for its resolution 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.150
 exceptional 36 million pixels 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.550
 in fx format 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.679
 it can also be used in dx format to 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.300
 18 million pixels so depending on 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.550
 of what we want to do of the type of 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.870
 photography we had to realize we will 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.030
 change our resolution 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.800
 the other thing too that makes this 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.300
 exceptional device is its 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.989
 processor of nearly 2 million pixels 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.550
 which improves accuracy and speed 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.160
 autofocus 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.489
 so if it's our continuous focus 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.170
 to simple focus but both things 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.090
 combined together make sure that it 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.730
 will be much faster and accurate 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.280
 at the level of the balance of blain too 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.899
 we will have more details than this 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.519
 either in automatic mode or 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.680
 custom or in the modes 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:11.060
 favorite game be it a stream 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.820
 recent cloudy tungsten in precision 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.830
 white balance still unmatched at 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.540
 level of use in low night 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.890
 we are going to find very very few 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.300
 noise in our images 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.510
 so that we can also use 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.920
 our device in native value from 100 to 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.510
 6400 iso 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.390
 or we can push it up 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.220
 about 25000 so they have for a 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.560
 use under conditions having 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.200
 very difficult if you want point of view 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:41.330
 video via a device that will be full 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.460
 HD 1920 by 1080 in 30 25 or 24 images 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.450
 per second if we will go against 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.780
 in the 1280 by 720 we will sit 150 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.670
 30 and 25 frames / second for another one 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.100
 very great flexibility of your taking 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.530
 at the mifo level well we have a 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.170
 microphone that is stereo is also a plug 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.050
 d will even cost the device that makes 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.390
 will be able to achieve with 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.760
 accuracy already all our quality two 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.390
 sense at the output level of an output 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.470
 usb 3 so for a faster transfer 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.690
 of our images this is video 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.460
 photo in the camera question 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.740
 ergonomics well we are really in 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.150
 nico terrain so little has been 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.340
 changed otherwise we will end up 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.020
 now with the keys what tea 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.940
 iso white balance and bracketing 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.880
 directly on the side of the case for 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.800
 even easier use 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.690
 can add on our case a 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.100
 handle you 're going to question work 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.510
 a lot in vertical that it is offered 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.640
 portrait but we will have a 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.010
 better ergonomics is also a plus 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.600
 great freedom in pictures 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.310
 because we will be able to add a 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.380
 second stack so nor condé 836 million 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.250
 of pixels and a very high quality 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.250
 Image
