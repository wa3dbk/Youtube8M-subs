I'm<00:02:01.690> gonna<00:02:01.870> go<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.050> Facebook<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:04.420> want<00:02:04.630> to

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
I'm gonna go to Facebook and you want to

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.670 
I'm gonna go to Facebook and you want to
go<00:02:05.470> to<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.680> graffiti<00:02:05.980> application<00:02:08.400> and<00:02:10.680> okay

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
go to the graffiti application and okay

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:24.490 
go to the graffiti application and okay
just<00:02:11.860> see<00:02:12.310> on<00:02:12.460> a<00:02:12.490> father's<00:02:13.240> with<00:02:13.390> somebody

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.820 

okay<00:02:25.130> so<00:02:25.580> it<00:02:25.940> is<00:02:26.300> very<00:02:26.840> important<00:02:27.440> this<00:02:27.590> step

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
okay so it is very important this step

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.240 
okay so it is very important this step
that<00:02:28.010> this<00:02:28.160> entire<00:02:28.720> graffiti<00:02:30.100> application<00:02:31.100> is

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
that this entire graffiti application is

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.150 
that this entire graffiti application is
exposed<00:02:31.790> on<00:02:32.000> your<00:02:32.150> screen<00:02:32.420> on<00:02:33.100> otherwise<00:02:34.100> a

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
exposed on your screen on otherwise a

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.810 
exposed on your screen on otherwise a
Java<00:02:34.520> applet<00:02:34.940> will<00:02:35.030> be<00:02:35.150> able<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.420> detect<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.170> so

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
Java applet will be able to detect it so

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.580 
Java applet will be able to detect it so
I'd<00:02:37.820> be<00:02:37.940> careful<00:02:38.180> if<00:02:38.330> you're<00:02:38.960> using<00:02:39.140> Mac<00:02:39.410> you

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
I'd be careful if you're using Mac you

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.980 
I'd be careful if you're using Mac you
can't<00:02:39.800> let<00:02:39.920> these<00:02:40.040> window<00:02:40.460> shadows<00:02:40.940> be<00:02:41.600> over

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
can't let these window shadows be over

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.080 
can't let these window shadows be over
this<00:02:42.860> main<00:02:43.100> area<00:02:43.400> either<00:02:43.580> because<00:02:43.940> the

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
this main area either because the

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.430 
this main area either because the
detection<00:02:44.390> algorithm<00:02:44.959> is<00:02:45.050> very<00:02:45.200> simple

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
detection algorithm is very simple

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.350 
detection algorithm is very simple
probably<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:47.450> um<00:02:47.930> before<00:02:48.709> you<00:02:48.920> start<00:02:49.360> painting

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
probably so um before you start painting

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.540 
probably so um before you start painting
it<00:02:50.450> with<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:50.900> button<00:02:51.170> here<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.310> have<00:02:52.459> to

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
it with this button here you you have to

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.070 
it with this button here you you have to
know<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.970> painting<00:02:53.270> process<00:02:53.420> cannot<00:02:54.020> be

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
know that the painting process cannot be

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.960 
know that the painting process cannot be
interrupted<00:02:54.380> and<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.040> actually<00:02:55.340> takes<00:02:55.700> like

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
interrupted and it actually takes like

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.870 
interrupted and it actually takes like
two<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.660> three<00:02:56.690> hours<00:02:56.900> for<00:02:57.470> each<00:02:57.500> painting<00:02:57.920> so

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
two to three hours for each painting so

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.020 
two to three hours for each painting so
it's<00:02:59.150> best<00:02:59.420> if<00:02:59.660> you<00:02:59.780> do<00:02:59.959> this<00:03:00.110> um<00:03:00.440> if<00:03:01.030> before

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
it's best if you do this um if before

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.310 
it's best if you do this um if before
you're<00:03:02.150> going<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.390> sleep<00:03:02.630> otherwise<00:03:02.900> you

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
you're going to sleep otherwise you

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.540 
you're going to sleep otherwise you
won't<00:03:03.410> be<00:03:03.530> able<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.770> use<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.890> computer<00:03:04.070> and<00:03:04.400> the

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
won't be able to use a computer and the

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.120 
won't be able to use a computer and the
only<00:03:04.730> way<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:04.970> actually<00:03:05.239> shut<00:03:05.540> it<00:03:05.630> down<00:03:05.810> is<00:03:06.080> to

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
only way to actually shut it down is to

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.949 
only way to actually shut it down is to
press<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.310> hold<00:03:07.340> your<00:03:07.670> power<00:03:07.970> button<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.450> you

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
press and hold your power button and you

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.990 
press and hold your power button and you
don't<00:03:09.080> want<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.290> do<00:03:09.380> that<00:03:09.410> so<00:03:09.950> in<00:03:10.850> this

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
don't want to do that so in this

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.970 
don't want to do that so in this
demonstration<00:03:11.239> I<00:03:11.870> made<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.410> program<00:03:12.739> in<00:03:12.860> such

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
demonstration I made the program in such

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.590 
demonstration I made the program in such
a<00:03:13.010> way<00:03:13.130> that<00:03:13.160> I<00:03:13.280> only<00:03:13.610> paints<00:03:14.150> a<00:03:14.239> number<00:03:14.540> of

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
a way that I only paints a number of

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.410 
a way that I only paints a number of
strokes<00:03:14.840> before<00:03:15.110> it<00:03:15.320> stops<00:03:15.530> but<00:03:16.520> um<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:17.209> get<00:03:17.390> a

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
strokes before it stops but um to get a

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.590 
strokes before it stops but um to get a
few<00:03:17.690> of<00:03:17.750> what<00:03:18.020> it's<00:03:18.320> like<00:03:18.850> you<00:03:19.850> just<00:03:19.970> click<00:03:20.450> on

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
few of what it's like you just click on

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.310 
few of what it's like you just click on
start<00:03:20.870> painting<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:22.750> Java<00:03:23.750> program<00:03:24.170> will

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
start painting and the Java program will

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.979 
start painting and the Java program will
actually<00:03:24.530> start<00:03:24.770> moving<00:03:25.250> your<00:03:25.690> mouse<00:03:26.690> and

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
actually start moving your mouse and

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.220 
actually start moving your mouse and
start<00:03:27.320> drawing<00:03:27.800> the<00:03:28.549> picture<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.230> end

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
start drawing the picture and the end

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.930 
start drawing the picture and the end
result<00:03:30.590> should<00:03:30.739> look<00:03:30.980> like<00:03:31.130> what<00:03:31.489> you<00:03:31.580> saw<00:03:31.790> in

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
result should look like what you saw in

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.449 
result should look like what you saw in
the<00:03:31.970> preview<00:03:32.709> but<00:03:33.709> as<00:03:33.769> you<00:03:33.860> can<00:03:33.980> see<00:03:34.220> in<00:03:34.370> this

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
the preview but as you can see in this

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.990 
the preview but as you can see in this
case<00:03:34.670> is<00:03:34.820> over<00:03:35.110> 4,000<00:03:36.110> strokes<00:03:36.440> here<00:03:36.820> so<00:03:37.820> it's

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
case is over 4,000 strokes here so it's

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.840 
case is over 4,000 strokes here so it's
going<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.299> take<00:03:38.660> a<00:03:38.690> whopper<00:03:39.049> to<00:03:39.170> finish<00:03:39.850> yeah

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
going to take a whopper to finish yeah

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.680 
going to take a whopper to finish yeah
so<00:03:41.269> this<00:03:41.630> is<00:03:41.780> it<00:03:41.989> and<00:03:42.760> so<00:03:43.760> please<00:03:44.269> use<00:03:44.570> this
