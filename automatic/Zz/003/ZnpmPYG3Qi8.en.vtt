00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello again friends from youtube my 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.000
 name is isaac and his instructor here in 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.410
 the driving school to class mexico a 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.360
 sorry for not being able to upload 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.000
 videos before and continue with this series 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.120
 but we have been having a lot of work 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.250
 At this moment I am going to teach you how 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.020
 they must adjust the three mirrors 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.240
 rearview mirrors of your car both 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.789
 lateral and the central we begin 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.910
 [Music] 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.910
 i 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.830
 the three rear-view mirrors of our 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.690
 auto are important at the moment of 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.000
 handle and should even be 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.460
 adjusted before starting the 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.590
 march of our vehicle this so that 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.200
 we can have readings 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.670
 correct about what is behind or what 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.770
 what happens behind our vehicle 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.280
 when we are going to make a change 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.330
 of lane or a rebase or we are going to turn already 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.280
 is to the right or to the 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.800
 left we have to be aware 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.160
 of the side mirrors because they 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.980
 They are the ones who will give us the pattern of 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.620
 know if we can invade the lane or not 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.259
 or if we can perform well the rebase or 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.899
 that's not why these should be fine 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.310
 well-aligned well-adjusted from 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.259
 before launching our 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.450
 vehicle and this time I'm going to 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.940
 teach how they should see it 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.840
 exactly as you should from 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.210
 appreciate in this case the mirror so that 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.610
 make no mistake when making a 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.409
 exceeded many of the accidents that 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.600
 they are currently passing 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.329
 are consequences of people not 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.450
 knows how to overtake or does not know how to invade a lane 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:38.229
 correctly invades a lane of 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.640
 wrong way and causes an accident 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.520
 so good this time I'm going to 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.039
 move the camera a little bit more to 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.560
 show them how you should see 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.039
 exactly the mirror that we are going to 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.959
 align to align the mirrors 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.090
 we must first adjust well 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:58.369
 our seat if you have not seen the video 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.849
 of how to adjust the seat according to 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.950
 our height then then around here 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:06.890
 I'm going to put a link so you can see 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.560
 the other video where you can see how 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.930
 we must adjust our seat once 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.670
 that is adjusted to our seat 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:17.390
 then we can align the mirrors 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.060
 if you do it upside down first line 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.069
 the mirror and then you adjust your seat 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.870
 what do you think you're going to have to go back to 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.970
 align the mirror later because the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.489
 mirrors align to our eyes 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.440
 then like all the lines is at a 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.579
 distance that was not the correct one because 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.910
 then you're going to have to go back to 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.580
 repeat to avoid all this 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.990
 what you first fit your seat well 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.540
 according to the indications that come 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.310
 in the previous video and in this way 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.500
 you will be able to align the mirrors well 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.970
 you must take into account something the 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.550
 mirrors have to be aligned to 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.280
 our eyes and not us being like 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.350
 nodding looking for the no, that's a 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.390
 wrong way to handle us 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.740
 we must always look to the front 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.350
 yes and with the look turn to see the 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.960
 Central mirror rotate to see the mirror 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.150
 right side and rotate to see the 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.040
 left side mirror ok ya you 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.590
 I recommend that the mirror take it from 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.470
 this way many people take it well 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.720
 you let them fingers are marked and longer 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.940
 it does not look good the mirror is due 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.010
 Align mold to mode 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:26.200
 to the degree that we can see 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.640
 through the back glass in this case 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.800
 well we have to see up 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.120
 here the letters and now here for each 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:37.780
 space this is how we should line up and 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.060
 remember that yes you have to see you have 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.400
 to see it with the moment of your eyes not 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.590
 with the movement of your head that 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.530
 there should be this the side mirror 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.780
 left of our vehicle must 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.150
 stay in this way aligned 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.120
 must have a margin of 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.330
 approximately one side you have to see 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.790
 the side of your car this is important 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.190
 because when you're learning to 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.080
 drive if you do not know where your 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.900
 vehicle if you do not have 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.600
 an idea of where is the most 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.180
 sure is that you're going to give it a stem 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:19.049
 scrape and well then this is no longer 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.810
 convenient it has to stay that way if you 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.450
 is this way the mirror is wrong 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.390
 aligned 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.630
 if you stay in this other way the 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.750
 mirror is also misaligned why 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.660
 you are watching others the car the car what 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.000
 you should see approximately thus having 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.780
 a reference of where it is and the rest 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.800
 that space 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.610
 this is the side mirror 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.259
 and finally the left side mirror 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.650
 This should also be left of this 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:53.530
 way watching a piece of the car in this 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.680
 case one side and the rest you must see 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.740
 space must be well centered 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.110
 both here and the top part and 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.419
 You must see this space 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:08.009
 completely and this small space 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:11.949
 is dedicated to the side of the car 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:15.219
 yes, if the mirror looks the same 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:19.000
 way is wrong ok and if you are left with this 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:22.139
 way is equally wrong that 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:27.219
 refers is very open or very closed 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:29.740
 I'm going up or down there has to be 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:32.020
 well so you can see even 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.129
 we have a van where the 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.129
 we can see perfectly 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:43.970
 by correct adjustment of the mirror 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:48.140
 Very good friends, since I 'm already walking the car 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:51.160
 this is how you should see in your mirror 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.160
 left mirror 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:57.810
 this is how you should see in your mirror 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:06:00.990
 central mirror 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:05.280
 and that's how you should see in your mirror 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:07.230
 important right side mirror 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.210
 that those three points of reference the 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:13.020
 see in this way how 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.020
 I was watching 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.840
