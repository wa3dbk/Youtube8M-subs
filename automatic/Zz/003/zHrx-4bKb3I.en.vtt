00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.500
 Cormorant uhh Uun Iiii 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:16.840
 The wide low is also important this time 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:21.820
 I think that I want to do the thick eyebrows and yet karma hot water currently in vogue 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:27.730
 Part of the head of the wharf to the daughter 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:30.279
 I write the kanji that I add to the upper part weapon and write the kanji firmly and let me build the mountain as it is and 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.520
 I feel like I'm going to fill the lower side of the coffin 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.990
 Parallel 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.990
 I will make a rainy season 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:43.449
 And as it is a little masai impression in this state , move the eyes with powder 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.449
 To go 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:53.500
 And because we will come in, I firmly color the sheet and Dawn 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.500
 Impressive impressions make up 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:10.470
 And I'll use f 3 when my favorite mail job is open 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:13.690
 It will extend to the entire unfolding taking the first best brightness color hair brush 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.860
 It is okay to go to a fairly wide area 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:23.440
 And tears bag and inner corner of the eye Nino 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:26.160
 I 'm going to knead firmly I want to emphasize the tears bag this time, so I'll do until the eyes firmly 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.160
 I will go 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:40.710
 Then let's move it lightly with your finger at the end and take the second brown gold next 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:44.390
 The line to 2 will put hand in it, so this time we will expand the width of Thailand so I 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.390
 And I'm painting it widely 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.320
 It is rare to use the law this time 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.730
 I will make the second 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.730
 Where you want to make power 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.960
 Apply paste and then 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.960
 I will bite firmly 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:11.870
 Take the next dark brown chip 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:21.150
 As a stomach hospital force 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:26.989
 Of feathers while the image of it in the will continue to write this time will change the delectable ham line 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.989
 I will write out a little in static eyelids have written a line 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.760
 And I will write an eyeline using the power tire liner black first 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:41.930
 Line mom will go back like this 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:47.440
 And I'm filling the inside, and my head is coming, I'm writing like this 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.440
 It is highly recommended because the feather line can be drawn beautifully and accurately 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.770
 I will look at the mucous membrane using a brown pencil 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:59.280
 Let's stop firmly and under the black eyes 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.520
 I wrote to the mucous membranes and static outer corner of the eyelid 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:07.080
 I will write it out now 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.940
 And the eye line to take the Brown of such eyes also in 10 minutes back to the palette 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.100
 I will move 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:19.620
 I'm getting along with the liquid eyeline I wrote a little while ago 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:22.540
 Often it will move around because it and painted a mascara to say to the Buhler 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:27.750
 I will not wear false eyelashes this time 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.750
 I'll paint well and firmly 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.030

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:45.500
 Next I will use the Elf Pharaoh to add shading 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.160
 Cheekbones 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.120
 It's had been coming Te major Kkoshi 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.120
 I 'm out now 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.470
 And this time I will use darker pink teak 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:07.070
 It started- 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:10.810
 Lovely to say put it in quite darker to say pretty soon put the pop pom-poms down to this 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.810
 I will make an impression 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:23.400
 And back to the elves' palette, this pink 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.400
 We will put color as a substitute for highlights 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:34.350
 Yes I will move to lip makeup I will use the color of the flying version of Lebron 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.480

 It is amazing here is a good color from even your recommendation 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:07.460
 Well painted firmly we will make a two-lips of Bukkake chestnut 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:09.289
 Because it is a little pink and pink if it is as it is, using lip of 0 colors 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.030
 Dark 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:17.300
 I think that I want to color 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.300
 Well I feel like a little mark pink 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.220
