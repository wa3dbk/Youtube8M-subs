00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
there do the fences and let's see if he

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.240 
there do the fences and let's see if he
stands<00:04:19.849> in<00:04:20.000> exactly<00:04:20.539> same<00:04:20.870> spot<00:04:21.229> and<00:04:21.620> it's<00:04:22.159> not

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
stands in exactly same spot and it's not

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.380 
stands in exactly same spot and it's not
like<00:04:22.310> that<00:04:22.460> small<00:04:22.909> right<00:04:23.060> there<00:04:23.210> is<00:04:23.270> an

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
like that small right there is an

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.340 
like that small right there is an
efficient<00:04:23.870> place<00:04:24.080> to<00:04:24.289> stand

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
efficient place to stand

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.690 
efficient place to stand
mean<00:04:25.500> it's<00:04:25.770> actually<00:04:25.920> further<00:04:26.310> away<00:04:26.460> from<00:04:26.520> the

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
mean it's actually further away from the

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.730 
mean it's actually further away from the
fences<00:04:27.090> so<00:04:27.270> if<00:04:27.720> you<00:04:27.900> were<00:04:27.990> gonna<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.590> know<00:04:28.710> be

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
fences so if you were gonna you know be

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.170 
fences so if you were gonna you know be
efficient<00:04:29.310> as<00:04:29.370> you<00:04:29.460> can<00:04:29.610> you<00:04:29.700> stand<00:04:29.970> around
