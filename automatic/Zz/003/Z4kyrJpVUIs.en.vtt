00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.509 

and<00:00:27.640> that's<00:00:28.300> for<00:00:28.689> most<00:00:28.900> humans<00:00:29.439> an<00:00:29.679> unusual

and that's for most humans an unusual

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:36.450 
and that's for most humans an unusual
thing<00:00:30.759> to<00:00:31.029> do<00:00:32.129> because<00:00:33.129> most<00:00:33.640> people<00:00:35.129> live<00:00:36.129> in

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
thing to do because most people live in

live in such a way as if the present

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.580 
live in such a way as if the present
moment<00:00:56.260> where<00:00:56.860> an<00:00:57.129> obstacle<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:59.050> they<00:00:59.260> need

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
moment where an obstacle that they need

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:10.050 
moment where an obstacle that they need
to<00:00:59.859> overcome<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:07.710> loss<00:01:08.710> of<00:01:09.130> most<00:01:09.490> parts<00:01:09.970> of

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
to overcome a loss of most parts of

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.870 
to overcome a loss of most parts of
their<00:01:10.270> lives<00:01:10.539> is<00:01:11.020> they<00:01:11.920> are<00:01:12.070> trying<00:01:12.520> to

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
their lives is they are trying to

their lives is they are trying to
overcome<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.840> obstacle<00:01:14.560> of<00:01:14.740> this<00:01:15.039> moment

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
overcome the obstacle of this moment

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.999 
overcome the obstacle of this moment
which<00:01:16.270> means<00:01:16.539> they<00:01:16.720> need<00:01:16.750> to<00:01:17.080> get<00:01:17.289> to<00:01:17.679> the<00:01:17.800> next

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
which means they need to get to the next

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.270 
which means they need to get to the next
one<00:01:18.220> where<00:01:18.670> they<00:01:19.270> believe<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:20.710> obstacle

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
one where they believe this obstacle

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.130 
one where they believe this obstacle
belief<00:01:21.729> disappeared<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:25.149> next<00:01:25.509> moment<00:01:25.720> which

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
belief disappeared the next moment which

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.770 
belief disappeared the next moment which
of<00:01:26.380> course<00:01:26.409> never<00:01:26.920> arrives<00:01:27.539> because<00:01:28.539> your

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
of course never arrives because your

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.859 
of course never arrives because your
entire<00:01:29.050> life<00:01:29.409> can<00:01:29.860> only<00:01:30.069> ever<00:01:30.520> be<00:01:30.909> this<00:01:31.360> moment

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
entire life can only ever be this moment

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.100 
entire life can only ever be this moment
which<00:01:32.530> then<00:01:32.829> remains<00:01:33.340> a<00:01:33.549> continuous<00:01:34.270> obstacle

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
which then remains a continuous obstacle

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.830 
which then remains a continuous obstacle
that<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:38.590> need<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.070> get<00:01:39.250> beyond<00:01:39.729> but<00:01:40.630> never

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
that you need to get beyond but never

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:49.440 
that you need to get beyond but never
get<00:01:41.170> beyond<00:01:46.619> if<00:01:47.619> that's<00:01:47.950> not<00:01:48.159> insanity<00:01:48.610> what

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
get beyond if that's not insanity what

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:59.819 
get beyond if that's not insanity what
is<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:55.090> it's<00:01:55.329> normal<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.840> you<00:01:58.899> don't<00:01:59.560> need<00:01:59.710> to

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
is but it's normal so you don't need to

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.240 
is but it's normal so you don't need to
be<00:01:59.979> good<00:02:00.250> at<00:02:00.460> mathematics<00:02:00.670> which<00:02:01.390> are<00:02:01.600> not

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
be good at mathematics which are not

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.999 
be good at mathematics which are not
she'll<00:02:03.250> then<00:02:03.460> find<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:04.000> equation<00:02:05.009> normal

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
she'll then find the equation normal

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:14.699 
she'll then find the equation normal
equals<00:02:07.380> insane<00:02:10.680> maybe<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:13.260> little<00:02:14.260> bit<00:02:14.410> extreme

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
equals insane maybe a little bit extreme

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:21.810 
equals insane maybe a little bit extreme
but<00:02:15.750> ultimately<00:02:16.750> true<00:02:19.620> if<00:02:20.620> normal<00:02:21.370> we're<00:02:21.579> not

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
but ultimately true if normal we're not

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.360 
but ultimately true if normal we're not
insane<00:02:22.359> human<00:02:23.079> history<00:02:23.650> would<00:02:23.980> be<00:02:24.010> very

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
insane human history would be very

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.530 
insane human history would be very
different<00:02:24.850> from<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.239> way<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.540> is<00:02:26.970> if<00:02:27.970> normal

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
different from the way it is if normal

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.300 
different from the way it is if normal
we're<00:02:28.750> not<00:02:28.959> insane<00:02:29.440> what<00:02:29.739> you<00:02:29.920> would<00:02:30.070> hear<00:02:30.250> on

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
we're not insane what you would hear on

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.490 
we're not insane what you would hear on
the<00:02:30.549> news<00:02:30.760> would<00:02:31.510> be<00:02:31.720> different<00:02:32.170> from<00:02:32.260> what

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
the news would be different from what

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:45.870 
the news would be different from what
you<00:02:32.650> hear<00:02:32.829> every<00:02:33.190> day<00:02:33.220> on<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.820> news<00:02:38.040> well

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.590 

so<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.450> present<00:02:47.959> bobbin<00:02:48.350> then<00:02:48.590> is<00:02:49.250> not<00:02:50.090> an

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
so the present bobbin then is not an

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.260 
so the present bobbin then is not an
obstacle<00:02:53.530> as<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.590> present<00:02:55.069> moment<00:02:55.459> is<00:02:55.700> not<00:02:56.030> by

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
obstacle as a present moment is not by

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:02.770 
obstacle as a present moment is not by
anime<00:02:56.890> another<00:02:57.890> way<00:02:58.130> of<00:02:58.280> putting<00:02:58.490> it<00:02:58.850> I<00:03:01.780> don't
