00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.530
 and then we'll see how we're going to use Gaussian blur for 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.980
 give an impression of depth of field the image that understood if one makes 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.860
 also that was swimming taken with a depth of field that can be 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.780
 understand and so the characters are of a level as the animal and so 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.400
 it does not allow me to say straits times 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.500
 so to realize without a rally applied to the mosques a full motion 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.849
 on the whole of the Ile-de-France so we will actually use a tool of 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.500
 select the assault to select the areas on which we will apply 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.170
 what we can do so we will work here with a lasso paul 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.230
 mcdonald 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.490
 well we will work with a drawing of the contours to zero, that is to say that 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.570
 we have to make women to the polygon he's not going to do that part they say 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.010
 but it's going well thirty-two years that I would have selected and conceding a 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.470
 polygon voter - because we will select the animal in England 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.150
 how a little clumsy not sting the treatment on the animal 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.510
 so here I will start if we take the example of wages faster 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.020
 but hey, I'll let you go much more precisely when you 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.850
 go do it 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.289
 at the human level so uci to make a video a little short 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.379
 I will quickly go over the points 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.159
 in a way very little how it goes better it will not be perfect but at 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.900
 level of treatment 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.390
 unclassified just do all the outlines so positioned from the point 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.090
 everywhere I want to make different possible conflicts in this part of 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.100
 the road I continue on the seduction on the move the fastest on the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.740
 chromosome m 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.210
 so if you want control that is not good but its 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.630
 party had simply slipped 4 years and over 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.850
 it's a workaround to change slightly under with the money from 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.670
 way that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.970
 the contrast between a little too much choice so here here I continue in the 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.440
 marine seduction 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.880
 The good way 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.320
 the title 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.320
 short selection the goal 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.390
 it shows how it works 5 I'm quiet an eclipse 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.950
 Putin maintained that she had been convinced of the importance 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.230
 fascinating section 6 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.050
 he keeps on 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.820
 our selection 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.820
 om 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:18.199
 8 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.349
 mouse 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.689
 ap because carl devos 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.039
 the small dots 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:37.039
 the most interesting 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:42.299
 no on the air I want 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.430
 this 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.320
 pure juice quite double click to finish my selection to keep all 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.770
 the area was selected so in fact good setting should apply on 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.260
 the part that did not rain I did not select if they have more than I have 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.920
 used a selection for me so we will select a real treat for 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.610
 trainees focus boghossian and we will play on their mistakes the most 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.179
 coarse in order to find 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:08.409
 the radius that was well compared to what I want master so here i'm going 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.299
 much better is for everyone 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.290
 the rise of the south with 40 points afp so we will now at the bottom 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.649
 she disappears 

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:20.089
 the ideal it would be a little air on the offensives so we will keep the same 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:23.579
 selection for all we created a wolfman ice-cold effect 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.359
 so we impose in French the touch of the finger so far bobby keys 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.870
 just this existing setting you take a new careful look of 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:33.129
 take that to list 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.010
 here and in return the strongest could well remain if the selection 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.419
 go over and if my selection that controls fiat molested two employees 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:45.559
 are all teeth step number no there is no step number 2 so 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:50.069
 here just i'm going to use the challenge and to gather a little my 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.349
 kid I just wanted to just play you on 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.089
 here is the central curve and hbo and I will assume my bottom 

00:03:56.089 --> 00:04:00.519
 it is enough for me at the market level I would like to clarify a little the 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.219
 central part so here we will create 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:03.539
 a new stage 

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:06.839
 to create this selection of the state could also decide 

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:10.549
 from there our selection based on integrated radium 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:15.060
 what by the circle and we will leave with a plus 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.239
 to choose the reputed area so I no longer have it because I applied it from here 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.370
 this selection 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.949
 so here I am going to select the area on which I will apply this 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:22.650
 setting 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.360
 so here and there I'm going to take a new lane setting it's 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.960
 elected 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.599
 and there we will clear you up 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.590
 so in fact I'm going up here in the game 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.350
 I'm doing all the fighting in place so we will play here on the part more 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.569
 clear 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.319
 gÃ©rard bapt enlighten men meet and this is now a 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:45.110
 luck with others we have not liked these people or more it is not used to 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.270
 nothing is not the purpose of the operation so it is to see that an image that is 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.819
 it fits well for the section 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.279
 the next step we will do 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:55.169
 when blurry 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:56.479
 to make an idea 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.669
 my creativity here 40 with 16 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:03.050
 here 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.270
 so here we notice then successful and our dignity seeing him no 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.020
 difference for the deaf to hide his efforts good this is a beautiful 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.499
 simply at the management level of the 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:16.449
 the cutouts to do quite accurate if you are in your Welsh essay 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.729
 very pretty brunette here on the selection and you can slightly change the 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.610
 aggressive behavior here i'm going to change thank you socks so as to 

00:05:24.609 --> 00:05:28.469
 now get something that suits me a lot better for me 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:32.330
 the selection is made understand that so low we see much less the selection 

00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:35.020
 we still see it but it's because I have not been precise enough 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.330
 when I read no doubt much more accurate or rather costs 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.419
 this is an illustration example of the footbal hers to change the depth 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:43.539
 minefield I am
