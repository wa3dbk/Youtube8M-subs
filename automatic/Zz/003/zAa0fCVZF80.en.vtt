 Ryan BÃ¡der and our advantage of 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.230
 casting in common bridge 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.910
 there are two key elements in the 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.250
 making the best battery 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.230
 liquid electrolyte of the world quality 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.540
 of the materials used to create 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.790
 its internal components and all the 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.410
 manufacturing process the components 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.300
 internal of a battery are 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.640
 fundamental for its performance and 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.680
 durability quality materials 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.660
 as the alpha plus pasta of trojan with a 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.300
 metal agent of two separators 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.700
 advanced max carte 2 oxide 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.559
 grids and alloy selection 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.780
 differentiate trojan batteries from 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.309
 of the competition these materials are 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.320
 essential to create a battery 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.969
 highly reliable that satisfies the 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.280
 rigorous quality standards and 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.809
 troy performance in the process 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.460
 manufacturing a battery 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.769
 liquid electrolyte is so important 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.780
 as the materials that are used to 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.120
 manufacture the battery manufacturing 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.339
 of liquid electrolyte demands precision 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.230
 accuracy and concise methods for 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.900
 ensure the proper assembly of your 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.730
 delicate internal components use 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.340
 of the casting equipment in common bridge 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.620
 also called 0s is fundamental 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.360
 to ensure the correct placement 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.790
 of the components during the 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.610
 manufacture although many manufacturers 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.440
 of batteries use this technology it 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.350
 originally designed for production 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.720
 of automotive batteries when recognizing the 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.340
 importance of the equipment desire is well 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.560
 designed for the manufacture of 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.600
 liquid electrolyte batteries 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.390
 troy developing new machines 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.950
 seo s specially designed for 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.870
 production of its batteries 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.780
 liquid electrolyte leaders in the 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.090
 industry the trojan plant of Latvia 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.220
 Georgia is the first of the plan 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.500
 implementation of ceo s equipment 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.720
 specially designed in all 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.250
 plants the machines desire is 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.840
 automated trojan 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.790
 fundamental to ensure 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.310
 correct placement and connection of 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.320
 key components of a battery the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.750
 Battery plates are grouped 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.480
 automatically that they then move to 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.340
 the ceo machines where they are leveled and 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.800
 they line up several times in different 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.200
 processes to position correctly 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.970
 the terminals of each plate are 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.890
 precise leveling techniques 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.800
 guarantee the correct connection of the 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.050
 plates in the seo process that end 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.940
 the conveyor belt locates the groups 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.970
 of plates to load them into the machine 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.520
 I wish s the plates re-aligned 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.110
 for casting the connections of the 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.660
 plates are prepared seville giving the 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.090
 terminals by applying a water base and 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.820
 is damaging those before the foundry 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.190
 the lead used in the foundry is 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.260
 pumped into the mold I wish that 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.840
 It is designed so that excess 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.660
 lead drain quickly and you get the 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.430
 level of casting necessary terminals 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.800
 of the plates are immersed in the lead 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.900
 molten the foundry is cooled and 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.640
 remove the mold elements with all 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.280
 bridge connections in place 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.470
 these bridge connections provide 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.270
 a series circuit between the plates 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.700
 lead that allows the correct 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.830
 operation of the battery 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.050
 assembled elements go to the process 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.360
 of final production where they are inserted into 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.980
 the right battery boxes 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.260
 then it is verified that no element 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.420
 have short circuits are welded 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.640
 connections between the cells and they are placed 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.410
 internal in cyan lids are burned 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.390
 terminals and a test is performed 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.010
 pneumatic to verify that the battery 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.409
 do not leak 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.090
 the battery receives a mounting code and 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.360
 It is filled with the severity of acid 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.709
 specific to the training process 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.590
 during the training process 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.510
 the battery receives its initial charge then 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.879
 of the formation the battery passes to the 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.909
 finishing process where it is cleaned 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:49.310
 test is labeled and the 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.989
 successful combination of technology 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.569
 advanced troy in the components 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.730
 special the rigorous standards of 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.069
 quality and advanced performance 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.049
 manufacturing process guarantee that 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.790
 our batteries offer to the 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.709
