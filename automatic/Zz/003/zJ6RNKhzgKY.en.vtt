gonna<00:00:43.800> get<00:00:43.980> into<00:00:44.190> my<00:00:44.309> reasoning<00:00:44.760> why<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:44.940> kind

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
gonna get into my reasoning why I kind

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.990

of<00:00:45.450> prefer<00:00:45.809> YouTube<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.680> little<00:00:46.980> bit<00:00:47.100> more<00:00:47.579> over

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
of prefer YouTube a little bit more over

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.189 
of prefer YouTube a little bit more over
TV<00:00:49.010> more<00:00:50.010> or<00:00:50.160> less<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.460> enjoy<00:00:51.059> both<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.719> watch

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
TV more or less I enjoy both and I watch

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.040 
TV more or less I enjoy both and I watch
TV<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.649> also<00:00:52.860> watch<00:00:53.640> youtube<00:00:54.030> videos<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.870> first

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
TV I also watch youtube videos the first

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.869 
TV I also watch youtube videos the first
reason<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.410> think<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.890> YouTube<00:00:56.280> kind<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.699> has

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
reason I think that YouTube kind of has

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.549 
reason I think that YouTube kind of has
a<00:00:56.910> little<00:00:57.300> bit<00:00:57.390> more<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.719> an<00:00:57.809> advantage<00:00:58.199> is

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
a little bit more of an advantage is

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.310 
a little bit more of an advantage is
that<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.609> really<00:01:00.329> have<00:01:00.690> content

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
that you can really have content

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.900 
that you can really have content
whenever<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.010> want<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.399> don't<00:01:02.609> really<00:01:02.760> have

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
whenever you want you don't really have

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.570 
whenever you want you don't really have
to<00:01:03.000> wait<00:01:03.329> for<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:04.140> show<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.650> come<00:01:04.920> out<00:01:05.070> every

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
to wait for a show to come out every

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.640 
to wait for a show to come out every
week<00:01:05.820> or<00:01:06.180> for<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:06.960> recorded<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.560> DVR

week or for it to be recorded on the DVR

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
wouldn't really work now that i think

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.869 
wouldn't really work now that i think
about<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.109> but<00:02:54.440> just<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.190> fact<00:02:55.220> that<00:02:55.489> you<00:02:55.639> can

can't be long i don't know i don't know

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.740 
can't be long i don't know i don't know
what<00:03:55.190> it<00:03:55.250> is<00:03:55.340> because<00:03:55.549> TV<00:03:56.060> shows<00:03:56.299> they<00:03:56.540> just

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
what it is because TV shows they just

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.050 
what it is because TV shows they just
they<00:03:57.319> just<00:03:57.349> are<00:03:58.040> so<00:03:58.280> much<00:03:58.430> longer<00:03:58.819> but<00:03:58.940> they

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
they just are so much longer but they

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.849 
they just are so much longer but they
don't<00:03:59.239> feel<00:03:59.569> as<00:03:59.750> long<00:03:59.989> i<00:04:00.260> guess<00:04:00.440> best<00:04:00.680> way<00:04:00.799> to

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
don't feel as long i guess best way to

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:03.580 
don't feel as long i guess best way to
put<00:04:01.099> it<00:04:01.159> is<00:04:01.430> that<00:04:01.459> a<00:04:02.030> 30<00:04:02.419> minute<00:04:02.629> TV<00:04:02.900> show<00:04:03.290> is

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
put it is that a 30 minute TV show is

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.550 
put it is that a 30 minute TV show is
probably<00:04:04.459> about<00:04:04.609> the<00:04:05.000> same<00:04:05.239> feeling<00:04:06.019> as<00:04:06.199> like

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
probably about the same feeling as like

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.159 
probably about the same feeling as like
a<00:04:06.590> 10<00:04:06.949> minutes<00:04:07.329> youtube<00:04:08.329> video<00:04:08.569> in<00:04:08.750> my<00:04:08.900> opinion

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.169 
a 10 minutes youtube video in my opinion

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.140 
a 10 minutes youtube video in my opinion
or<00:04:09.680> 10<00:04:09.979> minutes<00:04:10.159> of<00:04:10.340> watching<00:04:10.430> youtube<00:04:10.940> that's

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
or 10 minutes of watching youtube that's

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.879 
or 10 minutes of watching youtube that's
what<00:04:11.269> it<00:04:11.389> feels<00:04:11.510> like<00:04:11.690> it<00:04:11.840> feels<00:04:11.989> like<00:04:12.139> youtube

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
what it feels like it feels like youtube

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:15.039 
what it feels like it feels like youtube
time<00:04:13.159> is<00:04:13.370> like<00:04:13.549> longer<00:04:14.269> than<00:04:14.569> it<00:04:14.659> actually<00:04:14.810> is

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
time is like longer than it actually is

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.110 
time is like longer than it actually is
so<00:04:15.889> maybe<00:04:16.099> that's<00:04:16.310> an<00:04:16.459> advantage<00:04:16.609> that<00:04:17.030> you

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
so maybe that's an advantage that you

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.810 
so maybe that's an advantage that you
can<00:04:17.239> actually<00:04:17.389> get<00:04:17.930> more<00:04:18.470> content<00:04:19.099> in<00:04:19.310> in<00:04:19.609> a

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
can actually get more content in in a

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.500 
can actually get more content in in a
lesser<00:04:20.539> period<00:04:21.109> in<00:04:21.320> like<00:04:22.060> TV<00:04:23.060> comment<00:04:23.419> just

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
lesser period in like TV comment just

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.450 
lesser period in like TV comment just
drags<00:04:23.900> on<00:04:24.050> a<00:04:24.110> little<00:04:24.380> bit<00:04:24.469> more<00:04:24.620> but<00:04:25.190> it's<00:04:25.310> also

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
drags on a little bit more but it's also

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.590 
drags on a little bit more but it's also
a<00:04:25.610> lot<00:04:25.849> more<00:04:26.090> plan

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
a lot more plan

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.540 
a lot more plan
because<00:04:26.780> we've<00:04:26.930> got<00:04:27.110> these<00:04:27.230> big

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
because we've got these big

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.500 
because we've got these big
organizations<00:04:28.550> just<00:04:28.940> actually<00:04:29.150> like

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
organizations just actually like

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.990 
organizations just actually like
planning<00:04:29.990> out<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.140> whole<00:04:30.700> episode<00:04:31.700> and

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
putting a whole lot of time into it

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.900 
putting a whole lot of time into it
because<00:04:33.950> they're<00:04:34.220> getting<00:04:34.400> paid<00:04:34.430> a<00:04:34.640> lot<00:04:34.880> for
