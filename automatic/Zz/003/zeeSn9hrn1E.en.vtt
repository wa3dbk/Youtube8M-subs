00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
supply routes and advance of Hydra so I

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.470 
supply routes and advance of Hydra so I
think<00:00:50.219> what<00:00:50.460> they're<00:00:50.610> saying<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
think what they're saying is that the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.970 
think what they're saying is that the
first<00:00:51.690> person<00:00:52.110> who<00:00:52.260> got<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.649> grandma's

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
first person who got to grandma's

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.799 
first person who got to grandma's
prestige<00:00:53.340> has<00:00:53.579> got<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.850> arm<00:00:54.059> up<00:00:54.180> right<00:00:54.510> now

prestige has got this arm up right now

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.840 
prestige has got this arm up right now
or<00:00:54.840> he's<00:00:55.110> getting<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.559> right<00:00:55.680> now<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.039> then

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.630 
interesting so this could possibly
redeem<00:01:24.330> for<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.869> five<00:01:25.229> or<00:01:25.500> ten<00:01:25.770> thousand<00:01:26.220> XP

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
redeem for like five or ten thousand XP

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.969 
redeem for like five or ten thousand XP
of<00:01:26.670> course<00:01:26.790> he<00:01:27.150> normally<00:01:27.600> redeems<00:01:28.259> for<00:01:28.470> 2000

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
of course he normally redeems for 2000

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.469 
of course he normally redeems for 2000
XP<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.369> they<00:01:29.460> said<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.909> highest<00:01:30.150> so

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
XP and they said this is the highest so

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.390 
XP and they said this is the highest so
possibly<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.229> could<00:01:31.439> be<00:01:31.680> worth<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.009> lot<00:01:32.250> of

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
possibly it could be worth a lot of

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.560 
possibly it could be worth a lot of
experience<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.909> already<00:01:33.060> see<00:01:33.240> why<00:01:33.360> anyone

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
experience I already see why anyone

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.660 
experience I already see why anyone
would<00:01:33.810> want<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.170> dismantle<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:35.040> legendary

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
would want to dismantle this legendary

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.550 
would want to dismantle this legendary
gear<00:01:36.000> doesn<00:01:36.180> t<00:01:36.329> seem<00:01:36.509> about<00:01:36.869> worth<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.350> once

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
gear doesn t seem about worth it once

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.749 
gear doesn t seem about worth it once
but<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.829> think<00:01:38.100> they<00:01:38.189> definitely<00:01:38.310> make<00:01:38.610> it

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
but I think they definitely make it

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.429 
but I think they definitely make it
worth<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.659> could<00:01:39.810> be<00:01:39.900> worth<00:01:40.020> quite<00:01:40.290> a

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
worth it and this could be worth quite a

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.630 
worth it and this could be worth quite a
lot<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.680> experience<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.340> don't<00:01:41.490> actually

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
lot of experience if you don't actually

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.249 
lot of experience if you don't actually
like<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> look<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.509> if<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.049> want<00:01:43.200> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
like the look of it and if you want to

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.620 
like the look of it and if you want to
get<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> XP<00:01:43.799> instead<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:45.030> top<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.479> new

and these won't be in Supply Drop so
this<00:02:05.520> kind<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.759> makes<00:02:05.880> them<00:02:06.149> more<00:02:06.360> rare<00:02:06.689> more

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
this kind of makes them more rare more

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.499 
this kind of makes them more rare more
exclusive<00:02:07.439> because<00:02:07.619> there

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
kind of like limited edition and they

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.619 
kind of like limited edition and they
won't<00:02:10.310> be<00:02:10.429> available<00:02:10.670> anymore<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.239> get<00:02:11.420> and

won't be available anymore to get and

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.210 
won't be available anymore to get and
also<00:02:12.049> it's<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.260> good<00:02:12.409> things<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:12.799> means<00:02:12.890> less

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
also it's the good things it means less

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.830 
also it's the good things it means less
odds<00:02:13.459> of<00:02:13.640> getting<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:14.030> stuff<00:02:14.239> in<00:02:14.480> Supply<00:02:14.780> Drop

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
odds of getting the stuff in Supply Drop

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.179 
odds of getting the stuff in Supply Drop
so<00:02:15.170> you've<00:02:15.290> got<00:02:15.319> better<00:02:15.530> chance<00:02:15.829> of<00:02:16.040> getting

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189 
so you've got better chance of getting

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:17.319 
so you've got better chance of getting
some<00:02:16.549> of<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.670> other<00:02:16.760> stuff<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.030> have<00:02:17.299> to

a few enlisted ones and a couple bad

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.069 
a few enlisted ones and a couple bad
piece<00:02:43.790> of<00:02:43.909> arm<00:02:44.060> which<00:02:44.209> honestly<00:02:44.390> just<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:44.930> good

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
piece of arm which honestly just a good

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.479 
piece of arm which honestly just a good
thing<00:02:45.260> like<00:02:45.409> I<00:02:45.530> said<00:02:45.739> that<00:02:46.069> means<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:46.370> don't

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
thing like I said that means you don't

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.349 
thing like I said that means you don't
have<00:02:46.519> a<00:02:46.639> chance<00:02:46.849> to<00:02:46.940> get<00:02:47.030> in<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.209> mitten

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
have a chance to get in the mitten

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.119 
have a chance to get in the mitten
surprise<00:02:47.780> anymore<00:02:48.079> and<00:02:48.530> your<00:02:48.620> higher<00:02:48.859> chance

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
surprise anymore and your higher chance

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.470 
surprise anymore and your higher chance
of<00:02:49.220> getting<00:02:49.459> some<00:02:49.609> of<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.760> better<00:02:49.940> stuff<00:02:50.239> and

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
of getting some of the better stuff and

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.330 
of getting some of the better stuff and
honestly<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.230> think<00:02:51.379> a<00:02:51.650> later<00:02:51.889> down<00:02:52.099> the<00:02:52.129> line<00:02:52.220> I

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
honestly I think a later down the line I

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.559 
honestly I think a later down the line I
think<00:02:52.489> we're<00:02:52.700> going<00:02:52.790> to<00:02:52.879> start<00:02:53.030> retiring<00:02:53.420> some

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
think we're going to start retiring some

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.119 
think we're going to start retiring some
good<00:02:53.780> stuff<00:02:54.019> so<00:02:54.230> possibly<00:02:54.680> some<00:02:54.950> elite

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
good stuff so possibly some elite

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.289 
good stuff so possibly some elite
weapons<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.579> they'll<00:02:55.909> make<00:02:55.940> them<00:02:56.180> more

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
weapons and they'll make them more

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:57.819 
weapons and they'll make them more
exclusive<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.079> if<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:57.290> don't<00:02:57.379> have<00:02:57.620> them

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
exclusive so if you don't have them

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.259 
exclusive so if you don't have them
while<00:02:58.040> you<00:02:58.159> can<00:02:58.220> then<00:02:58.790> you'll<00:02:58.909> never<00:02:59.120> be<00:02:59.180> able

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
while you can then you'll never be able

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.640 
while you can then you'll never be able
to<00:02:59.359> get<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.510> never<00:02:59.690> again<00:02:59.959> so<00:03:00.139> what<00:03:00.319> if<00:03:00.379> they<00:03:00.500> did

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
to get a never again so what if they did

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.420 
to get a never again so what if they did
that<00:03:00.680> let<00:03:00.920> me<00:03:00.950> know<00:03:01.010> your<00:03:01.129> thoughts<00:03:01.159> in<00:03:01.370> the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
that let me know your thoughts in the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.129 
that let me know your thoughts in the
comment<00:03:01.730> section<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.090> something<00:03:02.750> else<00:03:02.870> I

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:03.139 
comment section and something else I

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:04.539 
comment section and something else I
thought<00:03:03.349> of<00:03:03.500> is<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:03.799> they<00:03:03.950> might<00:03:04.190> start

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
thought of is that they might start

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.520 
thought of is that they might start
doing<00:03:04.909> a<00:03:05.030> legendary<00:03:05.810> weapons<00:03:06.200> think<00:03:06.409> that's

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
doing a legendary weapons think that's

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.110 
doing a legendary weapons think that's
very<00:03:06.560> likely<00:03:06.739> they<00:03:07.190> open<00:03:07.370> up<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.519> new<00:03:07.549> tier<00:03:07.909> it

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
very likely they open up a new tier it

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.460 
very likely they open up a new tier it
would<00:03:08.450> make<00:03:08.599> sense<00:03:08.629> for<00:03:08.959> them<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.200> introduce

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
would make sense for them to introduce

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.960 
would make sense for them to introduce
leisure<00:03:09.889> new<00:03:10.010> weapons<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:10.609> i<00:03:10.730> thess
