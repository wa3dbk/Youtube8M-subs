00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 and it's everyone today we're going to 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.339
 teach how they should install 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.840
 Reverse sensors in a chevrolet 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.830
 tracker 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.930
 2014 is important that he always use 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.040
 a point of reference for making 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:19.950
 sensor markings and we have you 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:25.440
 we will explain a practical guide for 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:29.310
 that they do it fast and that as it should be 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.109
 initially they should be guided on the line 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.930
 of the separation that this generates 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.100
 respective 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:42.990
 of this order in this line mark two 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.540
 centimeters and a half the first hole 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.620
 after 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.170
 if they realize 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.829
 the defense in half has a line 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.910
 line one doubles 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:04.129
 which marks the center of the vehicle 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:07.040
 from that center in the next 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.580
 dialing equally for the other two 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.830
 sensors that are on the other side and the 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.400
 reversing camera using the same one as 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.760
 that we use in their sensors we upload 2.5 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.820
 centimeters throughout the marked center 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.380
 by the bumper and we drill the camera in 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.840
 if they have a pump chamber 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.800
 good and to have an installation 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.210
 safe and that there are no cables hanging 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.320
 always is good 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.320
 pass the cables 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.350
 and cables come here 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.509
 is returned through this hole 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.400
 it splices with this simply joins 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.210
 the tapes or the two should not be 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.400
 peel nothing 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.110
 these sensors can not you can not 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.520
 expand since they are 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.940
 these devices work with 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.650
 ultrasounds and they can be entered 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.940
 they can get interference if they 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.060
 peel 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.300
 then good the important arrow 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.090
 upwards 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.300
 again these two cables 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:15.319
 it becomes one around here for our egg and 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.360
 now really joins with tape it 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.670
 now return the three cables by the 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.560
 another gap are joined with tape and that 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.959
 way we guarantee that from the cable 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.840
 here will stay here united can you 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.209
 they will be here they passed here they were bridge here 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.720
 they passed here he turned in the goal 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.860
 click and go up to the connections 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.410
 reverse lamp as any sensor 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.190
 on the back you have to take the signal of 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.190
 Reverse light 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.300
 and then you can sell yourself to step on the 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.770
 vehicle 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.740
 and more in the cable from the top 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.069
 for these parts so they do not have to 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.409
 be treading 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.530
 then in the lower part of the 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:02.120
 cable and they take it out on the radio and so 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.420
 have in this case we are installing 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.880
 the multimedia sensor kit 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.940
 these sensors make it appear 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.220
 image the camera and the distance in the 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.470
 same screen in this case we are 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.470
 installing an original screen behind 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.020
 Well that's all there is to have 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.600
 important account in the measures for 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.550
 make the gaps and we will be publishing 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.050
 more instructional videos as soon as 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.050
 we have many thanks to all
