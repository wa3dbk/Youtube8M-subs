 thin and all ten years so 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.309
 in the management of the Moscow region

 find the camera on the object 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.379
 and click there 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.719
 the camera will offer you what it thinks 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.830
 necessary for this exposure

 the shutter speed is also controlled 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.190
 through cupid camera 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.260
 besides 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.980
 correct all shutter settings 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.709
 you need to go there bakiyev 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.389
 the camera menu itself 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:20.429
 from viewing footage 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:22.879
 prices are rather carried out with 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.760
 using three but still located 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.599
 also on the upper interpretation panel 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.849
 recordings despite the fact that this camera is very 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.290
 like a camera she is not 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.980
 capable of creating photos 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.890
 the only thing you can do 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.980
 this is pull out her photo frame president of the row 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.359
 which is fast-moving camera screen 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.939
 be magic conceived large enough but 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.289
 but small 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:45.069
 what panels to use 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.959
 cameras 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.949
 we remind that we sit behind the signature timidly then 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:49.400
 and blood 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.230
 very difficult therefore for more 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.090
 high-quality sharpness monitoring 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.930
 business users external monitor 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.950
 which is quietly connect through in 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.819
 Egypt and also preferably 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.689
 function problem 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:03.680
 often it turned out to be extremely 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.789
 simple 

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:06.879
 There are only four in the US menu. 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:07.810
 contractions 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.690
 the first one is camera settings in 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.069
 which half mood stationary 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.420
 that is, it's dasha time 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.799
 Its name 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.199
 camera setup and fso after 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.659
 own manual balance adjustment 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:22.199
 white setting 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.430
 Exposure the second phase is the settings and here I am 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.499
 I know here you can correct the settings 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:30.240
 RADD microphones adjust settings in 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.539
 dynamic side but also various flexible 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.599
 settings and the most rumored 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.469
 the third contribution of each on the construction record 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:40.010
 here you can select the recording format 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.480
 you can choose dynamic 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.920
 range when offers two 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.470
 option either in read mode profit 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.370
 either in video mode in the same apartment 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.630
 May Fry in Kiev is also selected 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.689
 record settings tab 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:54.709
 you can customize the functions there you 

00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:56.580
 fourth contribution like this is our holiday 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.279
 early 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:59.169
 dynamic range setting 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.429
 luminosity zebra function enabled 

00:05:01.429 --> 00:05:03.609
 Additional and Moscow in general, then this 

00:05:03.609 --> 00:05:06.789
 all the time there was a feeling that the company 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:07.610
 can live 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.300
 wants to do so even 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.909
 those who do not understand the video recording 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:13.319
 were able to in the area 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:14.939
 as quickly as possible 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.069
 however, all this is simplicity 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:19.050
 naturally justified he 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.840
 it is as they say in the box 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.699
 is just a little short 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.150
 videos of purely uncompensated 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.460
 signal look around 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.630
 camera writes images format 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.060
 is right 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.040
 allowing it to be very flexible 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.990
 correct the picture in particular in 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.479
 colors exposure 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.360
 In general, there is nothing bad tissue 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.139
 I can not say anything negative 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.949
 I could not find this camera for a long time 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:42.500
 waited 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.860
 but not worth the money and of course 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.370
 this particular camera is available in our 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.770
 already rolled today
