00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.200
 Good night, good, you ask questions for 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.200
 gentlemen who go then 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.009
 or goodnight friendship worse 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.990
 impossible today with that defeat that that 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:26.669
 win good at result level if 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.050
 we go to the end of the analysis and I think 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.840
 that you have the deepest when 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.210
 deliveries 20 in 12 minutes the rest 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.680
 of the party is already complicated only 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.760
 the result also the sensations that 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.190
 leave the team that is perhaps more 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.210
 worrying that maybe the result is not 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.470
 I do not know, okay 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.000
 I do not agree I think it did not form 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.280
 the sensations but do a reading 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.790
 as deep as that worrying and 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.770
 late when you agree 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.700
 yes frank good night like what 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.660
 would explain to the one who has not seen it 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.250
 This result is so strong because 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.590
 in 15 minutes where you do not play badly 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.290
 we did not fit the goals and finished the 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.210
 party then we had some control of the 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.190
 party but but a fictional control 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.320
 they did not care either what 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.000
 we had and every time they came to 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.370
 our area for those last 30 meters 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.780
 they generate problems in the same way 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.000
 every time we bring their 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.390
 last 30 meters to them they do not 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.890
 we did nothing then then in the end that 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.130
 is the difference between the two 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.680
 equipment is also true that the real 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.630
 has unbalancing players that the 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.520
 elche has no ms griezmann or carlos 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.810
 candle no no we were in second 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.780
 last year and they were in 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.040
 champions in the end that difference not that 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.780
 obviously in a game you can 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.850
 shorten and so we did in the match 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.470
 one way but at specific times to 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.270
 level of shooting at the level of everything I'm 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.979
 sure we 've had so many shots 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.240
 or even more than they are of the 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.550
 matches where we have finished 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.020
 more plays but it's true that they do not 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.250
 we have done nothing but I mean that to 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.770
 level of arrivals they 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.200
 arriving a similar number of times or 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.850
 the best already I say inferior or slightly 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.320
 superior but in number of arrivals I 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.420
 I have a feeling of very 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.580
 similar have logically made us 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.890
 much damage mister that you think has 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.780
 missed the team today 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.640
 all in the absence of the forcefulness that 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.130
 they have had the occasions in the 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.220
 that we have arrived in situations of 30 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.170
 last meters the feeling that 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.490
 we could score and we did not pass it 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.800
 they on the contrary yes that the 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.810
 they transmit why they have those players 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.160
 because solve your second line only 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.870
 two players have more goals than all 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.640
 our team at the end is that kind of 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.540
 things of intensity I do not think the 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.150
 team was intense to where it gave 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.920
 you did not think about making the changes before 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.329
 already with the 2 to 0 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.920
 maybe at rest to try 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:43.569
 vary something I say I did not do them if I 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.280
 I made a mistake making them late because it's a 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.329
 reading that can be but I do not have 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.580
 the feeling that he had changed 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:51.370
 nothing 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.270
 the questions I for my part the last 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.940
 yes 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.680
 how it happened in barcelona you think that this 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.050
 result will not leave any sequel 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.880
 I'm not sure that I'm not sure that 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.550
 fortunately this group if something has 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.540
 is that it gets up very quickly is it has the 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.300
 obligation but also has the 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.180
 character of getting up then we passed 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.650
 a bad day but tomorrow to train well and 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.030
 think and in the next game 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.190
 dominated that is very important shared 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.230
 apart from today's game what 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.560
 conclusion of the last signing of 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.140
 garry milk mÃ©ndez I have and I say 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.540
 with would be to today if it has been closed 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.130
 I do not know but of course today I care 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.290
 very little and I do not have any 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.940
 proof that it's officially mine 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.680
 I have not confirmed the club anything 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.570
 neither is it day to confirm anything 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.250
 tomorrow if it's done or now when I 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.209
 see but they will go but really not 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.630
 I have what I can not do 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.620
 valuation any 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.620
 okay thanks
