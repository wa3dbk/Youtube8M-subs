00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
it's going to be

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.990 
it's going to be

mind basically saying like pumped you
know<00:02:18.120> mine<00:02:18.450> just<00:02:18.750> dominating<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.620> movie

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
know mine just dominating a movie

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.180 
know mine just dominating a movie
basically<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:22.440> it's<00:02:22.769> going<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.950> be

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
basically so it's going to be

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.220 
basically so it's going to be
interesting<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.610> see<00:02:23.700> what<00:02:23.730> happens<00:02:23.849> here

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
interesting to see what happens here

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.930 
interesting to see what happens here
interestingly<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.650> say<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.819> lot

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
interestingly I say that a lot

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.720 
interestingly I say that a lot
interestingly<00:02:27.239> know<00:02:27.659> my<00:02:28.250> movie<00:02:29.250> sending<00:02:29.610> out

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
interestingly know my movie sending out

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.390 
interestingly know my movie sending out
an<00:02:29.970> SCV<00:02:30.480> here<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:31.470> map<00:02:31.650> we<00:02:31.860> see<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.069> lot<00:02:32.370> of

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
an SCV here this map we see a lot of

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.399 
an SCV here this map we see a lot of
random<00:02:32.909> proxies<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.629> stuff<00:02:33.840> usually<00:02:34.230> with

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
random proxies and stuff usually with

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.360 
random proxies and stuff usually with
protoss<00:02:35.420> some<00:02:36.420> with<00:02:36.599> taryn<00:02:36.900> though<00:02:37.280> okay<00:02:38.280> he's

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
protoss some with taryn though okay he's

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.680 
protoss some with taryn though okay he's
not<00:02:38.400> gonna<00:02:38.610> do<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.760> proxy<00:02:39.090> but<00:02:39.209> that's<00:02:39.390> just<00:02:39.540> a

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
not gonna do a proxy but that's just a

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.229 
not gonna do a proxy but that's just a
scout<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:41.310> goes<00:02:41.519> in<00:02:41.670> there<00:02:41.790> he<00:02:41.909> sees<00:02:42.090> that

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
scout so it goes in there he sees that

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.000 
scout so it goes in there he sees that
mind<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.659> going<00:02:42.900> straight<00:02:43.200> for<00:02:43.379> that<00:02:43.440> factory

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
mind is going straight for that factory

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.619 
mind is going straight for that factory
he<00:02:44.459> wasn't<00:02:44.700> going<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:44.879> get<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.000> marine<00:02:45.299> but<00:02:45.510> now

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
he wasn't going to get a marine but now

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.059 
he wasn't going to get a marine but now
that<00:02:45.780> there's<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.989> scout<00:02:46.260> is<00:02:46.410> basing<00:02:46.769> let's<00:02:46.890> get

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
that there's a scout is basing let's get

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.460 
that there's a scout is basing let's get
really<00:02:47.310> he's<00:02:47.459> making<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.030> Reno<00:02:48.420> or<00:02:49.019> maybe<00:02:49.319> he

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
really he's making a Reno or maybe he

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.360 
really he's making a Reno or maybe he
could<00:02:49.620> have<00:02:49.709> just<00:02:49.739> been<00:02:49.950> waiting<00:02:50.069> for<00:02:50.220> the

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
could have just been waiting for the

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.430 
could have just been waiting for the
minerals<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:50.790> guess<00:02:51.000> um<00:02:52.280> so<00:02:53.660> movie<00:02:54.660> yeah<00:02:55.230> we'll

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
minerals I guess um so movie yeah we'll

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.110 
minerals I guess um so movie yeah we'll
be<00:02:55.470> doing<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:55.890> same<00:02:55.920> thing<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:56.790> see<00:02:56.940> this<00:02:57.060> a

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
be doing the same thing you see this a

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.339 
be doing the same thing you see this a

map it's got neutral creep colonies near

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.789 
map it's got neutral creep colonies near
your<00:03:13.140> base<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:14.959> inhibits<00:03:15.959> building<00:03:16.409> for

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
your base so that inhibits building for

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.670 
your base so that inhibits building for
obviously<00:03:17.280> non<00:03:17.519> sir<00:03:17.870> I've<00:03:18.870> really<00:03:19.349> really

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
obviously non sir I've really really

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.879 
obviously non sir I've really really
really<00:03:19.889> really<00:03:20.010> really<00:03:20.280> want<00:03:20.819> to<00:03:20.880> see<00:03:21.060> a

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
really really really want to see a

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.740 
really really really want to see a
sunken<00:03:22.889> colony<00:03:23.280> rush<00:03:23.489> on<00:03:24.030> this<00:03:24.269> map<00:03:24.510> that

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
sunken colony rush on this map that

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.409 
sunken colony rush on this map that
would<00:03:24.870> be<00:03:24.959> awesome<00:03:25.109> but<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:26.030> haven't<00:03:27.030> seen<00:03:27.239> any

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
would be awesome but I haven't seen any

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.300 
would be awesome but I haven't seen any
zerks<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.959> have<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.650> balls<00:03:28.829> to<00:03:29.010> try<00:03:29.129> anything

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
zerks to have the balls to try anything

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.270 
zerks to have the balls to try anything
like<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.549> yet<00:03:30.560> that's<00:03:31.560> this<00:03:31.889> is<00:03:32.099> where<00:03:32.250> I

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
like that yet that's this is where I

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.190 
like that yet that's this is where I
usually<00:03:32.489> see<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:32.910> proxies<00:03:33.389> on<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.930> side

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
usually see the proxies on that side

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.199 
usually see the proxies on that side
base<00:03:34.440> there<00:03:34.650> next<00:03:34.829> to<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.099> but<00:03:35.700> there's<00:03:35.879> a<00:03:35.940> ton

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
base there next to it but there's a ton

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.430 
base there next to it but there's a ton
of<00:03:36.269> minerals<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.859> gas<00:03:38.099> in<00:03:38.430> your<00:03:38.489> main<00:03:38.879> so

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
of minerals and to gas in your main so

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.189 
of minerals and to gas in your main so
you<00:03:40.440> don't<00:03:40.799> necessarily<00:03:41.010> need<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:42.049> you<00:03:43.049> don't

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
you don't necessarily need and you don't

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:46.699 
you don't necessarily need and you don't
necessarily<00:03:43.319> need<00:03:43.620> oh<00:03:44.239> wow<00:03:45.239> okay<00:03:45.840> okay

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
necessarily need oh wow okay okay

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.259 
necessarily need oh wow okay okay
they're<00:03:46.889> both<00:03:47.010> making<00:03:47.160> command<00:03:47.549> centers<00:03:47.819> Wow

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
they're both making command centers Wow

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.000 
they're both making command centers Wow
so<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.720> both<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.410> their<00:03:49.500> bills<00:03:49.709> being

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
so the both of their bills being

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.610 
so the both of their bills being
mirrored<00:03:50.310> again<00:03:50.699> making<00:03:51.690> an<00:03:51.900> extra<00:03:52.109> commencer

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
mirrored again making an extra commencer

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.619 
mirrored again making an extra commencer
in<00:03:52.799> that<00:03:52.949> same<00:03:53.160> corner<00:03:53.430> interestingly<00:03:54.150> so

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
in that same corner interestingly so

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.589 
in that same corner interestingly so
it's<00:03:55.430> safe<00:03:56.430> in<00:03:56.669> their<00:03:56.819> base<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.329> they<00:03:57.449> can

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
it's safe in their base and they can

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.640 
it's safe in their base and they can
still<00:03:58.879> fly<00:03:59.879> it<00:03:59.940> over<00:04:00.120> relatively<00:04:00.569> easily<00:04:00.900> to

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
still fly it over relatively easily to

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.400 
still fly it over relatively easily to
that<00:04:01.799> expansion<00:04:02.699> base<00:04:03.000> near<00:04:03.269> there's<00:04:03.449> so

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
that expansion base near there's so

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.099 
that expansion base near there's so
that's<00:04:04.590> kind<00:04:04.739> of<00:04:04.769> cool<00:04:05.569> anyways<00:04:06.569> as<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:06.840> can

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
that's kind of cool anyways as you can

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.430 
that's kind of cool anyways as you can
see<00:04:07.230> their<00:04:08.030> mind<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.299> movie<00:04:09.690> well<00:04:10.230> it<00:04:10.319> looked

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
see their mind and movie well it looked

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.569 
see their mind and movie well it looked
like<00:04:10.530> just<00:04:10.709> mine<00:04:10.919> was<00:04:11.190> taking<00:04:11.489> out<00:04:11.519> that

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
like just mine was taking out that

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.300 
like just mine was taking out that
summer<00:04:12.269> colony<00:04:12.629> to<00:04:12.930> get<00:04:13.889> rid<00:04:14.010> of<00:04:14.040> some<00:04:14.160> of<00:04:14.190> that

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
summer colony to get rid of some of that

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.370 
summer colony to get rid of some of that
creep<00:04:14.519> there<00:04:16.639> any<00:04:17.639> case<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:18.630> was<00:04:19.109> talking

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
creep there any case so I was talking

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.360 
creep there any case so I was talking
about<00:04:19.530> something<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.859> minute<00:04:19.949> ago<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.340> I

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
about something a minute ago and I

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.879 
about something a minute ago and I
forgot<00:04:20.639> what<00:04:20.789> it<00:04:20.880> is<00:04:20.970> now

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
forgot what it is now

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.679 
forgot what it is now
anyways<00:04:23.889> oh<00:04:24.189> yeah<00:04:24.939> now<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.180> map<00:04:25.389> there's

00:04:25.679 --> 00:04:25.689 
anyways oh yeah now the map there's

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:27.510 
anyways oh yeah now the map there's
there's<00:04:26.020> a<00:04:26.080> ton<00:04:26.259> of<00:04:26.289> minerals<00:04:26.650> and<00:04:26.949> gas<00:04:27.189> so<00:04:27.490> it

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
there's a ton of minerals and gas so it

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.580 
there's a ton of minerals and gas so it
makes<00:04:28.060> for<00:04:28.270> some<00:04:28.389> long<00:04:28.569> games<00:04:28.599> sometimes<00:04:29.259> but

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
makes for some long games sometimes but

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.740 
makes for some long games sometimes but
then<00:04:29.770> again<00:04:29.889> there's<00:04:30.340> also<00:04:30.520> a<00:04:30.939> little<00:04:31.419> niche

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
then again there's also a little niche

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.559 
then again there's also a little niche
for<00:04:32.110> proxies<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:32.979> you<00:04:33.849> see<00:04:34.000> some<00:04:34.150> interesting

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:34.569 
for proxies and you see some interesting

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:35.909 
for proxies and you see some interesting
stuff<00:04:34.750> there<00:04:34.780> too<00:04:35.080> obviously<00:04:35.409> no<00:04:35.590> one's<00:04:35.740> going

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
stuff there too obviously no one's going

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.850 
stuff there too obviously no one's going
for<00:04:36.069> prox<00:04:36.310> at<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.550> moment<00:04:37.199> just<00:04:38.199> both<00:04:38.439> kind<00:04:38.770> of

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
for prox at the moment just both kind of

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.490 
for prox at the moment just both kind of
going<00:04:39.370> for<00:04:40.090> a<00:04:40.120> long-term<00:04:40.389> strategy<00:04:41.229> it<00:04:41.319> looks

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
going for a long-term strategy it looks

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.700 
going for a long-term strategy it looks
like<00:04:41.849> both<00:04:42.849> the<00:04:43.120> getting<00:04:43.419> expansion<00:04:44.110> getting

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
like both the getting expansion getting

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.070 
like both the getting expansion getting
that<00:04:44.830> extra<00:04:44.949> command<00:04:45.400> center<00:04:45.669> both<00:04:46.240> just<00:04:46.780> kind

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
that extra command center both just kind

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.659 
that extra command center both just kind
of<00:04:47.110> tacking<00:04:47.500> up<00:04:47.620> they<00:04:48.099> only<00:04:48.250> have<00:04:48.430> a<00:04:48.460> few

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
of tacking up they only have a few

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.339 
of tacking up they only have a few
Marines<00:04:49.000> on<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.210> ground<00:04:49.300> one<00:04:49.750> vulture<00:04:50.169> for

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
Marines on the ground one vulture for

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:52.830 
Marines on the ground one vulture for
each<00:04:50.439> of<00:04:50.620> them<00:04:50.939> so<00:04:51.939> what<00:04:52.210> what<00:04:52.449> I'm<00:04:52.539> thinking

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
each of them so what what I'm thinking

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.429 
each of them so what what I'm thinking
is<00:04:52.930> they'll<00:04:53.110> probably<00:04:53.349> end<00:04:53.680> up<00:04:55.169> getting<00:04:56.169> a<00:04:56.259> few

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:56.439 
is they'll probably end up getting a few

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:58.110 
is they'll probably end up getting a few
units<00:04:56.740> then<00:04:56.979> getting<00:04:57.250> that<00:04:57.370> expansion<00:04:57.789> down

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
units then getting that expansion down

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.969 
units then getting that expansion down
and<00:04:58.389> then<00:04:58.810> going<00:04:59.169> into<00:04:59.319> macro<00:04:59.650> mode<00:04:59.770> while

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
and then going into macro mode while

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.800 
and then going into macro mode while
both<00:05:00.250> of<00:05:00.279> their<00:05:00.550> command<00:05:01.210> centers<00:05:01.449> finishing

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
both of their command centers finishing

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.070 
both of their command centers finishing
it<00:05:01.960> almost<00:05:02.169> exactly<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:02.800> same<00:05:02.889> point<00:05:03.960> so<00:05:04.960> yeah

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
it almost exactly the same point so yeah

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.969 
it almost exactly the same point so yeah
they're<00:05:05.259> probably<00:05:05.409> gonna<00:05:05.590> start<00:05:05.830> putting

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
they're probably gonna start putting

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.879 
they're probably gonna start putting
down<00:05:06.250> more<00:05:07.000> factories<00:05:07.569> as<00:05:07.750> soon<00:05:08.469> as<00:05:08.590> they<00:05:08.740> get

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
down more factories as soon as they get

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.990 
down more factories as soon as they get
those<00:05:09.129> expansions<00:05:09.580> going<00:05:10.150> or<00:05:10.360> or<00:05:10.599> even<00:05:10.629> sooner

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
those expansions going or or even sooner

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.100 
those expansions going or or even sooner
we'll<00:05:13.000> be<00:05:13.120> putting<00:05:13.300> down<00:05:13.509> an<00:05:13.599> engineering<00:05:13.960> Bay

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
we'll be putting down an engineering Bay

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.070 
we'll be putting down an engineering Bay
interestingly<00:05:14.430> might<00:05:15.430> be<00:05:15.550> expecting<00:05:16.180> a<00:05:16.210> drops

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
interestingly might be expecting a drops

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.010 
interestingly might be expecting a drops
later<00:05:17.409> a<00:05:17.819> terran<00:05:18.819> vs<00:05:19.060> terran<00:05:19.240> you<00:05:19.419> do<00:05:19.569> see<00:05:19.750> a

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
later a terran vs terran you do see a

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.200 
later a terran vs terran you do see a
lot<00:05:20.439> of<00:05:20.469> drop<00:05:20.800> ships<00:05:21.069> especially<00:05:21.699> on<00:05:21.819> map<00:05:22.000> like

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
lot of drop ships especially on map like

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.519 
lot of drop ships especially on map like
this<00:05:22.240> it's<00:05:22.750> probably<00:05:22.930> going<00:05:23.169> to<00:05:23.229> be<00:05:23.289> useful

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:23.529 
this it's probably going to be useful

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:25.559 
this it's probably going to be useful
this<00:05:24.129> is<00:05:24.279> very<00:05:24.460> convoluted<00:05:24.789> map<00:05:25.180> there's<00:05:25.509> a

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:25.569 
this is very convoluted map there's a

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.059 
this is very convoluted map there's a
lot<00:05:25.719> of<00:05:25.750> twists<00:05:26.169> and<00:05:26.259> turns<00:05:26.469> and<00:05:26.740> what<00:05:26.949> have

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
lot of twists and turns and what have

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.629 
lot of twists and turns and what have
you<00:05:27.099> a<00:05:27.849> lot<00:05:28.240> of<00:05:28.360> land<00:05:28.599> routes<00:05:28.839> that<00:05:29.139> go<00:05:29.580> kind<00:05:30.580> of

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
you a lot of land routes that go kind of

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.450 
you a lot of land routes that go kind of
around<00:05:30.969> the<00:05:31.539> side<00:05:31.750> and<00:05:32.080> a<00:05:32.169> lot<00:05:32.349> of<00:05:32.469> options<00:05:33.219> for

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
around the side and a lot of options for

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.170 
around the side and a lot of options for
flanking<00:05:33.819> what<00:05:34.180> have<00:05:34.330> you<00:05:35.789> by<00:05:36.789> the<00:05:36.849> way<00:05:37.029> if<00:05:37.089> you

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
flanking what have you by the way if you

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.999 
flanking what have you by the way if you
heard<00:05:37.330> that<00:05:37.360> beeping<00:05:37.810> in<00:05:37.900> the<00:05:37.930> background<00:05:38.110> no

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
heard that beeping in the background no

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.040 
heard that beeping in the background no
it's<00:05:39.279> not<00:05:39.370> porn<00:05:39.759> downloads<00:05:40.270> that<00:05:40.599> would<00:05:40.779> be<00:05:40.900> my

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
it's not porn downloads that would be my

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.719 
it's not porn downloads that would be my
TV<00:05:41.500> dinner<00:05:41.650> so<00:05:41.919> as<00:05:42.129> soon<00:05:42.279> as<00:05:42.430> this<00:05:42.520> game<00:05:42.669> is

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
TV dinner so as soon as this game is

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.719 
TV dinner so as soon as this game is
over<00:05:43.029> I<00:05:43.089> get<00:05:43.240> to<00:05:43.330> have<00:05:43.449> dinner<00:05:43.949> any<00:05:44.949> case<00:05:45.159> so

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
over I get to have dinner any case so

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:46.890 
over I get to have dinner any case so
there's<00:05:45.909> a<00:05:45.969> lot<00:05:46.089> of<00:05:46.150> twists<00:05:46.479> and<00:05:46.599> turns<00:05:46.719> and

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
there's a lot of twists and turns and

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.300 
there's a lot of twists and turns and
you<00:05:47.020> can<00:05:47.169> see<00:05:47.379> right<00:05:47.409> there<00:05:47.860> with<00:05:48.190> the

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
you can see right there with the

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.959 
you can see right there with the
barracks<00:05:49.270> floating<00:05:49.629> over<00:05:49.930> the<00:05:50.610> just<00:05:51.610> the<00:05:51.759> map

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:51.969 
barracks floating over the just the map

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:54.420 
barracks floating over the just the map
features<00:05:52.419> lots<00:05:53.050> of<00:05:53.259> ridges<00:05:53.680> and<00:05:53.710> things<00:05:54.099> and

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
features lots of ridges and things and

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.279 
features lots of ridges and things and
so<00:05:54.639> it's<00:05:54.879> relatively<00:05:55.689> hard<00:05:55.960> to<00:05:56.050> get<00:05:56.169> your

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
so it's relatively hard to get your

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.279 
so it's relatively hard to get your
troops<00:05:56.650> around<00:05:56.889> in<00:05:57.099> a<00:05:57.189> long<00:05:57.460> game<00:05:57.819> where<00:05:58.509> your

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.289 
troops around in a long game where your

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:00.629 
troops around in a long game where your
expanded<00:05:59.770> across<00:05:59.860> the<00:06:00.159> map<00:06:00.339> you<00:06:00.460> can<00:06:00.580> see

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
expanded across the map you can see

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.059 
expanded across the map you can see
there's<00:06:00.939> that<00:06:01.120> kind<00:06:01.240> of<00:06:01.330> central<00:06:01.779> lane<00:06:02.069> that

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:03.069 
there's that kind of central lane that

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:05.339 
there's that kind of central lane that
goes<00:06:03.729> up<00:06:03.879> the<00:06:03.969> middle<00:06:04.120> so<00:06:04.810> it<00:06:04.930> makes<00:06:05.110> for

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349 
goes up the middle so it makes for

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:07.350 
goes up the middle so it makes for
relatively<00:06:06.069> short<00:06:06.339> distance<00:06:06.400> actually<00:06:07.120> for

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
relatively short distance actually for

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.450 
relatively short distance actually for
for<00:06:07.900> troops<00:06:08.110> to<00:06:08.229> go<00:06:08.349> in<00:06:08.529> early<00:06:08.650> game<00:06:09.009> but

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
for troops to go in early game but

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.779 
for troops to go in early game but
late-game<00:06:10.050> it<00:06:11.050> turns<00:06:11.409> it<00:06:11.740> turns<00:06:12.159> into<00:06:12.310> a<00:06:12.430> very

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
late-game it turns it turns into a very

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.459 
late-game it turns it turns into a very
big<00:06:13.000> map<00:06:13.180> because<00:06:13.569> of<00:06:13.689> all<00:06:13.810> those<00:06:13.960> twists<00:06:14.349> and

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:14.469 
big map because of all those twists and

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:17.610 
big map because of all those twists and
turns<00:06:14.620> so<00:06:15.389> it<00:06:16.389> looks<00:06:16.539> like<00:06:16.599> we'll<00:06:17.349> be<00:06:17.379> sending

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
turns so it looks like we'll be sending

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.170 
turns so it looks like we'll be sending
in<00:06:17.800> his<00:06:17.889> barracks<00:06:18.219> they're<00:06:18.400> trying<00:06:19.029> to<00:06:19.089> get

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
in his barracks they're trying to get

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.610 
in his barracks they're trying to get
asked<00:06:19.330> out<00:06:19.419> in<00:06:19.599> and<00:06:19.779> you<00:06:20.169> see<00:06:20.349> there's<00:06:20.529> like

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
asked out in and you see there's like

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.320 
asked out in and you see there's like
there's<00:06:20.860> random<00:06:21.279> neutral<00:06:21.819> buildings<00:06:22.150> and

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
there's random neutral buildings and

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.110 
there's random neutral buildings and
stuff<00:06:22.449> which<00:06:22.659> come<00:06:22.810> into<00:06:22.930> play
