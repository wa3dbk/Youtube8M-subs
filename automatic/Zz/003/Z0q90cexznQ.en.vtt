00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
that is making telly tabs so to do this

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.950 
that is making telly tabs so to do this
it'd<00:00:18.240> be<00:00:18.480> best<00:00:18.690> if<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:18.960> had<00:00:19.080> your<00:00:19.380> own<00:00:19.789> lectern

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
it'd be best if you had your own lectern

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.140 
it'd be best if you had your own lectern
I<00:00:21.990> have<00:00:22.769> my<00:00:22.949> own<00:00:22.980> lecture<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.699> have<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
I have my own lecture and I have the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.720 
I have my own lecture and I have the
best<00:00:24.330> one<00:00:24.720> mahogany<00:00:25.140> eagle<00:00:25.830> lectern<00:00:26.220> and

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
best one mahogany eagle lectern and

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.070 
best one mahogany eagle lectern and
that's<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.090> one<00:00:27.240> where<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.630> make<00:00:27.779> all

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
that's the one where you can make all

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.169 
that's the one where you can make all
the<00:00:28.289> tabs<00:00:28.560> including<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.340> house<00:00:29.490> teleport

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the tabs including the house teleport

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.580 
the tabs including the house teleport
tabs<00:00:30.420> which<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.080> what<00:00:31.260> I'll<00:00:31.380> be<00:00:31.590> making<00:00:33.590> but

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
tabs which is what I'll be making but

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.459 
tabs which is what I'll be making but
also<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:35.430> lots<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.210> people<00:00:36.480> by<00:00:36.600> varrock<00:00:37.110> tele

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
also it's lots of people by varrock tele

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.430 
also it's lots of people by varrock tele
tabs<00:00:37.829> maybe<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.550> few<00:00:38.940> by<00:00:39.239> Camelot<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:39.989> falador

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
tabs maybe a few by Camelot and falador

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.040 
tabs maybe a few by Camelot and falador
tabs<00:00:40.800> but<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.730> think<00:00:42.059> it'd<00:00:42.210> be<00:00:42.239> best<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.899> either

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
tabs but I think it'd be best to either

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.490 
tabs but I think it'd be best to either
make<00:00:43.350> couch<00:00:43.590> tabs<00:00:44.010> or<00:00:44.340> varrock<00:00:44.760> tabs<00:00:45.590> boom<00:00:46.730> so

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
make couch tabs or varrock tabs boom so

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.779 
make couch tabs or varrock tabs boom so
let's<00:00:49.500> look<00:00:49.620> at<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> construction<00:00:50.280> levels

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
let's look at the construction levels

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.110 
let's look at the construction levels
you<00:00:50.910> need<00:00:51.379> to<00:00:52.379> make<00:00:53.960> varrock<00:00:54.960> tab<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.590> need

I think earth and air rooms around the
same<00:02:50.230> price<00:02:50.410> earth<00:02:51.100> wings<00:02:51.459> might<00:02:51.910> be<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.150> little

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
same price earth wings might be a little

00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:01.410 
same price earth wings might be a little
bit<00:02:52.480> more<00:02:52.720> expensive<00:02:58.380> so<00:02:59.380> oops<00:03:00.090> that's<00:03:01.090> a

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
bit more expensive so oops that's a

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.030 
bit more expensive so oops that's a
wrong<00:03:01.630> tab<00:03:02.080> I<00:03:04.500> didn't<00:03:05.500> even<00:03:05.590> know<00:03:05.740> you<00:03:05.800> can

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
wrong tab I didn't even know you can

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.619 
wrong tab I didn't even know you can
make<00:03:06.160> watchtower<00:03:06.820> tabs

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:25.110 

I<00:03:12.659> shall<00:03:13.499> make<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.680> few<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.040> those

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.720 

but<00:03:25.660> you<00:03:25.750> get<00:03:25.870> matching<00:03:26.319> experiences<00:03:27.040> so<00:03:27.340> for

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
but you get matching experiences so for

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.369 
but you get matching experiences so for
each<00:03:28.410> house<00:03:29.410> teleport<00:03:30.250> let's<00:03:30.610> see<00:03:31.140> okay<00:03:32.140> man

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
each house teleport let's see okay man

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:38.880 
each house teleport let's see okay man
sixty-eight<00:03:35.190> house<00:03:36.190> teleport<00:03:37.470> so<00:03:38.470> thirty

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
sixty-eight house teleport so thirty

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.580 
sixty-eight house teleport so thirty
experience<00:03:39.459> her<00:03:39.819> house<00:03:40.090> teleport<00:03:40.810> tab<00:03:41.260> you

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
experience her house teleport tab you

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.910 
experience her house teleport tab you
make<00:03:44.160> think<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.280> experience<00:03:45.760> varies<00:03:46.150> per<00:03:46.390> tab

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
make think the experience varies per tab

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.979 
make think the experience varies per tab
so<00:03:48.030> that's<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.150> downside<00:03:49.299> if<00:03:49.720> you're<00:03:49.840> making

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
so that's the downside if you're making

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.930 
so that's the downside if you're making
varrock<00:03:50.440> tabs<00:03:50.739> you're<00:03:51.459> not<00:03:51.580> going<00:03:51.730> to<00:03:51.790> be

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
varrock tabs you're not going to be

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.259 
varrock tabs you're not going to be
getting<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:52.450> most<00:03:52.720> experience<00:03:57.090> that's<00:03:58.090> the

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
getting the most experience that's the

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:05.790 
getting the most experience that's the
only<00:03:58.480> downside

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.640 

and<00:04:06.370> when<00:04:06.520> you're<00:04:06.640> done<00:04:06.790> just<00:04:07.530> teleport<00:04:08.530> to
