00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
ill-equipped thick and totaled it will

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.550 
ill-equipped thick and totaled it will
be<00:01:05.120> eight<00:01:06.409> yes<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.860> if<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.940> want<00:01:09.320> this<00:01:10.320> is

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
be eight yes and if you want this is

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.920 
be eight yes and if you want this is
totally<00:01:11.100> optional<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:12.150> put<00:01:12.510> double

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
totally optional you can put double

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.640 
totally optional you can put double
layers<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.580> back<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.790> later<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.330> here<00:01:15.650> too

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
layers on it back to later in here too

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.600 
layers on it back to later in here too
so<00:01:17.190> that<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.490> could<00:01:17.729> stay<00:01:18.690> strong<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:20.220> if<00:01:20.340> that

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
so that it could stay strong but if that

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.270 
so that it could stay strong but if that
doesn't<00:01:20.640> work<00:01:21.119> then<00:01:21.600> put<00:01:22.229> an<00:01:22.380> X<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.979> bottom

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
doesn't work then put an X on the bottom

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.240 
doesn't work then put an X on the bottom
right<00:01:23.430> foot<00:01:24.409> as<00:01:25.409> if<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.710> seems<00:01:25.950> there's

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
right foot as if it seems there's

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.039 
right foot as if it seems there's
nothing<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.760> bottom<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.510> then<00:01:27.690> make<00:01:27.900> it

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
nothing on the bottom so then make it

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.190 
nothing on the bottom so then make it
back

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.679 

to<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> other<00:01:32.310> end<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.939> then<00:01:33.180> make<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> play

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
to the other end and then make a play

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.600 
to the other end and then make a play
around<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.439> maybe<00:01:34.950> that'll<00:01:35.310> make<00:01:35.399> it<00:01:35.520> safe

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
around it and maybe that'll make it safe

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.510 
around it and maybe that'll make it safe
I'd<00:01:38.610> rather<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.090> use<00:01:39.360> another<00:01:40.289> option<00:01:40.890> like

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
I'd rather you use another option like

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.850 
I'd rather you use another option like
another<00:01:41.880> material<00:01:42.299> instead<00:01:42.929> of<00:01:43.409> popsicle

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
another material instead of popsicle

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.520 
another material instead of popsicle
sticks<00:01:44.000> mm-hmm<00:01:45.000> but<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:46.079> just<00:01:46.229> made<00:01:46.500> it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
sticks mm-hmm but we just made it

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.870 
sticks mm-hmm but we just made it
because<00:01:46.860> now<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.009> only<00:01:47.250> thing<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:47.579> had<00:01:47.789> yes<00:01:49.880> so

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
because now the only thing we had yes so

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.450 
because now the only thing we had yes so
then<00:01:51.060> grab<00:01:51.329> your<00:01:51.360> vision<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.429> wedge<00:01:53.429> it

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
then grab your vision and wedge it

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.929 
then grab your vision and wedge it
between<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:55.380> two<00:01:55.679> popsicle<00:01:56.250> sticks<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.909> are

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
between the two popsicle sticks that are

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.899 
between the two popsicle sticks that are
layers<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.869> actually<00:01:58.079> use<00:01:58.560> three<00:01:59.340> popsicle

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
layers we actually use three popsicle

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.910 
layers we actually use three popsicle
sticks<00:02:00.119> for<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.539> and<00:02:00.990> build<00:02:01.380> them<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.619> each

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
sticks for this and build them to each

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.600 
sticks for this and build them to each
end<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:03.020> put<00:02:04.020> another<00:02:04.110> layer<00:02:04.470> then<00:02:05.340> look<00:02:05.459> for

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
end and put another layer then look for

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.710 
end and put another layer then look for
what<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.849> just<00:02:05.880> between<00:02:07.580> try<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.640> try<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.450> put
