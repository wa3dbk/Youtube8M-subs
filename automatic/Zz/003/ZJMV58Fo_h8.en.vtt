the<00:01:34.440> Moon<00:01:34.649> map<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.130> terms<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.429> sound<00:01:35.580> design<00:01:35.940> is

the Moon map in terms of sound design is

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.389

the<00:01:36.479> airless<00:01:36.840> environment<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.590> significantly

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
the airless environment it significantly

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:39.980 
the airless environment it significantly
changes<00:01:38.850> how<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.000> game<00:01:39.119> sounds<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.869> that's

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
changes how the game sounds and that's

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.300 
changes how the game sounds and that's
gonna<00:01:40.200> force<00:01:40.500> people<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.800> play<00:01:41.069> a<00:01:41.100> different

gonna force people to play a different

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.040 
gonna force people to play a different
way<00:01:43.729> we<00:01:44.729> thought<00:01:44.970> originally<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.929> would

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
way we thought originally that it would

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.930 
way we thought originally that it would
make<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.409> easy<00:01:46.679> the<00:01:47.190> things<00:01:47.550> would<00:01:47.700> slow<00:01:47.909> down

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
make it easy the things would slow down

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.210 
make it easy the things would slow down
and<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.750> have<00:01:48.899> time<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.259> shoot<00:01:49.409> zombies<00:01:49.470> and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
actually quite the opposite street

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.059 
actually quite the opposite street
because<00:01:51.750> everybody's<00:01:52.259> floating<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:52.950> no

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
because everybody's floating you have no

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.830
