garage<00:00:08.730> in<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:09.059> episode<00:00:09.630> we're<00:00:09.840> working

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
garage in this episode we're working

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.330 
garage in this episode we're working
again<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:11.040> our<00:00:11.130> r32<00:00:11.880> skyline<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:12.690> GTR<00:00:13.500> now<00:00:14.280> the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
again and our r32 skyline a GTR now the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.070 
again and our r32 skyline a GTR now the
overall<00:00:14.580> combination<00:00:15.540> on<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:15.780> car<00:00:15.990> is

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
overall combination on this car is

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.080 
overall combination on this car is
pretty<00:00:16.410> much<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:17.010> way<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.160> we<00:00:17.400> want<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.730> from

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
pretty much the way that we want it from

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.120 
pretty much the way that we want it from
here<00:00:18.390> on<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:18.720> it's<00:00:18.930> all<00:00:19.170> about<00:00:19.380> tweaking<00:00:19.980> that

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
here on in it's all about tweaking that

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.820 
here on in it's all about tweaking that
combination<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.090> make<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.510> perfect<00:00:22.140> now<00:00:22.560> since

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
combination to make it perfect now since

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.470 
combination to make it perfect now since
our<00:00:22.949> last<00:00:23.160> episode<00:00:23.730> we've<00:00:23.880> fitted<00:00:24.090> up<00:00:24.300> some

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
our last episode we've fitted up some

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.609 
our last episode we've fitted up some
achilles<00:00:24.930> 1<00:00:25.470> 2<00:00:25.830> 3<00:00:26.099> s<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.720> 65/35<00:00:27.750> 18-inch<00:00:28.349> tires

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
achilles 1 2 3 s to 65/35 18-inch tires

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.400 
achilles 1 2 3 s to 65/35 18-inch tires
so<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> car<00:00:29.429> has<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> whole<00:00:30.090> lot<00:00:30.720> more<00:00:31.050> grip

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
so the car has a whole lot more grip

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.290 
so the car has a whole lot more grip
which<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.830> not<00:00:32.009> only<00:00:32.219> good<00:00:32.369> for<00:00:32.399> cornering<00:00:33.000> but

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
which is not only good for cornering but

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.930 
which is not only good for cornering but
for<00:00:33.450> acceleration<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.140> braking<00:00:34.800> as<00:00:35.130> well<00:00:35.430> now

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
for acceleration and braking as well now

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.520 
for acceleration and braking as well now
in<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.180> episode<00:00:36.390> we're<00:00:36.840> going<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.020> focus<00:00:37.230> on

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
in this episode we're going to focus on

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.990 
in this episode we're going to focus on
putting<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> new<00:00:38.129> exhaust<00:00:38.430> system<00:00:38.910> and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
putting on a new exhaust system and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.940 
putting on a new exhaust system and
reaching<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.140> car<00:00:40.350> for<00:00:40.530> more<00:00:40.710> mid-range

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
reaching in the car for more mid-range

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.470 
reaching in the car for more mid-range
and<00:00:41.430> top-end<00:00:41.760> power

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
and top-end power

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.900 
and top-end power
the<00:00:43.350> first<00:00:43.680> step<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.129> more<00:00:44.309> power<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.850> better

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
the first step to more power and better

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.180 
the first step to more power and better
drivability<00:00:45.780> was<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> new<00:00:46.260> exhaust<00:00:46.559> system<00:00:46.739> as

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
drivability was a new exhaust system as

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.340 
drivability was a new exhaust system as
we<00:00:47.430> were<00:00:47.550> suspect<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> old<00:00:48.570> one<00:00:48.809> when<00:00:49.200> the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
the car now sounds what kikyo it used to

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.490 
the car now sounds what kikyo it used to
sound<00:01:54.010> stock<00:01:54.460> but<00:01:54.880> an<00:01:54.970> RB<00:01:55.240> 26<00:01:55.840> needs<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.380> be
