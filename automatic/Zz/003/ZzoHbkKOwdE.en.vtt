00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
to the 36 hours time difference which in

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.060 
to the 36 hours time difference which in
itself<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.660> not<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.840> big<00:00:45.989> challenge<00:00:46.230> especially

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
itself is not a big challenge especially

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.900 
itself is not a big challenge especially
flying<00:00:48.230> flying<00:00:49.230> East<00:00:49.620> but<00:00:50.400> it<00:00:50.489> becomes<00:00:50.760> a

flying flying East but it becomes a

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.030 
flying flying East but it becomes a
little<00:00:51.090> trickier<00:00:51.720> with<00:00:52.080> this<00:00:52.230> one<00:00:52.440> because<00:00:52.770> of

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
little trickier with this one because of

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.960 
little trickier with this one because of
the<00:00:53.840> actual<00:00:54.840> flight<00:00:55.320> duration<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.580> had<00:00:56.940> to

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
the actual flight duration so I had to

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.720 
the actual flight duration so I had to
add<00:00:57.300> these<00:00:57.510> guys<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:58.470> a<00:00:58.650> wash<00:00:58.860> to<00:00:59.160> join<00:00:59.610> his

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
add these guys just a wash to join his

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
book time as soon as we had as soon as

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.380 
book time as soon as we had as soon as
we<00:01:02.580> took<00:01:02.699> off<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.180> then<00:01:04.760> try<00:01:05.760> them<00:01:05.910> and<00:01:06.149> try<00:01:06.330> to

we took off and then try them and try to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.340 
we took off and then try them and try to
make<00:01:06.509> sure<00:01:06.690> that<00:01:06.869> they<00:01:06.960> would<00:01:07.110> sleep

according<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.310> Johnny's<00:01:09.090> bolt<00:01:09.270> onto<00:01:09.509> so<00:01:10.020> which

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
according to Johnny's bolt onto so which

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.480 
according to Johnny's bolt onto so which
meant<00:01:11.190> waking<00:01:11.940> them<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.530> at<00:01:13.530> times<00:01:13.979> where<00:01:14.250> they

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
meant waking them up at times where they

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.820 
meant waking them up at times where they
probably<00:01:14.910> didn't<00:01:15.270> feel<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.509> being<00:01:16.170> woken<00:01:16.590> up

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
probably didn't feel like being woken up

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.300 
probably didn't feel like being woken up
jet<00:01:17.310> lag<00:01:17.550> also<00:01:17.940> is<00:01:18.119> affected<00:01:18.690> by<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.930> noise

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
jet lag also is affected by the noise

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.590 
jet lag also is affected by the noise
and<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:21.119> exposure<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.290> light<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.860> if<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.600> she

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600

and the exposure to light so if you she
spent<00:01:24.840> 18<00:01:25.080> hours<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.530> dark<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:26.430> probably

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
spent 18 hours in the dark it's probably

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.040 
spent 18 hours in the dark it's probably
not<00:01:26.910> going<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.119> help<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.479> try<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.750> open<00:01:27.899> the

game<00:02:30.770> so<00:02:31.040> we<00:02:31.850> try<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.000> put<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.300> stress<00:02:32.570> to<00:02:32.720> the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
game so we try to put the stress to the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.470 
game so we try to put the stress to the
speed<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.680> know<00:02:33.800> we<00:02:34.130> try<00:02:34.459> to<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:35.360> the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
speed you know we try to to the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.870 
speed you know we try to to the
intensity<00:02:36.350> is<00:02:36.470> going<00:02:36.770> up<00:02:36.950> duration<00:02:37.520> is<00:02:37.640> going

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
intensity is going up duration is going

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.030 
intensity is going up duration is going
down<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.480> then<00:02:38.630> just<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.930> obviously<00:02:39.860> as

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
down and then just the obviously as

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.520 
down and then just the obviously as
intensity<00:02:40.850> goes<00:02:40.880> up<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:41.660> speed<00:02:41.989> at<00:02:42.110> which<00:02:42.140> we

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
intensity goes up to speed at which we

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.970 
intensity goes up to speed at which we
do<00:02:42.709> movements<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.790> speed<00:02:44.030> at<00:02:44.150> weeks<00:02:44.360> we<00:02:44.830> we<00:02:45.830> end

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
do movements to speed at weeks we we end

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.620 
do movements to speed at weeks we we end
up<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.340> two<00:02:46.489> walmart<00:02:46.880> at<00:02:47.000> practice<00:02:47.330> all<00:02:47.480> of

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
up the two walmart at practice all of

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.620 
up the two walmart at practice all of
these<00:02:47.780> increases<00:02:48.320> you<00:02:48.470> know<00:02:48.850> so<00:02:49.850> that<00:02:49.880> we've

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
these increases you know so that we've

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.479 
these increases you know so that we've
done<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.840> lot<00:02:50.930> of<00:02:51.110> like<00:02:51.620> like<00:02:51.830> low<00:02:52.190> hurdles

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
done a lot of like like low hurdles

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.540 
done a lot of like like low hurdles
reaction<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.570> signal<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:54.440> know<00:02:54.530> try<00:02:55.489> to

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
reaction to a signal you know try to

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.210 
reaction to a signal you know try to
incorporate<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:56.090> little<00:02:56.300> more<00:02:56.600> of<00:02:57.100> what<00:02:58.100> the

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
incorporate a little more of what the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.250 
incorporate a little more of what the
game<00:02:58.400> is<00:02:58.430> made<00:02:58.730> of<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.180> at<00:02:59.600> these<00:02:59.780> guys<00:02:59.989> you

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
game is made of and at these guys you

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.810 
game is made of and at these guys you
know<00:03:00.380> reactor<00:03:00.860> now<00:03:01.250> we're<00:03:01.430> going<00:03:01.580> to<00:03:01.640> try<00:03:01.790> to

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
know reactor now we're going to try to

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.090 
know reactor now we're going to try to
crank<00:03:02.239> it<00:03:02.390> up<00:03:02.480> a<00:03:02.600> little<00:03:02.750> bigger<00:03:03.110> speed<00:03:03.890> wise

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
crank it up a little bigger speed wise

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.210 
crank it up a little bigger speed wise
and<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:05.150> eventually<00:03:05.720> get<00:03:06.230> get<00:03:06.650> some<00:03:06.860> some

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
and and eventually get get some some

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.100 
and and eventually get get some some
more<00:03:07.370> power<00:03:07.550> than<00:03:07.820> before<00:03:08.090> this<00:03:08.660> offers<00:03:08.989> game

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
more power than before this offers game

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.700 
more power than before this offers game
this<00:03:10.830> is<00:03:11.010> moderate<00:03:11.610> elevation<00:03:12.330> okay<00:03:12.870> we<00:03:13.440> not

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
this is moderate elevation okay we not

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.920 
this is moderate elevation okay we not
we<00:03:14.070> had<00:03:14.190> thirteen<00:03:14.760> fourteen<00:03:15.420> hundred<00:03:15.510> head

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
we had thirteen fourteen hundred head

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.100 
we had thirteen fourteen hundred head
I'm<00:03:16.440> talking<00:03:16.830> mirrors<00:03:17.130> Denver<00:03:17.580> is<00:03:17.610> at<00:03:17.790> 1600<00:03:18.510> so

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
I'm talking mirrors Denver is at 1600 so

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.920 
I'm talking mirrors Denver is at 1600 so
it's<00:03:19.290> not<00:03:19.470> like<00:03:20.150> we<00:03:21.150> on<00:03:21.270> top<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.630> Mount<00:03:21.840> Everest

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
it's not like we on top of Mount Everest

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
it's not like we on top of Mount Everest
but<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:23.520> still<00:03:23.760> have<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.630> be<00:03:24.750> cautious<00:03:25.140> the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
but you still have to to be cautious the

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.660 
but you still have to to be cautious the
worst<00:03:26.340> thing<00:03:26.580> to<00:03:26.640> do<00:03:26.940> would<00:03:27.120> be<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.740> have<00:03:28.740> to

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
worst thing to do would be to have to

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.880 
worst thing to do would be to have to
intent<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.330> a<00:03:30.390> practice<00:03:30.810> early<00:03:31.200> on<00:03:31.320> because

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
intent of a practice early on because

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.310 
intent of a practice early on because
you<00:03:32.070> would<00:03:32.190> do<00:03:32.280> more<00:03:32.490> damage<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:32.910> good<00:03:33.200> so<00:03:34.200> we

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
you would do more damage and good so we

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.860 
you would do more damage and good so we
try<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.500> be<00:03:34.650> cautious<00:03:34.860> or<00:03:35.100> not<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.400> okay<00:03:35.870> we

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
try to be cautious or not it okay we

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.660 
try to be cautious or not it okay we
obviously<00:03:37.050> using<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.709> safe<00:03:37.920> software<00:03:38.220> that

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
obviously using the safe software that

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.040 
obviously using the safe software that
we've<00:03:38.820> been<00:03:38.970> using<00:03:39.180> in<00:03:39.450> terms<00:03:39.660> of<00:03:39.780> tracking

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
we've been using in terms of tracking

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.210 
we've been using in terms of tracking
heart<00:03:40.980> rates<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:42.140> and<00:03:43.140> then<00:03:43.800> we<00:03:43.920> able<00:03:44.160> to

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
heart rates and and then we able to

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.270 
heart rates and and then we able to
monitor<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:45.680> intensities<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.890> drill<00:03:47.130> you

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
monitor the intensities of the drill you

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.430 
monitor the intensities of the drill you
know
