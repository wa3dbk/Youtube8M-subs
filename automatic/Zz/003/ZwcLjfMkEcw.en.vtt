hygiene program is very challenging but
I<00:06:34.830> have<00:06:35.010> to<00:06:35.130> think<00:06:35.340> that<00:06:35.520> the<00:06:36.090> staff<00:06:36.390> is<00:06:36.720> just

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
I have to think that the staff is just

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.200 
I have to think that the staff is just
believing<00:06:37.230> in<00:06:37.440> us<00:06:37.590> and<00:06:37.800> pushing<00:06:38.190> us<00:06:38.340> and<00:06:38.550> just

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
believing in us and pushing us and just

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.390 
believing in us and pushing us and just
letting<00:06:39.390> us<00:06:39.540> know<00:06:39.630> that<00:06:39.780> you<00:06:40.770> know<00:06:40.920> better<00:06:41.220> is

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
letting us know that you know better is

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.740 
letting us know that you know better is
the<00:06:41.520> end<00:06:41.700> of<00:06:41.790> the<00:06:41.910> thing<00:06:42.090> than<00:06:42.300> the<00:06:42.390> beginning

the end of the thing than the beginning

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.780 
the end of the thing than the beginning
because<00:06:43.140> the<00:06:43.290> beginning<00:06:43.620> was<00:06:43.890> rough<00:06:44.130> but<00:06:44.670> as

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:44.790 
because the beginning was rough but as

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.970 
because the beginning was rough but as
