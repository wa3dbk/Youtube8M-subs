00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
yeah it is i mean the moons in cancer we

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.350 
yeah it is i mean the moons in cancer we
always<00:00:31.109> have<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> little<00:00:31.800> bit<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.360> underlying

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
worry or fear because the crab lives in

worry or fear because the crab lives in
the<00:00:36.390> intertidal<00:00:36.899> zone<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.620> tides<00:00:37.890> change

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the intertidal zone and the tides change

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.760 
the intertidal zone and the tides change
all<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.879> time<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.420> crabs<00:00:40.050> live<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.469> constant

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
all the time and crabs live in constant

all the time and crabs live in constant
fear<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.129> getting<00:00:41.309> washed<00:00:41.700> away<00:00:42.180> by<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.570> tides

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
fear of getting washed away by the tides

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.830 
fear of getting washed away by the tides
and<00:00:43.260> today<00:00:43.950> there's<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.579> seriousness<00:00:45.239> or<00:00:45.690> an

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
and today there's a seriousness or an

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.080 
and today there's a seriousness or an
intensity<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.129> tides<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.730> make<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
intensity to the tides that make the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.209 
intensity to the tides that make the
mother<00:00:48.270> absolutely<00:00:49.050> because<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> full

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
mother absolutely because we have a full

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.330 
mother absolutely because we have a full
moon<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.969> high<00:00:51.539> emotional<00:00:52.230> tide<00:00:52.559> experience

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
moon that high emotional tide experience

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.549 
moon that high emotional tide experience
in<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.850> sign<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.329> cancer<00:00:54.570> that's<00:00:54.989> opposite

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
in the sign of cancer that's opposite

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.860 
in the sign of cancer that's opposite
the<00:00:55.710> Sun<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.100> Capricorn<00:00:56.699> which<00:00:57.239> also<00:00:57.480> want

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the Sun in Capricorn which also want

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.900 
the Sun in Capricorn which also want
security<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.590> Capricorn<00:00:59.129> security<00:00:59.670> comes

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
security but Capricorn security comes

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.240 
security but Capricorn security comes
through<00:01:00.120> external<00:01:00.510> accomplishment<00:01:01.500> cancer

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
through external accomplishment cancer

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.090 
through external accomplishment cancer
security<00:01:02.760> comes<00:01:03.210> from<00:01:03.420> subjective<00:01:04.320> feelings

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
security comes from subjective feelings

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.080 
security comes from subjective feelings
and<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.240> problem<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.590> or<00:01:08.369> what<00:01:08.790> makes<00:01:08.970> a

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
and the problem is that or what makes a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.950 
and the problem is that or what makes a
mortgage<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.409> opportunity<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.390> that<00:01:12.390> that

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
mortgage the opportunity is that that

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.700 
mortgage the opportunity is that that
the<00:01:13.260> Sun<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.770> Capricorn<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:15.509> lining<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.650> with

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the Sun in Capricorn is lining up with

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.359 
the Sun in Capricorn is lining up with
or<00:01:17.159> coming<00:01:17.580> closer<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:19.189> conjunction<00:01:20.189> with

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
or coming closer to a conjunction with

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.830 
or coming closer to a conjunction with
Pluto<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.630> Pluto<00:01:22.439> takes<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.810> stability<00:01:24.810> of

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
Pluto and Pluto takes the stability of

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.710 
Pluto and Pluto takes the stability of
the<00:01:25.380> rocks<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:26.070> Capricorn<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.880> mountain<00:01:27.299> and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
the rocks of Capricorn the mountain and

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.440 
the rocks of Capricorn the mountain and
it<00:01:28.049> gradually<00:01:28.850> transforms<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.030> while<00:01:30.240> we're

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
it gradually transforms it while we're

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.749 
it gradually transforms it while we're
standing<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.950> what<00:01:32.130> happens<00:01:32.579> is

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
standing on it and so what happens is

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.510 
standing on it and so what happens is
that<00:01:32.790> today's<00:01:33.270> full<00:01:33.600> moon<00:01:33.840> opposing<00:01:34.799> Pluto

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
that today's full moon opposing Pluto

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.560 
that today's full moon opposing Pluto
really<00:01:36.329> gives<00:01:36.780> us<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.490> level<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.640> change<00:01:39.240> is

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
really gives us the level of change is

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.980 
really gives us the level of change is
greater<00:01:40.020> than<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.070> high<00:01:41.400> tide<00:01:41.790> or<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.810> a

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
greater than just a high tide or just a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.350 
greater than just a high tide or just a
full<00:01:43.290> moon<00:01:43.530> high<00:01:43.860> tide<00:01:43.890> oh<00:01:44.340> absolutely<00:01:44.640> we

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
full moon high tide oh absolutely we

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.240 
full moon high tide oh absolutely we
even<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.720> shocking<00:01:46.049> yer<00:01:46.380> honest<00:01:46.770> at<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> right

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
even have shocking yer honest at a right

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.760 
even have shocking yer honest at a right
angle<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.939> Sun<00:01:48.240> Moon<00:01:48.450> opposition<00:01:49.320> it's

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
angle to the Sun Moon opposition it's

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.920 
angle to the Sun Moon opposition it's
not<00:01:50.009> exact<00:01:50.520> but<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:50.820> close<00:01:51.149> enough<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.570> be<00:01:51.810> in

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
not exact but it's close enough to be in

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.990 
not exact but it's close enough to be in
effect<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.799> what<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.100> all<00:01:53.310> means<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.700> really

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
effect and what this all means is really

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.399 
effect and what this all means is really
we're<00:01:54.149> giving<00:01:54.420> birth<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.020> future

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
we're giving birth to the future

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.609 
we're giving birth to the future
security<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.460> not<00:01:57.299> about<00:01:57.719> returning<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
security is not about returning to the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.980 
security is not about returning to the
past<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:59.159> inventing<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.909> future<00:02:00.450> that's

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
past it's inventing a future that's

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.870 
past it's inventing a future that's
different<00:02:01.619> from<00:02:01.740> what<00:02:01.920> we<00:02:02.040> already<00:02:02.189> know<00:02:02.549> and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
different from what we already know and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.870 
different from what we already know and
I<00:02:03.299> think<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.079> ultimately<00:02:04.290> we<00:02:05.159> can<00:02:05.189> do<00:02:05.610> that

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
I think that ultimately we can do that

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.419 
I think that ultimately we can do that
because<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.930> full<00:02:07.140> moon<00:02:07.350> ends<00:02:07.710> up<00:02:07.860> making<00:02:08.099> a

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
because the full moon ends up making a

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.240 
because the full moon ends up making a
harmonious<00:02:09.119> trine<00:02:09.479> with<00:02:09.780> Saturn<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.470> Saturn

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
harmonious trine with Saturn and Saturn

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.070 
harmonious trine with Saturn and Saturn
is<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.580> planet<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.120> stability<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.959> this

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
is the planet of stability and this

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.430 
is the planet of stability and this
whole

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
whole

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.220
