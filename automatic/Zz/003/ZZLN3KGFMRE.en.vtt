 precisely, I always thank you for a surprise 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.809
 every day see that members 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.360
 they go up more and more and do me a lot 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.610
 like what I miss then it makes me 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.510
 also get on with the videos that 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.430
 let's say if video didn't like up to 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.890
 a certain point then I have so it is firm 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.010
 anyway I just let you out too 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.920
 a test mode of the jaguar 980 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.870
 the beloved jaguar and then i 'm 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.870
 continuing with the series I was now 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:06.149
 seeing to design a little something for the 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:09.250
 twentieth episode then as like then 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.890
 I will tell you at the end of the nineteenth 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.710
 faint ready even though I let it out 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.810
 only sixteenth I'm already recording 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.220
 the twentieth then that he saw this 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.810
 tried to take the later 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.270
 possible because with work like 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.770
 happened this week I did not even 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:30.250
 touched the computer so let's say I'm in 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.600
 trying to take me further we have 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.740
 I'm trying to get ahead more 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.810
 possible here I have done the test mode 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.200
 the sixth I send on very successfully 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.479
 they also look at the views, not me 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.579
 I expected it less and instead saw that 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.770
 this is going very well anyway 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.079
 I am pleased if there are singles 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.970
 player so hopefully then sending 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:55.090
 in multiplayer I call them 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.190
 visualizations increased diets 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.200
 precisely I wanted to thank you 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.960
 I'll remind you, in fact, that 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.700
 the graphics have all been renewed 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.209
 page graphics are renewed 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.619
 been a while so there are those who renovations 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.200
 liked the older one because 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.950
 primaries we had been accustomed to 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.260
 immediately to see that it brings then a little 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.510
 so a change that anyway 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.450
 He wanted 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.150
 nothing I recommend you comment on the video 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.650
 it's nothing 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.819
 keep following me guys because 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.170
 will innovations ideas but will come to 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.769
 tone 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.380
 in short, there will be some trees 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.599
 who speak 9 I say more because otherwise he goes 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.810
 little and boulders registered is fine 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.290
