be fitness to my bike shortly on the
back<00:00:33.809> here<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.380> peel-off<00:00:34.770> adhesive<00:00:35.670> pads

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
back here we have peel-off adhesive pads

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.950 
back here we have peel-off adhesive pads
for<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.790> mountain<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.629> can<00:00:39.780> see<00:00:39.809> that

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
for the mountain and as you can see that

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.049 
for the mountain and as you can see that
is<00:00:40.290> um<00:00:40.910> brackets<00:00:41.910> s<00:00:42.120> we<00:00:42.329> get<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.660> angle<00:00:42.840> right

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
is um brackets s we get the angle right

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.490 
is um brackets s we get the angle right
enough<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.329> let's<00:00:45.629> go<00:00:45.930> down<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.140> get<00:00:46.379> it

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
enough of this let's go down and get it

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.940 
enough of this let's go down and get it
fitted

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.430 

after<00:00:54.130> dabbling<00:00:54.370> around<00:00:54.670> with<00:00:54.940> a<00:00:54.970> position<00:00:55.570> I

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.120 

think<00:00:59.440> this<00:00:59.710> is<00:00:59.770> the<00:01:00.040> best<00:01:00.250> spot<00:01:00.430> for<00:01:00.580> it<00:01:02.130> you

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
think this is the best spot for it you

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.829 
think this is the best spot for it you
can<00:01:03.160> immediately<00:01:03.430> see<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:03.970> difference<00:01:04.570> in

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
can immediately see the difference in

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.170 
can immediately see the difference in
coverage<00:01:05.320> that<00:01:05.470> this<00:01:05.650> provides<00:01:06.100> compared<00:01:07.030> to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
coverage that this provides compared to

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.320 
coverage that this provides compared to
standard<00:01:08.080> rear<00:01:08.500> view<00:01:08.680> mirrors<00:01:12.150> okay<00:01:13.150> guys

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
standard rear view mirrors okay guys
