00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:16.139
 Hello and welcome to use 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.060

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.119
 you uploaded a video and that 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.310
 It says I need your help 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.600
 and there in this video I wanted that 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.450
 she asked me a few questions though 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.840
 would that it asks questions so many 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.120
 I did not believe so great first 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.340
 big thank you for giving me so many 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.620
 I can ask you questions unfortunately 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.440
 not all answer but i will 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.260
 make several faq is I think 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.350
 better then all have something of it and 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.950
 yes, just somewhere that's been around now 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.809
 17h 35 124 comments and it is 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.730
 just one o'clock at night so really 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.989
 fought for respect 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.210
 Let's start with the first question 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.339
 the first question is from sap has erdem 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.950
 he asked the question when do you have 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.530
 started to gamble so what cod 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.539
 and with what age the question is 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.369
 not easy to answer me 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.760
 I started when I was 15 years old 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.860
 cad to gamble because I have my ps3 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.740
 got a gift for the birthday 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.830
 I have them so incredible 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.960
 already incredibly desired that mine 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.630
 We have decided to come to our parents 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.070
 buy the tv without ps3 and you 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.810
 then you can have a few players 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.549
 of course she has my brother 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.990
 bought because my parents buy yes 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.990
 no games 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.460
 ie no games bought from 18 now 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.659
 However, this year can itself 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.290
 make and when it started comics too 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.080
 gamble 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.100
 that happened when I was on gitano 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.439
 am met 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.439
 i hope random in a cinema of the dead 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.960
 wanted a lobby and he has me a bit 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.329
 few tricks and tips showed how to 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.470
 can play better and have at the end 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.110
 We decided then we come 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.570
 make a marriage so it was with us 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.820
 I mentioned 46 was with us 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.190
 A marriage played her six hours 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.680
 and I was so incredibly proud 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.689
 on 146 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.939
 and in six hours, that's it 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:21.510
 a huge charge I would 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:24.170
 say because now practically 146 corp in 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:30.480
 almost two hours under two hours 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:33.120
 and that is really bad times for the second 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.680
 phase piero hackl asks me will you 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.260
 Be at gamescom and become one 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.569
 Abo meet the yes I will on 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.530
 to be the gamescom and yes I will become one 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.099
 make an appointment 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.750
 the special surprise is the abo 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.329
 Meet the gamescom instead 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.609
 because I think many want to see us 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.319
 and I think cavill is not anymore 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.010
 to overlook last year it was still 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.689
 completely different 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.000
 home in maybe three four people 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.109
 but now they are relaxed 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.700
 Recognize more 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:03.719
 That's why we decided to combine 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.769
 make it an abo meet and we 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.150
 you will always be up to date 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.310
 hold where we are 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.079
 that means via facebook or youtube 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.620
 maybe we load video or 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.299
 like this 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.889
 In any case, you can now on 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.780
 go to my facebook page and enter 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.189
 letting it lighter if you want it 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.510
 her also up to date page 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.959
 because i will when we go to the gamescom 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.329
 are also mappus we are just about it 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.720
 So you can visit us 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:31.260
 autograph car could pick up and so on 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.209
 so keep it cool 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.030
 Let's come to the third question 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.979
 lucky dog ask me it will be 400,000 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.129
 euro to sell the channel and do you like 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:43.439
 The first thing I ask is energy drinks 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.889
 my boss would sell 400,000 euros 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:47.939
 I do not think so because of me 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:52.019
 12,000 subscribers that I have now 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:54.750
 So much too important are me 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.759
 you would never go to someone else 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.430
 sell no idea what he is with the 

00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:01.319
 I would make money what do you want 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.310
 with a view of the channel what should 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.260
 there 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.330
 should be ok on the shelf if i find myself 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.030
 Imagine that others are on mine 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.090
 channel upload something there I will 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.790
 completely confused in the head so it does not work 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:19.190
 i could not honestly and 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:22.200
 Of course you may notice 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.660
 energydrinks I especially like the whole 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.520
 normal rockstar and the most normal 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.440
 monster but he I drink the whole 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.620
 normal rockstar because of me im 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.910
 he bought it as the monster because of the 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.120
 I only get monster in my life 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.650
 Kaufpark if walls in the offer is but 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.680
 Of course, then I'll buy too 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.450
 Let's come to the fourth question daniel 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.280
 easier ask me what was that 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.190
 most embarrassing thing in the school up 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.780
 happened now commented to 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.360
 The answer I was in the seventh 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.040
 class it was break i say in my 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.070
 best colleagues to the there and it has 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.900
 Rained like a bucket and of course 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.790
 Andy has the chance to see me 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.370
 Just play a joke and 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.860
 to shove me in the mud 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.400
 that means he was a lot of fun 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.320
 not natural to me and then me out 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.800
 I got up from the mud 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:18.300
 i have seen my jeans like them 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:21.060
 crappy truest sense of the word so 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.100
 shit as if there was someone on it 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.100
 has sat and with the hand 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:30.780
 So I got it right 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:32.940
 really good by the hand than mine 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.530
 and there I am to my romy 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.440
 gone and said okay me 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.990
 I need a new pair of pants 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.880
 my omi is still uneasy there because i am ahead 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.370
 recently had there still stayed with her 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.560
 and has there still a jeans star 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.690
 I belong from seven years drawn 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.320
 capped back to school 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:57.289
 and have seen so expect the people 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:59.280
 look at me like they look at me like that 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.680
 something is thinking 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.870
 the look at and very embarrassing 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.580
 that would happen to me that happened 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.010
 I have to be in one or two 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.600
 But weeks all the others have not 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:15.720
 understood that dirt was there the heer 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:19.260
 Sludge mud slut come 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.840
 We ask to the fifth question streams 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.330
 me which weapons you celebrate you love 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:28.680
 likes his last call of duty black 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:31.650
 ops 1 mw 3 or black ops two trees too 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.590
 black ops 1 I celebrate the most like 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.900
 pharma and of course those too 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:40.200
 both are so precise, actually 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.940
 sometimes you play very wrong and have 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.070
 then a lot like the wrong thing 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.140
 and can not handle it properly 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:48.210
 That's why I'm celebrating these two 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.520
 actually, because they are not 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.479
 but I play a lot of people with it 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.960
 can handle well 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:57.540
 at mw3 solemnly the acr as well as almost 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:03.540
 every player there i mean i see 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:05.820
 as rare as rare someone like you 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.610
 There with another weapon to run around 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:12.270
 as with the acr the kind he is there 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:14.930
 the best weapon there is the arrow with 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.530
 this weapon as fast as with ghost 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.680
 it is amazing 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:22.650
 So that's really blatant as the crass 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.950
 the crusty acr is there but i like the 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:28.190
 also and yes with black ops 2 it is quite 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:32.160
 exactly two weapons and once the 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:36.240
 so full the fn well yes this well 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:38.370
 single firearm and the ms mmc the 

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:42.570
 both solemnly correct but i hate 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:46.830
 c4 point yes it was actually from the fa 

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:48.390
 cup single as well as flynn should too 

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:54.180
 best the comments that should be 

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:59.210
 and so on blablabla yes exactly 

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:59.210
 Yes, we'll meet again
