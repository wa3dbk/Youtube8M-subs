00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
we've been doing this for a number of

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.840 
we've been doing this for a number of
years<00:02:04.719> now<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.369> we've<00:02:06.369> gotten<00:02:06.700> to<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.820> point

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
years now and we've gotten to the point

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.059 
years now and we've gotten to the point
now<00:02:07.149> where<00:02:07.240> we<00:02:07.539> have<00:02:07.750> art<00:02:08.170> all<00:02:08.410> over<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.769> world

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.040 

we've<00:02:14.069> kind<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.580> created<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:15.330> fear<00:02:15.840> horse

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
we've kind of created this fear horse

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.140 
we've kind of created this fear horse
myth<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:17.160> children<00:02:17.550> do<00:02:17.670> have<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.880> lot<00:02:18.120> of

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
myth the children do have a lot of

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.390 
myth the children do have a lot of
freedom<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.080> think<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.800> attractive

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
freedom and I think that is attractive

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.530 
freedom and I think that is attractive
to<00:02:20.430> some<00:02:20.790> people<00:02:21.980> it's<00:02:22.980> much<00:02:23.340> more<00:02:23.670> idealized

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
to some people it's much more idealized

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.199 
to some people it's much more idealized
than<00:02:25.050> real<00:02:25.260> life<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.860> do<00:02:26.520> think<00:02:26.970> there's<00:02:27.150> a

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
than real life I do think there's a

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.430 
than real life I do think there's a
winsomeness<00:02:27.720> about<00:02:28.200> our<00:02:28.350> life<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:29.040> true

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
winsomeness about our life that is true

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.230 
winsomeness about our life that is true
but<00:02:31.440> there's<00:02:31.890> also<00:02:32.160> you<00:02:32.400> know<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.790> struggle

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
but there's also you know the struggle

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.970 
but there's also you know the struggle
behind<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.780> scenes<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.350> people<00:02:34.410> don't<00:02:34.860> see

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
behind the scenes that people don't see

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.010
