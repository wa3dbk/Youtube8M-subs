00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.130 
I looked out to see and then at the full
moon<00:01:40.430> then<00:01:41.430> watched<00:01:41.880> clouds<00:01:42.479> scurrying

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
moon then watched clouds scurrying

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.520

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
across the sky and then I saw the clouds

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.030 
across the sky and then I saw the clouds
go<00:01:47.009> behind<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.970> moon<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:49.170> clouds<00:01:49.590> went

behind<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:51.270> moon<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:52.530> that's<00:01:52.770> an<00:01:52.890> unusual

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
behind the moon and that's an unusual

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.969 
behind the moon and that's an unusual
way<00:01:53.520> for<00:01:53.549> God<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.060> get<00:01:54.210> someone's<00:01:54.600> attention

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.380 
way for God to get someone's attention
but<00:01:55.979> he<00:01:56.070> certainly<00:01:56.310> had<00:01:56.610> mine

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
but he certainly had mine
