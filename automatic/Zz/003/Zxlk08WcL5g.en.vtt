00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.669 

this<00:00:02.030> is<00:00:02.179> a<00:00:02.239> project<00:00:02.480> that<00:00:02.929> in<00:00:03.290> collaborating

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:03.679 
this is a project that in collaborating

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:05.830 
this is a project that in collaborating
with<00:00:03.830> the<00:00:04.040> musician<00:00:04.520> and<00:00:04.670> an<00:00:04.819> artist<00:00:05.269> it's

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:05.840 
with the musician and an artist it's

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:20.000 
with the musician and an artist it's
called<00:00:06.019> dance<00:00:06.290> through<00:00:06.470> spectroscopy

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.180 

the<00:00:20.580> idea<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.030> to<00:00:22.340> use<00:00:23.930> physics<00:00:24.930> mix<00:00:25.619> classical

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.190 
the idea is to use physics mix classical

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.310 
the idea is to use physics mix classical
quantum<00:00:26.610> mechanics<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.360> then<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:27.990> we<00:00:28.110> do<00:00:28.290> is

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
quantum mechanics and then what we do is

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.950 
quantum mechanics and then what we do is
we<00:00:28.790> basically<00:00:29.790> let<00:00:30.090> people<00:00:30.119> walk<00:00:30.600> through<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
we basically let people walk through the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.690 
we basically let people walk through the
force<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.380> few<00:00:31.500> people<00:00:31.890> well<00:00:32.160> as<00:00:32.310> people<00:00:32.460> walk

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
force a few people well as people walk

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.250 
force a few people well as people walk
through<00:00:32.970> a<00:00:33.000> room<00:00:33.059> they<00:00:33.300> work<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.720> force<00:00:33.989> field

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
through a room they work the force field

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.500 
through a room they work the force field
in<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.500> particles<00:00:34.950> field<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.090> particles

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
in the particles field so the particles

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.210 
in the particles field so the particles
dynamically<00:00:36.930> respond<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.410> their<00:00:37.559> motion<00:00:37.980> and

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
dynamically respond to their motion and

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.119 
dynamically respond to their motion and
then<00:00:38.989> when<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.080> particles<00:00:40.559> collide<00:00:40.890> with

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
then when the particles collide with

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.439 
then when the particles collide with
each<00:00:41.160> other<00:00:41.520> or<00:00:41.730> with<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> walls<00:00:42.180> they

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
each other or with the walls they

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.900 
each other or with the walls they
generate<00:00:42.870> notes<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:44.040> people<00:00:44.220> can<00:00:44.550> generate

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
generate notes so people can generate

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.520 
generate notes so people can generate
their<00:00:45.120> own<00:00:45.150> crowds<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.900> people<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.199> generate

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
their own crowds of people can generate

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.760 
their own crowds of people can generate
their<00:00:46.710> own<00:00:46.850> dynamic<00:00:47.850> soundscapes<00:00:48.770> visual

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
their own dynamic soundscapes visual

00:00:49.770 --> 00:01:12.399 
their own dynamic soundscapes visual
escapes

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.440 

ultimately<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:13.579> idea<00:01:13.850> is<00:01:13.939> to<00:01:13.999> put<00:01:14.119> it<00:01:14.359> in

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
ultimately the idea is to put it in

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.719 
ultimately the idea is to put it in
venues<00:01:14.840> where<00:01:15.020> we<00:01:15.469> could<00:01:15.710> drop<00:01:15.950> bass<00:01:16.399> lines

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
venues where we could drop bass lines

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.080 
venues where we could drop bass lines
all<00:01:17.359> sorts<00:01:17.749> of<00:01:17.810> other<00:01:17.960> effects<00:01:18.380> that<00:01:18.799> as<00:01:19.189> when

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
all sorts of other effects that as when

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.450 
all sorts of other effects that as when
he<00:01:20.119> pleased<00:01:20.479> with<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.530> then<00:01:21.859> dynamically

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
he pleased with it and then dynamically

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.700 
he pleased with it and then dynamically
have<00:01:22.939> a<00:01:22.969> dynamic<00:01:23.329> feedback<00:01:23.990> with<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.469> crowd

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
have a dynamic feedback with the crowd

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.800 
have a dynamic feedback with the crowd
where<00:01:25.189> he<00:01:25.700> modulate<00:01:26.179> the<00:01:26.329> crowd<00:01:26.539> and<00:01:26.719> the

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
where he modulate the crowd and the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.020 
where he modulate the crowd and the
crowd<00:01:26.899> son's<00:01:27.709> feedback<00:01:28.069> back<00:01:28.280> to<00:01:28.429> him<00:01:28.579> so<00:01:28.850> it's

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
crowd son's feedback back to him so it's

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.429 
crowd son's feedback back to him so it's
to<00:01:29.179> create<00:01:29.329> a<00:01:29.479> sort<00:01:29.659> of<00:01:29.719> digital<00:01:30.079> feedback

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
to create a sort of digital feedback

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.559 
to create a sort of digital feedback
loop<00:01:30.709> and<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.340> Lee<00:01:31.549> has<00:01:31.759> a<00:01:31.789> lot<00:01:32.000> of<00:01:32.030> experience

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
loop and so Lee has a lot of experience

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:34.569 
loop and so Lee has a lot of experience
doing<00:01:32.810> working<00:01:33.439> with<00:01:33.649> choreograph<00:01:34.159> dancers

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
doing working with choreograph dancers

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.080 
doing working with choreograph dancers
and<00:01:34.789> things<00:01:34.939> like<00:01:35.119> this<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:37.670> goal<00:01:37.880> is<00:01:38.060> to

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
and things like this so the goal is to

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.510 
and things like this so the goal is to
try<00:01:38.359> to<00:01:38.450> create<00:01:38.719> some<00:01:39.079> sort<00:01:39.319> of<00:01:39.469> looking<00:01:40.219> Donna

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
try to create some sort of looking Donna

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.099 
try to create some sort of looking Donna
picture<00:01:41.060> you're<00:01:41.179> looking<00:01:41.209> on<00:01:41.599> multiplying

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
picture you're looking on multiplying

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:44.410 
picture you're looking on multiplying
some<00:01:42.649> sort<00:01:42.920> of<00:01:43.039> close<00:01:43.280> digital<00:01:43.789> feedback<00:01:44.149> loop

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
some sort of close digital feedback loop

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.249 
some sort of close digital feedback loop
where<00:01:44.719> we<00:01:45.229> can<00:01:45.439> source<00:01:46.159> out<00:01:46.399> the<00:01:46.549> vibe<00:01:47.259> people

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
where we can source out the vibe people

00:01:48.259 --> 00:02:03.400 
where we can source out the vibe people
or<00:01:48.409> individuals

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.840 

the<00:02:04.410> age<00:02:04.590> range<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.130> people<00:02:05.520> have<00:02:05.610> come<00:02:05.790> in

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the age range that people have come in

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.810 
the age range that people have come in
and<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.180> looked<00:02:06.480> up<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.810> start<00:02:07.470> smiling

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
and just looked up and start smiling

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.680 
and just looked up and start smiling
moving<00:02:08.820> around<00:02:08.910> as<00:02:09.210> well<00:02:09.360> old<00:02:10.260> grandmas<00:02:10.770> were

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
moving around as well old grandmas were

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.850 
moving around as well old grandmas were
little<00:02:12.690> kids<00:02:12.870> going<00:02:13.170> around<00:02:13.350> saying<00:02:13.650> it's<00:02:13.800> a

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
little kids going around saying it's a

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.750 
little kids going around saying it's a
party<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.280> here<00:02:16.010> it's<00:02:17.010> very<00:02:17.370> good<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.580> see

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
party in here it's very good to see

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.570 
party in here it's very good to see
people<00:02:18.560> like<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:19.830> i<00:02:19.920> think<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.220> physics

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
people like it and i think the physics

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.190 
people like it and i think the physics
aspect<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.390> things<00:02:21.600> also<00:02:21.930> makes<00:02:22.110> it

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
aspect of things also makes it

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:38.630 
aspect of things also makes it
interested<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.680> people<00:02:37.160> we've<00:02:38.160> done<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.370> lot<00:02:38.610> of

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
interested in people we've done a lot of

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.070 
interested in people we've done a lot of
evaluating<00:02:39.420> like<00:02:41.180> but<00:02:42.180> i<00:02:42.240> think<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.540> exercise

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
evaluating like but i think the exercise

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.740 
evaluating like but i think the exercise
itself<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.620> useful<00:02:44.070> because<00:02:44.190> i<00:02:44.430> think

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
itself is useful because i think

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.900 
itself is useful because i think
interacting<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:45.870> explaining<00:02:46.730> spawns<00:02:47.730> new

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
interacting and explaining spawns new

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.030 
interacting and explaining spawns new
ideas

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
ideas

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.679 
ideas
and<00:02:50.280> like<00:02:50.670> some<00:02:50.909> of<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.060> way<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.239> mekin<00:02:51.599> it

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 
and like some of the way to mekin it

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.119 
and like some of the way to mekin it
we're<00:02:51.810> developing<00:02:52.290> some<00:02:52.530> new<00:02:52.560> ways<00:02:52.920> of

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
we're developing some new ways of

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.910 
we're developing some new ways of
interpreting<00:02:53.489> really<00:02:54.239> chaotic<00:02:54.810> freedom<00:02:55.170> so

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
interpreting really chaotic freedom so

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.830 
interpreting really chaotic freedom so
this<00:02:56.040> is<00:02:56.069> very<00:02:56.250> much<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:56.519> research<00:02:56.939> that's<00:02:57.719> one

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
this is very much a research that's one

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.849 
this is very much a research that's one
of<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:57.959> things<00:02:58.019> I<00:02:58.170> really<00:02:58.290> like<00:02:58.439> about<00:02:58.500> this
