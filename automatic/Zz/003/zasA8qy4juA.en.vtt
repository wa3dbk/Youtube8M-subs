a few things that BMX is lacking and I

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.560

think just with such a big brown behind

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.319 
think just with such a big brown behind
it<00:01:42.750> we<00:01:42.869> can<00:01:43.049> actually<00:01:43.229> make<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.649> happen<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.329> you
