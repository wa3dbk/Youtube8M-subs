00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.410 
of choices and you know it's all
individually<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:25.850> so<00:01:26.850> that's<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.180> stage

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
individually for you so that's the stage

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.149 
individually for you so that's the stage
we're<00:01:27.630> up<00:01:27.719> to<00:01:27.899> at<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.020> moment<00:01:28.380> all<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.740> say<00:01:28.920> old

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
we're up to at the moment all I say old

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.499 
we're up to at the moment all I say old
all<00:01:29.399> this<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.759> all<00:01:29.909> guys<00:01:30.119> like<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:32.329> come<00:01:33.329> to

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
all this is all guys like that come to

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.480 
all this is all guys like that come to
and<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.750> might<00:01:33.960> do<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> little<00:01:34.560> bit<00:01:34.710> more<00:01:34.859> country

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
and I might do a little bit more country

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.580 
and I might do a little bit more country
and<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.240> rather<00:01:37.049> than<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.409> going

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
and so that this rather than just going

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.190 
and so that this rather than just going
it<00:01:37.799> across<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.310> will<00:01:39.090> go<00:01:39.270> slightly<00:01:39.810> under

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
it across to that will go slightly under

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.319 
it across to that will go slightly under
more<00:01:40.710> like<00:01:40.859> violet<00:01:41.399> that's<00:01:41.939> how<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.240> normally

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
more like violet that's how I normally

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.209 
more like violet that's how I normally
do<00:01:42.810> them<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.200> should<00:01:43.590> probably<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> same

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
do them so I should probably do the same

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.660 
do them so I should probably do the same
with<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:45.469> but<00:01:46.469> it's<00:01:46.710> just<00:01:46.799> important<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.520> get

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
with this but it's just important to get

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.190 
with this but it's just important to get
it<00:01:47.789> to<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.969> stage<00:01:48.210> where<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.509> can<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:48.960> clamp

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
it to the stage where I can just clamp

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.550 
it to the stage where I can just clamp
it<00:01:49.289> up<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:51.210> benches<00:01:51.570> venues<00:01:51.929> for<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.200> made<00:01:52.380> this

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
it up the benches venues for I made this

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.330 
it up the benches venues for I made this

then so that way our that's where we're
up<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.520> moment<00:02:28.730> right<00:02:29.330> we've<00:02:29.569> got<00:02:29.780> this<00:02:30.680> is

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
up to the moment right we've got this is

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.479 
up to the moment right we've got this is
a<00:02:30.890> special<00:02:31.340> Les<00:02:31.550> Paul<00:02:31.790> on<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.090> other<00:02:32.390> car<00:02:32.630> and

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
traditional black Les Paul and then we

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.400 
traditional black Les Paul and then we

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
started talking about things about him

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.140 
started talking about things about him
so<00:02:45.620> we've<00:02:45.769> changed<00:02:45.980> every<00:02:46.370> spec<00:02:46.640> in<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:46.970> world

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
so we've changed every spec in the world

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.300 
so we've changed every spec in the world
on<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.510> now<00:02:47.660> we've<00:02:48.380> changed<00:02:48.410> it<00:02:48.890> from<00:02:49.010> mahogany

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
on it now we've changed it from mahogany

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.390 
on it now we've changed it from mahogany
to<00:02:49.760> up<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.239> poplar<00:02:50.959> which<00:02:51.739> is<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.040> same<00:02:52.250> as

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
to up to poplar which is the same as

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.580 
to up to poplar which is the same as
American<00:02:52.820> or<00:02:52.970> just<00:02:53.209> slightly<00:02:53.420> lighter<00:02:53.780> and

Cora<00:02:54.890> same<00:02:55.610> weight<00:02:55.820> we've<00:02:56.660> got<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.840> two-piece

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
Cora same weight we've got a two-piece

Cora same weight we've got a two-piece
rock<00:02:57.980> maple<00:02:58.220> neck<00:02:58.580> so<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:59.660> accidents<00:03:00.140> where

they always break it and stuff so that

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.569 
they always break it and stuff so that
shouldn't<00:03:03.080> happen<00:03:03.320> when<00:03:03.560> it's<00:03:03.739> drops<00:03:04.010> but<00:03:04.489> it

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
will be and I've changed the angle there

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.539 
will be and I've changed the angle there
it's<00:03:08.239> much<00:03:08.420> shallower<00:03:08.780> than<00:03:09.049> 17<00:03:09.560> degrees<00:03:09.980> get

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
it's much shallower than 17 degrees get

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.130 
it's much shallower than 17 degrees get
the<00:03:10.670> four<00:03:10.880> degree<00:03:11.209> angle<00:03:11.510> on<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.750> neck<00:03:11.930> though
