00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.379 

guys<00:00:01.709> so<00:00:02.340> this<00:00:02.550> video<00:00:02.790> is<00:00:02.850> going<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.179> introduce

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
guys so this video is going to introduce

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.530 
guys so this video is going to introduce
the<00:00:03.810> concept<00:00:04.170> of<00:00:04.260> a<00:00:04.380> scatter<00:00:04.620> plot<00:00:05.390> so<00:00:06.390> we've

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
the concept of a scatter plot so we've

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.230 
the concept of a scatter plot so we've
looked<00:00:06.660> at<00:00:06.840> the<00:00:07.879> relationships<00:00:08.879> between

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
looked at the relationships between

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.779 
looked at the relationships between
dependent<00:00:09.959> and<00:00:10.110> independent<00:00:10.519> variables<00:00:11.519> and

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:11.789 
dependent and independent variables and

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:13.489 
dependent and independent variables and
now<00:00:11.969> we've<00:00:12.120> just<00:00:12.150> got<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.509> put<00:00:12.660> those<00:00:12.809> into

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:13.499 
now we've just got to put those into

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.400 
now we've just got to put those into
play<00:00:13.740> using<00:00:14.129> some<00:00:14.309> data<00:00:14.490> so<00:00:15.360> I've<00:00:16.020> gone<00:00:16.230> out

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
play using some data so I've gone out

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.520 
play using some data so I've gone out
and<00:00:16.530> I've<00:00:16.620> taken<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:17.010> survey<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.000> asked<00:00:18.530> six

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:19.530 
and I've taken a survey so I asked six

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.000 
and I've taken a survey so I asked six
of<00:00:19.680> my<00:00:19.830> friends<00:00:20.220> who<00:00:20.460> are<00:00:21.590> people<00:00:22.590> at<00:00:22.800> least

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
of my friends who are people at least

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.200 
of my friends who are people at least
five<00:00:23.280> years<00:00:23.310> older<00:00:23.730> than<00:00:23.850> me<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:26.000> I've<00:00:27.000> asked

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
five years older than me and I've asked

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.000 
five years older than me and I've asked
them<00:00:27.360> what<00:00:27.480> their<00:00:27.600> incomes<00:00:27.990> are<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.860> I've

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
them what their incomes are and I've

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.509 
them what their incomes are and I've
recorded<00:00:29.310> their<00:00:29.550> age<00:00:29.700> and<00:00:30.030> their<00:00:30.210> income<00:00:31.519> so

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:32.519 
recorded their age and their income so

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:35.180 
recorded their age and their income so
I've<00:00:32.640> got<00:00:32.929> one<00:00:33.929> guy<00:00:34.079> who<00:00:34.140> was<00:00:34.350> 25<00:00:34.769> from<00:00:34.980> 8

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
I've got one guy who was 25 from 8

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.739 
I've got one guy who was 25 from 8
$40,000<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.149> guy<00:00:36.449> who<00:00:36.510> was<00:00:36.660> 36<00:00:38.239> 2035<00:00:39.239> next

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:39.749 
$40,000 a guy who was 36 2035 next

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:42.290 
$40,000 a guy who was 36 2035 next
68,000<00:00:40.649> go<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.309> was<00:00:41.429> 40<00:00:41.760> made<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> hundred

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
68,000 go it was 40 made a hundred

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.590 
68,000 go it was 40 made a hundred
thousand<00:00:42.719> go<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.589> was<00:00:43.710> 45<00:00:44.159> made<00:00:44.519> 120,000<00:00:45.449> and<00:00:45.480> a

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
thousand go it was 45 made 120,000 and a

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.739 
thousand go it was 45 made 120,000 and a
guy<00:00:45.780> who<00:00:45.839> was<00:00:46.129> 5950<00:00:47.129> thousand<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.510> first

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
guy who was 5950 thousand so the first

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:50.090 
guy who was 5950 thousand so the first
thing<00:00:48.899> we've<00:00:49.019> got<00:00:49.199> to<00:00:49.230> do<00:00:49.409> before<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.859> can<00:00:49.980> make

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
thing we've got to do before we can make

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.079 
thing we've got to do before we can make
our<00:00:50.309> scatter<00:00:50.550> plot<00:00:50.609> is<00:00:51.210> work<00:00:51.870> out<00:00:52.019> our

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
our scatter plot is work out our

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.969 
our scatter plot is work out our
independent<00:00:54.089> and<00:00:54.269> dependent<00:00:54.510> variable<00:00:55.170> so

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
independent and dependent variable so

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.849 
independent and dependent variable so
we've<00:00:56.100> got<00:00:56.249> to<00:00:56.339> work<00:00:56.489> out<00:00:56.729> which<00:00:56.999> one<00:00:57.859> depends

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
we've got to work out which one depends

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:59.799 
we've got to work out which one depends
on<00:00:58.889> the<00:00:59.129> other

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
on the other

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.680 
on the other
so<00:01:00.809> we'll<00:01:01.440> try<00:01:01.679> it<00:01:01.710> out<00:01:01.999> so<00:01:02.999> we<00:01:03.149> might<00:01:03.269> say<00:01:03.479> a

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
so we'll try it out so we might say a

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.209 
so we'll try it out so we might say a
was<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.320> could<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.559> one<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.769> two<00:01:04.860> things

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:05.219 
was so we could have one of two things

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:14.359 
was so we could have one of two things
we<00:01:06.060> get<00:01:06.210> at<00:01:06.360> age<00:01:08.119> depends<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.509> income<00:01:13.219> we<00:01:14.219> could

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
we get at age depends on income we could

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.610 
we get at age depends on income we could
have<00:01:14.549> income

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:26.830 

depends<00:01:19.550> on<00:01:19.700> edge<00:01:23.200> so<00:01:24.940> if<00:01:25.940> you<00:01:26.120> look<00:01:26.330> at<00:01:26.450> it<00:01:26.600> it

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
depends on edge so if you look at it it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.750 
depends on edge so if you look at it it
seems<00:01:27.140> kind<00:01:27.440> of<00:01:27.500> silly<00:01:27.710> to<00:01:27.920> say<00:01:28.100> age<00:01:28.310> depends

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
seems kind of silly to say age depends

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.760 
seems kind of silly to say age depends
on<00:01:28.850> income<00:01:29.120> that<00:01:29.900> means<00:01:30.110> that<00:01:30.320> if<00:01:30.500> you<00:01:30.620> were

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
on income that means that if you were

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.870 
on income that means that if you were
say<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:34.250> more<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:34.640> earn

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
say the more you earn

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.870 
say the more you earn
the<00:01:35.210> older<00:01:35.480> you<00:01:35.540> would<00:01:35.750> be<00:01:36.340> it<00:01:37.340> seems<00:01:37.670> more

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
the older you would be it seems more

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.670 
the older you would be it seems more
logical<00:01:38.030> to<00:01:38.450> say<00:01:38.600> that<00:01:38.780> income<00:01:39.140> depends<00:01:39.590> on

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
logical to say that income depends on

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.040 
logical to say that income depends on
age<00:01:39.890> that<00:01:40.460> is<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.790> older<00:01:41.060> you<00:01:41.210> are<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.390> more

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
age that is the older you are the more

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.410 
age that is the older you are the more
income<00:01:42.530> you<00:01:42.680> earn<00:01:42.860> so<00:01:43.640> we're<00:01:43.760> probably<00:01:43.910> likely

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
income you earn so we're probably likely

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.150 
income you earn so we're probably likely
to<00:01:44.690> choose<00:01:44.900> this<00:01:45.080> bottom<00:01:45.380> one<00:01:45.410> here<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:45.920> say

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
to choose this bottom one here and say

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.800 
to choose this bottom one here and say
income<00:01:46.880> depends<00:01:47.420> on<00:01:47.570> age<00:01:48.190> so<00:01:49.190> if<00:01:49.310> income

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
income depends on age so if income

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.580 
income depends on age so if income
depends<00:01:50.810> on<00:01:50.930> age<00:01:51.850> income<00:01:53.230> will<00:01:54.230> be<00:01:54.410> dependent

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
depends on age income will be dependent

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:08.440 
depends on age income will be dependent
and<00:01:59.020> age<00:02:02.080> be<00:02:03.080> independent<00:02:06.430> so<00:02:07.430> age<00:02:07.940> will<00:02:08.300> be

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
and age be independent so age will be

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.120 
and age be independent so age will be
our<00:02:08.570> X<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.700> income<00:02:10.700> be<00:02:11.060> our<00:02:11.180> Y<00:02:11.620> if<00:02:12.620> we<00:02:12.830> remember

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
our X and income be our Y if we remember

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.310 
our X and income be our Y if we remember
we<00:02:13.160> had<00:02:13.370> our<00:02:13.400> y<00:02:13.700> axis<00:02:13.730> here<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.570> this<00:02:15.140> will<00:02:15.260> be

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
we had our y axis here and this will be

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.490 
we had our y axis here and this will be
income<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:17.320> we<00:02:18.320> had<00:02:18.470> our<00:02:18.500> x<00:02:18.830> axis<00:02:19.100> down<00:02:19.490> here

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
income and we had our x axis down here

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.720 
income and we had our x axis down here
so<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:21.650> will<00:02:21.860> be<00:02:21.980> H<00:02:22.160> so<00:02:22.780> we<00:02:23.780> can<00:02:23.930> now<00:02:24.670> start<00:02:25.670> to

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
so this will be H so we can now start to

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.340 
so this will be H so we can now start to
drop<00:02:26.090> our<00:02:26.300> scatterplot<00:02:26.660> because<00:02:27.080> we<00:02:27.230> know

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
drop our scatterplot because we know

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.240 
drop our scatterplot because we know
which<00:02:27.620> is<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:29.410> independent<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:30.560> which<00:02:31.040> is

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
which is the independent and which is

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.210 
which is the independent and which is
the<00:02:31.430> dependent<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:33.709> what<00:02:33.890> we're<00:02:34.040> going<00:02:34.190> to

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
the dependent so what we're going to

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.040 
the dependent so what we're going to
need<00:02:34.430> first<00:02:34.730> is<00:02:35.260> sort<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.350> a<00:02:36.530> scale<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:38.810> we<00:02:38.930> know

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
need first is sort of a scale so we know

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.010 
need first is sort of a scale so we know
we've<00:02:39.200> got<00:02:39.260> ages<00:02:39.709> between<00:02:39.890> 25<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:40.640> 50<00:02:41.450> so

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
we've got ages between 25 and 50 so

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.930 
we've got ages between 25 and 50 so
little<00:02:42.680> squiggle<00:02:43.130> here<00:02:43.160> which<00:02:43.489> means<00:02:43.730> that

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
little squiggle here which means that

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.710 
little squiggle here which means that
the<00:02:44.060> axis<00:02:44.480> does<00:02:44.810> not<00:02:44.989> start<00:02:45.230> at<00:02:45.350> zero<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:46.720> we

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
the axis does not start at zero and we

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.510 
the axis does not start at zero and we
can<00:02:47.750> start<00:02:48.170> drawing<00:02:48.380> our<00:02:49.270> ages<00:02:50.270> so<00:02:50.870> we've<00:02:51.020> got

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
can start drawing our ages so we've got

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.449 
can start drawing our ages so we've got
one<00:02:52.520> two<00:02:53.120> three<00:02:54.340> five<00:02:55.340> six<00:02:56.120> ages<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:57.459> they

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
one two three five six ages and they

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:08.980 
one two three five six ages and they
range<00:02:58.730> from<00:02:59.180> 25<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:02.420> 50

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.920 

and<00:03:09.770> then<00:03:09.920> on<00:03:10.190> this<00:03:10.400> axis<00:03:10.880> we<00:03:11.150> have<00:03:11.180> our<00:03:11.510> income

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
and then on this axis we have our income

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.980 
and then on this axis we have our income
so<00:03:12.920> it<00:03:13.010> goes<00:03:13.190> from<00:03:13.430> about<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:14.480> knowledge

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
so it goes from about and knowledge

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.390 
so it goes from about and knowledge
really<00:03:15.200> simple<00:03:15.530> again<00:03:15.740> to<00:03:15.860> show<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.100> axis

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
really simple again to show the axis

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.490 
really simple again to show the axis
doesn't<00:03:16.700> start<00:03:16.880> at<00:03:16.970> zero<00:03:17.180> go<00:03:18.050> from<00:03:18.260> about

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
doesn't start at zero go from about

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:27.190 
doesn't start at zero go from about
40,000<00:03:20.380> all<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.500> way<00:03:21.620> up<00:03:21.770> to<00:03:23.380> 150,000<00:03:26.050> so<00:03:27.050> when

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
40,000 all the way up to 150,000 so when

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.200 
40,000 all the way up to 150,000 so when
we're<00:03:27.350> drawing<00:03:27.530> a<00:03:27.710> scatterplot<00:03:28.040> what<00:03:28.940> we<00:03:29.060> want

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
we're drawing a scatterplot what we want

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.260 
we're drawing a scatterplot what we want
to<00:03:29.300> do<00:03:29.420> is<00:03:29.720> we<00:03:30.170> just<00:03:30.200> take<00:03:30.550> our<00:03:31.550> observations

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
to do is we just take our observations

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.990 
to do is we just take our observations
and<00:03:32.720> I'll<00:03:32.870> do<00:03:32.990> this<00:03:33.110> in<00:03:33.170> this<00:03:33.470> red<00:03:33.680> color<00:03:34.000> we

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
and I'll do this in this red color we

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.670 
and I'll do this in this red color we
take<00:03:35.270> our<00:03:35.450> observations<00:03:36.080> so<00:03:36.230> we<00:03:36.350> look<00:03:36.500> at<00:03:36.560> our

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
take our observations so we look at our

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.330 
take our observations so we look at our
observation<00:03:37.280> number<00:03:37.400> one<00:03:37.960> and<00:03:39.010> we<00:03:40.010> look<00:03:40.160> at

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
observation number one and we look at

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.180 
observation number one and we look at
the<00:03:40.550> age<00:03:41.360> which<00:03:41.810> is<00:03:41.960> our<00:03:42.080> X<00:03:42.260> variable<00:03:42.440> we<00:03:42.890> find

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
the age which is our X variable we find

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.300 
the age which is our X variable we find
the<00:03:43.310> corresponding<00:03:43.550> age<00:03:44.120> down<00:03:44.510> here<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:45.310> then

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
the corresponding age down here and then

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.650 
the corresponding age down here and then
we<00:03:46.430> go<00:03:46.580> up<00:03:46.610> and<00:03:47.000> we<00:03:47.950> go<00:03:48.950> up<00:03:49.190> until<00:03:49.880> we<00:03:50.300> add<00:03:50.480> the

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
we go up and we go up until we add the

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.330 
we go up and we go up until we add the
corresponding<00:03:50.870> Y<00:03:51.470> value<00:03:51.860> so<00:03:52.070> the

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
corresponding Y value so the

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.520 
corresponding Y value so the
corresponding<00:03:52.610> Y<00:03:52.970> value<00:03:53.330> is<00:03:53.390> 40<00:03:53.750> so<00:03:54.410> we'll

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
corresponding Y value is 40 so we'll

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.770 
corresponding Y value is 40 so we'll
move<00:03:54.650> upwards<00:03:55.130> until<00:03:55.430> we<00:03:55.520> hit<00:03:55.610> 40<00:03:56.000> and<00:03:56.510> we<00:03:56.600> just

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
move upwards until we hit 40 and we just

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.260 
move upwards until we hit 40 and we just
put<00:03:56.930> a<00:03:56.960> dot<00:03:57.140> there<00:03:58.840> so<00:04:00.760> that's<00:04:01.760> how<00:04:01.910> we<00:04:01.970> plot

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
put a dot there so that's how we plot

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.020 
put a dot there so that's how we plot
our<00:04:02.450> age<00:04:02.630> and<00:04:03.460> income<00:04:04.460> for<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:04.850> first

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
our age and income for the first

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.970 
our age and income for the first
observation<00:04:05.600> for<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.350> second<00:04:06.740> observation

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
observation for the second observation

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.970 
observation for the second observation
we<00:04:07.400> repeat<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:07.820> process<00:04:08.290> so<00:04:09.290> we<00:04:09.320> go<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.530> a<00:04:09.650> 30

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
we repeat the process so we go to a 30

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.570 
we repeat the process so we go to a 30
and<00:04:10.280> we<00:04:10.610> know<00:04:10.730> we<00:04:10.850> have<00:04:10.970> an<00:04:11.060> income<00:04:11.420> of<00:04:11.570> 60<00:04:12.580> so

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
and we know we have an income of 60 so

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.670 
and we know we have an income of 60 so
we<00:04:13.850> go<00:04:14.000> up<00:04:14.210> so<00:04:14.990> that<00:04:15.110> would<00:04:15.230> be<00:04:15.350> an<00:04:15.410> income<00:04:15.650> of

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
we go up so that would be an income of

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.979 
we go up so that would be an income of
40<00:04:16.250> so<00:04:16.610> we'd<00:04:16.730> say<00:04:16.880> an<00:04:16.940> income<00:04:17.239> of<00:04:17.360> 60<00:04:17.750> would<00:04:17.870> be

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
40 so we'd say an income of 60 would be

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.320 
40 so we'd say an income of 60 would be
a<00:04:18.020> little<00:04:18.350> bit<00:04:18.470> above<00:04:18.650> that<00:04:19.060> maybe<00:04:20.060> about

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
a little bit above that maybe about

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.590 
a little bit above that maybe about
there<00:04:21.070> and<00:04:22.070> that<00:04:22.700> would<00:04:22.790> be<00:04:22.940> our<00:04:23.030> second

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
there and that would be our second

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.070 
there and that would be our second
observation<00:04:25.240> then<00:04:26.240> we<00:04:26.420> go<00:04:26.600> to<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:26.900> next

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
observation then we go to the next

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.560 
observation then we go to the next
observation<00:04:27.560> which<00:04:27.980> is<00:04:28.190> at<00:04:28.370> 35<00:04:28.910> and<00:04:29.180> we've<00:04:29.390> got

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
observation which is at 35 and we've got

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.750 
observation which is at 35 and we've got
an<00:04:29.720> income<00:04:30.050> of<00:04:30.080> 68<00:04:30.680> now<00:04:30.890> this<00:04:31.220> is<00:04:31.370> our<00:04:31.520> third

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
an income of 68 now this is our third

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.540 
an income of 68 now this is our third
observation<00:04:32.290> so<00:04:33.290> we<00:04:33.410> go<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:35.350> our<00:04:36.350> third

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
observation so we go to our third

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.100 
observation so we go to our third
observation<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:37.880> we<00:04:38.000> go<00:04:38.090> up<00:04:38.270> and<00:04:38.450> we<00:04:38.510> plot

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
observation and we go up and we plot

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.780 
observation and we go up and we plot
that<00:04:39.880> there<00:04:40.990> which<00:04:41.990> is<00:04:42.140> roughly<00:04:42.440> about<00:04:42.760> 68,000

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
that there which is roughly about 68,000

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.960 
that there which is roughly about 68,000
we<00:04:44.240> go<00:04:44.360> to<00:04:44.420> our<00:04:44.600> fourth<00:04:44.870> which<00:04:45.830> is<00:04:45.920> 40,000<00:04:46.790> and

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
we go to our fourth which is 40,000 and

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.640 
we go to our fourth which is 40,000 and
we're<00:04:47.150> up<00:04:47.270> to<00:04:47.420> about<00:04:47.570> a<00:04:47.630> hundred<00:04:47.720> K<00:04:48.200> so<00:04:48.260> there's

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
we're up to about a hundred K so there's

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.750 
we're up to about a hundred K so there's
a<00:04:48.710> big<00:04:48.950> jump<00:04:49.220> there<00:04:49.490> and<00:04:49.990> we<00:04:50.990> just<00:04:51.200> plot<00:04:51.410> that

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
a big jump there and we just plot that

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.510 
a big jump there and we just plot that
that's<00:04:52.760> our<00:04:53.000> fourth<00:04:53.390> observation<00:04:54.280> and<00:04:55.280> we<00:04:55.400> go

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
that's our fourth observation and we go

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.520 
that's our fourth observation and we go
to<00:04:55.610> our<00:04:55.640> fifth<00:04:56.000> which<00:04:56.300> is<00:04:56.330> 45<00:04:56.990> and<00:04:57.020> 120<00:04:58.810> so<00:04:59.810> you

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
to our fifth which is 45 and 120 so you

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.530 
to our fifth which is 45 and 120 so you
go<00:05:00.680> to<00:05:00.740> our<00:05:00.920> 45<00:05:01.430> I'm<00:05:01.790> gonna<00:05:01.940> go<00:05:02.030> all<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.300> way<00:05:02.360> up

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
go to our 45 I'm gonna go all the way up

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:09.070 
go to our 45 I'm gonna go all the way up
to<00:05:02.780> 120<00:05:04.270> get<00:05:05.270> out<00:05:05.450> here<00:05:05.930> and<00:05:07.450> that's<00:05:08.450> a<00:05:08.750> fifth

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
to 120 get out here and that's a fifth

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.910 
to 120 get out here and that's a fifth
observation<00:05:09.710> and<00:05:09.950> then<00:05:10.040> we<00:05:10.190> go<00:05:10.280> to<00:05:10.310> a<00:05:10.430> six<00:05:11.920> and

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
observation and then we go to a six and

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.760 
observation and then we go to a six and
we<00:05:13.220> plot<00:05:13.520> that<00:05:13.700> it<00:05:14.450> would<00:05:14.570> be<00:05:14.660> 50<00:05:15.080> and<00:05:15.410> we<00:05:15.560> right

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
we plot that it would be 50 and we right

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.020 
we plot that it would be 50 and we right
up<00:05:15.920> until<00:05:16.220> we<00:05:16.280> hit<00:05:16.400> 150

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
up until we hit 150

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.750 
up until we hit 150
and<00:05:18.120> that<00:05:18.840> would<00:05:18.990> be<00:05:19.140> our<00:05:19.440> scatterplot<00:05:20.280> for

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
and that would be our scatterplot for

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.270 
and that would be our scatterplot for
our<00:05:23.760> age<00:05:24.060> first<00:05:24.810> income<00:05:25.230> now<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:25.830> reason<00:05:26.190> we

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
our age first income now the reason we

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.890 
our age first income now the reason we
like<00:05:26.430> scatter<00:05:26.790> plots<00:05:27.060> is<00:05:27.360> because<00:05:27.690> they're

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
like scatter plots is because they're

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.040 
like scatter plots is because they're
very<00:05:28.140> handy<00:05:28.380> and<00:05:28.770> they<00:05:28.890> let<00:05:29.070> us<00:05:29.810> display<00:05:30.810> data

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
very handy and they let us display data

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.220 
very handy and they let us display data
and<00:05:31.410> get<00:05:31.590> an<00:05:31.740> idea<00:05:32.070> of<00:05:32.130> what<00:05:32.580> is<00:05:32.820> happening

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
and get an idea of what is happening

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.310 
and get an idea of what is happening
with<00:05:34.230> your<00:05:34.350> relationship<00:05:35.480> so<00:05:36.480> we<00:05:36.960> can<00:05:37.110> see

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
with your relationship so we can see

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.430 
with your relationship so we can see
here<00:05:37.560> that<00:05:37.590> as<00:05:38.250> we<00:05:38.940> would<00:05:39.270> expect<00:05:39.300> as<00:05:39.930> your<00:05:40.200> age

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
here that as we would expect as your age

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.650 
here that as we would expect as your age
increases<00:05:41.040> it's<00:05:41.520> likely<00:05:41.970> that<00:05:42.000> your<00:05:42.300> income

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
increases it's likely that your income

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.570 
increases it's likely that your income
will<00:05:43.260> increase<00:05:44.060> so<00:05:45.890> this<00:05:46.890> is<00:05:47.250> what<00:05:47.460> the

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
will increase so this is what the

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.400 
will increase so this is what the
scatter<00:05:47.790> plot<00:05:47.970> lets<00:05:48.180> us<00:05:48.330> draw<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:48.900> conclusion

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
scatter plot lets us draw the conclusion

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.970 
scatter plot lets us draw the conclusion
off<00:05:49.530> so<00:05:50.430> it<00:05:50.550> says<00:05:50.760> as<00:05:51.090> age<00:05:52.080> increases<00:05:52.140> that

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
off so it says as age increases that

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.730 
off so it says as age increases that
income<00:05:53.370> is<00:05:53.490> likely<00:05:53.670> to<00:05:53.910> increase<00:05:54.410> but<00:05:55.410> it's

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
income is likely to increase but it's

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.050 
income is likely to increase but it's
just<00:05:56.130> one<00:05:56.760> very<00:05:57.150> handy<00:05:57.600> way<00:05:57.750> of<00:05:57.930> displaying<00:05:58.260> a

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
just one very handy way of displaying a

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.810 
just one very handy way of displaying a
bivariate<00:06:00.060> data<00:06:00.600> so<00:06:01.260> I'll<00:06:01.620> get<00:06:01.800> into<00:06:01.920> the

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
bivariate data so I'll get into the

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.180 
bivariate data so I'll get into the
importance<00:06:03.240> of<00:06:03.360> scatter<00:06:03.570> plots<00:06:03.840> in<00:06:04.830> a<00:06:04.920> little

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
importance of scatter plots in a little

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.910 
importance of scatter plots in a little
bit<00:06:05.310> and<00:06:05.460> the<00:06:06.030> properties<00:06:06.480> of<00:06:06.510> them<00:06:06.920> but

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
bit and the properties of them but

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
bit and the properties of them but
that's<00:06:08.190> just<00:06:08.490> how<00:06:08.580> we<00:06:08.640> draw<00:06:08.910> one<00:06:09.060> thanks<00:06:09.780> guys
