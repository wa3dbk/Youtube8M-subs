00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.870
 this metaphorical sense that is given to 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:17.070
 home games at times 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.520
 that seem impossible and that in the end 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.520
 they are 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.390
 no football nothing is impossible 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.519
 and when it arrived on Tuesday before 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.250
 everyone will be ready 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:45.040
 to go 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.040
 with everything and to try it all 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.820
 this does not mean that the tie is 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.460
 I have finished 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.460
 but there are 90 minutes left bernabéu 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.850
 I believe in the comeback I think that with 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.030
 our people with our see nobody is going to 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.790
 burst because we are going to compete 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.620
 a great match and look for that third 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.270
 we have to fight every minute as if 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.810
 was the last to be able to overcome the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.810
 match 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.020
 that we can make a comeback will be 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.750
 complicated but with the support of the public 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.430
 Can be done 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.620
 is very complicated but the help of the 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.940
 hobby and self from the first 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.900
 player until the last we must be 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.900
 convinced that you can 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.140
 the real madrid historically I think 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.790
 that has acquired prestige in the 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.180
 international arena precisely because 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.180
 this kind of second matches do not 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.000
 honestly I believe that we 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.310
 we can be able to pass the 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.980
 eliminatory 'and of course the support 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.800
 from the public 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.990
 I have had similar experiences in my 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.240
 era of the player who left home 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.790
 we got results even worse than 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.100
 this one and we have been able to lift or 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.990
 eliminator does not even ask me what I 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.280
 I do now it's because this group of 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.070
 players will not be able to do it 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.340
 I do not know if we in our time if I 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.340
 we did 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.150
 and something has this team and this club is 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.580
 that never tires of doing great 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.230
 great deeds have already happened years ago 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.200
 back and I am convinced that 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.820
 can happen in constant days that's my 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.970
 hope good I would almost say my 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.710
 conviction because I know the potential 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.210
 we know the potential of this team and 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.800
 we know that madrid is capable of marking 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.160
 34 goals in any game in the 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.280
 bernabéu 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.280
 Well, on Tuesday we have that illusion 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.340
 and my message will be simply 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:11.939
 just one in football everything is 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.790
 possible can not be eliminated without moving 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:17.180
 in irremovable field is 41 is that 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.180
 ride it 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.549
 sure they are also going to try 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.659
 help our players to be able to 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.659
 be in that end of london
