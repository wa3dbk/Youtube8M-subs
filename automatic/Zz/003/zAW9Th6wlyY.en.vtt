00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
minutes with them which is kind of a

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.640 
minutes with them which is kind of a
pain<00:02:33.580> because<00:02:33.670> if<00:02:33.880> i<00:02:34.360> go<00:02:34.690> for<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.870> solo<00:02:35.170> like

I'm<00:02:55.000> never<00:02:55.210> too<00:02:55.450> fussed<00:02:55.720> about<00:02:55.840> what<00:02:56.140> other

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
I'm never too fussed about what other

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.350 
I'm never too fussed about what other
people<00:02:57.220> are<00:02:57.310> doing<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.820> what<00:02:57.910> other<00:02:58.030> people

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
people are doing and what other people

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.580 
people are doing and what other people
are<00:02:58.390> getting<00:02:58.600> I'm<00:02:58.840> always<00:02:58.960> kind<00:02:59.140> of<00:02:59.230> try<00:02:59.290> to

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
focus on what I'm doing and I think

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.090 
focus on what I'm doing and I think
that's<00:03:01.900> quite<00:03:01.990> important<00:03:02.530> people<00:03:02.800> always<00:03:02.950> get

that's quite important people always get

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.400 
that's quite important people always get
too<00:03:03.340> distracted<00:03:03.610> in<00:03:04.270> whatever<00:03:04.570> they<00:03:04.960> do<00:03:05.020> on

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
too distracted in whatever they do on

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.200 
too distracted in whatever they do on
what<00:03:05.620> other<00:03:05.830> people<00:03:06.100> were<00:03:06.460> achieving<00:03:06.940> or<00:03:07.090> what

what other people were achieving or what

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.760 
what other people were achieving or what
other<00:03:07.390> people<00:03:07.690> doing<00:03:07.870> Slyke<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.230> same<00:03:08.410> school

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
other people doing Slyke the same school

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.430 
other people doing Slyke the same school
sport<00:03:09.630> or<00:03:10.630> anything<00:03:10.960> like<00:03:10.990> that<00:03:11.170> you're

sport or anything like that you're
always<00:03:11.740> too<00:03:11.950> focused<00:03:12.460> on<00:03:12.520> what<00:03:12.700> other<00:03:12.940> people

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
always too focused on what other people

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.690 
always too focused on what other people
doing<00:03:13.600> another<00:03:13.870> one<00:03:14.020> yourself<00:03:14.380> for<00:03:14.560> doing<00:03:14.710> and

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
doing another one yourself for doing and

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.550 
doing another one yourself for doing and
people<00:03:16.180> gotta<00:03:16.480> start<00:03:16.810> getting<00:03:16.870> demotivate

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
people gotta start getting demotivate

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.050 
people gotta start getting demotivate
because<00:03:17.890> other<00:03:18.160> people<00:03:18.550> may<00:03:18.610> be<00:03:18.670> doing<00:03:18.880> better

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
because other people may be doing better

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.540 
because other people may be doing better
or<00:03:19.600> stuff<00:03:20.350> like<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.680> I<00:03:21.040> think<00:03:21.160> that's<00:03:21.459> a

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
or stuff like that and I think that's a

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.650 
or stuff like that and I think that's a
shame<00:03:21.700> they're<00:03:21.880> saying<00:03:22.090> I've<00:03:22.240> always<00:03:22.390> tried

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
shame they're saying I've always tried

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.810 
shame they're saying I've always tried
to<00:03:22.720> keep<00:03:23.080> myself<00:03:23.230> away<00:03:23.560> from<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:24.070> just<00:03:24.610> focus

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
to keep myself away from and just focus

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.370 
to keep myself away from and just focus
on<00:03:24.850> what<00:03:24.970> I'm<00:03:25.030> doing<00:03:25.060> I'm<00:03:25.270> trying<00:03:25.300> to<00:03:25.540> beat<00:03:26.170> my

into place and now I'm trying to get the

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.370 
into place and now I'm trying to get the
three<00:03:36.400> into<00:03:36.520> place<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:37.000> it's<00:03:37.840> I'm<00:03:38.200> just

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
three into place and it's I'm just

trying to trying to keep upping what

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.410 
trying to trying to keep upping what
I've<00:03:40.600> been<00:03:40.840> able<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:41.140> set<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:41.470> bar<00:03:41.650> for<00:03:41.680> myself

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
I've been able to set the bar for myself

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.360 
I've been able to set the bar for myself
and<00:03:43.420> I<00:03:43.870> think<00:03:44.080> it's<00:03:44.200> big<00:03:44.500> big<00:03:44.830> importance

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
and I think it's big big importance

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.680 
and I think it's big big importance
because<00:03:45.520> I<00:03:45.790> get<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:46.060> many<00:03:46.239> people<00:03:46.480> asked<00:03:46.630> me

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
because I get so many people asked me

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.720 
because I get so many people asked me
how<00:03:46.900> do<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:47.110> get<00:03:47.200> our<00:03:47.500> 200<00:03:47.860> plus<00:03:47.980> gameplays<00:03:48.400> how

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
how do I get our 200 plus gameplays how

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.780 
how do I get our 200 plus gameplays how
do<00:03:48.790> I<00:03:48.910> get<00:03:48.970> this<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.450> I<00:03:50.290> think<00:03:50.770> a<00:03:51.190> lot<00:03:51.280> of<00:03:51.459> it<00:03:51.670> is

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
do I get this and I think a lot of it is

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.670 
do I get this and I think a lot of it is
down<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.090> like<00:03:52.600> learning<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.170> maps<00:03:53.320> and<00:03:53.560> we're

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
down to like learning the maps and we're

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.080 
down to like learning the maps and we're
trying<00:03:53.830> to<00:03:53.980> beat<00:03:54.130> myself<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:54.580> I<00:03:54.640> kind<00:03:55.060> of

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
trying to beat myself and I kind of

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.180 
trying to beat myself and I kind of
build<00:03:55.330> tactics<00:03:55.840> for<00:03:55.959> each<00:03:56.080> map<00:03:56.380> and<00:03:56.620> then<00:03:56.739> as<00:03:56.920> I

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
build tactics for each map and then as I

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.860 
build tactics for each map and then as I
get<00:03:57.340> more<00:03:57.489> comfortable<00:03:57.760> more<00:03:58.209> confident<00:03:58.720> with

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
get more comfortable more confident with

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.990 
get more comfortable more confident with
it<00:03:58.930> with<00:03:59.620> like<00:03:59.920> all<00:04:00.070> my<00:04:00.250> roots<00:04:00.489> and<00:04:00.790> stuff

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
it with like all my roots and stuff

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.880 
it with like all my roots and stuff
because<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.300> think<00:04:01.510> that's<00:04:01.660> big<00:04:01.870> thing<00:04:02.230> I<00:04:02.440> think

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
because I think that's big thing I think

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.080 
because I think that's big thing I think
sets<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:04.000> apart<00:04:04.300> the<00:04:05.080> like<00:04:05.440> great<00:04:06.310> players<00:04:06.730> and

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
sets it apart the like great players and

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.080 
sets it apart the like great players and
then<00:04:07.360> they<00:04:07.540> like<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.020> good<00:04:08.230> players<00:04:08.670> is<00:04:09.670> is

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
then they like the good players is is

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.430 
then they like the good players is is
Matt<00:04:10.390> knowledge<00:04:10.750> because<00:04:10.930> if<00:04:11.020> you<00:04:11.110> know<00:04:11.260> it's

comes out like hundred pluses were like

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.010 
comes out like hundred pluses were like
oh<00:04:14.890> my<00:04:15.250> god<00:04:15.520> that<00:04:15.730> is<00:04:15.760> insane<00:04:16.270> now<00:04:16.510> hundred

oh my god that is insane now hundred
places<00:04:17.140> are<00:04:17.440> like<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.739> average<00:04:17.980> like<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:19.000> set

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
places are like the average like the set

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.620 
places are like the average like the set
and<00:04:20.260> it's<00:04:20.739> like

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630
