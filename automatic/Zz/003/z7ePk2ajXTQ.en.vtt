00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.960

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.260
 want to do this video is them 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.330
 give my impression as this guitar 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.460
 Overall , I have to say it is 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.270
 really nicely processed 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.020
 Instrument mood holds relatively 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.910
 Well 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.190
 you are already in the video here very nice 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.100
 very beautiful woods so there is called 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:58.690
 has really little little horn horn 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:01.329
 This is a great sound 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.269
 was top is me on it so speak 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.530
 The ceiling of the guitar is real wood 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.770
 is not it somehow pressspan or 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.210
 something clay pot well there you do it 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.860
 a bit of a mystery out of what that 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.270
 so now that 's what that says 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.460
 creative camp hampelt taken 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.990
 but in such a price region at his 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.500
 Children are done that too 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.330
 okay and now somehow on the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.140
 take wood species into consideration well that 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.450
 would be a little bit over it 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.490
 I do not play a game with you 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.820
