00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.120 
a good strategy to take out the holdouts
especially<00:03:52.290> if<00:03:52.350> there's<00:03:52.560> more<00:03:52.739> than<00:03:52.799> one

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
people that were able to join but there

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.640 
people that were able to join but there
wasn't<00:03:56.640> enough<00:03:56.850> where<00:03:57.690> there<00:03:58.019> wasn't<00:03:58.200> one

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
wasn't enough where there wasn't one

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.280 
wasn't enough where there wasn't one
holdout<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.400> then<00:03:59.549> three<00:03:59.880> to<00:04:00.000> four<00:04:00.290> assaulter

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
holdout and then three to four assaulter

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.080 
holdout and then three to four assaulter
is<00:04:01.440> coming<00:04:01.709> after<00:04:01.830> that<00:04:02.070> hold<00:04:02.250> out<00:04:02.430> another
