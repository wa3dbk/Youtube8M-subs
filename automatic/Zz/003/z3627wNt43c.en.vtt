00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:32.080
 in a canvas we are going to carve the almond 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.080
 so that it starts to peel 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:41.130

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.130

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:15.020
 through a sieve we liquefy the rest of the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.020
 cilantro with milk and seasoning 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.760

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.260
 constantly 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:31.140
 you have to let it simmer 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:34.460
 we separated the half breasts from the bone 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.500
 leaving the steaks 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.380
 once we have taken out the stockings 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.380
 breasts remove the fillets 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.840

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.750
 may have the breast 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.359

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:00.880

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:39.280
 we wrap them again diagonally 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:42.010
