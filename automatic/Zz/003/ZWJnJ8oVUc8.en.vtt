00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.840
 I like to put the iq 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.860
 when near one serves as a base to me 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.860
 also a preset here 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.570
 translated means 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.180
 that this is more through the compression 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.210
 gets more bite and day and 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.410
 at the same time the iq in the heights through 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.700
 the compression is triggered 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.239
 Let's take a look at the setting 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.239
 more exactly 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.070
 the clock time is not too short around the 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.980
 not to cut patient 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.110
 but the release time is short 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.000
 This value can vary depending on the sound 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.480
 it turns out to be different 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.840
 always experimenting a bit 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.370
 The iq is enabled to have a shaping up about 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.410
 1800 heart the link level is 100 percent 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.190
 In this case, too, is the look ahead 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.190
 pressed switch 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.640
 that makes the iq some 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.570
 milliseconds before compression 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.090
 is activated 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.070
 that's why i attach importance to this 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.260
 make sure that the transient 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.660
 which makes the compressor so impossible 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.660
 still get more heights 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.330
 At the same time , the complex manages that 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.310
 this has increased significantly more 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.300
 without the overreach of your home 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.300
 get louder 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.710
 you can hear in the drums with very 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.710
 clear 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.720
 but also in the complete mix can 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.720
 enforce this much better 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.530
 Another area of ​​use for the cube 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.800
 is the dynamic control of piano 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.099
 Recorded in video tutorial number 85 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.420
 from pokus m6g already on the 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.360
 difficulties with the piano 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.130
 compression that the eig you come 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.519
 also suitable for this task 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.989
 is due to its adaptive behavior 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.840
 That means he adjusts the speed 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:15.140
 which returns to the reduction 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.060
 the need for it is little reduced 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.340
 the mulis speed is slow 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.100
 with stronger reduction this is 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.660
 speed faster in practice 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.519
 this ensures that the compression 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.760
 not as strongly perceptible as one 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.350
 machining with fixed control behavior in 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.299
 our example breaks the piano without 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:37.090
 Compressor to a few places from the 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.090
 mix it out to others it is a little quiet 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.480
 with compressor the piano fits 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.480
 better into the mix 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.720
 this adaptation of the rule predecessor 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.250
 makes sure that even more extreme 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.680
 Settings do not sound 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.630
 completely ruin after the first one 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.790
 regulation, the reduction remains on 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.310
 constant level and therefore less 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:29.979
 audibly pay attention to how the 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.979
 reduction indicator during stop behaves 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:01.090
 I hope I could give you some new ones 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.129
 provide insights and the one or 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.569
 give offense to others and wish 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:09.780
 continue to have fun with yours 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:09.780
