00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.270
 ah 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:13.150
 Hi, I'm a month and I know I have not recorded 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.309
 like a video in a very long time ago and 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.260
 an apology for that what happens is that 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.779
 I'm not in my house right now I'm 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.029
 vacation made from a little while ago 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:25.000
 more than a month I am in the USA at home 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.680
 my sister and well that's like the reason 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.090
 why I could not record because 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.060
 been like making a record is with 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.039
 her and taking care of my nephew and things for 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.809
 the style 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:37.660
 so I wanted to make at least one 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:42.460
 video while I was here to not be 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:45.460
 so long without videos and good is this 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.530
 What I want to teach you today is 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.770
 an outfit of the day or let's say like my 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.310
 look of the day or what I'm 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.050
 wearing this day and the reason why 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:02.410
 what I'm doing is because I think that 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.440
 in mexico there are not as many channels in 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.619
 youtube at least where I can 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:13.360
 have people in Spanish talking about 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:16.420
 clothes and like fashion and things like that but that 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:22.000
 they like as more of my style and more 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.740
 as from my circulation and so then then 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.860
 that's why I'm doing it because I feel 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.530
 that there is not or there is not enough and then 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.620
 here I am to offer one more option 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.350
 in Spanish 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:38.260
 then starting what I bring in the 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.470
 part of top is one is a blouse of 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.860
 completely simple chiffon 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:49.510
 smooth 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.490
 It's collar buttons and back 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.580
 is open I do not know if I got to see 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.690
 but this is true for that and because it is 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:02.380
 as quite transparent I bring in the 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.330
 bottom part a pretty black top 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.930
 simple has absolutely nothing the 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.290
 100 soles a long black top and also 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.350
 this long black top is very useful 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.330
 because in the lower part I bring 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:22.060
 everyone 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:29.049
 I teach them some leggings 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.049
 They are a cute unicorn 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.950
 and rainbows and stars and they are super super 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.020
 magical 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.020
 and they are just a little 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.739
 let's say that when they stretch out of 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.530
 parts where there were more especially 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.240
 in the hip and so 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.510
 they become a little transparent 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.330
 then cover how that part is a 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.890
 unimportant and also especially 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.740
 because something important with the leggins 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.690
 is that they are not pants and one does not 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:05.180
 I should walk with them good being me 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.670
 teaching like everything or a blouse 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:13.319
 long a long is always like 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:16.880
 and a good company of some wines and in 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:21.310
 My shoes are 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:24.730
 my lolita shoes I guess they can 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.730
 to be called 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:35.010
 It has a little heel but they are super 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.010
 super super super comfortable 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:47.300
 and quick so this is not so long 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.300
 and a bit like the makeup that I bring 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.940
 what I'm like using earrings and so 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.540
 in my hands I only bring rings 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.110
 I bring bracelets or anything and I bring these 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.110
 two necklaces 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:11.190
 And finally in the head plus 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:16.769
 my beautiful hair i am using stay 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:18.930
 of more than and I think the light there is of 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.190
 studs and roses that made me 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.900
 hand 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.790
 and that's all I hope fused as short 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.890
 and simple the verses this program is 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.010
 that I make a video of this type I hope 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.660
 that you also liked something so 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.510
 that I forgot to mention and that I think 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.030
 what is important about teaching them 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.670
 like the clothes I wear and that's the way it is 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.060
 As you can see, I'm not a 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.950
 Sylph is not thin or anything like that 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.700
 is in the body of the low model 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:53.820
 no circumstance then I think that 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.370
 it is important that people who have a 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.380
 size as different you can see that 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.680
 you can also dress nice today can 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:04.740
 dress differently and do not have to 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.750
 resign themselves to dressing up with things that 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.030
 he does not like them so much because I really 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.690
 I put what I want and I do not think that I 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.570
 I will have then then yes that's all 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.910
