aluma to aid her in battle this is

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.760 
aluma to aid her in battle this is
similar<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.450> what<00:00:36.719> we've<00:00:36.870> seen<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.110> Oh<00:00:37.469> Lamar

and<00:00:38.010> his<00:00:38.100> Pikmin<00:00:38.520> but<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.210> major<00:00:39.420> difference

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
and his Pikmin but the major difference

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.959 
and his Pikmin but the major difference
is<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.320> rosalina<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.070> able<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.610> influence

be able to hold her own so far we've

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.260 
be able to hold her own so far we've
seen<00:01:22.229> three<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.799> her<00:01:22.890> specials<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.580> launching

type<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.150> reflector<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.020> seems<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.470> distort

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
type of reflector that seems to distort

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.609 
type of reflector that seems to distort
space<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:30.000> course<00:01:30.240> rosalina<00:01:31.140> actually

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
space and of course rosalina actually

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.340 
space and of course rosalina actually
summoning<00:01:32.070> her<00:01:32.250> luma<00:01:32.810> we<00:01:33.810> also<00:01:33.960> got<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.259> see

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
summoning her luma we also got to see

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.319 
summoning her luma we also got to see
small<00:01:34.770> glimpses<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.400> things<00:01:35.610> like<00:01:35.850> her<00:01:36.030> smash

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
small glimpses of things like her smash

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.289 
small glimpses of things like her smash
attacks<00:01:36.689> taunts<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.530> even<00:01:37.920> her<00:01:38.009> aerials<00:01:38.460> it

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
attacks taunts and even her aerials it

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.730 
attacks taunts and even her aerials it
was<00:01:39.479> really<00:01:39.810> great<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.020> see<00:01:40.320> how<00:01:40.560> much

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
was really great to see how much

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.090 
was really great to see how much
information<00:01:41.130> came<00:01:41.640> out<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:42.000> trailer

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
information came out this trailer

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.770 
information came out this trailer
another<00:01:43.760> thing<00:01:44.000> worth<00:01:44.150> noting<00:01:44.390> is<00:01:44.689> that

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
another thing worth noting is that

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.050 
another thing worth noting is that
Rosalina's<00:01:45.530> reveal<00:01:45.860> actually<00:01:46.460> goes<00:01:46.670> in<00:01:46.850> line

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
Rosalina's reveal actually goes in line

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.460 
Rosalina's reveal actually goes in line
with<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.360> theory<00:01:47.630> that<00:01:47.720> they'll<00:01:47.990> probably<00:01:48.229> be

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
with the theory that they'll probably be

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.430 
with the theory that they'll probably be
more<00:01:48.650> female<00:01:49.100> fighters<00:01:49.490> added<00:01:49.909> to<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.119> cast

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
more female fighters added to the cast

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.140 
more female fighters added to the cast
will<00:01:51.440> she<00:01:51.590> be<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.830> only<00:01:51.979> one<00:01:52.280> or<00:01:52.700> will<00:01:52.970> there

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
will she be the only one or will there

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.999 
will she be the only one or will there
be<00:01:53.180> more<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.479> come<00:01:53.780> we'll<00:01:54.440> just<00:01:54.650> have<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.890> wait

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
be more to come we'll just have to wait

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.670 
be more to come we'll just have to wait
