it looks freaking amazing and another
one<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.309> habits<00:00:56.820> which<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.390> another<00:00:57.660> really

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
one I habits which is another really

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.000 
one I habits which is another really
good<00:00:58.680> graphics<00:00:59.660> that<00:01:00.660> graphical<00:01:01.469> looking<00:01:01.800> mod

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
good graphics that graphical looking mod

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.190 
good graphics that graphical looking mod
is<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.640> realistic<00:01:03.890> realistic<00:01:04.890> lighting

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
is the realistic realistic lighting

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.039 
is the realistic realistic lighting
final<00:01:07.200> which<00:01:07.530> basically<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.780> does<00:01:09.780> what<00:01:09.960> it

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
final which basically just does what it

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.390 
final which basically just does what it
says<00:01:10.080> um<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:11.420> improves<00:01:12.500> shaders<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.530> mainly

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
says um it improves shaders and mainly

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.120 
says um it improves shaders and mainly
the<00:01:14.610> lighting<00:01:15.000> come<00:01:15.540> lightning<00:01:16.350> from<00:01:16.590> sources

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
the lighting come lightning from sources

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.240 
the lighting come lightning from sources
it<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.090> makes<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.420> much<00:01:18.600> more<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:19.290> like<00:01:19.650> it

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
it just makes it so much more of like it

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.520 
it just makes it so much more of like it
feels<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.600> were<00:01:21.720> there<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.170> wouldn't

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
feels like if you were there it wouldn't

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.200 
feels like if you were there it wouldn't
be<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> video<00:01:23.220> game<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.700> would<00:01:23.759> be<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:23.909> real

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
be a video game it would be like real

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.749 
be a video game it would be like real
life<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:24.780> yeah<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:26.220> third<00:01:26.430> one<00:01:26.610> I'm

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
life but yeah and the third one I'm

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.480 
life but yeah and the third one I'm
using<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:27.240> realistic<00:01:28.020> colors<00:01:28.500> /<00:01:28.799> shaders

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
using is realistic colors / shaders

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.039 
using is realistic colors / shaders
which<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.329> shaders<00:01:30.659> part<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.020> just

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
which is just the shaders part is just

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.410 
which is just the shaders part is just
slightly<00:01:31.470> improving<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.030> which<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
slightly improving that of which the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.740 
slightly improving that of which the
previous<00:01:34.200> one<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.530> already<00:01:34.920> upon<00:01:35.479> I'm<00:01:36.479> just

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
previous one is already upon I'm just

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.030 
previous one is already upon I'm just
showing<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.990> some<00:01:37.200> more<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.439> these<00:01:37.530> textures

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
showing you some more of these textures

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.640 
showing you some more of these textures
at<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.180> end<00:01:39.329> I'm<00:01:39.450> going<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.630> show<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.810> some

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
at the end I'm going to show you some

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.910 
at the end I'm going to show you some
better<00:01:40.740> comparisons<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.180> um<00:01:42.680> not<00:01:43.680> side<00:01:43.890> by

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
better comparisons so I um not side by

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.550 
better comparisons so I um not side by
side<00:01:44.310> they're<00:01:44.490> going<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:44.759> quick<00:01:45.380> swipes<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
side they're going to be quick swipes a

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.800 
side they're going to be quick swipes a
couple<00:01:46.860> times<00:01:47.000> between<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.509> were<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.720> have

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
couple times between if I were to have

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.190 
couple times between if I were to have
the<00:01:48.930> shader<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.799> shader<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.700> off<00:01:50.990> what<00:01:51.990> a
