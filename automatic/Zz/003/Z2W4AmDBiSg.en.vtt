00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
all the gears work the best i can do is

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.140 
all the gears work the best i can do is
a<00:03:35.340> kind<00:03:36.340> of<00:03:36.459> straight<00:03:36.700> at<00:03:36.819> us<00:03:36.880> to<00:03:37.000> go<00:03:37.120> through

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
a kind of straight at us to go through

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.760 
a kind of straight at us to go through
the<00:03:37.330> gears<00:03:37.599> here<00:03:38.190> each<00:03:39.190> one<00:03:39.400> works<00:03:39.610> this<00:03:40.270> first

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
the gears here each one works this first

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.510 
the gears here each one works this first
fought<00:03:41.770> sit<00:03:41.980> down<00:03:42.630> second-most<00:03:43.630> it<00:03:43.930> down

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
fought sit down second-most it down

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.610 
fought sit down second-most it down
third<00:03:45.520> bogs<00:03:46.390> down<00:03:46.720> fourth<00:03:47.970> block<00:03:48.970> sit<00:03:49.180> down

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
third bogs down fourth block sit down

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.900 
third bogs down fourth block sit down
fifth<00:03:50.730> bugs<00:03:51.730> it<00:03:51.880> down<00:03:52.090> reverse<00:03:53.580> Bob's<00:03:54.580> it<00:03:54.730> down

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
fifth bugs it down reverse Bob's it down

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.220 
fifth bugs it down reverse Bob's it down
so<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.269> transmission<00:03:55.810> works<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:59.110> know

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
so the transmission works and you know

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.340 
so the transmission works and you know
