00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
at last year's CES then it replaced it

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.620 
at last year's CES then it replaced it
with<00:03:22.210> the<00:03:22.510> g18<00:03:23.110> Eva<00:03:23.380> in<00:03:23.830> September<00:03:24.490> in<00:03:24.730> the

city this year's CES we only saw the z1
compact<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:29.140> not<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.440> new<00:03:29.740> 5-inch<00:03:30.280> flagship<00:03:30.910> so

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
compact and not a new 5-inch flagship so

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.900 
compact and not a new 5-inch flagship so
i<00:03:31.600> would<00:03:31.960> say<00:03:32.140> that<00:03:32.170> sony<00:03:32.770> is<00:03:33.010> most<00:03:33.340> likely<00:03:33.670> to

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
i would say that sony is most likely to

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.450 
i would say that sony is most likely to
launch<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.570> z2<00:03:34.990> or<00:03:35.260> whatever<00:03:35.680> it<00:03:35.920> calls<00:03:36.190> its

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
launch the z2 or whatever it calls its

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.660 
launch the z2 or whatever it calls its
next<00:03:36.790> flagship<00:03:37.590> sometime<00:03:38.590> around<00:03:38.980> the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
next flagship sometime around the
