rate you're removing a fraction maybe an

rate you're removing a fraction maybe an
eighth<00:01:12.330> or<00:01:12.720> tenth<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.740> what<00:01:13.890> you'd<00:01:14.070> be

removing if you hope

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.500 
removing if you hope
so<00:01:17.290> you<00:01:17.350> learn<00:01:17.620> that<00:01:17.830> from<00:01:18.460> doing<00:01:18.760> it<00:01:18.850> right<00:01:19.210> so

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
so you learn that from doing it right so

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.680 
so you learn that from doing it right so
what<00:01:20.320> was<00:01:20.470> your<00:01:20.680> aha<00:01:21.270> moment<00:01:22.270> that<00:01:22.360> made<00:01:22.540> you

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
what was your aha moment that made you

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.940 
what was your aha moment that made you
say<00:01:22.900> I'm<00:01:23.140> not<00:01:23.229> doing<00:01:23.470> it<00:01:23.530> like<00:01:23.650> this<00:01:23.770> again

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
say I'm not doing it like this again

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.040 
say I'm not doing it like this again
just<00:01:24.300> because<00:01:25.300> of<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.479> amount<00:01:25.510> of<00:01:25.720> time<00:01:26.020> or

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
just because of the amount of time or

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.770 
just because of the amount of time or
because<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.710> amount<00:01:26.950> of<00:01:27.040> work<00:01:27.340> or<00:01:27.700> all<00:01:28.540> those

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
because the amount of work or all those

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.760 
because the amount of work or all those
things<00:01:28.840> but<00:01:29.830> I<00:01:30.210> found<00:01:31.210> that<00:01:31.330> if<00:01:31.479> this<00:01:32.350> very

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
things but I found that if this very

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.270 
things but I found that if this very
little<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:34.090> example<00:01:34.119> you<00:01:34.900> can<00:01:35.110> use<00:01:35.140> six<00:01:36.040> inch

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
little for example you can use six inch

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.390 
little for example you can use six inch
tubing<00:01:36.670> is<00:01:37.119> that<00:01:37.270> a<00:01:37.300> four<00:01:37.570> inch<00:01:37.720> tubing<00:01:38.400> but

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
tubing is that a four inch tubing but

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.609 
tubing is that a four inch tubing but
the<00:01:39.610> return<00:01:40.030> on<00:01:40.180> investment<00:01:40.210> doesn't<00:01:41.080> justify

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
the return on investment doesn't justify

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.550 
the return on investment doesn't justify
the<00:01:42.330> 50%<00:01:43.330> increase<00:01:43.780> in<00:01:43.900> cost

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
the 50% increase in cost

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.430 
the 50% increase in cost
can<00:01:45.280> you<00:01:45.400> go<00:01:45.520> below<00:01:45.790> four<00:01:46.090> inch<00:01:46.240> tubing<00:01:46.570> you

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
can you go below four inch tubing you

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.960 
can you go below four inch tubing you
could<00:01:47.710> but<00:01:48.100> you'd<00:01:48.220> have<00:01:48.250> to<00:01:48.430> have<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.580> lot<00:01:48.940> more

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
could but you'd have to have a lot more

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.770 
could but you'd have to have a lot more
tubing<00:01:49.660> okay<00:01:50.440> I<00:01:50.680> could<00:01:51.430> have<00:01:51.520> used<00:01:51.780> galvanized

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
tubing okay I could have used galvanized

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.710 
tubing okay I could have used galvanized
steel<00:01:53.259> here<00:01:53.649> but<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.820> turn<00:01:55.210> for<00:01:55.479> an<00:01:55.570> on

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
steel here but the turn for an on

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.719 
steel here but the turn for an on
investment<00:01:56.170> isn't<00:01:56.350> just<00:01:57.070> doesn't<00:01:57.490> justify

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
investment isn't just doesn't justify

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.609 
investment isn't just doesn't justify
the<00:01:57.910> cost<00:01:58.240> for<00:01:58.479> me

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
the cost for me

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.550 
the cost for me
so<00:02:00.159> they<00:02:00.820> return<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.479> investment<00:02:01.929> to<00:02:02.079> dig<00:02:02.380> out

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
so they return the investment to dig out

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.580 
so they return the investment to dig out
the<00:02:02.710> whole<00:02:03.009> area<00:02:03.520> isn't<00:02:04.479> as<00:02:04.719> good<00:02:04.869> return<00:02:05.439> on

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
the whole area isn't as good return on

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.529 
the whole area isn't as good return on
investment<00:02:05.649> as<00:02:06.310> simply<00:02:06.700> digging<00:02:06.939> a<00:02:07.149> four<00:02:07.390> foot

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
okay so that's what's when you determine

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.530 
okay so that's what's when you determine
the<00:03:02.890> link<00:03:03.310> okay<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:05.530> in<00:03:05.710> this<00:03:05.890> case<00:03:06.300> if<00:03:07.300> I<00:03:07.420> were

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
the link okay so in this case if I were

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.700 
the link okay so in this case if I were
going<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.720> be<00:03:07.780> putting<00:03:08.020> that<00:03:08.170> tubing<00:03:08.530> inside

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
going to be putting that tubing inside

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.890 
going to be putting that tubing inside
the<00:03:09.010> screen<00:03:09.280> house<00:03:09.490> I<00:03:09.730> would<00:03:09.940> dig<00:03:10.150> it<00:03:10.180> 40<00:03:10.660> feet

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
the screen house I would dig it 40 feet

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.660 
the screen house I would dig it 40 feet
long<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:12.540> would<00:03:13.540> take<00:03:13.930> my<00:03:14.080> four<00:03:14.770> five<00:03:15.160> four

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
long I would take my four five four

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.530 
long I would take my four five four
pipes<00:03:16.209> of<00:03:16.450> tubing<00:03:16.810> lay<00:03:17.590> them<00:03:17.800> out<00:03:17.890> on<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.220> lawn

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
pipes of tubing lay them out on the lawn

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.360 
pipes of tubing lay them out on the lawn
put<00:03:19.540> chicken<00:03:19.930> wire<00:03:20.080> for<00:03:20.709> Commission<00:03:21.130> beneath

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
put chicken wire for Commission beneath

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.580 
put chicken wire for Commission beneath
them<00:03:21.520> and<00:03:21.640> tie<00:03:22.209> those<00:03:22.540> tubing's<00:03:23.050> end<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.470> the

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
them and tie those tubing's end to the

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.490 
them and tie those tubing's end to the
pole<00:03:23.770> to<00:03:23.920> mesh<00:03:24.100> so<00:03:24.310> they<00:03:24.430> don't<00:03:24.640> move<00:03:24.850> that<00:03:25.500> way

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
pole to mesh so they don't move that way

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.980 
pole to mesh so they don't move that way
they're<00:03:27.040> properly<00:03:27.640> spaced<00:03:28.030> 12<00:03:28.450> inches<00:03:28.660> on

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
they're properly spaced 12 inches on

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.500 
they're properly spaced 12 inches on
center<00:03:29.320> then<00:03:30.310> I<00:03:30.340> walk<00:03:30.730> over<00:03:31.030> here<00:03:31.240> and<00:03:31.300> I

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
center then I walk over here and I

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.199 
center then I walk over here and I
simply<00:03:31.840> drop<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.500> into<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:33.070> eight-foot<00:03:33.910> hole

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
simply drop it into the eight-foot hole

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.390 
simply drop it into the eight-foot hole
so<00:03:34.840> I<00:03:34.870> don't<00:03:35.080> have<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.290> walk<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:35.950> get<00:03:36.190> down

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
so I don't have to walk and get down

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.880 
so I don't have to walk and get down
into<00:03:36.580> an<00:03:36.730> eight-foot<00:03:37.060> deep<00:03:37.750> trench<00:03:38.200> which<00:03:38.740> is

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
into an eight-foot deep trench which is

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:39.660 
into an eight-foot deep trench which is
dangerous

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
dangerous

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.760 
dangerous
I've<00:03:40.390> got<00:03:40.600> my<00:03:40.720> tubes<00:03:40.990> sticking<00:03:41.230> out<00:03:41.410> of<00:03:41.709> the

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
foot length of tube over that which is

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.020 
foot length of tube over that which is
another<00:04:06.760> 160<00:04:07.240> feet<00:04:07.680> right<00:04:08.680> okay<00:04:09.280> so<00:04:09.670> I<00:04:09.700> started

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
another 160 feet right okay so I started

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.240 
another 160 feet right okay so I started
at<00:04:10.150> 8<00:04:10.270> feet<00:04:10.540> then<00:04:11.170> I<00:04:11.200> my<00:04:11.620> second<00:04:11.950> layer<00:04:12.010> is<00:04:12.130> at

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
at 8 feet then I my second layer is at

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.340 
at 8 feet then I my second layer is at
six<00:04:12.490> and<00:04:12.610> a<00:04:12.670> half<00:04:12.730> feet<00:04:13.060> I<00:04:13.330> tamp<00:04:14.050> that<00:04:14.170> down

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
six and a half feet I tamp that down

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.620 
six and a half feet I tamp that down
like<00:04:14.830> it<00:04:14.980> did<00:04:15.070> in<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.310> first<00:04:15.370> layer<00:04:15.730> at<00:04:16.239> 18

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
like it did in the first layer at 18

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.010 
like it did in the first layer at 18
inches<00:04:16.989> so<00:04:17.380> I'm<00:04:17.500> 18<00:04:17.830> inches<00:04:18.010> above<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.310> tubes

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
inches so I'm 18 inches above the tubes

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.180 
inches so I'm 18 inches above the tubes
roll<00:04:20.020> the<00:04:20.170> tubes<00:04:20.350> back<00:04:20.560> over<00:04:20.830> it<00:04:20.890> now<00:04:21.010> get

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
roll the tubes back over it now get

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.930 
roll the tubes back over it now get
another<00:04:21.430> 160<00:04:22.390> feet<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:23.080> tubing<00:04:23.470> down<00:04:23.770> there<00:04:24.040> so

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
another 160 feet of tubing down there so

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.000 
another 160 feet of tubing down there so
I've<00:04:25.060> got<00:04:25.180> three<00:04:25.480> layers<00:04:25.750> of<00:04:25.930> 160<00:04:26.740> feet<00:04:26.860> of

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
I've got three layers of 160 feet of

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.470 
I've got three layers of 160 feet of
tubing<00:04:28.080> that's<00:04:29.080> how<00:04:29.980> a<00:04:30.010> mini<00:04:30.340> layer<00:04:30.610> or<00:04:31.030> one<00:04:31.390> of

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
tubing that's how a mini layer or one of

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.630 
tubing that's how a mini layer or one of
the<00:04:31.570> lengthens<00:04:32.190> make<00:04:33.190> sure<00:04:33.340> you<00:04:33.430> have<00:04:33.550> at

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
the lengthens make sure you have at

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.590 
the lengthens make sure you have at
least<00:04:33.670> 10<00:04:34.000> percent<00:04:34.420> of<00:04:34.570> cubic<00:04:35.530> space<00:04:36.190> and<00:04:36.910> then

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
least 10 percent of cubic space and then

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.310 
least 10 percent of cubic space and then
you<00:04:37.840> float<00:04:38.080> up<00:04:38.200> to<00:04:38.230> the<00:04:38.350> top<00:04:38.470> and<00:04:39.370> you<00:04:40.270> know

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
you float up to the top and you know

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.490 
you float up to the top and you know
okay

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
okay

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.100 
okay
so<00:04:42.340> as<00:04:42.430> long<00:04:42.550> as<00:04:42.610> your<00:04:42.880> tubing<00:04:43.360> is<00:04:43.630> still<00:04:43.870> below

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
so as long as your tubing is still below

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.870 
so as long as your tubing is still below
the<00:04:44.260> frost<00:04:44.470> line<00:04:44.680> though<00:04:45.070> cuz<00:04:45.550> that's<00:04:45.730> where

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
the frost line though cuz that's where

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.680 
the frost line though cuz that's where
the<00:04:46.000> cool<00:04:46.210> air<00:04:46.420> you<00:04:46.900> only<00:04:47.050> want<00:04:47.320> to<00:04:47.350> come<00:04:47.650> up<00:04:47.800> to

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
the cool air you only want to come up to

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.540 
the cool air you only want to come up to
about<00:04:49.690> 5<00:04:50.050> feet<00:04:50.320> like<00:04:50.740> if<00:04:51.010> you<00:04:51.190> want<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.400> come

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
about 5 feet like if you want to come

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.940 
about 5 feet like if you want to come
you<00:04:52.540> might<00:04:52.690> even<00:04:52.840> also<00:04:53.140> it<00:04:53.410> might<00:04:53.590> be<00:04:53.770> helpful

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
you might even also it might be helpful

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.130 
you might even also it might be helpful
after<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.610> trench<00:04:54.850> is<00:04:55.000> dug<00:04:55.060> to<00:04:55.450> mark<00:04:55.690> that<00:04:55.870> 5

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
after the trench is dug to mark that 5

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.000 
after the trench is dug to mark that 5
feet<00:04:56.670> line<00:04:57.670> to<00:04:58.180> make<00:04:58.330> sure<00:04:58.510> you<00:04:58.660> don't<00:04:59.010> go

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
feet line to make sure you don't go

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.120 
feet line to make sure you don't go
above<00:05:00.250> it<00:05:00.400> well<00:05:01.300> no<00:05:01.540> because<00:05:01.870> math<00:05:02.590> tells<00:05:02.890> you

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
above it well no because math tells you

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.280 
above it well no because math tells you
can<00:05:03.310> start<00:05:03.520> at<00:05:03.580> 8<00:05:03.760> feet<00:05:03.970> yet<00:05:04.420> 18<00:05:04.600> inches<00:05:05.110> you

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
can start at 8 feet yet 18 inches you

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.180 
can start at 8 feet yet 18 inches you
had<00:05:05.380> six<00:05:05.650> and<00:05:05.800> a<00:05:05.860> half

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
had six and a half

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.120 
had six and a half
you<00:05:06.250> had<00:05:06.340> 18<00:05:06.700> inches<00:05:06.940> you<00:05:07.090> got<00:05:07.210> five<00:05:07.420> feet<00:05:07.720> okay

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
you had 18 inches you got five feet okay

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.600 
you had 18 inches you got five feet okay
so<00:05:09.130> all<00:05:09.400> right<00:05:09.850> then<00:05:10.090> on<00:05:10.330> the<00:05:10.600> outside<00:05:11.050> of<00:05:11.230> that

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
so all right then on the outside of that

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.580 
so all right then on the outside of that
starting<00:05:12.610> at<00:05:12.880> ground<00:05:13.270> level<00:05:13.360> I<00:05:13.780> put<00:05:14.320> four

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
starting at ground level I put four

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.920 
starting at ground level I put four
inches<00:05:14.830> of<00:05:15.010> styrofoam<00:05:15.280> on<00:05:15.790> the<00:05:15.940> outside<00:05:16.450> to

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
inches of styrofoam on the outside to

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.950 
inches of styrofoam on the outside to
stop<00:05:17.230> that<00:05:17.530> frost<00:05:18.310> from<00:05:19.000> coming<00:05:19.390> in<00:05:19.600> during

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
stop that frost from coming in during

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.610 
stop that frost from coming in during
the<00:05:20.080> winter

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
the winter

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.340 
the winter
in<00:05:21.070> the<00:05:21.370> trench<00:05:21.730> right<00:05:22.390> on<00:05:22.630> the<00:05:22.840> outside<00:05:23.200> of

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
in the trench right on the outside of

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.040 
in the trench right on the outside of
the<00:05:23.880> inside<00:05:24.880> the<00:05:25.060> trench<00:05:25.270> on<00:05:25.510> the<00:05:25.600> outside

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
the inside the trench on the outside

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.320 
the inside the trench on the outside
right<00:05:27.040> I<00:05:27.070> saw<00:05:27.310> those<00:05:27.490> panels<00:05:27.850> in<00:05:28.000> your<00:05:28.120> garage

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
right I saw those panels in your garage

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.380 
right I saw those panels in your garage
in<00:05:28.780> a<00:05:28.900> previous<00:05:29.290> video<00:05:29.610> okay<00:05:30.610> right<00:05:30.970> so<00:05:31.180> you

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
in a previous video okay right so you

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.660 
in a previous video okay right so you
basically<00:05:31.540> lined<00:05:32.050> the<00:05:32.860> walls<00:05:32.890> of<00:05:33.370> the<00:05:33.490> ditch

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
basically lined the walls of the ditch

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.190 
basically lined the walls of the ditch
with<00:05:33.910> that<00:05:34.180> exactly

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
with that exactly

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.860 
with that exactly
maybe<00:05:35.920> there's<00:05:36.730> up<00:05:37.000> to<00:05:37.150> a<00:05:37.180> 20<00:05:37.600> degree

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
maybe there's up to a 20 degree

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.420 
maybe there's up to a 20 degree
difference<00:05:38.050> between<00:05:38.350> the<00:05:38.710> soil<00:05:38.980> temperature

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
difference between the soil temperature

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.280 
difference between the soil temperature
outside<00:05:39.760> and<00:05:39.910> the<00:05:39.970> soil<00:05:40.210> temperature<00:05:40.690> home

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
outside and the soil temperature home

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.230 
outside and the soil temperature home
that<00:05:43.290> will<00:05:43.470> help<00:05:43.620> regulate<00:05:44.010> that<00:05:44.370> soil<00:05:44.700> year

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
that will help regulate that soil year

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.990 
that will help regulate that soil year
around<00:05:45.570> the<00:05:46.140> same<00:05:46.320> time<00:05:46.500> so<00:05:46.890> that<00:05:47.370> ice<00:05:47.490> that<00:05:47.760> I

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
around the same time so that ice that I

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.090 
around the same time so that ice that I
see<00:05:48.300> that<00:05:48.540> you<00:05:48.720> on<00:05:49.050> your<00:05:49.260> first<00:05:49.500> layer<00:05:50.070> of

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
see that you on your first layer of

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.460 
see that you on your first layer of
tubing<00:05:50.670> in<00:05:50.760> the<00:05:50.850> ground<00:05:51.090> you<00:05:51.270> had<00:05:51.480> stakes<00:05:52.230> in

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
tubing in the ground you had stakes in

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.260 
tubing in the ground you had stakes in
the<00:05:52.560> ground<00:05:52.590> holding<00:05:53.130> them<00:05:53.280> in<00:05:53.400> place<00:05:53.430> I<00:05:53.910> did

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
the ground holding them in place I did

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.880 
the ground holding them in place I did
because<00:05:54.570> I<00:05:54.660> have<00:05:54.810> the<00:05:54.900> whole<00:05:55.080> place<00:05:55.110> Trench

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
because I have the whole place Trench

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.580 
because I have the whole place Trench
doubt<00:05:56.160> I<00:05:56.460> wouldn't<00:05:57.060> do<00:05:57.150> that<00:05:57.180> if<00:05:58.140> I<00:05:58.320> were<00:05:58.440> doing

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
doubt I wouldn't do that if I were doing

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.290 
doubt I wouldn't do that if I were doing
a<00:05:58.770> four-foot<00:05:59.160> wide<00:05:59.190> trench<00:05:59.640> because<00:06:00.000> I'd<00:06:00.120> have

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
a four-foot wide trench because I'd have

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.700 
a four-foot wide trench because I'd have
to<00:06:00.390> get<00:06:00.510> down<00:06:00.660> in<00:06:00.810> the<00:06:00.840> trench<00:06:01.170> to<00:06:01.290> do<00:06:01.500> that

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
to get down in the trench to do that

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.590 
to get down in the trench to do that
that's<00:06:01.980> why<00:06:02.100> I<00:06:02.130> would<00:06:02.280> play<00:06:02.400> like<00:06:02.430> chicken<00:06:02.940> max

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
that's why I would play like chicken max

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.580 
that's why I would play like chicken max
gotcha

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590
