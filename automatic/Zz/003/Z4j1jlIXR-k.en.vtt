 nutrition what is the meaning of a mixture of proteins and 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.330
 one to one carbohydrate proportions 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.810
 approximately with the addition of vitamins 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.790
 minerals 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.960
 that is, everything that a person needs to 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.880

 vegetarian sources by all 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.680
 chocolate taste is not bad sweetie too 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:28.670

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.410
 bitter gives you about American

 vegan company garden of life under 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.470
 no title issues generally do not 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.910
 it means immediately mine is like an outsider 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.220
 we have been reading an outsider and once 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.500
 outsider 2 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.610
 we leave those who drink to drink 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.810

 beef here this story reminds 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.569
 according to taste, that is, I would not be able to kill 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.989
 honestly say for sure it somehow too 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:13.010
 Probably here you will go further 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.010
 metabolic Khanka control 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.870
 liquid tasteless chocolate feel still 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.159
 creaks in my teeth like in this sand I would 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.909
 it was a tiger it already sent 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:27.680
 whey protein oh here everything is clear 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:30.620
 it is not at all in this form and stoke 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.480
 but it's great to interfere with the juice that 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.400
 we'll do it so far until I do it 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.689
 send to his center and the last is with us 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.970
 means vegan protein 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:44.500
 vegetarian protein 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:47.500
 berry flavor and chocolate appearance 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.500
 for some reason 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.390
 here it is bitter claus game 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.000
 one-two-three-four chalk one hundred percent 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.680
 80 percent here is functional 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.379
 food functional food that is 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.629
 carbohydrate proteins in half with the addition of 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:15.980
 vitamins and minerals that can be done 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:19.479
 on squirrel my recommendation in terms of 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:22.910
 how whey protein do more 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:25.610
 more palatable about multi 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.259
 power of the formula 80 as I said 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.169
 it is not necessary to stay awake because 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:32.840
 taste it is strong enough but for how long 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.490
 not enough just in terms of patience is 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.690
 two to three weeks and everything chops off 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.669
 functional nutrition 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.710
 Now let's talk about theoretical 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.090
 component that is, protein can not 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.530
 serve as a meal replacement you yourself understand 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.930
 because there are no vitamins minerals 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.580
 and so on here are there any vitamins 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.830
 minerals and there is still a shortage 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.180
 carbohydrates and at the same time carbohydrates all where 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.220
 there is that is after training it 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.530
 looks like 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.210
 but it turns out what you need next 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.760
 this is like a giant story 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.160
 super comfortable given therefore i 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.960
 I prefer energy diet but this thing 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.150
 also quite good in quality 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.100
 comparable within the meaning of comparable 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.770
 products, that is, everyone here already chooses 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.000
 for myself 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.220
 so friends after all this long 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.420

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.670

 carbohydrate and to optimize the evening 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.700
 food intake and one hundred percent whey 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.740
 protein firms are more than mixed with 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.120
 orange juice with added berries then 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.670
 I have this husband did not call them a couple 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.190
 diet yes rather a story during 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.240
 oil work and the need 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.340
 increase protein intake 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.770
