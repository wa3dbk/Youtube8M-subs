here<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.420> have<00:00:15.990> already<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:16.740> discontent<00:00:17.400> and

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
here I have already so discontent and

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.510 
here I have already so discontent and
check<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.570> look<00:00:18.810> at<00:00:18.960> my<00:00:19.170> video<00:00:19.710> on<00:00:19.859> what<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.310> is

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
check a look at my video on what that is

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.880 
check a look at my video on what that is
but<00:00:20.760> I've<00:00:21.000> increased<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.869> likelihood<00:00:22.590> of

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
but I've increased the likelihood of

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.929 
but I've increased the likelihood of
rebels<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:24.500> navels<00:00:25.500> here<00:00:25.800> with<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.609> soldiers

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
rebels in navels here with the soldiers

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.750 
rebels in navels here with the soldiers
contend<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.750> his<00:00:28.410> ability<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.070> increase<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
contend and his ability to increase the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.500 
contend and his ability to increase the
stability<00:00:29.910> has<00:00:30.390> also<00:00:30.689> been<00:00:31.250> lowered<00:00:32.250> with<00:00:32.700> 50%

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
stability has also been lowered with 50%

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.260 
stability has also been lowered with 50%
extra<00:00:33.690> cost<00:00:34.140> but<00:00:35.010> if<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.309> support<00:00:35.640> rebels<00:00:36.000> here

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
extra cost but if I support rebels here

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.139 
extra cost but if I support rebels here
and<00:00:36.950> if<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.070> see<00:00:38.219> they<00:00:38.399> have<00:00:38.579> already

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
that's actually pretty darn good and as

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.719 
that's actually pretty darn good and as
you<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:43.799> see<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:45.329> costing<00:01:45.780> us<00:01:45.869> money

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
you can see here it's costing us money

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.940 
you can see here it's costing us money
but<00:01:47.729> risk<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.180> discovery<00:01:48.570> that's<00:01:49.380> what<00:01:49.619> it'll

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
but risk of discovery that's what it'll

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.210 
but risk of discovery that's what it'll
give<00:01:50.220> us<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.520> decrease<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.770> prestige<00:01:52.770> if<00:01:52.979> we're

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
give us a decrease in prestige if we're

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.380 
give us a decrease in prestige if we're
discovered<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.740> as<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.950> see<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.430> country<00:01:57.030> is

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
discovered but as you see the country is

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.789 
discovered but as you see the country is
pretty<00:01:57.750> destabilized

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
pretty destabilized

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:05.270 
pretty destabilized
you<00:01:59.729> can<00:01:59.880> use<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.329> with<00:02:01.549> factions<00:02:04.280> within

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
you can use this with factions within

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.950 
you can use this with factions within
that<00:02:05.520> country<00:02:05.939> for<00:02:06.090> instance<00:02:06.180> if<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.750> know

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
that country for instance if you know

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.809 
that country for instance if you know
there's<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.409> problems<00:02:07.799> we<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.099> koron<00:02:08.610> you

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
there's a problems we have a koron you

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.999 
there's a problems we have a koron you
can<00:02:09.090> support<00:02:09.450> rebels<00:02:09.840> on<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.590> is

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
can support rebels on that it is

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.380 
can support rebels on that it is
expensive<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.819> know

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
expensive I know

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.760 
expensive I know
but<00:02:14.090> it's<00:02:15.090> worth<00:02:15.450> considering<00:02:16.020> for<00:02:16.470> instance

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
but it's worth considering for instance

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.740 
but it's worth considering for instance
if<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.100> are<00:02:17.130> here<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:18.000> have<00:02:18.120> been<00:02:18.330> warned

by everybody and you have these small
cores<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:24.560> Germany<00:02:25.560> also<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:26.520> can<00:02:26.670> then<00:02:26.819> make

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
cores in Germany also you can then make

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.510 
cores in Germany also you can then make
support<00:02:27.959> rebels<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.620> hopefully<00:02:29.160> they<00:02:29.310> win

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
support rebels and hopefully they win

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
will well we can't actually but that's

doing a small amount small amount it's a

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.789 
doing a small amount small amount it's a
big<00:03:35.660> but<00:03:36.660> that<00:03:36.810> will<00:03:36.959> increase<00:03:37.350> the

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
big but that will increase the

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.580 
big but that will increase the
likelihood<00:03:38.130> of<00:03:38.519> all<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.180> Hungarian<00:03:39.720> culture
