long time ago that I used it you can
make<00:05:07.900> some<00:05:08.110> 3d<00:05:08.830> text<00:05:09.280> with<00:05:09.480> this<00:05:10.480> program<00:05:11.050> and

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
make some 3d text with this program and

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.930 
make some 3d text with this program and
its<00:05:11.590> really<00:05:11.830> good<00:05:12.130> for<00:05:12.160> that<00:05:12.460> a<00:05:12.640> lot<00:05:12.820> of<00:05:12.850> people

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
use it for their motion tracks and they

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.350 
use it for their motion tracks and they
use<00:05:16.990> it<00:05:17.110> in<00:05:17.230> combination<00:05:17.470> with<00:05:17.890> bozo<00:05:18.730> which<00:05:19.090> is

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
use it in combination with bozo which is

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.150 
use it in combination with bozo which is
the<00:05:19.600> last<00:05:19.780> program<00:05:20.020> that<00:05:20.440> I<00:05:20.470> use<00:05:20.680> a<00:05:20.710> lot<00:05:20.830> and

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
the last program that I use a lot and

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
the last program that I use a lot and
this<00:05:21.940> is<00:05:22.120> to<00:05:22.390> track<00:05:22.810> your<00:05:23.470> clips<00:05:23.950> for<00:05:24.670> example

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
this is to track your clips for example

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.900 
this is to track your clips for example
if<00:05:25.360> you<00:05:25.540> have<00:05:25.570> like<00:05:25.930> a<00:05:26.080> cinematic<00:05:26.740> you<00:05:27.700> can

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
if you have like a cinematic you can

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.120 
if you have like a cinematic you can
track<00:05:28.270> that<00:05:28.300> and<00:05:28.750> then<00:05:28.990> in<00:05:29.260> combination<00:05:29.950> with

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
track that and then in combination with

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.290 
track that and then in combination with
this<00:05:30.790> you<00:05:31.000> can<00:05:31.030> put<00:05:31.510> some<00:05:31.780> nice<00:05:32.620> 3d<00:05:33.160> text<00:05:33.610> into

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
this you can put some nice 3d text into

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.170 
this you can put some nice 3d text into
your<00:05:34.480> videos<00:05:34.900> and<00:05:35.430> almost<00:05:36.430> all<00:05:36.760> the<00:05:37.000> nice

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
your videos and almost all the nice

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.760 
your videos and almost all the nice
edits<00:05:37.650> have<00:05:38.650> 3d<00:05:39.150> animations<00:05:40.150> or<00:05:40.440> 3d<00:05:41.440> motion

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
edits have 3d animations or 3d motion

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.159 
edits have 3d animations or 3d motion
tracking<00:05:42.220> in<00:05:42.490> it<00:05:42.640> so<00:05:43.180> if<00:05:43.450> you<00:05:43.600> want<00:05:43.810> to<00:05:43.930> be<00:05:44.050> in

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
tracking in it so if you want to be in

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.170 
tracking in it so if you want to be in
an<00:05:44.260> advanced<00:05:44.560> editor<00:05:45.010> you<00:05:45.190> definitely<00:05:45.790> need

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
an advanced editor you definitely need

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.810 
an advanced editor you definitely need
to<00:05:46.300> learn<00:05:46.480> this<00:05:46.750> technique<00:05:47.010> because<00:05:48.010> it's

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
to learn this technique because it's

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.760 
to learn this technique because it's
it's<00:05:49.090> really<00:05:49.300> good<00:05:49.660> and<00:05:49.930> it<00:05:50.260> and<00:05:50.500> if<00:05:50.590> you

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
it's really good and it and if you

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.940 
it's really good and it and if you
really<00:05:51.550> like<00:05:51.790> that<00:05:52.320> so<00:05:53.320> those<00:05:53.710> are<00:05:53.740> the

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
really like that so those are the

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.740 
really like that so those are the
programs<00:05:54.880> that<00:05:55.030> I<00:05:55.180> used<00:05:55.600> and<00:05:55.870> it's<00:05:56.560> kind<00:05:57.010> of

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
programs that I used and it's kind of

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.390 
programs that I used and it's kind of
the<00:05:58.750> end<00:05:58.900> of<00:05:59.200> the<00:05:59.350> first<00:05:59.590> tutorial<00:05:59.830> I<00:06:00.370> will

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
the end of the first tutorial I will

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.630 
the end of the first tutorial I will
make<00:06:00.910> other<00:06:01.180> videos<00:06:01.450> about<00:06:02.200> this<00:06:02.440> I<00:06:02.980> hope<00:06:03.520> you

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
make other videos about this I hope you

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.560 
make other videos about this I hope you
guys<00:06:03.820> enjoyed<00:06:04.240> and<00:06:04.450> I<00:06:04.690> will<00:06:04.720> see<00:06:05.229> you<00:06:05.260> later
