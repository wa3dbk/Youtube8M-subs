00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:08.940
 Playing tag in the Main plex server from everyone Hello live person of the presiding judge this time 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.890
 I do 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:19.800
 I'm sure I want to explain a little about this game on Archer 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:20.320
 Finally this game is that increases in the wo Once caught since the demon has an ax to wo to have one person 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.539
 For up to 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:28.810
 The person who owns the victory 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:32.410
 Subtitles have been revived from this time , so there are no subtitles in the picture 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:37.809
 I will go there because this map has a good hiding place 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.589
 It is recommended to hide it because it is difficult to find who is hidden but this game 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.530
 I will 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:46.430
 I forgot to say but the subtitle font is different from usual 4 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:51.850
 Use of Tteyuu do it ze ranch font was to bet 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:58.390
 It is quite a favorite one, so only hiding it 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:01:00.100
 Here a little chat re p Lord post this video on what you have posted a video of anni 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.269
 Is it done 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.420
 It is a god if you understand that I can not understand such 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.409
 Then I will say the correct answer 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:16.710
 The correct answer is editing than video in there was because it is easier 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:18.780
 Later you have to turn the Lord into a bloody festival, but the story changes, but now you have the compass 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.610
 You can see the distance to the demon in 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.409
 You can see the distance of fleeing people because in the reverse has a compass to wo 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.210
 Fewer people are running away 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.400
 P The Lord is a good at this game, so I have survived many times 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.480
 Uz 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:42.900
 I knew I had to prove it if I said that 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:50.060
 This game will randomly become a demon when nobody gets caught for a certain period of time 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:51.909
 It's fine if you can catch anything after you can not survive until the end, so you don't have to do anything Work 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.929
 Yes 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:59.069
 Pinch the trouble to use Where's compass 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.069
 It's too late for a day 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.740
 Ha ha ha goodbye 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.760
 It was annihilation 3rd place by this 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.830
 Until the next game cut ah ah ah 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.210
 Yeah yeah 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:25.770
 Why it's decided because it's noisy 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:30.000
 Always That's ridiculous not nuisance'll have it when I got up in the morning 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:36.819
 It is recommended that such a map be hidden here aside 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.599
 There is one more hiding place like this one that wasn't right here 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.340
 And again, what is chosen randomly ? 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.810
 Cut to next match 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.020
 See you again 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.709
 I'm hiding with someone I don't know 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.819
 And don't get caught like this in the barrel 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.150
 The chief justice who betrays a friend here 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.690
 Don't you say that the poor man betrayed you 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:06.780
 Run away 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:10.830
 I wonder if I can not find here? Hide Let's enter the time being in this house 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.440
 Do not do anything Yes is not anything No, no, I said what or Sue 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.220
 Where is the enemy 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.220
 nearby 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.210
 Preparation for escape 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.260
 Yabe pinched 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:28.640
 It seems that I was blindfolded to the one that was surprising 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:31.230
 I mean, I wonder what I mean. 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:36.659
 Do not worry about from hen stinking 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:40.170
 If you can not run away , any map is likely to be a map that will be ready tomorrow 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:46.580
 You can't wear it p The Lord can only hide 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:50.760
 Don't stop thinking that you 'll have to play to make it go wrong even if you make a mistake 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.220
 I'm sure there will be some, but it will be a little easier 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.420
 As expected 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.420
 It was my brother who got stuck in the game until next game 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.870
 Ah 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:13.330
 Not hear only this time what survive flag 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:17.670
 And there is only one place, which is the usual hiding place 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:23.550
 I think I'll chat again because there was nothing in particular 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:26.910
 Recently, I registered over hundreds of subscribers for the report videos that I don't care about. 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:31.770
 What should I do at the commemorative video ? 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:37.660
 When the main channel was over 100 people did nothing 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:43.600
 So the video I posted last time was the first to report the number of subscribers 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:45.430
 Then the wizard summoned at p main lack of knowledge cormorant If you think or Dazemaa watch the dirty fireworks 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:51.640
 It was just a video 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:55.510
 Solo it will be in good commemorative videos if rush out to Well not meaning to the video itself 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.650
 Because I 've never had a rush, I almost fail 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:03.919
 If you really want to see a rush 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:10.639
 I would like to comment on it, but I think that I will use the rush of the clan in which the Lord is included . 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:11.600
 General election of akb48 I is Toka cm but it also changed the story you see 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:17.120
 Is it 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.670
 P The Lord is an eye mass but I think I need to say that if I say it I need akb wind 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.160
 I guess 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.160
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:27.040
 Tehepero has a good shape too. 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:31.390
 Money is coming in because it is profit or not on this main channel 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:37.180
 It says it now in Nenan because this channel is not the sound 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:38.150
 In particular cd because changing the cash earned in the upcoming so Tsube to Imus goods 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.570
 Ainotama 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:45.920
 I survived and I finally won 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:52.580
 This time it will be up to this time there was another thing to say 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:55.930
 Tomorrow popular vote I miss you so much why I say it right now I ignore it and watch it 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.930
 Thank you very much
