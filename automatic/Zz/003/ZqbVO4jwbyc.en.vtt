00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
practice there's nights where we compete

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.270 
practice there's nights where we compete
like<00:02:08.200> compete<00:02:09.200> as<00:02:09.349> hard<00:02:09.380> as<00:02:09.590> we<00:02:09.649> possibly<00:02:09.679> can

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
like compete as hard as we possibly can

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.210 
like compete as hard as we possibly can
but<00:02:10.940> at<00:02:11.150> times<00:02:11.360> we're<00:02:11.569> competing

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
but at times we're competing

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.010 
but at times we're competing
individually<00:02:13.220> rather<00:02:13.430> than<00:02:13.580> as<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.760> team<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:14.270> I

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
individually rather than as a team so I

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.559 
individually rather than as a team so I
think<00:02:15.110> our<00:02:15.680> focus<00:02:15.950> moving<00:02:16.760> into<00:02:16.940> this<00:02:17.060> weekend

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
think our focus moving into this weekend

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.559 
think our focus moving into this weekend
is<00:02:17.780> competing<00:02:18.500> as<00:02:18.739> a<00:02:18.769> team<00:02:18.890> working<00:02:19.489> smart<00:02:20.120> and

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
is competing as a team working smart and
