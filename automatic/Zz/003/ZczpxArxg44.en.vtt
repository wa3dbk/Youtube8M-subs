speaking<00:00:02.220> of<00:00:02.370> Salix<00:00:02.790> that<00:00:03.419> brings<00:00:03.659> us<00:00:03.810> to

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
speaking of Salix that brings us to

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.380 
speaking of Salix that brings us to
palate<00:00:04.500> at<00:00:04.650> a<00:00:04.680> really<00:00:05.040> last<00:00:05.250> major<00:00:05.700> part<00:00:06.240> of

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
palate at a really last major part of

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.560

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
the basic interface refresh

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.660 
the basic interface refresh
so<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.440> palate<00:00:10.740> everywhere<00:00:11.130> allows<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.550> to

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
so the palate everywhere allows you to

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.480 
so the palate everywhere allows you to
see<00:00:11.910> which<00:00:12.389> colors<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:13.019> have<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.769> your<00:00:14.009> in

you<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.500> simply<00:00:29.130> double<00:00:29.460> click<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
you can simply double click on a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.120 
you can simply double click on a
particular<00:00:30.210> color<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.990> that's<00:00:31.769> going<00:00:32.040> to

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
particular color and that's going to

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.490 
particular color and that's going to
bring<00:00:32.250> up<00:00:32.489> much<00:00:33.000> more<00:00:33.270> advanced<00:00:33.750> we<00:00:34.050> can<00:00:34.260> type

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
bring up much more advanced we can type

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.389 
bring up much more advanced we can type
in<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.399> web<00:00:35.610> number<00:00:36.329> which<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:37.190> basically<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
in the web number which is basically the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.350 
in the web number which is basically the
hex<00:00:38.610> value<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.590> color<00:00:40.879> make<00:00:41.879> sure<00:00:42.030> auto

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
hex value of a color make sure auto

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.889 
hex value of a color make sure auto
update<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.280> checked<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.850> way<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.719> can

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
update is checked on that way you can

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.250 
update is checked on that way you can
actually<00:00:46.079> see<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> fly<00:00:47.719> of<00:00:48.719> course<00:00:48.989> that

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
actually see on the fly of course that

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.560 
actually see on the fly of course that
would<00:00:49.440> mean<00:00:49.680> they<00:00:50.100> were<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:51.030> know<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.329> this

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
would mean they were you know that this

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.689 
would mean they were you know that this
only<00:00:51.750> works<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.680> color<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.160> actually<00:00:53.550> in

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
only works if that color is actually in

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.939 
only works if that color is actually in
the<00:00:53.879> image<00:00:54.149> right<00:00:54.350> double-click<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.379> color

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
the image right double-click that color

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.189 
the image right double-click that color
that's<00:00:56.250> not<00:00:56.340> really<00:00:56.699> being<00:00:56.850> used<00:00:57.050> when<00:00:58.050> it's

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
that's not really being used when it's

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.860 
that's not really being used when it's
ticket<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.590> color<00:00:58.770> because<00:00:59.430> it's<00:01:00.149> into<00:01:00.570> again

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
ticket of color because it's into again

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.590 
ticket of color because it's into again
and<00:01:01.859> now<00:01:02.370> when<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.579> change<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:03.059> you'll<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.449> it

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
and now when I change that you'll see it

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.840 
and now when I change that you'll see it
changes<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.439> fly<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> screen<00:01:05.489> itself

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
changes on the fly on the screen itself

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.899 
changes on the fly on the screen itself
which<00:01:06.299> makes<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.720> really<00:01:06.840> much<00:01:07.560> easier<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.340> to

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
which makes it really much easier to to

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.090 
which makes it really much easier to to
perfect<00:01:11.420> so<00:01:12.420> that's<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.080> basics<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.619> potala

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
perfect so that's the basics of potala

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.120 
perfect so that's the basics of potala
