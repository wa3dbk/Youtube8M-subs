00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the motor is also still going to mount

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.950 
the motor is also still going to mount
there<00:01:13.680> except<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.189> mounting<00:01:15.180> screws<00:01:15.509> we're<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
there except the mounting screws we're a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.380 
there except the mounting screws we're a
little<00:01:16.259> bit<00:01:16.350> small<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:17.000> what<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.030> was<00:01:18.119> going<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
little bit small for what I was going to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.870 
little bit small for what I was going to
do<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.380> was<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.770> do<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.670> see

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
do and what I was going to do is you see

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.370 
do and what I was going to do is you see
this<00:01:21.000> leg<00:01:21.240> right<00:01:21.270> here<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.810> that's<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
this leg right here that that's the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.090 
this leg right here that that's the
motor<00:01:22.560> mount<00:01:22.799> plate<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:24.140> so<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.500> adds<00:01:25.890> a

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
motor mount plate and so this adds a

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.940 
motor mount plate and so this adds a
little<00:01:26.189> bit<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.490> thickness<00:01:26.700> there<00:01:27.619> as<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.799> can

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
little bit of thickness there as you can

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.690 
little bit of thickness there as you can
see<00:01:29.180> so<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.630> needed<00:01:31.530> something<00:01:31.890> bigger<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.670> I

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
see so I needed something bigger so I

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.700 
see so I needed something bigger so I
got<00:01:32.850> another<00:01:33.060> screw<00:01:33.390> from<00:01:33.540> with<00:01:33.810> my<00:01:33.990> Emacs<00:01:34.409> box

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
got another screw from with my Emacs box

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.670 
got another screw from with my Emacs box
I<00:01:35.009> decided<00:01:36.000> not<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.299> shave<00:01:36.750> off<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.290> that

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
I decided not to shave off that that

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.080 
I decided not to shave off that that
piece<00:01:37.979> right<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:40.670> instead<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.700> was<00:01:41.850> going<00:01:42.030> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
piece right here instead I was going to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.219 
piece right here instead I was going to
use<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.329> as<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> placeholder<00:01:42.810> as<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:44.130> can<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.549> I

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
use it as a placeholder as you can see I

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:55.039 
use it as a placeholder as you can see I
just<00:01:46.229> take<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.619> piece<00:01:46.979> right<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:54.049> that

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
just take this piece right here that

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.139 
just take this piece right here that
holds<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.619> right<00:01:55.649> there<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.399> thing<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.790> flush

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
holds it right there that thing is flush

holds it right there that thing is flush
to<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.479> ground<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.770> then<00:01:58.890> as<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.189> motor

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
to the ground and then as the motor

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.010 
to the ground and then as the motor
running<00:01:59.640> screw<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.329> just<00:02:00.509> drill<00:02:00.869> I

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
running screw and I just just drill I

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.780

all the holes for the that told you no
water<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.700> fit<00:02:08.879> through<00:02:09.090> that's<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:10.069> so<00:02:11.069> I

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
water to fit through that's that so I

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.290 
water to fit through that's that so I
got<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.400> down

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
got that down

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.190 
got that down
well<00:02:12.480> with<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.830> lexan<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.450> out<00:02:15.450> then<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
well with a lexan and out then the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.170 
well with a lexan and out then the
thickness<00:02:16.410> I'll<00:02:16.860> show<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:17.700> is<00:02:17.850> at<00:02:17.970> Home

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180

Depot you about it up point zero nine

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.170 
Depot you about it up point zero nine
three<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.490> this<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.700> just<00:02:26.850> like<00:02:27.000> the

three and so this is just like the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.700 
three and so this is just like the
regular<00:02:27.300> RC<00:02:27.810> like<00:02:27.990> Center<00:02:28.260> they<00:02:28.380> use<00:02:28.530> four

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
regular RC like Center they use four

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.340 
regular RC like Center they use four
bodies<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.220> stuff<00:02:29.310> found<00:02:30.150> out<00:02:30.300> hog<00:02:30.450> Home

Depot<00:02:31.680> for<00:02:31.710> I<00:02:32.310> think<00:02:32.850> it's<00:02:32.970> three<00:02:33.180> dollars<00:02:33.330> for

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780

Depot for I think it's three dollars for
this<00:02:34.010> pretty<00:02:35.010> big<00:02:35.250> square<00:02:35.610> over<00:02:35.880> here<00:02:36.830> okay

acrylic over there but it was pretty

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.490 
acrylic over there but it was pretty
thick<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.760> was<00:02:41.880> like<00:02:41.970> 53<00:02:42.510> bucks<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.020> thing<00:02:43.350> was

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
like three times the size something

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.480 
like three times the size something

Baja blade body okay this thing Lexus a
bunch<00:02:59.610> that's<00:03:00.570> really<00:03:01.080> big<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:02.100> then<00:03:02.250> we<00:03:02.340> have

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
bunch that's really big and then we have

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.500 
bunch that's really big and then we have
the<00:03:02.760> hard<00:03:03.240> drive<00:03:03.480> body<00:03:03.750> over<00:03:04.050> here<00:03:05.330> which<00:03:06.330> is

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
the hard drive body over here which is

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.980 
the hard drive body over here which is
made<00:03:06.690> from<00:03:06.930> proline<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.100> that's<00:03:08.400> visit<00:03:09.390> point

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
made from proline and that's visit point

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.960 
made from proline and that's visit point
zero<00:03:10.440> four<00:03:10.740> zero<00:03:10.770> thickness<00:03:12.080> and<00:03:13.080> this<00:03:13.260> thing

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
zero four zero thickness and this thing

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
zero four zero thickness and this thing
what<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.060> didn't<00:03:15.270> use<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:15.540> on<00:03:15.720> my<00:03:15.810> body

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
what I didn't use this on my body

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.170 
what I didn't use this on my body
because<00:03:16.380> I<00:03:16.500> think<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:17.280> wouldn't<00:03:17.580> flex<00:03:17.880> enough

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
because I think it wouldn't flex enough

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.340 
because I think it wouldn't flex enough
and<00:03:18.360> would<00:03:18.480> probably<00:03:18.570> break<00:03:18.870> something<00:03:19.230> so

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
and would probably break something so

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.710 
and would probably break something so
this<00:03:19.410> is<00:03:19.560> just<00:03:19.739> like<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:19.890> show<00:03:20.190> body<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:23.720> see

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
this is just like a show body to see

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.949 
this is just like a show body to see
Alexis<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:27.030> point<00:03:27.390> zero<00:03:27.690> nine<00:03:27.930> three

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
Alexis and this is point zero nine three

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.410 
Alexis and this is point zero nine three
that's<00:03:29.060> that's<00:03:30.830> rather<00:03:31.830> so<00:03:32.670> this<00:03:32.820> is<00:03:32.970> this<00:03:33.239> is

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
that's that's rather so this is this is

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.940 
that's that's rather so this is this is
more<00:03:33.660> than<00:03:34.160> stop<00:03:35.160> this<00:03:35.880> is<00:03:36.090> more<00:03:36.300> than<00:03:36.770> this<00:03:37.770> is

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
more than stop this is more than this is

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.410 
more than stop this is more than this is
like<00:03:38.070> double<00:03:38.640> thickness<00:03:38.880> or<00:03:39.150> something<00:03:39.360> like

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
like double thickness or something like

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.840 
like double thickness or something like
that<00:03:39.480> yeah<00:03:39.780> okay<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.830> now<00:03:41.070> I'm<00:03:41.430> going<00:03:41.640> with

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
that yeah okay and now I'm going with

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.280 
that yeah okay and now I'm going with
this<00:03:41.970> instead<00:03:42.360> of<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.540> sheet<00:03:42.750> metal<00:03:42.870> like<00:03:43.140> my

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
this instead of the sheet metal like my

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.010 
this instead of the sheet metal like my
last<00:03:43.470> video<00:03:43.800> because<00:03:44.420> as<00:03:45.420> you<00:03:45.570> can<00:03:45.660> see<00:03:45.900> from
