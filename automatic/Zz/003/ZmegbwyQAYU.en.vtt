have so little answers but after looking
at<00:00:17.789> dozens<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.300> other<00:00:18.510> theories<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.289> all<00:00:19.500> the

managed<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.350> make<00:00:22.500> one<00:00:22.890> big<00:00:23.160> theory<00:00:23.750> so<00:00:24.750> that

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
managed to make one big theory so that

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.200 
managed to make one big theory so that

but<00:04:05.330> right<00:04:05.810> now<00:04:05.960> we<00:04:06.020> can<00:04:06.290> assume<00:04:06.530> that<00:04:06.590> at

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
but right now we can assume that at

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.330 
but right now we can assume that at
least<00:04:07.100> the<00:04:07.370> stronger<00:04:07.850> gems<00:04:08.090> do<00:04:09.340> the

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
least the stronger gems do the

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.800 
least the stronger gems do the
kindergarten<00:04:10.910> has<00:04:11.000> been<00:04:11.150> seen<00:04:11.390> as<00:04:11.420> a<00:04:11.540> way<00:04:11.690> of

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
kindergarten has been seen as a way of

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.580 
kindergarten has been seen as a way of
creating<00:04:12.290> new<00:04:12.320> gems<00:04:12.830> such<00:04:13.670> as<00:04:13.820> amethyst<00:04:14.590> it's

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
creating new gems such as amethyst it's

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.670 
creating new gems such as amethyst it's
possible<00:04:16.160> that<00:04:16.370> these<00:04:17.210> gems<00:04:17.540> were<00:04:17.720> basically

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
possible that these gems were basically

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.070 
possible that these gems were basically
created<00:04:19.250> with<00:04:19.520> already<00:04:20.090> living<00:04:20.390> creatures<00:04:20.900> on

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
created with already living creatures on

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.600 
created with already living creatures on
earth

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
earth

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.520 
earth
so<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:22.760> homeworld<00:04:23.210> was<00:04:23.450> going<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:23.960> earth<00:04:24.140> and

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
so the homeworld was going to earth and

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.800 
so the homeworld was going to earth and
basically<00:04:25.250> kidnapping<00:04:26.060> life-forms<00:04:26.630> and

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
basically kidnapping life-forms and

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.410 
basically kidnapping life-forms and
mutating<00:04:27.290> them<00:04:27.410> into<00:04:27.650> gems<00:04:28.210> and<00:04:29.210> when<00:04:29.330> you

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
mutating them into gems and when you

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.420 
mutating them into gems and when you
think<00:04:29.660> about<00:04:29.750> it<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.260> entire<00:04:30.590> scenario<00:04:31.040> is

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
think about it the entire scenario is

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.960 
think about it the entire scenario is
pretty<00:04:32.030> dark<00:04:33.070> this<00:04:34.070> is<00:04:34.130> most<00:04:34.430> likely<00:04:34.760> why<00:04:34.910> the

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
pretty dark this is most likely why the

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.630 
pretty dark this is most likely why the
crystal<00:04:35.419> gems<00:04:35.630> were<00:04:35.840> formed<00:04:36.229> because<00:04:36.740> Rose

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
crystal gems were formed because Rose

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.999 
crystal gems were formed because Rose
was<00:04:37.970> outraged

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 
was outraged

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.369 
was outraged
by<00:04:39.219> how<00:04:39.819> the<00:04:39.879> helm<00:04:40.360> world<00:04:40.569> was<00:04:40.719> treating<00:04:41.110> the

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:41.379 
by how the helm world was treating the

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:44.249 
by how the helm world was treating the
creatures<00:04:41.740> already<00:04:41.979> living<00:04:42.309> on<00:04:42.490> earth<00:04:43.259> the

last<00:04:44.469> question<00:04:44.889> is<00:04:45.039> roses<00:04:45.520> relationship<00:04:46.210> with

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
last question is roses relationship with

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.290 
last question is roses relationship with
the<00:04:46.389> other<00:04:46.479> diamonds<00:04:47.279> some<00:04:48.279> say<00:04:48.490> she<00:04:48.699> was<00:04:48.849> one

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
the other diamonds some say she was one

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.820 
the other diamonds some say she was one
of<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:49.449> leaders<00:04:49.779> of<00:04:49.809> the<00:04:50.020> diamond<00:04:50.319> authority

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
of the leaders of the diamond authority

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.540 
of the leaders of the diamond authority
as<00:04:51.039> pink<00:04:51.339> diamond<00:04:52.199> others<00:04:53.199> say<00:04:53.469> she<00:04:53.770> was<00:04:54.039> just

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
as pink diamond others say she was just

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.389 
as pink diamond others say she was just
a<00:04:54.639> normal<00:04:54.909> compassionate<00:04:55.659> Jim<00:04:55.979> but<00:04:56.979> I'm<00:04:57.129> going

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:57.399 
a normal compassionate Jim but I'm going

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:59.070 
a normal compassionate Jim but I'm going
to<00:04:57.490> save<00:04:57.669> this<00:04:57.819> topic<00:04:58.180> for<00:04:58.389> another<00:04:58.449> theory

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
to save this topic for another theory

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.659 
to save this topic for another theory
because<00:04:59.379> there's<00:05:00.219> just<00:05:00.309> so<00:05:00.580> many

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
because there's just so many

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.459 
because there's just so many
possibilities<00:05:00.909> no<00:05:01.569> take<00:05:01.749> a<00:05:01.779> lot<00:05:02.020> of<00:05:02.050> time<00:05:02.289> to

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:02.469 
possibilities no take a lot of time to

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:06.989 
possibilities no take a lot of time to
cover<00:05:02.680> that<00:05:04.949> sorry<00:05:05.949> if<00:05:06.099> my<00:05:06.219> theory<00:05:06.610> was<00:05:06.699> a<00:05:06.759> bit

00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:06.999 
cover that sorry if my theory was a bit

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:08.969 
cover that sorry if my theory was a bit
messy<00:05:07.419> there<00:05:07.809> were<00:05:07.899> just<00:05:08.080> so<00:05:08.439> many<00:05:08.619> topics

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
messy there were just so many topics

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.040 
messy there were just so many topics
that<00:05:09.279> I<00:05:09.369> wanted<00:05:09.669> to<00:05:09.789> cover<00:05:10.149> that<00:05:10.449> and<00:05:10.719> kind<00:05:10.960> of

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
that I wanted to cover that and kind of

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.129 
that I wanted to cover that and kind of
got<00:05:11.139> lost<00:05:11.409> along<00:05:11.860> the<00:05:12.009> way<00:05:12.180> if<00:05:13.180> you<00:05:13.839> have<00:05:13.960> any
