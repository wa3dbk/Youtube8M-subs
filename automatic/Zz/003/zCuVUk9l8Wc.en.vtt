 classic American cheese cake but that 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.689

 Nutella cake preparation e 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.600
 mascarpone we must start from 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.489
 realization of the biscuit base that 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.109
 then he will have to rest in the refrigerator for 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.460
 doing this we will need a mixer 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.680
 within which we will add i 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.659
 dry biscuits the melted butter and a 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.490
 roughly sugar spoon when 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.650
 we will have got a door and well it is 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.540
 compact we will reach inside 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.700
 hinge mold so that then extract 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.590
 our mascarpone cake a nice yes 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.090
 it is very simple we will compact everything 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.460
 with the back of a spoon so to 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.990
 level it well and we will rest it 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.970
 in the refrigerator for about half an hour 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.530
 45 minutes then we move on to 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.530
 making of the rusk 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.450
 while when rusk is resting 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.130
 in the refrigerator we pass to the 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.020
 making the cream we will need 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.030
 to stuff it so first thing 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.740
 we will have to whip up our cream 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.600
 together with vanillin than when this 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.220
 he had achieved a firm consistency 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.990
 we will gradually add the 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.700
 mascarpone with movements from above 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.050
 down to not dismantle do it 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.300
 and continue to forfeit areas 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.560
 inside the compound as the last one 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.239
 ingredient we will add the glue of 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.400
 fish that I have already put to soften in 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.020
 a little cold water squeezed by 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.340
 the isinglass well dissolve the in 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.840
 a bit of liquid cream that you will have 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.910
 left aside first or in 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.680
 add a few drops of milk and add them to 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.630
 compound and mix everything well 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.860
 then we can move on to the filling of 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.860
 cake but nutella scarfone 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.830
 the cream we made with the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.750
 cream and mascarpone at this point is 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.250
 ready so we just have to pour it 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.900
 on the rusk that we made 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.370
 contact in the refrigerator 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.840
 we see them all right with the 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.880
