00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.719
 well the other days maybe not but 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.659
 I have to show myself between 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:20.210
 week we try to give me the 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.149
 best opportunity the best 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.509
 opportunity to make leaps and bounds for 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.880
 team 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.680
 if it's possible then that's the goal 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.360
 the abuse of ambition in my head to 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.789
 the state of mind so wise that my saturday 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.909
 morning we try to try to 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:37.100
 build to the preparation of 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:42.469
 build foundation foundations for 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.719
 the match you just have to do at each 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:48.200
 times and fingers crossed in need 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:52.729
 but here today I knew that the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.859
 kicking would be ready when gg 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.570
 when I hit the ball I knew that 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:58.429
 it was not bad but we know 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.649
 never if it will pass then I am 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.950
 confident to see his passions and 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.719
 especially the right kicks 2 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.609
 I was very happy that he 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.330
 would pass yes it's always special 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:12.420
 special of 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.700
 dreaming in the semifinals but at the same 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.330
 time I'm fine that's 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:22.530
 I hope it's going to be part of it 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.120
 from the road path ccsa ambition 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.400
 also to continue but we know very well 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:32.160
 Although Hungary is here we will play 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:36.000
 against the best teams and sweets 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.350
 team they're used to 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.320
 challenge the big games like that of 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.930
 with the games has a lot of experience 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.120
 with the games that would elmaleh 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.930
 games games but also at the same time 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.110
 time the power and know-how 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.350
 in the short game so we know very 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.660
 well it's a big challenge for better 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.150
 but at the end of the season it's better 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.330
 to be there with things to play with 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.250
 the things to do that from him to finish 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.980
 earlier so that's great thing even though 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:12.530
 I do not know him well enough 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.790
 not slip too much but before that was 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.239
 super stage I imagine it's exactly 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.870
 the same 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.030
 but here we play that of two teams 15 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.830
 against 15 with the substitutes it is 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.540
 so that's the most important 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.180
 we have to train in the process of 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.220
 go out no no it's not possible by 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.200
 compared to my situation it's very good 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.930
 to be 100% to be competitive 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.190
 against a team like that but that's the 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.420
 pleasure I know very well that the 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.930
 players will be at 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.650
 to have too much enthusiasm for 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.650
 this match
