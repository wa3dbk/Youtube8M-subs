increased fabrina gen and increased

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.650 
increased fabrina gen and increased
platelets<00:00:42.800> B<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.010> decreased<00:00:44.610> fibrinogen<00:00:45.239> and

platelets B is decreased fibrinogen and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.220 
platelets B is decreased fibrinogen and
no<00:00:46.110> change<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.710> platelets<00:00:47.329> C<00:00:48.329> decreased

no change in fibrinogen and decreased
platelets<00:00:57.059> now<00:00:57.530> what<00:00:58.530> are<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.859> commonalities

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
platelets now what are the commonalities

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.020 
platelets now what are the commonalities
that<00:00:59.820> we<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.660> identify<00:01:00.809> as<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.730> see

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
that we can identify as you can see

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.230 
that we can identify as you can see
there's<00:01:03.719> two<00:01:04.290> main<00:01:04.500> sections<00:01:04.860> here<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:06.030> have

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
there's two main sections here you have

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.090 
there's two main sections here you have
this<00:01:06.420> value<00:01:06.720> that's<00:01:07.140> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.560> change<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
this value that's going to change and

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.340 
this value that's going to change and
then<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:09.210> value<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
then you have this value so this is a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.620 
then you have this value so this is a
great<00:01:10.650> set<00:01:11.010> up<00:01:11.130> when<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.430> have<00:01:11.640> two<00:01:12.240> different

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
great set up when you have two different

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.800 
great set up when you have two different
values<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:13.500> your<00:01:13.680> answer<00:01:14.040> choices<00:01:14.509> now<00:01:15.509> if<00:01:15.659> we

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
values for your answer choices now if we

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.960 
values for your answer choices now if we
look<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.350> adjust<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.460> side<00:01:17.729> we<00:01:17.939> have

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
look we have adjust this side we have

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.600 
look we have adjust this side we have
increased<00:01:18.570> fibrinogen<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:20.040> decrease

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
increased fibrinogen to decrease

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.700 
increased fibrinogen to decrease
fibrinogen<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.450> then<00:01:21.540> we<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.840> no<00:01:22.080> change<00:01:22.409> in

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
fibrinogen and then we have no change in

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.370 
fibrinogen and then we have no change in
fibrinogen<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.630> say<00:01:24.840> majority

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
fibrinogen and so if you say majority

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.789 
fibrinogen and so if you say majority
rules<00:01:25.650> then<00:01:26.009> then<00:01:26.490> these<00:01:26.759> two<00:01:27.210> are<00:01:27.799> likely

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
rules then then these two are likely

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.859 
rules then then these two are likely
candidates<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.540> answer

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
candidates for the that the answer

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.020 
candidates for the that the answer
choice<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.409> going<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.799> be<00:01:31.890> correct<00:01:32.159> because

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
choice is going to be correct because

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.020 
choice is going to be correct because
the<00:01:33.950> person<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.100> wrote<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.549> practice

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
the person that wrote the practice

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.600 
the person that wrote the practice
question<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.810> trying<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.619> focus<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.220> and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
question is trying to focus on that and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.980 
question is trying to focus on that and
they<00:01:38.729> want<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.030> throw<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.299> off<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.869> so

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
they want to throw you off and so

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.420 
they want to throw you off and so
they're<00:01:40.140> going<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.320> write<00:01:40.560> questions<00:01:40.920> that

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
they're going to write questions that

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.730 
they're going to write questions that
contain<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> lot<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.509> correct<00:01:42.960> information<00:01:43.290> but

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
contain a lot of correct information but

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.899 
contain a lot of correct information but
may<00:01:43.890> not<00:01:44.040> be<00:01:44.100> correct

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
may not be correct

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.969 
may not be correct
to<00:01:45.299> make<00:01:45.479> sure<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.840> truly<00:01:46.320> understand<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
to make sure you truly understand the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.670 
to make sure you truly understand the
subject<00:01:47.220> matter<00:01:47.579> now<00:01:48.540> let's<00:01:48.750> look<00:01:48.960> at<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
subject matter now let's look at the the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.460 
subject matter now let's look at the the
second<00:01:50.159> section<00:01:50.460> over<00:01:50.850> here<00:01:51.320> ignore<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
second section over here ignore the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.590 
second section over here ignore the
first<00:01:52.710> for<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.040> moment<00:01:53.430> we<00:01:54.030> have<00:01:54.149> increased

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
first for a moment we have increased

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.550 
first for a moment we have increased
platelets<00:01:55.430> no<00:01:56.430> change<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:57.000> platelets

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
platelets no change in platelets

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.020 
platelets no change in platelets
decreased<00:01:58.560> platelets<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.340> decreased

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
decreased platelets and decreased

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.010 
decreased platelets and decreased
platelets<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:01.350> these<00:02:02.130> two<00:02:02.610> would<00:02:03.479> be<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.780> ones

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
platelets so these two would be the ones

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.520 
platelets so these two would be the ones
that<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:05.399> majority<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.780> responses

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
that have the majority of the responses

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.889 
that have the majority of the responses
so<00:02:08.520> if<00:02:08.700> we<00:02:08.849> come<00:02:09.030> over<00:02:09.060> here<00:02:09.300> we<00:02:09.420> say<00:02:09.720> well

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
so if we come over here we say well

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.580 
so if we come over here we say well
which<00:02:10.050> one<00:02:10.349> B<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.679> C<00:02:11.190> have<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.360> majority<00:02:12.720> here

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
which one B and C have the majority here

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.210 
which one B and C have the majority here
and<00:02:13.680> then<00:02:14.519> C<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.330> D<00:02:15.629> have<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.319> majority<00:02:16.830> here

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
and then C and D have the majority here

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.220 
and then C and D have the majority here
then<00:02:17.879> that<00:02:17.910> leaves<00:02:18.390> us<00:02:18.980> with<00:02:19.980> C<00:02:20.519> as<00:02:21.110> being<00:02:22.110> the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
then that leaves us with C as being the

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.400 
then that leaves us with C as being the
answer<00:02:22.440> choice<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.400> contains<00:02:23.849> more<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.690> the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
answer choice that contains more of the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.949 
answer choice that contains more of the
majority<00:02:26.599> answer<00:02:27.599> choices<00:02:29.360> out<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.510> what<00:02:30.840> the

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
majority answer choices out of what the

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.320 
majority answer choices out of what the
ones<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.319> have<00:02:31.349> to<00:02:31.500> choose<00:02:31.830> from<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:33.000> if

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
ones you have to choose from and so if

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.210 
ones you have to choose from and so if
you<00:02:33.750> don't<00:02:34.080> know<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.530> answer<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.069> you're

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
you don't know the answer and you're

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.210 
you don't know the answer and you're
trying<00:02:35.549> to<00:02:35.730> make<00:02:35.879> an<00:02:36.060> educated<00:02:36.799> guess<00:02:37.799> and

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
trying to make an educated guess and

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.160 
trying to make an educated guess and
you're<00:02:38.670> maybe<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.180> know<00:02:39.330> some<00:02:39.660> part<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:40.019> the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
you're maybe you know some part of the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.110 
you're maybe you know some part of the
the<00:02:40.500> answer<00:02:40.860> maybe<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.190> know<00:02:41.370> what<00:02:41.940> this

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
the answer maybe you know what this

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.789 
the answer maybe you know what this
value<00:02:42.330> should<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:42.959> but<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.290> don't<00:02:43.500> know<00:02:43.650> what

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
value should be but you don't know what

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.910 
value should be but you don't know what
this<00:02:43.980> one<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.910> can<00:02:45.150> look<00:02:45.390> at<00:02:45.660> how<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.530> other

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
this one you can look at how the other

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.460 
this one you can look at how the other
answer<00:02:47.340> choices<00:02:47.670> stack<00:02:48.239> up<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:49.290> would

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
answer choices stack up and that would

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.460 
answer choices stack up and that would
lead<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.099> choose<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.430> choice<00:02:51.030> C<00:02:51.450> as<00:02:51.720> the

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
lead you to choose a choice C as the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.190 
lead you to choose a choice C as the
correct<00:02:52.739> answer<00:02:53.160> choice
