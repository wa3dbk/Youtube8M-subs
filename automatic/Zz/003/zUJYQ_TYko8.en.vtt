don't know why people think sleeping so
overpowered<00:01:27.240> maybe<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.229> know<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.470> actually

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
overpowered maybe you know it actually

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.649 
overpowered maybe you know it actually
is<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.579> suck<00:01:29.850> at<00:01:29.970> sniping<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.479> some

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
is it's just I suck at sniping for some

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.350 
is it's just I suck at sniping for some
reason<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.590> no<00:01:31.740> idea<00:01:31.829> why<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.729> personally

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
reason I have no idea why but personally

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.120 
reason I have no idea why but personally
I<00:01:33.390> think<00:01:33.570> they<00:01:33.960> should<00:01:34.170> not<00:01:34.380> nerv<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.799> snipers

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
I think they should not nerv the snipers

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.859 
I think they should not nerv the snipers
I<00:01:35.310> don't<00:01:35.520> think<00:01:35.729> they<00:01:36.119> should<00:01:36.150> just<00:01:36.390> take<00:01:36.720> out

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
I don't think they should just take out

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.120 
I don't think they should just take out
quick<00:01:37.079> scoping<00:01:37.320> as<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.590> whole<00:01:37.710> because<00:01:37.890> that

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
quick scoping as a whole because that

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.530 
quick scoping as a whole because that
would<00:01:38.220> get<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.700> many<00:01:38.880> people<00:01:39.119> mad<00:01:39.329> why

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
would get just so many people mad why

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.060 
would get just so many people mad why
would<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.810> even<00:01:39.900> do<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.170> that's<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.799> stupid

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
would you even do that that's so stupid

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.639 
would you even do that that's so stupid
but<00:01:41.820> if<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.030> guys<00:01:42.150> don't<00:01:42.299> remember<00:01:42.390> last<00:01:42.990> year

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
but if you guys don't remember last year

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.380 
but if you guys don't remember last year
when<00:01:44.070> called<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> D<00:01:44.579> ghost<00:01:44.790> was<00:01:44.970> about<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.299> be

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
when called the D ghost was about to be

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.870 
when called the D ghost was about to be
released<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:46.259> one<00:01:46.619> guy<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.430> interview

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
released this one guy in this interview

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.429 
released this one guy in this interview
a<00:01:48.149> game<00:01:48.450> developer<00:01:48.600> for<00:01:49.020> ghosts<00:01:49.170> actually

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
a game developer for ghosts actually

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.679 
a game developer for ghosts actually
said<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.640> there<00:01:50.820> wasn't<00:01:51.030> going<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.329> be<00:01:51.420> quick

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
said that there wasn't going to be quick

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.590 
said that there wasn't going to be quick
scoping<00:01:52.079> at<00:01:52.290> all<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.979> coffee<00:01:53.280> ghosts<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.060> if

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
scoping at all and coffee ghosts and if

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.690 
scoping at all and coffee ghosts and if
you<00:01:54.780> guys<00:01:54.930> don't<00:01:55.079> recall<00:01:55.439> there<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.189> quick

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
you guys don't recall there is quick

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.850 
you guys don't recall there is quick
scoping<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.240> ghosts<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.560> probably

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
scoping and ghosts so this is probably

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.999 
scoping and ghosts so this is probably
just<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.700> bunch<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.390> PR<00:02:01.229> stuff<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.890> he's

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
just a bunch of PR stuff that he's

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.950 
just a bunch of PR stuff that he's
trying<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.430> say<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:03.119> get<00:02:03.270> more<00:02:03.450> people<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.750> buy

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
trying to say to get more people to buy

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.170 
trying to say to get more people to buy
the<00:02:04.020> game<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.649> think<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.729> sniping<00:02:06.090> is

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
the game I think that the sniping is

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.429 
the game I think that the sniping is
going<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.360> be<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> little<00:02:06.750> bit<00:02:06.930> harder<00:02:07.200> advanced

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
going to be a little bit harder advanced

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.930 
going to be a little bit harder advanced
warfare<00:02:07.860> but<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.160> definitely<00:02:08.520> won't<00:02:08.819> be

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
warfare but it definitely won't be

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.820 
warfare but it definitely won't be
impossible<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.929> guys<00:02:10.140> know<00:02:10.349> from<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.649> game

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
impossible you guys know from the game

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.500 
impossible you guys know from the game
play<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.190> background<00:02:11.370> right<00:02:11.700> now<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:12.330> can

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
play in the background right now you can

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.730 
play in the background right now you can
see<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.780> sniping

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
see that sniping

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.770 
see that sniping
is<00:02:13.800> not<00:02:14.070> impossible<00:02:14.580> in<00:02:15.060> advanced<00:02:15.330> warfare

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
is not impossible in advanced warfare

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.000 
is not impossible in advanced warfare
like<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.080> guy<00:02:16.230> is<00:02:16.290> able<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.650> quickscope

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
like this guy is able to quickscope

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.740 
like this guy is able to quickscope
pretty<00:02:17.280> easily<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.670> stuff<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.180> from<00:02:18.630> the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
pretty easily and stuff and from the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.030 
pretty easily and stuff and from the
people<00:02:19.020> who<00:02:19.050> have<00:02:19.290> talked<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.800> who<00:02:19.950> have

people who have talked to who have
already<00:02:20.190> played<00:02:20.520> advanced<00:02:20.790> warfare<00:02:21.180> they

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
already played advanced warfare they

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.510 
already played advanced warfare they
told<00:02:21.990> me<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.140> sniping<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.740> great<00:02:23.010> they<00:02:23.310> told

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
told me that sniping is great they told

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.550 
told me that sniping is great they told
me<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.670> they<00:02:23.850> likes<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.300> think<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:24.780> maybe<00:02:25.350> this

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
me that they likes I think so maybe this

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.230 
me that they likes I think so maybe this
is<00:02:25.740> just<00:02:25.770> stuff<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.340> he's<00:02:26.580> doing<00:02:26.730> for<00:02:26.970> PR

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
is just stuff that he's doing for PR

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.700 
is just stuff that he's doing for PR
purposes<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.900> he's<00:02:27.990> just<00:02:28.140> trying<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.560> make

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
purposes and he's just trying to make

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.260 
purposes and he's just trying to make
everyone<00:02:29.010> happy<00:02:29.430> with<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.640> game<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.120> more

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
everyone happy with the game so more

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.780 
everyone happy with the game so more
people<00:02:30.420> can<00:02:30.690> buy<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:30.990> but<00:02:31.800> personally<00:02:32.550> I<00:02:32.580> think

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
people can buy it but personally I think

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.970 
people can buy it but personally I think
that<00:02:33.210> this<00:02:33.330> is<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.720> little<00:02:34.170> bit<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.350> BS<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.890> know

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
that this is a little bit of BS you know

sniping<00:02:41.280> should<00:02:41.460> be<00:02:41.550> like<00:02:41.700> an<00:02:41.820> advanced

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
sniping should be like an advanced

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.370 
sniping should be like an advanced
warfare<00:02:42.480> do<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.690> guys<00:02:42.810> think<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.170> should<00:02:43.290> be

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
warfare do you guys think it should be

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.780 
warfare do you guys think it should be
like<00:02:43.470> black<00:02:43.680> ops<00:02:43.860> 1<00:02:43.950> sniping<00:02:44.490> where<00:02:44.640> was<00:02:44.730> a

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
like black ops 1 sniping where was a

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.370 
like black ops 1 sniping where was a
little<00:02:44.970> bit<00:02:45.090> challenging<00:02:45.570> or<00:02:45.870> do<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.200> think

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
little bit challenging or do you think

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.840 
little bit challenging or do you think
it<00:02:46.440> should<00:02:46.470> be<00:02:46.620> like<00:02:46.830> black<00:02:47.070> ops<00:02:47.220> 2<00:02:47.430> sniping

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
it should be like black ops 2 sniping

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.460 
it should be like black ops 2 sniping
we're<00:02:48.120> obviously<00:02:48.360> probably<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.290> best

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
we're obviously probably the best
