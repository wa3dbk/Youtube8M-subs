00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.120
I'm Arne Duncan, U.S. Secretary of Education.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.250
Our shared goal of preparing all students
for college, careers, and civic life cannot

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.029
be met without first creating the safe campuses
and positive school climates where teaching

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:21.529
and learning can thrive.

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.269
Creating a safe school and a positive school
climate can be tough work.

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.430
No student or teacher should feel unsafe or
unable to concentrate on learning because

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.000
of violence or disruptive behavior.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.699
Yet even as we set high expectations for student
behavior, we must also emphasize prevention

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.580
and supportive approaches that keep students
in school, engaged in learning.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:53.659
Today, too many students are unnecessarily
removed from class each year due to suspensions,

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.720
expulsions, and other exclusionary discipline
practices.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:04.129
In the 2011 school year alone, more than 3
million public school students received out-of-school

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.140
suspensions, and over a hundred thousand students
were expelled, leading to our students losing

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.170
hundreds of thousands of hours of instructional
time..

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.380
Youth of color and students with disabilities
are far more likely to be removed from school

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.950
for disciplinary reasons than other students.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.590
African American students are over 3 times
more likely than their White peers to be suspended

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.520
or expelled, often for similar offenses.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.630
No one questions that school leaders need
to have effective policies in place to make

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.649
their campuses safe havens where learning
can flourish.

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:44.080
Yet most exclusionary disciplinary actions
are for non-violent student behaviors, many

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.219
of which once meant a phone call home.

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.920
Suspending and expelling students for nonviolent
behaviors comes at great cost to both students

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.679
and their communities: suspended students
are more likely to drop out or come into contact

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.990
with the juvenile justice system.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.829
I'm pleased to work with Attorney General
Holder to advance our partnership -- the Supportive

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.060
School Discipline Initiative.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.200
Together, we call on state, district, and
school leaders to rethink school discipline.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.180
To help educators create safe and supportive
environments, and reduce disproportionate

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.800
and high rates of exclusionary discipline,
we are issuing a package of resources for

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.360
educators, school leaders, and parents.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.740
That package includes new guidance on every
school's legal obligation, under federal law,

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:39.420
to administer student discipline without discriminating
on the basis of race, color, or national origin.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.740
And it includes a set of Guiding Principles
to help communities prevent misbehavior and

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.140
create positive school climates.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:54.550
You can learn more about these resources at
ed.gov/school-discipline.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.740
If schools are to succeed, it is essential
that they have the full support of parents,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.890
communities, and lawmakers.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.800
And it is essential that educators have access
to the resources and training to support positive

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.560
student behavior and implement alternatives
to exclusionary discipline.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.960
A safe school, a school with a positive climate,
should also be a school with fair, appropriate

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.790
discipline policies that keep students in
school and learning.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.990
Thank you.
