00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 ok us girls in this video I'm going with 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.160
 you look what would happen if 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.500
 two male youtubers a child 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.120
 would indeed get guys wise 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.679
 so that's what I'm not going to this video 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.000
 of course i have latest video 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.220
 uploaded on my game plan your a game 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.750
 in which i went to watch youtubers out 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.640
 and first twenty or thirty 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.890
 year old would be under the influence of 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.269
 drugs or not under the influence of drugs and 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.099
 it seemed to me it still had the idea to do this 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.289
 I did see this website last here 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.300
 so boys are girls with hail moves 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.369
 you watch what are going to happen in which 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.100
 for example in and david becomes flat there 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.620
