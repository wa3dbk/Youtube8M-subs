00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
television right now we have the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.290 
television right now we have the
capability<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.379> doing<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.770> at<00:00:40.950> 16<00:00:41.940> times<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
capability of doing it at 16 times the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.290 
capability of doing it at 16 times the
resolution<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:43.070> current<00:00:44.070> televisions<00:00:44.789> as<00:00:45.090> you

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
resolution of current televisions as you

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.319 
resolution of current televisions as you
speak<00:00:45.570> see<00:00:45.809> now<00:00:45.989> 8k<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.160> going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.120> be<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
speak see now 8k is going to be the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.209 
speak see now 8k is going to be the
future<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:49.170> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> lot<00:00:49.980> sooner

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
future and it's going to be a lot sooner

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.709 
future and it's going to be a lot sooner
than<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.520> think<00:00:50.730> people<00:00:50.879> actually<00:00:51.120> expect

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
than I think people actually expect

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.750 
than I think people actually expect
there's<00:00:52.230> already<00:00:52.440> talk<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:53.010> people<00:00:53.399> pushing

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
there's already talk of people pushing

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.529 
there's already talk of people pushing
8k<00:00:54.449> resolution<00:00:54.680> by<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.739> year<00:00:56.129> 2016<00:00:56.910> wow

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
8k resolution by the year 2016 wow

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.990 
8k resolution by the year 2016 wow
that's<00:00:57.840> pretty<00:00:57.989> crazy<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.680> why<00:00:58.890> why<00:00:59.550> if<00:00:59.820> you

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
that's pretty crazy so why why if you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.459 
that's pretty crazy so why why if you
have<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> capability<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.870> do<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.140> now<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.289> can't

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
have the capability to do it now I can't

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.709 
have the capability to do it now I can't
I<00:01:01.890> have<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.219> now<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.609> very<00:01:03.030> expensive<00:01:03.300> right

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
I have it now it's very expensive right

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:04.939 
I have it now it's very expensive right
now<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:04.170> expensive<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.799> know

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
now it's expensive for you to know

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.440 
now it's expensive for you to know
they're<00:01:05.189> expensive<00:01:05.580> for<00:01:05.850> me<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.000> buy<00:01:06.119> both

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
they're expensive for me to buy both

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.300 
they're expensive for me to buy both
very<00:01:07.260> very<00:01:07.500> expensive<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.920> build<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
very very expensive to build the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.340 
very very expensive to build the
contents<00:01:08.760> not<00:01:08.909> readily<00:01:09.150> available<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.080> until

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
contents not readily available so until

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.020 
contents not readily available so until
that<00:01:10.409> happens<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:11.220> not<00:01:11.340> really<00:01:11.549> necessarily

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
that happens it's not really necessarily

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.880 
that happens it's not really necessarily
a<00:01:12.150> need<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:12.840> much<00:01:13.080> but<00:01:13.619> you're<00:01:13.799> going

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
a need for it as much but you're going

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.859 
a need for it as much but you're going
to<00:01:13.950> see<00:01:14.159> content<00:01:14.640> continue<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.240> move<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.450> as

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
to see content continue to move just as

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.570 
to see content continue to move just as
rapidly<00:01:16.320> as<00:01:16.409> let's<00:01:16.860> say<00:01:16.950> memory<00:01:17.430> and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
rapidly as let's say memory and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.580 
rapidly as let's say memory and
computers<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.630> guys<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:19.020> actually<00:01:19.409> see

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
computers so you guys can actually see

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.380 
computers so you guys can actually see
this<00:01:19.740> necessarily<00:01:20.490> because<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.909> resolution

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
this necessarily because the resolution

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.320 
this necessarily because the resolution
on<00:01:21.509> your<00:01:21.930> computers<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.979> our<00:01:23.939> live<00:01:24.119> stream

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
on your computers and our live stream

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.880 
on your computers and our live stream
isn't<00:01:24.750> as<00:01:24.840> good<00:01:25.049> as<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.650> can't

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
isn't as good as it so you can't

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.870 
isn't as good as it so you can't
experience<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:26.549> telling<00:01:26.820> you

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
experience it but I'm telling you

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.999 
experience it but I'm telling you
firsthand<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.320> pretty<00:01:28.680> incredible

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
firsthand that this is pretty incredible

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.340 
firsthand that this is pretty incredible
it<00:01:29.790> really<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.240> when<00:01:30.900> people<00:01:31.140> talk<00:01:31.320> about

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
it really is when people talk about

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.929 
it really is when people talk about
resolution<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.579> one<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.790> those<00:01:32.880> things

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
resolution to it's one of those things

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.460 
resolution to it's one of those things
that<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:33.420> you're<00:01:33.540> standing<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:34.049> far<00:01:34.290> away

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that if you're standing this far away

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.630 
that if you're standing this far away
from<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.860> really<00:01:34.979> don't<00:01:35.189> get<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.340> chance<00:01:35.520> to

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
from it you really don't get a chance to

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.370 
from it you really don't get a chance to
see<00:01:35.909> how<00:01:36.329> impressive<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.020> we'll<00:01:37.200> go<00:01:37.290> ahead

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
see how impressive it is we'll go ahead

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.899 
see how impressive it is we'll go ahead
and<00:01:37.560> move<00:01:37.650> forward<00:01:37.950> okay<00:01:38.159> yeah<00:01:38.460> I'm<00:01:38.610> down<00:01:38.759> with

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909
