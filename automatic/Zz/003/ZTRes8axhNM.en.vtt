00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.080 

so<00:00:00.630> I<00:00:01.110> guess<00:00:01.860> that's<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.190> little<00:00:02.370> bit<00:00:02.580> when<00:00:03.060> he

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
so I guess that's a little bit when he

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.039 
so I guess that's a little bit when he
doesn't<00:00:03.389> 24<00:00:03.899> miler<00:00:04.310> it<00:00:05.310> you<00:00:05.790> know<00:00:05.879> his<00:00:06.750> goal

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
doesn't 24 miler it you know his goal

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.589 
doesn't 24 miler it you know his goal
race<00:00:07.379> pace<00:00:07.649> for<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.010> most<00:00:08.250> part<00:00:08.519> going<00:00:09.420> into

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
race pace for the most part going into

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.039 
race pace for the most part going into
these<00:00:09.719> races<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.260> low<00:00:10.469> for<00:00:10.740> 50<00:00:11.099> paise<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:12.179> you

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
these races is low for 50 paise so you

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.200 
these races is low for 50 paise so you
know<00:00:13.139> probably<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:13.950> look<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.670> slowest<00:00:15.089> this

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
know probably is look the slowest this

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.820 
know probably is look the slowest this
marathon<00:00:15.509> pace<00:00:15.900> probably<00:00:16.350> was<00:00:16.529> in

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
marathon pace probably was in

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.800 
marathon pace probably was in
preparation<00:00:17.430> for<00:00:17.730> these<00:00:18.090> marathons<00:00:18.420> around

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
preparation for these marathons around

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.109 
preparation for these marathons around
for<00:00:19.020> fifty<00:00:19.260> five<00:00:19.439> forty<00:00:19.650> four<00:00:20.039> days<00:00:20.250> was<00:00:20.910> kind

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
for fifty five forty four days was kind

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.759 
for fifty five forty four days was kind
of<00:00:21.180> what<00:00:21.300> we<00:00:21.420> are<00:00:21.449> looking<00:00:21.600> at<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:22.410> when<00:00:22.650> he

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
of what we are looking at so when he

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.450 
of what we are looking at so when he
does<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.240> run<00:00:24.240> like<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:24.810> he<00:00:25.740> usually<00:00:25.980> starts

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
does a run like that he usually starts

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.070 
does a run like that he usually starts
somewhere<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.000> neighborhood<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.390> 520<00:00:28.050> a

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
somewhere in the neighborhood of 520 a

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.589 
somewhere in the neighborhood of 520 a
mile<00:00:28.580> we<00:00:29.580> basing<00:00:30.029> everything<00:00:30.330> off<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
mile we basing everything off the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.170 
mile we basing everything off the
percent<00:00:30.960> as<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.109> race<00:00:31.289> pace<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.820> type

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
percent as a race pace and so that type

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.970 
percent as a race pace and so that type
of<00:00:33.329> run<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:33.780> called<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.050> support<00:00:34.500> run<00:00:34.680> and

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
of run is just called a support run and

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.310 
of run is just called a support run and
so<00:00:35.489> what<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:35.880> try<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.120> finish<00:00:36.540> at<00:00:36.809> race<00:00:37.170> pace

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
so what we try to finish at race pace

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.560 
so what we try to finish at race pace
are<00:00:37.710> close<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.489> think<00:00:39.059> he<00:00:39.180> averaged

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
are close to it I think he averaged

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.569 
are close to it I think he averaged
before<00:00:39.930> Beijing<00:00:40.290> looked<00:00:40.530> 5/10<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> mile<00:00:41.250> which

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
before Beijing looked 5/10 a mile which

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.810 
before Beijing looked 5/10 a mile which
is<00:00:41.610> roughly<00:00:42.170> you<00:00:43.170> know<00:00:43.200> 15<00:00:44.160> seconds<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.640> mile

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
is roughly you know 15 seconds a mile

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.520 
is roughly you know 15 seconds a mile
off<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> race<00:00:45.390> pace<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:45.870> would<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.500> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
off a race pace so that would just be a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.529 
off a race pace so that would just be a
support<00:00:46.950> run<00:00:47.129> but<00:00:47.309> he<00:00:47.820> definitely<00:00:48.059> takes

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
support run but he definitely takes

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.040 
support run but he definitely takes
three<00:00:48.870> or<00:00:48.960> four<00:00:49.140> days<00:00:49.640> and<00:00:50.750> as<00:00:51.750> he's<00:00:51.899> getting

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
three or four days and as he's getting

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.990 
three or four days and as he's getting
in<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.320> last<00:00:52.530> five<00:00:52.890> or<00:00:52.949> six<00:00:53.160> weeks<00:00:53.340> before<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
in the last five or six weeks before the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.360 
in the last five or six weeks before the
marathon<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.840> workouts<00:00:55.710> are<00:00:55.829> pretty<00:00:56.129> taxing

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
marathon the workouts are pretty taxing

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.400 
marathon the workouts are pretty taxing
that<00:00:56.699> he'll<00:00:56.940> take<00:00:57.149> anywhere<00:00:57.510> from<00:00:57.570> three<00:00:58.379> to

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
that he'll take anywhere from three to

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.189 
that he'll take anywhere from three to
five<00:00:58.649> days<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.129> recovery<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.760> between<00:01:00.199> and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
five days of recovery in between and

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.349 
five days of recovery in between and
that's<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.859> real<00:01:02.010> key<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.340> what<00:01:02.850> how<00:01:03.300> he

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
that's the real key is what how he

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.329 
that's the real key is what how he
recovers<00:01:03.960> off<00:01:04.110> those<00:01:04.290> runs<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:04.920> very<00:01:05.129> very

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
recovers off those runs it's very very

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.920 
recovers off those runs it's very very
important<00:01:07.520> when<00:01:08.520> he<00:01:08.640> says<00:01:08.820> recover<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.630> we're

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
important when he says recover if we're

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.600 
important when he says recover if we're
still<00:01:10.140> running<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.799> still<00:01:11.010> jockey<00:01:11.250> you're<00:01:11.490> not

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
still running we still jockey you're not

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.460 
still running we still jockey you're not
still<00:01:11.850> doing<00:01:12.150> double<00:01:12.840> runs<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.200> some<00:01:13.290> think

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
still doing double runs and some think

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.750 
still doing double runs and some think
that<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:13.799> probably<00:01:13.920> don't<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> workout

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
that but we probably don't do a workout

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.410 
that but we probably don't do a workout
of<00:01:15.479> any<00:01:15.659> quality<00:01:15.960> for<00:01:16.500> yeah<00:01:17.310> three<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.850> three

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
of any quality for yeah three to three

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.570 
of any quality for yeah three to three
to<00:01:18.509> five<00:01:18.689> days<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.220> something<00:01:20.430> like

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
to five days if if we do something like

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.539 
to five days if if we do something like
20<00:01:21.299> or<00:01:21.450> 24<00:01:21.810> Mile<00:01:22.020> Temple<00:01:22.439> Run<00:01:22.560> type<00:01:22.860> stuff<00:01:23.280> and

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
20 or 24 Mile Temple Run type stuff and

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.499 
20 or 24 Mile Temple Run type stuff and
so<00:01:24.330> those<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:25.290> mean<00:01:26.180> we're<00:01:27.180> kind<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.390> running

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
so those I mean we're kind of running

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.359 
so those I mean we're kind of running
like<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> borderline<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.619> what's<00:01:29.040> humanly

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
like on the borderline on what's humanly

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.410 
like on the borderline on what's humanly
possible<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.150> think<00:01:30.470> you<00:01:31.470> know<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:32.420> sometimes

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
possible I think you know so sometimes

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.640 
possible I think you know so sometimes
finding<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.259> line<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.920> hard<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.490> do<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.650> like

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
finding that line is hard to do and like

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.230 
finding that line is hard to do and like
you<00:01:37.890> know<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.070> did<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.220> 20<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.000> was<00:01:39.090> just

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
you know we did that 20 and it was just

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.109 
you know we did that 20 and it was just
a<00:01:39.329> little<00:01:39.540> bit<00:01:39.659> over<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> line<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.700> in<00:01:41.700> her<00:01:41.970> my

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
a little bit over the line and in her my

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.359 
a little bit over the line and in her my
calf<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.570> know<00:01:42.659> whereas<00:01:43.649> we<00:01:43.799> did<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> 24

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
calf you know whereas we did the 24

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.620 
calf you know whereas we did the 24
before<00:01:44.729> Beijing<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.299> worked<00:01:45.450> out<00:01:45.570> great

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
before Beijing and it worked out great

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.130 
before Beijing and it worked out great
so<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.259> knowing<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.979> difference<00:01:47.899> it's<00:01:48.899> hard

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
so just knowing the difference it's hard

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.530 
so just knowing the difference it's hard
to<00:01:49.290> do<00:01:49.470> sometimes<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.939> taking<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.360> you

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
to do sometimes but just taking it you

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.330 
to do sometimes but just taking it you
know<00:01:51.659> taking<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.409> an<00:01:52.500> easy<00:01:52.740> listen<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.220> your

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
know taking it an easy listen to your

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.999 
know taking it an easy listen to your
body<00:01:53.549> that's<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.920> most<00:01:55.920> important<00:01:56.399> thing

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
body that's the the most important thing

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.530 
body that's the the most important thing
and<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.130> guess<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.430> difference<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.909> -<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.360> it

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
and I guess the difference is - is it

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.090 
and I guess the difference is - is it
when<00:02:00.719> we're<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.560> last<00:02:01.770> phase<00:02:02.070> of

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
when we're in that last phase of

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.910 
when we're in that last phase of
training<00:02:02.460> when<00:02:03.329> we're<00:02:03.719> doing<00:02:03.990> our<00:02:04.229> long<00:02:04.469> runs

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
training when we're doing our long runs

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.500 
training when we're doing our long runs
it's

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
it's

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.150 
it's
work<00:02:05.870> out<00:02:06.020> itself<00:02:06.440> some<00:02:06.680> people<00:02:06.890> will<00:02:06.980> throw<00:02:07.130> a

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
work out itself some people will throw a

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.310 
work out itself some people will throw a
long<00:02:07.400> run<00:02:07.610> in<00:02:07.640> be<00:02:08.270> able<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.480> do<00:02:08.540> speed<00:02:08.990> work<00:02:09.110> on

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
long run in be able to do speed work on

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.600 
long run in be able to do speed work on
Tuesday<00:02:09.680> and<00:02:09.800> Thursday<00:02:10.100> and<00:02:10.190> Saturday<00:02:10.340> and

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
Tuesday and Thursday and Saturday and

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.490 
Tuesday and Thursday and Saturday and
then<00:02:10.730> just<00:02:10.880> do<00:02:10.970> their<00:02:11.120> long<00:02:11.300> run<00:02:11.540> with<00:02:12.200> not<00:02:12.470> a

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
then just do their long run with not a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.590 
then just do their long run with not a
lot<00:02:12.710> of<00:02:12.740> thought<00:02:12.980> that<00:02:13.220> is<00:02:13.400> our<00:02:13.550> workout<00:02:13.940> so

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
lot of thought that is our workout so

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.600 
lot of thought that is our workout so
the<00:02:15.080> training<00:02:15.350> is<00:02:15.530> based<00:02:15.800> on<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:16.220> long<00:02:16.400> run

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
the training is based on the long run

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.460 
the training is based on the long run
like<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:16.940> so<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.270> everything<00:02:18.260> is<00:02:18.320> about

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
like that so that everything is about

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.830 
like that so that everything is about
just<00:02:18.710> recovering<00:02:19.190> from<00:02:19.310> that<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:19.820> you<00:02:20.750> know

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
just recovering from that and you know

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.450 
just recovering from that and you know
seeing<00:02:21.080> what<00:02:21.170> you<00:02:21.290> can<00:02:21.410> do<00:02:21.560> in<00:02:21.830> four<00:02:22.340> or<00:02:22.430> five

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
seeing what you can do in four or five

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.440 
seeing what you can do in four or five
days<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.000> that<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.390> focus<00:02:23.750> is<00:02:23.900> on<00:02:24.020> that<00:02:24.200> run
