can put it on an airplane you could

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.470 
can put it on an airplane you could
probably<00:00:49.559> even<00:00:49.969> carry<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.270> if<00:00:51.420> you

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
probably even carry this on if you

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.330 
probably even carry this on if you
wanted<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.980> definitely<00:00:53.070> check

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
wanted to but you can definitely check

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.119 
wanted to but you can definitely check
back<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.879> there's<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.899> four<00:00:55.350> main<00:00:55.530> components

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
back it there's a four main components

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.639 
back it there's a four main components
within<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.360> Pelican<00:00:58.109> case<00:00:58.289> itself

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
within the can the Pelican case itself

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.880 
within the can the Pelican case itself
you<00:00:58.890> have<00:00:58.980> your<00:00:59.129> rx<00:00:59.489> radio<00:01:00.079> your<00:01:01.079> TX<00:01:01.469> radio

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
you have your rx radio your TX radio

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.390 
you have your rx radio your TX radio
your<00:01:02.760> mini<00:01:02.969> duplexer<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.949> your<00:01:04.949> controller

your mini duplexer and your controller

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.480 
your mini duplexer and your controller
system<00:01:06.170> so<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.350> works<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.130> normal

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
system so it works just like a normal

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.670 
system so it works just like a normal
big<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:10.049> know<00:01:10.200> repeater<00:01:10.979> would<00:01:12.530> when<00:01:13.530> you

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
big you know repeater would when you

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.310 
big you know repeater would when you
transmit<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.310> your<00:01:14.460> handheld<00:01:15.060> or<00:01:15.270> mobile<00:01:15.630> this

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
radio receives on the full 432 500 which

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.070 
radio receives on the full 432 500 which
is<00:01:18.810> our<00:01:19.020> negative<00:01:19.200> offset<00:01:19.530> frequency<00:01:21.080> then

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
is our negative offset frequency then

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.410 
is our negative offset frequency then
the<00:01:22.229> radio<00:01:22.560> control<00:01:22.770> over<00:01:23.310> here<00:01:23.549> takes<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the radio control over here takes the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.249 
the radio control over here takes the
audio<00:01:24.780> signal<00:01:25.520> tells<00:01:26.520> us<00:01:26.700> radio<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.450> transmit

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
audio signal tells us radio to transmit

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.560 
audio signal tells us radio to transmit
and<00:01:28.560> then<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.369> radio<00:01:29.700> transmits<00:01:30.180> back<00:01:30.360> out

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
and then this radio transmits back out

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.160 
and then this radio transmits back out

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
signals and goes to in this case we've

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.640 
signals and goes to in this case we've
built<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.280> portable<00:01:38.729> mast<00:01:38.970> system<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:40.110> hunting

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
built a portable mast system for hunting

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.920 
built a portable mast system for hunting
trips<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.100> go<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> beach<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.840> so

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
trips and go to the beach so on and so

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.889 
trips and go to the beach so on and so
forth<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.770> could<00:01:44.430> do<00:01:45.180> what<00:01:45.450> we're<00:01:45.689> gonna<00:01:45.780> do

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
forth you could do what we're gonna do

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.710 
forth you could do what we're gonna do
pretty<00:01:46.110> soon<00:01:46.409> here<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.820> drill<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> hole<00:01:48.180> with<00:01:48.689> a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
pretty soon here is drill a hole with a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.600 
pretty soon here is drill a hole with a
connector<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.920> could<00:01:50.100> put<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> mobile

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
connector and you could put a mobile

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.149 
connector and you could put a mobile
antenna<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> side<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.920> there's<00:01:53.100> a

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
antenna on the side of it so there's a

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.450 
antenna on the side of it so there's a
lot<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.399> possibilities<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.060> could<00:01:54.420> even<00:01:55.460> not

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
lot of possibilities you could even not

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.219 
lot of possibilities you could even not
use<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> duplexer<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:57.810> keep<00:01:58.049> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
use a duplexer and just keep the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.260 
use a duplexer and just keep the
antennas<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:59.399> here

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
antennas on here

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.060 
antennas on here
we<00:02:00.750> know<00:02:00.930> I've<00:02:01.229> known<00:02:01.380> some<00:02:01.590> people<00:02:01.649> who<00:02:01.950> do

they actually mount the HD handheld the

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.089 
they actually mount the HD handheld the
antennas<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.200> outside<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.710> case<00:02:07.890> not

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
antennas on the outside of the case not

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.420 
antennas on the outside of the case not
sure<00:02:08.369> about<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:10.280> interference<00:02:11.280> you'd

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
sure about the the interference you'd

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.830 
sure about the the interference you'd
get<00:02:11.640> with<00:02:11.760> those<00:02:11.970> two<00:02:12.209> antennas<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.599> be<00:02:12.690> so

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
get with those two antennas to be so

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.070 
get with those two antennas to be so
close<00:02:13.050> together<00:02:13.230> but

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
close together but

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.310 
close together but
it<00:02:14.260> is<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.440> possible<00:02:14.920> thing<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:15.220> do<00:02:15.400> so<00:02:16.330> um<00:02:16.630> just

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
it is a possible thing to do so um just

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.540 
it is a possible thing to do so um just

going to turn the rx radio off and when

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.210 
going to turn the rx radio off and when
I<00:02:25.960> turn<00:02:26.140> this<00:02:26.260> rate<00:02:26.470> on<00:02:26.590> it'll<00:02:26.800> give<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.920> beat

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
I turn this rate on it'll give a beat

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.610 
I turn this rate on it'll give a beat
which<00:02:27.460> is<00:02:27.490> gonna<00:02:27.870> fake<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.050> controller<00:02:29.440> -

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
which is gonna fake the controller -

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.070 
which is gonna fake the controller -

holds<00:03:53.440> it<00:03:53.680> pretty<00:03:53.890> good<00:03:55.140> now<00:03:56.140> I'm<00:03:56.290> moving<00:03:56.650> it<00:03:56.739> a

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
holds it pretty good now I'm moving it a

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.430 
holds it pretty good now I'm moving it a
little<00:03:57.580> bit<00:03:57.730> right<00:03:58.000> there<00:03:58.630> and<00:03:58.780> it's<00:03:58.959> uh<00:03:59.050> you

little bit right there and it's uh you

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.199 
little bit right there and it's uh you
know<00:04:00.220> it's<00:04:00.340> wiggling<00:04:00.580> a<00:04:00.790> little<00:04:00.850> bit<00:04:01.060> that's

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
know it's wiggling a little bit that's

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.710 
know it's wiggling a little bit that's
because<00:04:01.360> the<00:04:01.480> base<00:04:01.660> isn't<00:04:02.130> level<00:04:03.130> right<00:04:03.430> now

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
because the base isn't level right now

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.840 
because the base isn't level right now

said<00:06:03.550> we<00:06:03.880> anywhere<00:06:04.300> from<00:06:04.450> you<00:06:04.810> know<00:06:04.960> a<00:06:04.990> 10<00:06:05.350> to

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
said we anywhere from you know a 10 to

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.879 
said we anywhere from you know a 10 to
25<00:06:06.490> mile<00:06:06.850> radius<00:06:07.200> if<00:06:08.200> you<00:06:08.350> can<00:06:08.530> get<00:06:08.620> it<00:06:08.710> up<00:06:08.800> on

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
25 mile radius if you can get it up on

25 mile radius if you can get it up on
top<00:06:09.010> of<00:06:09.070> a<00:06:09.220> mountain<00:06:09.400> you<00:06:09.850> get<00:06:10.030> even<00:06:10.150> more<00:06:10.479> out

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
top of a mountain you get even more out

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.750 
top of a mountain you get even more out
of<00:06:10.690> it<00:06:10.960> so<00:06:11.680> it<00:06:11.919> just<00:06:12.100> all<00:06:12.190> depends<00:06:12.490> on<00:06:12.580> where

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
of it so it just all depends on where

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.640 
of it so it just all depends on where
you<00:06:12.850> can<00:06:13.030> stick<00:06:13.360> the<00:06:13.539> stick<00:06:14.110> the<00:06:14.260> antenna<00:06:14.530> but

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
you can stick the stick the antenna but

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.110 
you can stick the stick the antenna but
