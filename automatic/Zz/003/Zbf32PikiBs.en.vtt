00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
problems and I don't think people might

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.100 
problems and I don't think people might

notes p in my hand and let's see how

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.130 
notes p in my hand and let's see how
pocketable<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.979> device<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:44.689> it<00:01:45.689> went<00:01:45.990> in

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
pocketable this device is it went in

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.469 
pocketable this device is it went in
without<00:01:46.680> any<00:01:47.040> problems<00:01:47.520> but<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.970> actually

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
without any problems but the actually

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.859 
without any problems but the actually
the<00:01:48.509> device<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:50.119> much<00:01:51.119> bigger<00:01:51.360> than<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.840> other

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.920 
the device is much bigger than the other
devices<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:53.060> people<00:01:54.060> still<00:01:54.299> might<00:01:54.540> not<00:01:54.570> be

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
devices so people still might not be

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.319 
devices so people still might not be
able<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.200> notice<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.280> feel<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.820> there

so let's see how pocketable these

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.960 
so let's see how pocketable these
devices<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:18.440> its<00:02:18.830> kind<00:02:19.040> of<00:02:19.160> stretch<00:02:19.489> but

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970
