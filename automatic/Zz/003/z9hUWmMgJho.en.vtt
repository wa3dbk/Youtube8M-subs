with<00:01:17.070> seven<00:01:17.369> captures<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.880> game<00:01:18.090> as<00:01:18.240> well<00:01:18.420> I

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
with seven captures this game as well I

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.399 
with seven captures this game as well I
I<00:01:20.549> find<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.330> with<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> submachine<00:01:22.110> gun

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
I find that with the submachine gun

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.499 
I find that with the submachine gun
since<00:01:22.650> they<00:01:22.770> do<00:01:22.830> have<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> faster<00:01:24.060> movement

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
since they do have a faster movement

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.480 
since they do have a faster movement
speed<00:01:24.720> I'm<00:01:24.930> actually<00:01:25.200> able<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.920> stay<00:01:26.189> alive<00:01:26.430> a

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
speed I'm actually able to stay alive a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.100 
speed I'm actually able to stay alive a
little<00:01:26.729> bit<00:01:26.970> longer<00:01:27.180> because<00:01:27.479> now<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.840> can

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
little bit longer because now I can

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.450 
little bit longer because now I can
start<00:01:28.229> dealing<00:01:28.650> with<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> lot<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> guys

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
start dealing with a lot of the guys

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.609 
start dealing with a lot of the guys
that<00:01:29.490> are<00:01:29.729> flying<00:01:29.970> around<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.420> map<00:01:30.600> what<00:01:31.470> they

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
that are flying around the map what they

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.280 
that are flying around the map what they
were<00:01:31.680> doing<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.280> since<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> boost<00:01:33.290> increases

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
were doing is since the boost increases

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.990 
were doing is since the boost increases
the<00:01:34.409> movement<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:34.920> much<00:01:35.159> they<00:01:35.549> were<00:01:35.610> getting

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the movement so much they were getting

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.999 
the movement so much they were getting
to<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> lot<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.689> spots<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.350> that's<00:01:37.829> pretty

to a lot of the spots and that's pretty

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.710 
to a lot of the spots and that's pretty
much<00:01:38.130> all<00:01:38.340> Call<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.610> Duty<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.360> get<00:01:39.509> to

of<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.360> advantage<00:01:43.049> spot<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:45.600> know<00:01:45.720> with

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
of that advantage spot so you know with

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.480 
of that advantage spot so you know with
the<00:01:45.930> submachine<00:01:46.320> gun<00:01:46.619> I'm<00:01:46.740> able<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.009> beat<00:01:47.310> them

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the submachine gun I'm able to beat them

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.880 
the submachine gun I'm able to beat them
to<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> lot<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.970> positions<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.630> normally<00:01:49.110> they

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
to a lot of positions that normally they

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.200 
to a lot of positions that normally they
would<00:01:50.040> have<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> advantage<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:50.970> now<00:01:51.060> I'm

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
would have the advantage in but now I'm

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.550 
would have the advantage in but now I'm
able<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.540> Surprise<00:01:51.899> them<00:01:51.930> because<00:01:52.320> I'm<00:01:52.409> in

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
places that they wouldn't really expect

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.810 
places that they wouldn't really expect

submachine guns and this is helping me

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.770 
submachine guns and this is helping me
learn<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.730> game<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:36.880> lot<00:02:37.090> faster<00:02:37.540> than<00:02:37.690> I

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
assault rifles because I just got stock

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.170 
assault rifles because I just got stock
on<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.230> ak-12<00:02:44.770> but<00:02:45.280> then<00:02:45.400> also<00:02:45.580> I<00:02:45.730> got<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.120> on

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
on the ak-12 but then also I got it on

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.600 
on the ak-12 but then also I got it on
the<00:02:46.240> bow<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.500> want<00:02:47.740> to<00:02:47.800> get<00:02:47.890> in<00:02:47.980> some<00:02:48.250> matches

the bow so I want to get in some matches

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.580 
the bow so I want to get in some matches
with<00:02:48.760> those<00:02:48.970> haven't<00:02:49.390> really<00:02:49.540> had<00:02:49.660> I<00:02:49.720> haven't

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
with those haven't really had I haven't

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.620 
with those haven't really had I haven't
had<00:02:50.740> a<00:02:50.770> really<00:02:51.010> good<00:02:51.190> time<00:02:51.459> but<00:02:51.820> I<00:02:52.030> saw<00:02:52.209> trifles

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
had a really good time but I saw trifles

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.930 
had a really good time but I saw trifles
without<00:02:52.870> stock<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:54.310> I<00:02:54.340> didn't<00:02:54.610> really<00:02:54.670> use

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
without stock so I didn't really use

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.540 
without stock so I didn't really use
them<00:02:55.120> too<00:02:55.420> much<00:02:55.860> but<00:02:56.860> now<00:02:56.950> i<00:02:56.980> think<00:02:57.100> i'm<00:02:57.370> going

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
them too much but now i think i'm going

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.940 
them too much but now i think i'm going
to<00:02:57.640> actually<00:02:57.790> start<00:02:58.150> using<00:02:58.240> them<00:02:58.660> i<00:02:58.990> did<00:02:59.380> have

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
to actually start using them i did have

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.560 
to actually start using them i did have
a<00:02:59.980> lot<00:03:00.160> of<00:03:00.190> success<00:03:00.580> last<00:03:00.820> night<00:03:01.000> we<00:03:01.240> using<00:03:01.480> the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
a lot of success last night we using the

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.900 
a lot of success last night we using the
ak-12<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:02.380> stock<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:03.040> that'll<00:03:03.550> probably<00:03:03.760> be

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
ak-12 of stock and that'll probably be

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.300

to run it but if you're playing with
friends<00:03:51.640> you<00:03:51.910> probably<00:03:52.150> don't<00:03:52.360> because

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
friends you probably don't because

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.729 
friends you probably don't because
you're<00:03:52.690> gonna<00:03:52.810> be<00:03:52.900> beating<00:03:53.230> down<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.500> enemy

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
you're gonna be beating down the enemy

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:54.960 
you're gonna be beating down the enemy
to<00:03:53.860> where<00:03:54.040> they<00:03:54.160> don't<00:03:54.340> really<00:03:54.519> get<00:03:54.730> your

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
to where they don't really get your

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.990 
to where they don't really get your
script<00:03:55.150> anyways

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
script anyways

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.030 
script anyways
and<00:03:57.930> look<00:03:58.320> at<00:03:58.410> this<00:03:58.500> I<00:03:58.620> mean<00:03:58.770> with<00:03:58.920> the

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
and look at this I mean with the

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.230 
and look at this I mean with the
submachine<00:03:59.340> guns<00:03:59.640> there's<00:03:59.790> just<00:03:59.940> so<00:04:00.060> much

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
submachine guns there's just so much

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.990 
submachine guns there's just so much
easier<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.750> use<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.170> assault<00:04:01.470> rifles<00:04:02.000> for

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
easier to use the assault rifles for

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.970 
easier to use the assault rifles for
someone<00:04:03.870> that's<00:04:04.020> not<00:04:04.170> really<00:04:04.410> advanced<00:04:04.860> at

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
someone that's not really advanced at

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.040 
someone that's not really advanced at
the<00:04:05.100> game<00:04:05.280> so<00:04:06.090> if<00:04:06.210> you<00:04:06.360> guys<00:04:06.510> aren't<00:04:06.720> like<00:04:06.900> the

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
the game so if you guys aren't like the
