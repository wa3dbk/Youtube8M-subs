00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
in white but that is really hard to find

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.380

at<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.009> dollar<00:00:32.189> tree<00:00:32.279> unless<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.059> get<00:00:33.239> it

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
at the dollar tree unless you get it

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.319 
at the dollar tree unless you get it
like<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.870> day<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.440> comes<00:00:34.739> out<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.969> had

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
like the day that it comes out so I had

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.119 
like the day that it comes out so I had
literally<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:36.989> been<00:00:37.320> there<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.649> date<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
literally just been there the date the

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.389 
literally just been there the date the
same<00:00:38.340> day<00:00:38.670> before<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.329> saw<00:00:39.510> her<00:00:39.660> video<00:00:39.930> and

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
same day before I saw her video and

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.920 
same day before I saw her video and
nothing<00:00:41.399> was<00:00:41.520> there<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:42.059> after<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.450> watched<00:00:42.719> her

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
nothing was there so after I watched her

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.799 
nothing was there so after I watched her
video<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.410> went<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.890> next<00:00:44.070> day<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.809> glory

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
video I went the next day and glory

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.590 
video I went the next day and glory
glory<00:00:46.170> there<00:00:47.100> was<00:00:47.340> stuff<00:00:47.610> there<00:00:47.879> there<00:00:48.210> wasn't

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
glory there was stuff there there wasn't

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.060 
glory there was stuff there there wasn't
white<00:00:49.050> containers<00:00:49.829> but<00:00:50.039> there<00:00:50.280> were<00:00:52.070> workable

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
white containers but there were workable

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.500 
white containers but there were workable
solution<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.789> was<00:00:53.940> going<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.180> go<00:00:54.270> ahead<00:00:54.329> and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
solution so I was going to go ahead and

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.590 
solution so I was going to go ahead and
show<00:00:54.899> these<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.760> if<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.850> want<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:57.449> any

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
show these to you if you want to get any

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.630 
show these to you if you want to get any
of<00:00:57.690> these<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.020> suggest<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.620> quick<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.219> don't

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
of these I suggest going quick I don't

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.040 
of these I suggest going quick I don't
know<00:00:59.760> what<00:00:59.910> your<00:01:00.030> area<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.329> like<00:01:00.570> how<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
know what your area is like how the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.759 
know what your area is like how the
restocking<00:01:01.620> options<00:01:02.129> are<00:01:02.340> but<00:01:03.120> mine<00:01:03.840> tends<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
restocking options are but mine tends to

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.399 
restocking options are but mine tends to
sell<00:01:05.460> out<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.000> then<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.990> kind<00:01:07.290> of

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
sell out and then it's just kind of

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.520 
sell out and then it's just kind of
nothing<00:01:08.189> for<00:01:08.640> months<00:01:09.030> until<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.720> next<00:01:10.320> line

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
nothing for months until the next line

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.530 
nothing for months until the next line
comes<00:01:10.799> out<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.790> was<00:01:11.820> really<00:01:12.060> busy<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
basket I got is this red one and again I

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.380 
basket I got is this red one and again I
don't<00:01:19.350> really<00:01:19.650> as<00:01:20.280> far<00:01:20.549> as<00:01:20.580> when<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.119> comes<00:01:21.299> to

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
don't really as far as when it comes to

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.820 
don't really as far as when it comes to
decorating<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.990> don't<00:01:22.140> really<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.590> use

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
decorating I don't really like to use

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.039 
decorating I don't really like to use
super<00:01:23.549> bright<00:01:23.729> colors<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.299> got<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.780> to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
super bright colors but I got this to

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.870 
super bright colors but I got this to
put<00:01:25.259> medicines<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.040> because<00:01:26.670> we're<00:01:26.790> not

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
put medicines in because we're not

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.670 
put medicines in because we're not
supposed<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.240> stay<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> bathroom<00:01:28.080> we<00:01:28.409> keep

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
supposed to stay in the bathroom we keep

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.340 
supposed to stay in the bathroom we keep
ours<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.369> kitchen<00:01:30.079> because<00:01:31.079> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
ours in the kitchen because the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.109 
ours in the kitchen because the
temperature<00:01:32.040> stays<00:01:32.250> level<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.670> doesn't<00:01:32.939> mess

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
temperature stays level it doesn't mess

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.120 
temperature stays level it doesn't mess
with<00:01:33.150> anything<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.680> thought<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.040> this

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
with anything but I thought that this

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.550 
with anything but I thought that this
would<00:01:35.280> be<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:36.210> nice<00:01:36.360> way<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.630> put<00:01:37.140> them<00:01:37.470> all

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
would be just a nice way to put them all

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.350 
would be just a nice way to put them all
in<00:01:37.740> one<00:01:37.890> spot<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.250> then<00:01:38.579> put<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.970> into<00:01:39.150> a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
in one spot and then put it into a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.149 
in one spot and then put it into a
cupboard<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.490> then<00:01:41.490> um<00:01:41.759> these<00:01:42.720> are<00:01:43.159> my

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
cupboard and then um these are my

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.460 
cupboard and then um these are my
favorites<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.140> hopefully<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.170> don't<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.439> a

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
favorites and hopefully I don't have a

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.780 
favorites and hopefully I don't have a
hard<00:01:46.680> time<00:01:46.829> getting<00:01:47.130> them<00:01:47.220> apart<00:01:47.490> because<00:01:47.610> in

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
hard time getting them apart because in
