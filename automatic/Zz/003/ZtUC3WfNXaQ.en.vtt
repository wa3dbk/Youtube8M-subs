experiences we've had as as
entrepreneurs<00:03:05.520> so<00:03:05.640> far

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
entrepreneurs so far

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.720 
entrepreneurs so far
so<00:03:07.500> one<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.799> things<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.159> would<00:03:08.280> urge<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.579> lot

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
so one of the things I would urge a lot

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.959 
so one of the things I would urge a lot
of<00:03:08.849> students<00:03:09.329> to<00:03:09.510> do<00:03:09.689> and<00:03:10.340> even<00:03:11.340> prospective

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:11.969 
of students to do and even prospective

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:13.940 
of students to do and even prospective
students<00:03:12.329> to<00:03:12.450> do<00:03:12.599> is<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.200> really<00:03:13.319> focus<00:03:13.769> on

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
students to do is to really focus on

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.420 
students to do is to really focus on
collaboration<00:03:14.689> since<00:03:15.689> getting<00:03:16.200> into<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.920> the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
collaboration since getting into the the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.690 
collaboration since getting into the the
entrepreneur<00:03:18.409> in<00:03:19.409> real<00:03:19.650> world<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:20.219> guess<00:03:20.489> one

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
entrepreneur in real world I guess one

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.490 
entrepreneur in real world I guess one
thing<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:21.060> I've<00:03:21.209> really<00:03:21.810> noticed<00:03:22.019> is<00:03:22.319> that

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
thing that I've really noticed is that

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.099 
thing that I've really noticed is that
collaboration<00:03:23.129> is<00:03:23.400> how<00:03:23.639> how<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.569> world<00:03:24.840> works

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
collaboration is how how the world works

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.690 
collaboration is how how the world works
now<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.379> it's<00:03:25.650> how<00:03:25.799> our<00:03:25.950> generation<00:03:26.519> is

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
now and it's how our generation is

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.490 
now and it's how our generation is
shifting<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.209> way<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:27.629> systems<00:03:28.049> operate

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
shifting the way that systems operate

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.500 
shifting the way that systems operate
