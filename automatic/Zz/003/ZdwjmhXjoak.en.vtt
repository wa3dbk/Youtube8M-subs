00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.600
Puppy nipping and mouthing is a completely
normal behavior.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.640
Puppies nip, mouth and chew not only because
they're teething, but because that's really

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.230
how they explore their world, using their
mouth.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.290
They're all about the mouth, and that's fine
except we don't want them using their mouth

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.160
on us, our clothing or our furniture.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.660
So the best thing to do to make sure that
you can control your puppy, especially when

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.390
they get in those kind of bouts of excess
energy and mouthing is to have them on a long

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.210
lightweight indoor leash.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.500
This way you can simply hold your puppy away
until they calm a little bit and redirect

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.150
them onto an appropriate chew toy.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.490
Fortunately for me, this puppy is really engaged
in his chew toy, and I've been keep encouraging

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.680
that, and he's not chewing on me.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.710
What your puppy is going after and what they're
chewing on can give you some guidance on what

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.350
type of chew toys to give them.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.510
Right now, this puppy's really pleased with
his little soft toy and he's enjoying that.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.350
However, if that wasn't working for him, I
might give him a food stuffed toy some sort

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.790
of a rubber bone or something that has a bit
of a nice tasting meaty treat in there so

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.350
that if the fluffy toy wasn't quite doing
it for him I would give him something a little

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.510
higher value that he wouldn't be able to resist.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.020
But this, I'm going to put my foot on it so
it doesn't roll away.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.060
There you go.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.439
And then he can gleefully chew and lick at
that instead of at my shoes.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.679
Another option might be something that he
can chew on in whole, like this little stick

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:37.750
made out of dry bully.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.179
Lets see if he likes that.

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.520
Gives me a little object exchange too.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.520
The important thing to remember is not to
get angry at your puppy when they're mouthing

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.520
or biting at you.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.999
They're not trying to do you any harm.

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:54.390
But with that said, you don't want to allow
it to happen.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.130
You don't want them to practice behavior that
you don't want to see in an adult dog.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.859
So as your puppy's parent, you're going to
guide them to what they're allowed to chew

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:08.630
on and play with with their mouth so that
they're not learning to do that to you, with

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.050
gentle guidance and redirection onto appropriate
items.
