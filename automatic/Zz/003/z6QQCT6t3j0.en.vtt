00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 this is where the body begins to look like those blocks of 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.380
 building 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.430
 the liver is the largest organ in the body with more than 500 functions 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.949
 different 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:17.480
 It's a pretty busy chemical factory made up of 75 thousand groups 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.890
 identical of seville the liver filters the nutrients that transports the vessels 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.710
 blood directly from the small intestine 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.230
 here they mix again in the highly complex proteins and 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.509
 Fat molecules that the body requires is also a sugar senator weapon 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.440
 that provides the required energy 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.060
 six hours after breakfast the food stripped of its nutrients 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.500
 begins the final phase of your journey a slow one meter step with 53 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.260
 centimeters through the large intestine 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
 is ready for the third phase of digestion 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.650
 the product 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.390
 an enormous number of resistant bacteria and not from their housing the 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.880
 remains of former president Bill Clinton 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.940
 these bacteria are harmless in the digestive tract 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.710
 actually help us produce small amounts of certain 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.950
 vitamins 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.310
 the bacteria not the remains of food make up most of our 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.130
 solid waste 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.070
 uu the last component east and lake 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.390
 a substance so important that the body constantly distracts him from 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.390
 our waste products 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.820
 Water with shapes for 60% of the human body 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.740
 10 gallons in total 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.750
 however we are in constant danger dried 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.410
 to play its role in our water control the digestive tract corro 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.700
 as we enter the large intestine changes of cells that absorb the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.790
 nutrients like this 1 seville cas to filter the water 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.450
 our digestive juices have transformed the original food into a 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.719
 muddy stuff and the body needs to recover the water 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:17.199
 about two thirds of the water of the ki moon is extracted by the intestine 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:20.829
 Thick cells taken care of by a microscopic sieve 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.180
 tururú 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.659
 Clear 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.369
 per game 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:34.649
 thousands of blood vessels in the intestinal walls the tape also 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:37.649
 20 water houses daily 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:41.729
 one 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:47.049
 a dense network of capillaries transports the required water and everything to the nutrients 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.049
 absorbed from the intestines and put into circulation 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:06.609
 the walls and muscles of the large intestine carry their content so the rest 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.609
 the end of the ten-meter journey through the digestive tract 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.250
 the sorianos in charge of balancing our water 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.010
 are the two kidneys it explains in the blood expelled to any waste 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.020
 through long tubes shown here red 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:32.489
 andrés arteries and the structure in which amount of blood flows through 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.639
 of the kidneys all the blood of our body circulates through them every 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:37.850
 five minutes 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.430
 that is 400 gallons a day 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.829
 and 10 million gallons throughout life 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.399
 afp 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:50.239
 each kidney contains more than one million filter units the blood flows to 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.839
 through the capillaries the sheriff wastes are filtered and then 

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:57.499
 collected by tubes between the parties 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:04:00.679
 99% of the clean water and returns to the blood 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.809
 Oct 

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:12.599
 the resulting liquid the urine that collection centers are included and then 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.599
 low by long tubes called urgent 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.130
 adhered flow through these tubes just a few steps of water the 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.870
 amount depends on the amount of liquid we say asks how much 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.870
 let's overcome 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.710
 urine occur slowly during sleep and much more quickly while 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.349
 in activity 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:38.539
 the trip of 30 centimeters and half of life in the wake 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:40.939
 acp 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:43.939
 the girl is expelled from the premiere of the series the hills 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.599
 its elastic muscular walls is also as it fills 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.510
 when you were cia bladder that was the size of a walnut 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.550
 reaches the size of a fist before it requires to be unoccupied 

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:11.029
 the food processor works mostly automatically 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:15.539
 but the final phase the expression is under our conscious control 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:21.389
 just as the first part of the digestive process eat digest and 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.210
 excrete is an endless cycle 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.410
 even the most exotic foods has its exclusive purpose 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:32.899
 keep them alive and healthy thanks to the unseen work theory and the 

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:36.889
 interests of our food processor that never complained 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.520
 his work 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.570
 put in contact concluded with five passports in full 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.000
 with coconut act set with elbow with elbow with elbow with elbow with elbow a 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.699

 It may seem out of this world but it is not a lunar landscape 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:29.999
 dead on the surface 

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:34.159
 activates inside with the intricate counting of the thermostat and the sensors 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.909
 electronic

 explore the depths of the human skin then the lic in the 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:43.599
 body class

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.680
 the skin 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.520
 our skin weighs almost five kilos 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.419
 This heavy layer has a total area of ​​almost two square meters 

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:52.369
 It is as thin as the paper of our times
