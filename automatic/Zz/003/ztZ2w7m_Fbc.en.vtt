00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.219
 that the one that my name of July what you 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.750
 esp and today I have here a trick for 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:12.330
 make money and limit and theft auto 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.509
 5 for tequila online under whitewashed 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.300
 work baila justia bailas rock star 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.300
 created low transmissions and the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.279
 question clear out the third one because that 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.599
 is the mission that we have been doing and 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.070
 You put on pretty how many times you give 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.140
 the gains it once you finish the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.170
 mission the gala x or if you are in the pri 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.910
 station gives the square this but if 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.160
 here leave all the settings the same if 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.750
 change the difficulties is normal what 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.510
 change down I think you get a little 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.129
 more experience reputation as 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.620
 well little bit of difference and money 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.210
 is the same you are playing 7 thousand each 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.730
 once you do this mission for this 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.129
 something super easy does not end in a 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.260
 minute and a half 2 the sour metal of how 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.449
 two minutes because I'm a shit with the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.579
 boxer what will he have to do 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.390
 here now when the mission starts it takes off 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.129
 of the cell phone 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.350
 they call pegasus and you call me your 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.180
 boxers and this is going to be the most 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.430
 easy to do this mission that of 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.690
 truth I give me the two minutes and this 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.209
 It's the first time I'm doing this mission 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.590
 they will go to the forest and now what 

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:12.119
 you will have to do is go 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.789
 under a street car because the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.130
 poster is basically next or flame 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.229
 a car with your mechanic and nothing and a 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.569
 Once you do that, you direct to where 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.149
 it had to be that it is supposed to be 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:26.130
 well close and with that one that will knock down 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.890
 all the red dots you see in the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.770
 map if with those targets it takes in the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.200
 assembly then what will I do now 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.780
 this and once you change it the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.299
 soul to the rockets you make it super easy 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.329
 to knock those little dots 2 am and 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.369
 more a bit difficult and they contain so much 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.560
 difference is that it sucks with the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.170
 box is really that I do not know how to fly anything in 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.239
 this jet jets game I crashed it 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.459
 everything against the floor but I do not know 

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:55.860
 he defended and a little bit each time he 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.270
 basically this is what you like as a car 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.640
 and bad such that you study castle 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.829
 basically nothing saying that a little dot 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.229
 red in the back turn and I with a 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.579
 moment with the ball I wanted that but nothing 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.200
 this yes that's basically what you have 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.810
 what to do destroy all the tanks in 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.420
 the map and I think that is a vision 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.430
 super easy so 7 thousand pesos for the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.810
 mission and you get almost two thousand of 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.209
 reputation 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.459
 of 2 minutes so I think it's worth the 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.560
 I'm sorry and I think you're going to like 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.200
 many of you as brazen as 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.959
 that terrorists are bathing shit 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.569
 for the clichés and that's not many people 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.340
 is adding clichés today that this one has 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.720
 afraid of something happening to them that 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.060
 pay that they can no longer play 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.640
 game and well these are the kind of things 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.849
 that lie down if you leave something 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.769
 too much clicks of hacks than what 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.690
 you are uploading this channel but 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.670
 This is what we have and I think that 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.830
 it's pretty nice truth in a mission 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.390
 I spend fun spending playing this 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.940
 mission to do the mission is going to 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.799
 have like you do that but they liked it 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.420
 the video if you liked the like 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.549
 we could already 50 and it would be too 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.690
 subscribe has been done still goes up
