 so and lubkin finger movements 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.179

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:14.259
 on a note up on the first third-party and adds 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:15.749

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.579
 but helped happiness we can still play 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.369
 on the act of having one above 3 cases 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:29.629
 because with such a price 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.629
 for however in working on this challenge 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:40.959
 in order to play 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.900
 injured as quickly as possible 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.899
 plays the first obligatory 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:49.199
 I already look with my eyes the next position in 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.199
 In this case, this day 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.209
 once again 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:00.739
 now the same thing done with the major 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.980
 but in the major as you understand it a 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.909
 Turkey 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.779

 the third step will be in a minute to aa to sharp 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.279
 based on this I play 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:12.109
 but is it 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.079
 second half of the world d 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.239
 Well 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.159
 he can play that way 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.269
 that is, two fingers can so 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.529
 way 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:26.779
 but it is convenient for me to strike 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:29.329
 so on sex so here is the same thing that olya 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.849
 Norina's time is only again up to 9th place 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.349
 it was based on the same cost but here 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.179
 about childhood 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:39.439

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:41.889

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.109
 layer of dough corr 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.289
 very important moment please do not take 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:48.679
 bars don't play like that 

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:51.019
 Of course it is in general that sounds cool but very 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.779
 a lot of dirt so the rays 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:56.430
 ghosts come out first as well 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.420
 how did you play the hole program here 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.010
 still have a little secret if i will 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.730
 play in two acts this again 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.739
 complaints 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.599
 Yes, I much he long to prove if 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.039
 would the elections really 

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:12.039
 looks 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:15.309
 Well, again, the problem of complaints 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:18.109
 Here we will win just as in general 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.400
 linux kernels below but interesting first 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.610
 pores will play in a tournament 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.889
 P 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.830
 so the most important points for that 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.020
 to 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.229
 play it as much as possible 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.779
 high quality and fast 

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:34.270
 so first we must 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.580
 very clearly beat the first country when 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.129
 play 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:41.569
 accented blow yes dortmund instead 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:43.860

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.599
 muffling 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.059
 respectively third party 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:50.680
 parties m 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.289
 this is the first 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.289
 and the second look a little forward 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.919
 and finally let's talk oh 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.919
 reduced neighbor chord 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.039
 he builds on points what 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.919
 we will not change this applicator 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:08.960

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.259
 depending on where you could score 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.259
 more 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.069
 that such a thing 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.400
 it means we play it the third finger 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.529
 but more precisely the third party 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:31.559
