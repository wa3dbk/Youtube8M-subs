how well so for guys at the no Bryan we
needed<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.299> use<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.810> new<00:01:16.049> bit<00:01:16.290> technology<00:01:16.890> to

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
needed to use this new bit technology to

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.219 
needed to use this new bit technology to
get<00:01:17.549> interest<00:01:17.880> right<00:01:18.240> there<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.080> this

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
get interest right there is this

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.469 
get interest right there is this
specific<00:01:19.770> code<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.220> technology<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.030> we'll

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
specific code of technology that we'll

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.210 
specific code of technology that we'll
use<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.110> bids<00:01:22.320> are<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.680> right<00:01:22.950> and

more<00:01:26.700> open<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.210> scraggly<00:01:27.570> then<00:01:28.439> if<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.650> look

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
more open and scraggly then if you look

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.890 
more open and scraggly then if you look
at<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> guy<00:01:29.189> like<00:01:29.220> Mark<00:01:29.579> Henry<00:01:30.000> he<00:01:30.450> has<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> big

beard better fit and solar bid we had to

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.100 
beard better fit and solar bid we had to
create<00:01:34.409> technology<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:35.280> be<00:01:35.430> able<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.670> capture

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
create technology to be able to capture

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.929 
create technology to be able to capture
both<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.409> way<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:38.159> not<00:01:38.280> only<00:01:38.340> look<00:01:38.820> great
