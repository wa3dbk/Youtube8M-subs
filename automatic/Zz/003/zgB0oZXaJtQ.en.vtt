00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
before but after the difference is that

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.130 
before but after the difference is that
there's<00:03:03.430> definitely<00:03:04.269> her<00:03:04.360> belly<00:03:04.599> is<00:03:04.720> more

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
there's definitely her belly is more

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.259 
there's definitely her belly is more
sculpted<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:05.800> we<00:03:06.400> see<00:03:06.610> she<00:03:06.790> also<00:03:06.910> had<00:03:07.239> a

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
sculpted and we see she also had a

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.449 
sculpted and we see she also had a
little<00:03:07.840> augmentation<00:03:08.709> on<00:03:08.830> her<00:03:08.950> breasts<00:03:09.220> right

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
little augmentation on her breasts right

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:10.770 
little augmentation on her breasts right

doctor that's correct

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.839 
doctor that's correct
so<00:03:10.989> explain<00:03:11.530> again<00:03:11.769> how<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:12.010> did<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.459> belly

sculpting<00:03:13.530> essentially<00:03:14.530> what<00:03:14.830> we<00:03:14.950> do<00:03:15.190> is<00:03:15.220> use

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
sculpting essentially what we do is use

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.729 
sculpting essentially what we do is use
a<00:03:15.819> technologist<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:16.989> art<00:03:17.140> technology

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
a technologist of the art technology

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.449 
a technologist of the art technology
laser<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:19.239> remove<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:20.709> subcutaneous<00:03:20.950> fat

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
laser to remove the subcutaneous fat

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.890 
laser to remove the subcutaneous fat
over<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.790> muscles<00:03:22.120> bring<00:03:22.299> it<00:03:22.420> out<00:03:22.510> our<00:03:22.630> muscle

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
over the muscles bring it out our muscle

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.210 
over the muscles bring it out our muscle
definition<00:03:23.049> it's<00:03:23.650> really<00:03:23.890> a<00:03:23.920> marriage

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
definition it's really a marriage

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.970 
definition it's really a marriage
between<00:03:24.400> art<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.299> technology<00:03:26.049> okay<00:03:26.530> so<00:03:26.590> for

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
between art and technology okay so for

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.620 
between art and technology okay so for
us<00:03:27.069> in<00:03:27.519> layman's<00:03:27.880> terms<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.209> put<00:03:28.390> something

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
us in layman's terms you put something

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.970 
us in layman's terms you put something
in<00:03:28.780> her<00:03:28.900> stomach<00:03:29.170> that's<00:03:29.470> like<00:03:29.650> an<00:03:29.769> ultrasound

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
in her stomach that's like an ultrasound

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.370 
in her stomach that's like an ultrasound
in<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:30.370> what<00:03:30.670> is<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:30.910> due<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.120> fat<00:03:31.360> with<00:03:32.019> two

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
in it what is it due to the fat with two

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.110 
in it what is it due to the fat with two
small<00:03:32.650> incisions<00:03:32.950> we<00:03:33.250> put<00:03:33.459> a<00:03:33.489> little<00:03:33.700> probe<00:03:33.940> in

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
small incisions we put a little probe in

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.660 
small incisions we put a little probe in
and<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:35.140> ultrasound<00:03:35.739> essentially<00:03:36.280> shakes

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
and the ultrasound essentially shakes

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.100 
and the ultrasound essentially shakes
the<00:03:36.940> fat<00:03:37.180> lose<00:03:37.390> as<00:03:37.480> much<00:03:37.630> as<00:03:37.780> you<00:03:37.870> check<00:03:38.049> the

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
the fat lose as much as you check the

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.490 
the fat lose as much as you check the
grapes<00:03:38.500> off<00:03:38.709> a<00:03:38.739> vine<00:03:39.040> very<00:03:39.340> gently<00:03:39.959> very<00:03:40.959> melts

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
grapes off a vine very gently very melts

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.620 
grapes off a vine very gently very melts
it<00:03:41.590> away<00:03:41.769> allowing<00:03:42.099> precise<00:03:42.760> sculpting<00:03:43.360> of

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
it away allowing precise sculpting of

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.960 
it away allowing precise sculpting of

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
definition anywhere in the body what's

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.400 
definition anywhere in the body what's
the<00:03:46.090> difference<00:03:46.390> between<00:03:46.480> that<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:47.049> regular

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
the difference between that and regular

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.530 
the difference between that and regular
life<00:03:47.620> but<00:03:47.799> what<00:03:47.920> is<00:03:48.010> regular<00:03:48.370> lipo<00:03:48.670> do<00:03:48.849> regular

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
life but what is regular lipo do regular

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.560 
life but what is regular lipo do regular
lipo<00:03:49.870> is<00:03:50.049> really<00:03:50.380> more<00:03:50.950> traumatic<00:03:51.160> it<00:03:52.120> doesn't

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
lipo is really more traumatic it doesn't

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.210 
lipo is really more traumatic it doesn't

the<00:04:05.470> fats<00:04:05.680> in<00:04:05.829> her<00:04:05.950> belly<00:04:06.160> and<00:04:06.430> then<00:04:06.700> this<00:04:06.880> is

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
the fats in her belly and then this is

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.059 
the fats in her belly and then this is
what's<00:04:07.390> incredibly<00:04:08.350> interesting<00:04:08.739> I've<00:04:08.829> never

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
what's incredibly interesting I've never

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.500 
what's incredibly interesting I've never
heard<00:04:09.310> of<00:04:09.370> this<00:04:09.489> before<00:04:09.640> you<00:04:09.910> take<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.269> fat

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
heard of this before you take the fat

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.880 
heard of this before you take the fat
from<00:04:10.720> one<00:04:10.900> area<00:04:11.079> and<00:04:11.319> put<00:04:11.560> it<00:04:11.650> in<00:04:11.769> another

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
from one area and put it in another

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.949 
from one area and put it in another
correct<00:04:12.700> correct<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.420> why<00:04:13.480> did<00:04:13.690> you<00:04:13.720> do<00:04:13.870> with

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
correct correct and why did you do with

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.979 
correct correct and why did you do with
Carolyn<00:04:14.410> and<00:04:14.530> Carolyn's<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:16.269> situation<00:04:16.810> here

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
Carolyn and Carolyn's the situation here

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.870 
Carolyn and Carolyn's the situation here
we<00:04:17.109> actually<00:04:17.410> took<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.709> fat<00:04:17.950> from<00:04:18.190> her<00:04:18.400> flanks

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
we actually took the fat from her flanks

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.849 
we actually took the fat from her flanks
which<00:04:19.510> we<00:04:19.660> took<00:04:19.840> away<00:04:19.989> and<00:04:20.380> on<00:04:20.440> her<00:04:20.560> waistline

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
which we took away and on her waistline

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.230 
which we took away and on her waistline
to<00:04:21.100> bring<00:04:21.250> in<00:04:21.370> her<00:04:21.459> waistline<00:04:21.760> giving<00:04:22.150> her

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
to bring in her waistline giving her

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.719 
to bring in her waistline giving her
more<00:04:22.389> of<00:04:22.539> a<00:04:22.660> tight<00:04:23.229> ratio<00:04:23.620> and<00:04:24.190> we<00:04:24.430> took<00:04:24.669> that

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
more of a tight ratio and we took that

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.129 
more of a tight ratio and we took that
fat<00:04:25.030> and<00:04:25.150> processed<00:04:25.630> it<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:25.960> then

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
fat and processed it and then

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.120 
fat and processed it and then
transplanted<00:04:26.950> it<00:04:27.100> into<00:04:27.970> her<00:04:28.060> breasts<00:04:28.570> and<00:04:29.130> so

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
transplanted it into her breasts and so

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.740 
transplanted it into her breasts and so
instead<00:04:30.400> of<00:04:30.520> saline<00:04:31.030> or<00:04:31.120> silicone<00:04:31.180> there's

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
instead of saline or silicone there's

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.480 
instead of saline or silicone there's
something<00:04:32.110> natural<00:04:32.560> and<00:04:32.650> that<00:04:32.919> would<00:04:33.220> appeal

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
something natural and that would appeal

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.400 
something natural and that would appeal
to<00:04:33.520> you<00:04:33.729> about<00:04:34.000> this<00:04:34.180> Caroline

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
to you about this Caroline

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.120 
to you about this Caroline
I<00:04:35.490> wanted<00:04:36.490> a<00:04:36.580> really<00:04:37.030> natural<00:04:37.660> look<00:04:37.870> and<00:04:38.110> and<00:04:38.560> a

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
I wanted a really natural look and and a

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.129 
I wanted a really natural look and and a
healthier<00:04:39.669> approach<00:04:39.850> I<00:04:40.450> didn't<00:04:40.930> like<00:04:41.020> the

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
healthier approach I didn't like the

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.840 
healthier approach I didn't like the
idea<00:04:41.410> of<00:04:41.470> having<00:04:41.620> something<00:04:42.100> foreign<00:04:42.430> in<00:04:42.700> my

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
idea of having something foreign in my

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:43.250 
idea of having something foreign in my
body

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
body

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.050 
body
and<00:04:43.380> this<00:04:43.800> way<00:04:43.950> all<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.400> tissue<00:04:44.610> that's<00:04:44.910> been

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
and this way all the tissue that's been

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.050 
and this way all the tissue that's been
added<00:04:45.630> is<00:04:45.840> all<00:04:46.170> my<00:04:46.320> own<00:04:46.700> plastic<00:04:47.700> surgeons

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
added is all my own plastic surgeons

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.550 
added is all my own plastic surgeons
that<00:04:48.150> don't<00:04:48.480> do<00:04:48.690> this<00:04:48.870> that<00:04:49.050> regularly

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
that don't do this that regularly

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.170 
that don't do this that regularly
because<00:04:49.710> there<00:04:49.980> aren't<00:04:50.160> long-term<00:04:50.730> studies

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
because there aren't long-term studies

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.370 
because there aren't long-term studies
is<00:04:51.330> there<00:04:51.480> anything<00:04:51.720> you're<00:04:51.960> worried<00:04:52.290> about

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
is there anything you're worried about

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.770 
is there anything you're worried about
not<00:04:53.190> at<00:04:53.370> all<00:04:53.490> not<00:04:53.790> at<00:04:53.880> all<00:04:53.970> it's<00:04:54.210> my<00:04:54.360> own<00:04:54.480> tissue

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
not at all not at all it's my own tissue

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.420 
not at all not at all it's my own tissue
so<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.200> worst<00:04:55.380> that<00:04:55.530> can<00:04:55.620> happen<00:04:55.800> is<00:04:56.130> it<00:04:56.250> gets

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
so the worst that can happen is it gets

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.700 
so the worst that can happen is it gets
absorbed<00:04:56.610> back<00:04:57.210> into<00:04:57.270> my<00:04:57.630> body<00:04:57.780> how<00:04:58.500> do<00:04:58.560> you

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
absorbed back into my body how do you

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.410 
absorbed back into my body how do you
feel<00:04:58.950> I<00:04:59.190> feel<00:04:59.520> fantastic

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
feel I feel fantastic

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.450 
feel I feel fantastic
really<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:01.050> change<00:05:01.290> to<00:05:01.470> my<00:05:01.590> body<00:05:01.800> has<00:05:02.010> been<00:05:02.160> so
