little in drum corps they called this a
sextuplet<00:00:34.890> because<00:00:35.219> it's<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> group<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.700> six

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
sextuplet because it's a group of six

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.510 
sextuplet because it's a group of six
notes<00:00:36.270> although<00:00:36.540> really<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.320> seven<00:00:37.860> right

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
notes although really it's a seven right

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.860 
notes although really it's a seven right
because<00:00:38.820> we're<00:00:38.940> going<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.120> release<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.719> on

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
because we're going to release it on

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.590 
because we're going to release it on
that<00:00:40.559> seventh<00:00:41.070> if<00:00:41.309> we<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:41.700> did<00:00:41.879> six<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.480> would

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
that seventh if we just did six it would

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.160 
that seventh if we just did six it would
be<00:00:44.090> right<00:00:46.039> and<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.430> wouldn't<00:00:48.300> finish<00:00:48.539> on<00:00:48.870> one

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
be right and it wouldn't finish on one

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.119 
be right and it wouldn't finish on one
if<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.590> add<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.980> seventh<00:00:50.430> note<00:00:50.700> then<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.149> get

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.410 

it's<00:00:56.129> really<00:00:56.309> straightforward<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:57.030> one

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
it's really straightforward just one

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.279 
it's really straightforward just one
beat<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:58.309> sixteenth<00:00:59.309> note<00:00:59.489> triplets<00:00:59.910> 1<00:01:00.660> 2<00:01:00.840> 3<00:01:00.870> 4

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
beat of sixteenth note triplets 1 2 3 4

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.810 
beat of sixteenth note triplets 1 2 3 4
5<00:01:01.500> 6<00:01:01.680> 7<00:01:01.920> 1<00:01:02.250> 2<00:01:02.520> 3<00:01:02.699> 4<00:01:02.910> 5<00:01:03.270> 6<00:01:03.300> 7<00:01:04.369> it's<00:01:05.369> important<00:01:05.790> to

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 it's important to

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.320 
5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 it's important to
note<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.390> because<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.650> has<00:01:07.799> seven<00:01:08.159> notes<00:01:08.549> it

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
note that because it has seven notes it

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.240 
note that because it has seven notes it
starts<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.780> ends<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.140> same<00:01:10.260> hand<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.130> if

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
starts and ends on the same hand so if

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.200 
starts and ends on the same hand so if
you<00:01:11.340> start<00:01:11.549> with<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.790> right<00:01:11.939> hand<00:01:12.119> you're

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
you start with the right hand you're

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.250 
you start with the right hand you're
going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> end<00:01:12.570> with<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.750> right<00:01:12.869> hand<00:01:13.049> if<00:01:13.170> you

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
going to end with the right hand if you

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.750 
going to end with the right hand if you
start<00:01:13.500> with<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.680> left<00:01:13.799> hand<00:01:13.979> you're<00:01:14.580> going<00:01:14.700> to

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
start with the left hand you're going to

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.149 
start with the left hand you're going to
end<00:01:14.909> with<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> left<00:01:15.330> hand<00:01:15.509> okay<00:01:16.409> that's

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
end with the left hand okay that's

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.800 
end with the left hand okay that's
different<00:01:17.640> from<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> previous<00:01:18.330> one<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
different from the previous one the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.010 
different from the previous one the
single<00:01:19.170> stroke<00:01:19.350> for<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:20.670> which<00:01:20.880> had<00:01:21.150> four

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
single stroke for it which had four

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.499 
single stroke for it which had four
notes<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.950> starts<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.520> ends<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:23.970> opposite

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
notes and so starts and ends on opposite

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.330 
notes and so starts and ends on opposite
hand<00:01:24.689> one<00:01:24.960> two<00:01:25.229> three<00:01:25.619> four<00:01:25.920> because<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.220> have

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
hand one two three four because you have

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.640 
hand one two three four because you have
an<00:01:26.460> even<00:01:26.670> number<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.970> hands<00:01:27.210> right<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.780> if

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
an even number of hands right and so if

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.140 
an even number of hands right and so if
it's<00:01:28.860> an<00:01:28.979> odd<00:01:29.130> number<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.640> start<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:29.939> end<00:01:30.030> on

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
it's an odd number you start and end on

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.880 
it's an odd number you start and end on
the<00:01:30.240> same<00:01:30.450> hand<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.229> an<00:01:31.320> even<00:01:31.560> number<00:01:31.799> you

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
the same hand if it's an even number you

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.810 
the same hand if it's an even number you
start<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.490> end<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.939> different<00:01:33.299> hands<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.820> we

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
start and end on different hands so we

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.280 
start and end on different hands so we
put<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> quarter<00:01:36.299> note<00:01:36.360> pulse<00:01:36.720> with<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.049> just

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
put a quarter note pulse with this just

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.660 
put a quarter note pulse with this just
so<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.560> hear<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:37.950> really<00:01:38.520> very

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
so you can hear but it's really very

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.200 
so you can hear but it's really very
straight<00:01:39.030> ahead<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.540> one<00:01:39.900> beat<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:41.210> single

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
straight ahead just one beat of single

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.109 
straight ahead just one beat of single
strokes<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.979> rhythm<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.759> sixteenth

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
strokes in the rhythm of a sixteenth

00:01:45.119 --> 00:02:08.919 
strokes in the rhythm of a sixteenth
note<00:01:45.329> triplet

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.780 

and<00:02:09.929> like<00:02:10.170> anything<00:02:10.560> else<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:11.400> can<00:02:11.430> play<00:02:11.760> it

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
and like anything else you can play it

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.900 
and like anything else you can play it
as<00:02:12.000> fast<00:02:12.450> as<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.110> want<00:02:13.140> as<00:02:13.560> long<00:02:14.280> as<00:02:14.489> it's<00:02:14.670> nice
