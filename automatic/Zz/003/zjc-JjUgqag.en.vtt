00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:21.859 
up with that my my favorite app is a

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:23.830 
up with that my my favorite app is a
toss-up<00:01:22.100> between<00:01:22.429> the<00:01:22.909> third<00:01:23.119> one<00:01:23.359> and<00:01:23.600> the

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
toss-up between the third one and the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.590 
toss-up between the third one and the
sixth<00:01:24.200> one<00:01:24.469> I<00:01:24.740> like<00:01:25.639> the<00:01:25.789> third<00:01:25.999> one<00:01:26.210> Cole

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
sixth one I like the third one Cole

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.499 
sixth one I like the third one Cole
because<00:01:26.960> it<00:01:27.139> was<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:28.759> most<00:01:28.969> I<00:01:29.240> guess

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
because it was the most I guess

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.330 
because it was the most I guess
emotional<00:01:30.109> because<00:01:30.319> it<00:01:30.560> was<00:01:30.679> the<00:01:30.859> final<00:01:31.189> one

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340
