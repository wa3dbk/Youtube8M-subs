fibers and the oil from your skin

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.090 
fibers and the oil from your skin
getting<00:00:36.239> onto<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.660> fibers<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.380> preventing

them from absorbing

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.729 
them from absorbing
the<00:00:40.469> resin<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.520> common<00:00:41.969> problem<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.780> when

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the resin and a common problem is when

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.830 
the resin and a common problem is when
you<00:00:43.920> peel<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.670> tab<00:00:46.219> it<00:00:47.219> flops<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.059> when<00:00:48.719> it

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
you peel this tab it flops and when it

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.229 
you peel this tab it flops and when it
flops<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.469> hits<00:00:49.710> your<00:00:49.890> skin<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.940> becomes

flops it hits your skin and it becomes

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.360 
flops it hits your skin and it becomes
difficult<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.870> handle<00:00:52.410> or<00:00:52.530> manage<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.160> you've

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
gotten the oil on the fibers so I'm

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.580 
gotten the oil on the fibers so I'm
going<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.360> show<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.719> great<00:00:58.079> trick

using a nail form and using the center
cut<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> nail<00:01:02.940> form<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:04.170> handle<00:01:04.559> your

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
cut of the nail form to handle your

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.649 
cut of the nail form to handle your
fiberglass<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> great<00:01:06.330> thing<00:01:06.540> about

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
fiberglass and the great thing about

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.010 
fiberglass and the great thing about
this<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.290> everybody<00:01:07.920> throws<00:01:08.580> away<00:01:08.909> these<00:01:09.180> when

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
this is everybody throws away these when

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.990 
this is everybody throws away these when
they<00:01:10.140> don't<00:01:10.350> use<00:01:10.560> them<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.369> now<00:01:11.580> you'll<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:11.939> a

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
they don't use them so now you'll have a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.240 
they don't use them so now you'll have a
use<00:01:12.270> for<00:01:12.510> these<00:01:12.689> what<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.680> want<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.950> do<00:01:14.100> is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
use for these what you want to do is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.090 
use for these what you want to do is
take<00:01:14.490> your<00:01:14.700> nail<00:01:14.880> form<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.479> adhere<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
take your nail form and adhere it to the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.820 
take your nail form and adhere it to the
end<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.360> fiberglass<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:19.259> you're

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
end of the fiberglass that you're

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.270 
end of the fiberglass that you're
handling<00:01:20.490> not<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.360> end<00:01:21.570> that's<00:01:22.350> touching<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
handling not the end that's touching the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.950 
handling not the end that's touching the
nail<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.150> going<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.390> touch<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.780> nail

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
nail this is going to touch the nail

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.410 
nail this is going to touch the nail
this<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.890> end<00:01:26.009> we're<00:01:26.220> handling<00:01:26.580> make<00:01:27.210> sure

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
this is the end we're handling make sure

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.800 
this is the end we're handling make sure
it's<00:01:27.630> stuck<00:01:27.930> really<00:01:28.500> well<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.329> then<00:01:30.329> get<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
it's stuck really well and then get the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.679 
it's stuck really well and then get the
back<00:01:31.049> started<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:32.490> works<00:01:32.790> great<00:01:33.119> for<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
back started this works great for the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.780 
back started this works great for the
kind<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.110> fiberglass<00:01:34.650> that's<00:01:34.890> not<00:01:35.130> pre-cut<00:01:35.640> as

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
kind of fiberglass that's not pre-cut as

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.850 
kind of fiberglass that's not pre-cut as
well<00:01:36.060> because<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:36.960> always<00:01:37.200> difficult<00:01:37.500> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
well because it's always difficult to

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.490 
well because it's always difficult to
separate<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.670> backing<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.110> will<00:01:40.320> help

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
separate the backing so this will help

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.490 
separate the backing so this will help
you<00:01:40.619> separate<00:01:41.150> a<00:01:42.150> piece<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.049> fiberglass

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
you separate a piece of the fiberglass

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.069 
you separate a piece of the fiberglass
that<00:01:43.530> aren't<00:01:43.979> pre-cut<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:45.119> before<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.840> pull

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
that aren't pre-cut so before you pull

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.350 
that aren't pre-cut so before you pull
this<00:01:46.229> off<00:01:46.439> what<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.040> should<00:01:47.280> do<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.759> put<00:01:48.329> a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
this off what you should do is put a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.850 
this off what you should do is put a
little<00:01:48.420> bend<00:01:49.909> like<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.720> then<00:01:52.530> what<00:01:52.740> will

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
little bend like this and then what will

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.789 
little bend like this and then what will
happen<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:54.149> bend<00:01:54.509> will<00:01:55.110> keep<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.560> fiber

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
happen is the bend will keep the fiber

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.760 
happen is the bend will keep the fiber
glass<00:01:55.950> nice<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.790> stiff<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.450> now<00:01:58.049> you're<00:01:58.320> able

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
glass nice and stiff and now you're able

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.580 
glass nice and stiff and now you're able
to<00:01:58.799> line<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.280> up<00:01:59.579> without<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.409> dropping<00:02:01.409> and

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
to line it up without it dropping and

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.340 
to line it up without it dropping and
hitting<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.040> nail<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:03.600> can<00:02:03.780> place<00:02:04.110> it

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
hitting the nail and you can place it

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.170 
hitting the nail and you can place it
perfectly<00:02:05.100> where<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.430> need<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.700> every<00:02:05.969> time

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
perfectly where you need it every time

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.960 
perfectly where you need it every time
once<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.320> get<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.560> placed<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.429> can<00:02:08.459> use<00:02:08.819> your

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
once you get it placed you can use your

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.010 
once you get it placed you can use your
scissors<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:10.459> lay<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.640> down<00:02:11.670> or<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.270> piece

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
scissors to just lay it down or a piece

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.730 
scissors to just lay it down or a piece
of<00:02:13.200> plastic

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
