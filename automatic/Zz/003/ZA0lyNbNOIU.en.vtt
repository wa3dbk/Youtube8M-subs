Minecraft<00:00:09.170> this<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.290> what<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:10.530> looks<00:00:10.710> like<00:00:13.070> and

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
Minecraft this is what it looks like and

Minecraft this is what it looks like and
let's<00:00:15.179> get<00:00:15.389> started<00:00:16.020> okay<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:16.949> basically

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
let's get started okay so basically

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.210 
let's get started okay so basically
first<00:00:18.750> off<00:00:19.020> you're<00:00:19.260> gonna<00:00:19.380> want<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.800> start<00:00:20.100> off

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
first off you're gonna want to start off

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.849 
first off you're gonna want to start off
with<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.550> wheels<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:24.050> it<00:00:25.050> took<00:00:25.260> me<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.470> lot<00:00:25.800> of

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
with the wheels and it took me a lot of

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.380 
with the wheels and it took me a lot of
time<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.550> get<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.090> scale<00:00:28.939> so<00:00:29.939> basically

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
time to get this to scale so basically

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.849 
time to get this to scale so basically
what<00:00:30.660> you're<00:00:30.750> going<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.019> want<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.289> do<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.590> just

what you're going to want to do is just

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.790 
what you're going to want to do is just
place<00:00:32.189> or<00:00:33.059> block<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> stone<00:00:33.870> like<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.649> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
place or block a stone like this on the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:01:10.850 
place or block a stone like this on the
ground

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.150 

so<00:01:11.860> basically<00:01:12.520> and<00:01:12.760> you<00:01:12.790> just<00:01:13.060> have<00:01:13.800> this<00:01:14.800> part

of the wheel now now you're gonna want

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.930 
of the wheel now now you're gonna want
to<00:01:24.880> do<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.240> outside<00:01:25.660> of<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.870> wheel<00:01:26.700> which<00:01:27.700> is

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
to do the outside of the wheel which is

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:37.170 
to do the outside of the wheel which is
like<00:01:28.300> this<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.869> basically<00:01:35.290> just<00:01:35.880> one<00:01:36.880> block

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
like this it's basically just one block

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.070 
like this it's basically just one block
on<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.660> outer<00:01:37.810> edge<00:01:38.110> of<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:39.930> part<00:01:40.930> we<00:01:41.050> just

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
on the outer edge of the part we just

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:53.010 
on the outer edge of the part we just
did<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.500> it<00:01:50.560> should<00:01:50.770> look<00:01:50.800> like<00:01:50.950> this<00:01:51.690> okay<00:01:52.690> now

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
did so it should look like this okay now

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
now my channel is obviously a very very

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.470 
now my channel is obviously a very very
small<00:03:41.660> probably<00:03:42.590> won't<00:03:42.890> have<00:03:42.980> to<00:03:43.100> grow<00:03:43.480> very

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
small probably won't have to grow very

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.720 
small probably won't have to grow very
much<00:03:45.400> what<00:03:46.400> I'm<00:03:46.520> trying<00:03:49.090> okay<00:03:50.110> now<00:03:51.110> you<00:03:51.170> just

you can just go in ah why am I missing
so<00:04:24.740> many<00:04:24.800> blocks<00:04:26.260> I<00:04:27.260> think<00:04:28.150> maybe<00:04:29.150> I'm<00:04:29.419> on<00:04:29.570> to

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
so many blocks I think maybe I'm on to

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:48.190 
so many blocks I think maybe I'm on to
oversensitive<00:04:45.520> okay<00:04:46.520> so<00:04:46.630> now<00:04:47.630> that<00:04:47.660> you<00:04:48.050> have

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
oversensitive okay so now that you have

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:55.360 
oversensitive okay so now that you have
this<00:04:48.350> wheel<00:04:48.650> done<00:04:50.620> space<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:51.860> next<00:04:52.160> wheel<00:04:54.370> two

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
this wheel done space the next wheel two

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:06.490 
this wheel done space the next wheel two
blocks<00:04:55.700> apart<00:05:04.930> I'll<00:05:05.930> just<00:05:06.080> show<00:05:06.260> you<00:05:06.290> the

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
blocks apart I'll just show you the

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.010 
blocks apart I'll just show you the
beginning<00:05:06.830> of<00:05:07.070> it<00:05:07.220> but<00:05:08.000> I'm<00:05:08.120> gonna<00:05:08.270> skip<00:05:08.630> the

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
beginning of it but I'm gonna skip the

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.219 
beginning of it but I'm gonna skip the
next<00:05:09.229> wheels<00:05:09.650> just<00:05:10.010> so<00:05:10.250> it's<00:05:10.690> simplified<00:05:11.690> or

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
next wheels just so it's simplified or

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.500 
next wheels just so it's simplified or
not<00:05:12.500> simplified<00:05:13.130> so<00:05:13.400> just<00:05:13.669> so<00:05:13.760> it's<00:05:13.910> longer

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
not simplified so just so it's longer

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:45.680 
not simplified so just so it's longer
I<00:05:14.540> ain't<00:05:14.900> les<00:05:15.650> longer<00:05:16.300> shorter<00:05:17.470> yeah<00:05:18.470> you<00:05:19.100> good

wheel just make it the same exact same
thing<00:05:53.770> just<00:05:54.100> two<00:05:54.790> blocks<00:05:55.000> apart<00:05:55.389> and<00:05:56.250> then<00:05:57.250> do

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
thing just two blocks apart and then do
