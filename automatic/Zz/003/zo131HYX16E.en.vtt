00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:18.940 
much parental work with the Delta game

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.730 
much parental work with the Delta game

turning on the bottom please this is a

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.260 
turning on the bottom please this is a
new<00:00:20.890> battery<00:00:21.100> compartments<00:00:21.939> the<00:00:21.970> first

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
new battery compartments the first

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.609 
new battery compartments the first
version<00:00:22.570> we<00:00:22.810> got<00:00:22.930> an<00:00:23.020> upgraded<00:00:23.500> version

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
version we got an upgraded version

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.130 
version we got an upgraded version
already<00:00:24.010> this<00:00:24.910> is<00:00:25.090> flying<00:00:25.330> to<00:00:25.450> 4<00:00:25.660> so<00:00:25.930> with<00:00:26.110> a

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
already this is flying to 4 so with a

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.830 
already this is flying to 4 so with a
6-4<00:00:27.480> about<00:00:28.480> prop<00:00:29.110> on<00:00:29.320> it<00:00:29.500> a<00:00:29.590> 550<00:00:30.250> I<00:00:30.840> believe

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
6-4 about prop on it a 550 I believe

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.240 
6-4 about prop on it a 550 I believe
this<00:00:32.050> is<00:00:32.230> the<00:00:33.600> 500<00:00:34.600> motor<00:00:34.780> ok<00:00:35.560> just<00:00:36.070> a

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
this is the 500 motor ok just a

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.190 
this is the 500 motor ok just a
four-cell<00:00:36.730> with<00:00:36.970> the<00:00:37.120> sixth<00:00:37.540> floor<00:00:37.630> prop<00:00:37.989> on

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
four-cell with the sixth floor prop on

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.979 
four-cell with the sixth floor prop on
it<00:00:38.460> we've<00:00:39.460> got<00:00:39.670> all<00:00:39.850> the<00:00:40.000> experimental<00:00:40.750> we're

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
it we've got all the experimental we're

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.790 
it we've got all the experimental we're
covering<00:00:41.410> the<00:00:41.670> servos<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:44.079> receiver<00:00:44.470> is<00:00:44.620> a

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
covering the servos the receiver is a

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.840 
covering the servos the receiver is a
2.4<00:00:45.660> yeah<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:46.809> receiver<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.739> the<00:00:48.489> speed

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
2.4 yeah the receiver the the speed

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.450 
2.4 yeah the receiver the the speed

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
control is a 45 and we'll give it a

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.759 
control is a 45 and we'll give it a
whirl<00:00:51.609> and<00:00:51.699> see<00:00:51.760> what<00:00:52.000> happens<00:00:52.359> on<00:00:52.480> it<00:00:52.769> welcome

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
whirl and see what happens on it welcome

whirl and see what happens on it welcome
there<00:00:54.269> now<00:00:55.269> this<00:00:55.420> is<00:00:55.480> the<00:00:55.629> suggested<00:00:56.469> launch

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
there now this is the suggested launch

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.489 
there now this is the suggested launch
position<00:00:57.390> especially<00:00:58.390> on<00:00:58.420> a<00:00:58.539> new<00:00:58.780> flight<00:00:59.079> new

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:01.470 
position especially on a new flight new
maiden<00:00:59.859> flight<00:01:00.160> simple<00:01:01.059> reason<00:01:01.269> we're<00:01:01.359> gonna

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
maiden flight simple reason we're gonna

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.090 
maiden flight simple reason we're gonna
try<00:01:01.629> to<00:01:01.690> get<00:01:01.839> up<00:01:02.019> as<00:01:02.170> high<00:01:02.320> as<00:01:02.350> we<00:01:02.589> can<00:01:02.620> as<00:01:02.920> quick

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
try to get up as high as we can as quick

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.619 
try to get up as high as we can as quick
if<00:01:03.129> we<00:01:03.339> got<00:01:03.489> a<00:01:03.519> lot<00:01:03.730> of<00:01:03.760> torque<00:01:04.089> this<00:01:04.300> motors

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
if we got a lot of torque this motors

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.360 
if we got a lot of torque this motors
got<00:01:04.750> some<00:01:05.110> torque<00:01:05.470> it's<00:01:06.010> going<00:01:06.190> to<00:01:06.250> always

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
got some torque it's going to always

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.370 
got some torque it's going to always
want<00:01:06.610> to<00:01:06.700> torque<00:01:06.970> roll<00:01:07.180> to<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.390> left<00:01:07.480> so<00:01:08.140> if<00:01:08.260> it

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
want to torque roll to the left so if it

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.870 
want to torque roll to the left so if it
torques<00:01:08.680> I<00:01:08.830> should<00:01:09.010> have<00:01:09.130> plenty<00:01:09.370> of<00:01:09.490> time<00:01:09.700> I'm

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
torques I should have plenty of time I'm

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.030 
torques I should have plenty of time I'm
gonna<00:01:10.000> stand<00:01:10.210> to<00:01:10.390> his<00:01:10.540> left<00:01:10.870> I'm<00:01:11.560> gonna<00:01:11.740> burn

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
gonna stand to his left I'm gonna burn

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.320 
gonna stand to his left I'm gonna burn
up<00:01:12.190> to<00:01:12.250> about<00:01:12.460> three<00:01:12.760> quarter<00:01:13.150> and<00:01:13.240> you're

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
up to about three quarter and you're

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.760 
up to about three quarter and you're
going<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.540> just<00:01:13.690> give<00:01:13.870> it<00:01:13.990> a<00:01:14.020> slight<00:01:14.170> nudge<00:01:14.560> up

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
going to just give it a slight nudge up

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.990 
going to just give it a slight nudge up
at<00:01:14.920> that<00:01:15.040> distance<00:01:15.280> here<00:01:15.970> we<00:01:16.060> go

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.550 

get<00:01:21.000> rolled<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.540> me<00:01:21.690> but<00:01:21.870> I<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.230> know<00:01:22.440> I<00:01:22.470> want

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
get rolled on me but I just know I want

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:38.380 
get rolled on me but I just know I want
to<00:01:22.740> trim<00:01:22.980> it<00:01:23.100> now

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.700 

pretty<00:01:39.390> stable<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.110> let's<00:01:40.380> give<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.619> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
pretty stable on it let's give it a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.160 
pretty stable on it let's give it a
hands-off<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.610> little<00:01:42.390> bit<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.570> crude<00:01:42.810> into<00:01:42.990> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
hands-off a little bit of crude into the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:54.150 
hands-off a little bit of crude into the
winner<00:01:43.380> we<00:01:43.530> doing<00:01:43.740> here<00:01:43.830> Wow

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.720 

we're<00:01:55.160> gonna<00:01:55.250> bring<00:01:55.460> it<00:01:55.580> down<00:01:57.370> she's<00:01:58.370> having<00:01:58.670> a

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
we're gonna bring it down she's having a

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:12.220 
we're gonna bring it down she's having a
kid

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:35.759 

that's

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:46.319 

that<00:02:36.769> was<00:02:36.920> three<00:02:37.129> quarter<00:02:37.430> trolem

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.119 

running<00:02:47.329> pretty<00:02:47.540> good<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.829> extra

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
running pretty good that the extra

00:02:49.129 --> 00:03:11.450 
running pretty good that the extra
weight<00:02:49.280> in<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.489> battery

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:23.580 

Wow<00:03:13.860> yeah<00:03:14.860> it's<00:03:15.850> really<00:03:16.060> crazy

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:31.890 

this<00:03:24.590> is<00:03:24.769> slow<00:03:25.040> flying<00:03:26.050> keep<00:03:27.050> them<00:03:27.230> real<00:03:27.379> tight

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.440 

pretty<00:03:32.900> stable<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:34.099> can<00:03:34.250> see<00:03:34.459> it<00:03:34.580> that<00:03:35.150> torque

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
pretty stable you can see it that torque

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.119 
pretty stable you can see it that torque
roll<00:03:35.720> is<00:03:35.870> on<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.170> take-off<00:03:36.650> you<00:03:36.830> have<00:03:36.920> to<00:03:37.040> be

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
roll is on the take-off you have to be

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.130 
roll is on the take-off you have to be
real<00:03:37.340> careful<00:03:37.370> with<00:03:37.940> it<00:03:38.150> it's<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.720> simplest

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
real careful with it it's the simplest

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.440 
real careful with it it's the simplest
way<00:03:39.349> to<00:03:39.379> launch<00:03:39.890> it<00:03:40.099> but<00:03:40.879> you<00:03:41.000> could<00:03:41.150> see<00:03:41.330> it

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
way to launch it but you could see it

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.300 
way to launch it but you could see it
she's<00:03:41.660> got<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:41.989> good<00:03:42.170> glide<00:03:42.440> path<00:03:42.769> is<00:03:43.040> when

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
she's got a good glide path is when

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.640 
she's got a good glide path is when
pushing<00:03:43.610> it<00:03:43.819> to<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:43.970> right<00:03:44.230> but<00:03:45.230> she's<00:03:45.440> still

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
pushing it to the right but she's still

00:03:45.650 --> 00:04:10.420 
pushing it to the right but she's still
handling<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.190> very<00:03:46.250> very<00:03:46.670> well

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430
