00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
you different endure tweaking is

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.540 
you different endure tweaking is
possible<00:00:13.849> now<00:00:14.849> here<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.120> am<00:00:15.269> just<00:00:15.719> got<00:00:15.900> my

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
possible now here I am just got my

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.769 
possible now here I am just got my
action<00:00:17.550> replay<00:00:17.910> DSi

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
action replay DSi

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.980 
action replay DSi
as<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:19.170> can<00:00:19.289> see<00:00:19.500> DSi<00:00:20.960> so<00:00:21.960> beautiful<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:23.990> just

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
as you can see DSi so beautiful and just

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.660 
as you can see DSi so beautiful and just
thought<00:00:25.170> I'd<00:00:25.380> make<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.830> video<00:00:26.189> on<00:00:26.250> this

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
thought I'd make a video on this

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.410 
thought I'd make a video on this
specifically<00:00:27.300> hi<00:00:28.289> home<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.590> origin<00:00:29.420> anyway

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
specifically hi home of origin anyway

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.170 
specifically hi home of origin anyway
Here<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.720> am<00:00:30.949> at<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.219> hall<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.369> origin

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
Here I am at the hall of origin

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.430 
Here I am at the hall of origin
yeah<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:33.690> all<00:00:33.899> glitchy<00:00:34.170> whatever<00:00:36.440> anyway

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440

to<00:00:41.160> be<00:00:41.460> tweaking<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.960> whole<00:00:43.559> area<00:00:44.070> right

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
to be tweaking this whole area right

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.830 
to be tweaking this whole area right
here<00:00:44.899> out<00:00:45.899> there<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.110> little<00:00:46.260> bit<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.840> searching

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
here out there a little bit of searching

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.869 
here out there a little bit of searching
I<00:00:48.960> found<00:00:49.200> out<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.039> horizontal<00:00:50.760> load

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
I found out that the horizontal load

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.729 
I found out that the horizontal load
line<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.149> right<00:00:51.510> here<00:00:51.870> here's<00:00:52.800> one<00:00:53.280> here's<00:00:53.760> 2

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
line is right here here's one here's 2

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.650 
line is right here here's one here's 2
whatever<00:00:55.739> top<00:00:56.010> bottom<00:00:56.430> or<00:00:56.610> 3<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.210> should<00:00:57.300> say

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
whatever top bottom or 3 I should say

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.650 
whatever top bottom or 3 I should say
but<00:00:58.469> here's<00:00:58.680> top<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.070> bottom<00:00:59.390> and<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.570> you

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
but here's top and bottom and if you

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.740 
but here's top and bottom and if you
count<00:01:00.809> seven<00:01:01.350> over<00:01:01.620> from<00:01:01.800> here<00:01:02.160> 1<00:01:02.609> 2<00:01:03.090> 3<00:01:03.359> 4<00:01:04.140> 5<00:01:04.530> 6<00:01:05.040> 7

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
count seven over from here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.780 
count seven over from here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
right<00:01:06.750> between<00:01:07.560> these<00:01:07.920> two<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> load<00:01:08.549> line

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
right between these two is a load line

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.570 
right between these two is a load line
so<00:01:09.439> right<00:01:10.439> here<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.610> load<00:01:12.119> line<00:01:13.310> well<00:01:14.310> one

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
so right here is the load line well one

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.420 
so right here is the load line well one
the<00:01:14.760> load<00:01:14.939> lines<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> Hall<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.810> origin<00:01:16.430> so

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
the load lines for the Hall of origin so

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:25.219 
the load lines for the Hall of origin so
all<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:17.729> do<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.270> tweak<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.460> Don<00:01:24.049> it's<00:01:25.049> sort<00:01:25.200> of

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
all we do is tweak that Don it's sort of

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.600 
all we do is tweak that Don it's sort of
hard<00:01:25.350> tweaking<00:01:25.890> with<00:01:26.009> one<00:01:26.250> hand<00:01:26.520> even<00:01:28.340> 5<00:01:29.340> tile

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
hard tweaking with one hand even 5 tile

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.429 
hard tweaking with one hand even 5 tile
is<00:01:29.850> hard

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.469 

anyway<00:01:35.429> there<00:01:36.149> we<00:01:36.359> go<00:01:36.539> as<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:38.479> I've

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
anyway there we go as you can see I've

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.580 
anyway there we go as you can see I've
tweaked<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.590> area<00:01:41.750> you<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:42.869> walk<00:01:43.079> over<00:01:43.109> it

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
tweaked this area you can walk over it

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.669 
tweaked this area you can walk over it
whatever<00:01:44.579> not<00:01:45.299> go<00:01:45.479> upstairs<00:01:45.630> not<00:01:46.289> change<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
whatever not go upstairs not change the

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.880 
whatever not go upstairs not change the
z-axis<00:01:47.450> but<00:01:48.450> if<00:01:48.569> you<00:01:48.689> see<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.929> go<00:01:49.319> up<00:01:50.030> whoops<00:01:51.030> I

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
z-axis but if you see I go up whoops I

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.990 
z-axis but if you see I go up whoops I
go<00:01:52.890> around<00:01:53.299> and<00:01:54.829> only<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:56.099> square<00:01:56.459> is<00:01:56.579> missing

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
go around and only a square is missing

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.410 
go around and only a square is missing
from<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.420> not<00:01:57.959> just<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.649> whole<00:01:58.829> side<00:01:59.399> but<00:02:00.299> only

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
from it not just the whole side but only

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:09.770 
from it not just the whole side but only
one<00:02:00.750> tiny<00:02:01.049> square<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:08.239> and<00:02:09.239> then<00:02:09.360> once<00:02:09.569> we

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
one tiny square of it and then once we

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.890 
one tiny square of it and then once we
go<00:02:09.989> back<00:02:10.259> over<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.619> load<00:02:10.769> line<00:02:11.009> one<00:02:11.640> two<00:02:12.209> three

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
go back over the load line one two three

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.690 
go back over the load line one two three
four<00:02:13.410> five<00:02:13.860> six<00:02:14.430> seven<00:02:15.470> well<00:02:16.470> just<00:02:17.400> show<00:02:17.640> you
