00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.680
 Of course I have always said that 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.220
 it is a joy will always return to the 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.110
 selection and to re-start a 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.599
 new challenge that is in the eurocopa 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.700
 present and prepare us and get from the 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.239
 better way to start a new cycle 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.770
 forget the past so much of this last 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.510
 worldwide as the successes that we have 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.780
 achieved and as a result there can 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.760
 try again will be what we went to 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.980
 believe truly again believes that 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.190
 you can get important things not 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.830
 I think it's a clean-up issue 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.770
 image I think the selection always 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.960
 has had his identity his personality and 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.240
 in that sense we should not change 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.180
 although there are players who have left 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.250
 the selection or new players come 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.690
 players who have never been to the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.480
 absolute I think that here 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.880
 we should always keep that about the 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.740
 time at the end because it is giving you that 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.170
 but in that sense then here we are 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.030
 to help to create a good climate a 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.880
 good atmosphere to all the player who 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.470
 come so that the adaptation is what 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.000
 best but after all each 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.040
 one then jump to the field do the 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.740
 well deluded things and that but that 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.830
 everyone who comes comes convinced and that 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.870
 come to want to help and to believe in doing 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.580
 some important role in the eurocopa the 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.070
 Paradise winning the matches 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.710
 So we have the truth that although they have 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.260
 been two very important players for 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.630
 this selection have marked a time and 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.640
 have evidently been fundamental in 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.090
 the history of our selection about 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.990
 all these last years of success but 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.580
 neither should we forget that the 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.160
 players of a lot of quality a 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.890
 fifth of new footballer with a lot 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.410
 illusion and eager to want to be 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.360
 something important also yes I think that 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.940
 the winning after all, always 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.010
 It motivates you a lot and you have known all 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.810
 those years of success as it is an extra plus 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.720
 of motivation for the time to face 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.970
 any new challenge and in that 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.370
 let's try not to do what 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.960
 that we went and forget about the successes 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.540
 that have been achieved because we can not 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:26.430
 live from that past but obviously 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.430
 you can believe again that you can
