of what goes on with it we do have a

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.539 
of what goes on with it we do have a
five-way<00:01:13.380> selector<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.189> should<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.460> able

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
five-way selector so we should be able

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.179 
five-way selector so we should be able
to<00:01:14.670> do<00:01:14.820> some<00:01:15.119> single<00:01:15.600> coolest<00:01:15.750> sounds<00:01:16.320> he<00:01:17.070> has
