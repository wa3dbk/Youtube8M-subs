 and the viewers and viewers alright welcome 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.620
 to my complete logistical tutorial and 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.559
 peace in this tutorial explain how to use 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.450
 all blocks items upgrade modules 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.370
 part includes the system of 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.410
 manipulation of liquid and 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.869
 transportation of energy in other modes 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.520
 through bek craft tubes to 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.189
 facilitate the location of information 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.170
 of this tutorial I divided into 16 parts and 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.760
 I put this hydro and this menu in the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.960
 beginning of them all 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.029
 If you want to watch the tutorial 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.560
 complete I recommend watch in the list 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.480
 because it will skip 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.579
 this automatically between - you'll 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.620
 watch as if it were a great video 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.660
 link it is in active description 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.520
 notes for you can click on the menus 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.739
 and sees possible corrections information 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.059
 additional information that I may have overlooked in 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.219
 time I was recording 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.360
 I hope you like the video if you like it. 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.360
 forget to click like 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.629
 the next big one that will demonstrate here 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.140
 is kraft monitored the lawsuit you make 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.510
 it thus using a set type 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.100
 of house tony diamond green dyes 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.560
 redstone blues and a crash on the jeep mk2 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.260
 and you can only put it inside the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.790
 shopkeeper recognizing table does not work 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.060
 no other place has to be on the river 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.000
 loge xrs table event will open here 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.650
 put the crafting monitor the lawsuit 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.810
 here and now every time I 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.960
 make a request to create 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.479
 any item here he will put in that 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.250
 screen here for example the copper block 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.200
 I'll ask him what a block of 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.090
 since it takes time to create and 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.920
 now this guide appeared, showing 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.659
 that he is creating a block of copper 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.400
 if you apply here it will show this 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.350
 screen in a little more detail if 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.720
 clicking on it will show all the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.759
 possible additional details here for 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.060
 example front also vote to create 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.950
 ejectors and I will request a 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.509
 of five managers then it will start 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.790
 creating five directors is that they are 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.119
 all the details of the creations he 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.119
 Is doing 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.520
 the latest upgrade that failed to show here 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.500
 is the peter craft remote control the upgrade 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.630
 to demonstrate this it is necessary to say the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.620
 Next all tubes logistics 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.050
 tie they are and are connectable to the 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.420
 computer craft all of them all all 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.560
 all of them all share the same 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.519
 even functionality but some like the 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.980
 request father has some 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.450
 features to demonstrate 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.980
 This is where I took a computer from 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.260
 I'll put it here 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.030
 side and it will be a peripheral of the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.989
 computer crepe I'll open the interface 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.260
 here type moon and here I am going to give a 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:47.250
 peripheral point rap east that is the side 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.709
 computer and I'm going to put it in the 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.640
 variable x and now if I give an x point 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.739
 help 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.099
 I'll have the information here about 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.049
 this tube that we are connected to 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.700
 people can make requests to us 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:03.030
 can make consultations and several other 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.010
 The things we can do is in the jeep. 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.959
 and I'll leave the procon-pe link to 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.910
 request completed the shopkeeper Kroeff and peace 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.209
 in the description of this video so that you 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.780
 have more details and what this module 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.820
 does it allow you to have 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.100
 more control over the jeep 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.380
 this module that is made that way you 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.780
 can put in the tube that you are 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.940
 connected to the computer for example in the 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.660
 if I connected approved today father you 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.519
 You can connect it here and put your 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.280
 upgrade here and now you will get a 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.290
 new method available here in his case 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.389
 is showing these methods if I 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.760
 I put this is the actual x command again 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.650
 he is not shown in the method 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.350
 but it has the method that is the method 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.100
 called ok was already demonstrated in the 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.959
 subway that gap by yu haiti if you 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.609
 try to use this method without this 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.760
 so you will get an access error 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:59.519
 denied in December I'm going to take the remote 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.549
 control is from here and I will execute the method 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.620
 x.org is typical of the forum and get a 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.989
 string example it will give permission 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.350
 Because we do not have another day. 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.760
 now if I put plaid it will not 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.950
 give permission for energy but in 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.329
 compensation also did not find the id because 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.310
 there is no sample calling 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.319
 id is not a name we call not 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.750
 is what we put it the ideal is 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:24.699
 associated with all tubes here in the case 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.860
 I put a computer on top of a 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.930
 the jeep and I put this 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.280
 floppy disk with a blank white ac 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.500
 if it is no longer blank because 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.050
 I ran some commands that go 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.300
 pick up the peripheral from the bottom peripheral 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.169
 which in the case of the jeep will open a file 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.719
 on the floppy disk and will save it to that file 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.550
 id has removed this is the most 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:48.639
 practice at the moment 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.229
 so it is quickly if you get and 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.870
 rye to write down on any paper 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:55.240
 thing then I closed the file only myself 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.569
 I'm leaving now and here in the file 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.009
 in the folder says that my id was created 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:05.680
 that I can give a exists here has the id 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:09.099
 that the jeep left now withdraw 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.319
 I'm going to put this disk in 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.840
 here in this drive. 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:15.550
 floppy disk 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.990
 now I can do the following here I 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:22.870
 I can open the file open the file is 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:26.110
 read the entire contents of a variable and 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:29.500
 close the file now if I give 11 for 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.400
 example print and from where I put it 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.389
 or id 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.080
 I have the idea of ​​a file id here 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.449
 inside 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.550
 knowing you and the tube I can do it 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:43.120
 next to put for example father pi 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:47.500
 and what x the peripheral ghetti piper 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:50.409
 forum the id and put the id and now the parent 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.990
 pi he is to coasul if the dual 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:55.719
 peripheral of that tube no longer than that of 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.449
 tube was used in case and injured and 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:06:00.520
 if I occupied the grid so that I could 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:02.770
 connect to any of these tubes that 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.159
 are in the logistics network and now I can 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.289
 make requests using this tube 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:11.110
 through this computer without having to 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:13.509
 put anything beyond that 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.729
 and to demonstrate remote control I 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:20.830
 that we can do using this 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:23.169
 upgrade i got the iddd ejector item 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.639
 is identified by longipalpis through 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.789
 of the parent method because I'm using 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:29.440
 that type is not this team and although 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:31.980
 this method would not make any difference 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.830
 well I used the hot spot father and 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:38.500
 identify and defour 2030 this method 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:42.490
 will get the method from a number of 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:45.340
 identification of the 23 block as a goal 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:49.690
 date or in the case with the zero-value dna 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:52.960
 that this is the editor that is 23 2.0 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:56.050
 as 2,100 is not showing 2.0 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.720
 then objective and jeton and now I 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:03.040
 I put a variable that made the parent 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:05.260
 Pi made a request to me and is 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.960
 in the case create because it will not have the 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.030
 ejector that we got and from and I asked 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.800
 for him to take 10 then as soon as I 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.140
 send the signal here 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.090
 he said that he is lacking resources only 

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:19.150
 that he did not read it in readable form 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:21.250
 said is showing is this information 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:24.160
 so I'll request a smaller amount 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.960
 here with 13 for example and now owner 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.150
 avoid it by requesting I made a 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:31.000
 request remotely he succeeded 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.750
 bring the three managers in here 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.230
 from this chest 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:37.150
 Note that I did not use it. 

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.530
 another tube that we had used 

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.260
 before 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:43.360
 I did not use the remote logistics order and 

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:47.710
 parents or a remote hero I used 

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:49.510
 just invite and craft with a remote 

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.790
 found the ticket I can do 

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.440
 control over any of these 

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.990
 studies remotely here since 

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.880
 I'm in this logistics system . 

00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:00.480
 to be able to control through this unique 

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.480
 computer
