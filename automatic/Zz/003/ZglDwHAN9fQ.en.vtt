00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.789
 no here is totti with one again 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.509
 more comments here on my 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.570
 channel 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:23.599
 you see a background in the team 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.460
 match plays by myself and also the 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.520
 problematic that always occurs when 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.779
 you played in a bar where better up 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.879
 are very good players 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.340
 you just have to run in my team 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:38.910
 deathmatch or in general also that one 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.219
 but somehow I get kills 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.530
 say so I'm suggesting yes 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.870
 also happen that one or the other 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.090
 maybe even you do not know one 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.200
 but it does not matter but we do not care 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.690
 want some again today 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.280
 Address serious matters for her 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.899
 You know, I will still be 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.399
 written by you I think so too 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.130
 Good that you trust more 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.230
 against it gives because you know me 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.610
 you will not name a name, so who? 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.309
 Look out for this with his 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.960
 history somehow good known too 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.969
 or something like that will not happen 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.430
 because I always take the thing 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:15.049
 writes seriously and that's why I treat 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.700
 all those who write me something anonymous and 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.399
 very often I was then so to this 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.299
 fashion for example 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:26.850
 where it is about jealousy thing against switch 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.350
 to be pretty big topic and me 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.850
 would like to grab a thing out and 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.509
 While this is so, or in the history 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.659
 that he is with his girlfriend one 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.759
 nightclub is and she is with someone else 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.619
 Dances and he does not so clear 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.840
 Yes, and then it comes too 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.249
 Rigging on the dance floor and scene 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.670
 and so on and so forth 

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:50.090
 In retrospect, ultra embarrassing for both 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.069
 him as well as for the girlfriend 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.420
 and yes, he just asked what he did 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.549
 because should because he is a make 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.049
 Bad conscience has his girlfriend 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.690
 I basically have to 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.240
 Of course, that's always when 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.160
 in the game that is there in part 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.690
 jealousy comes on so I can 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.310
 not imagine that if you have someone 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.500
 loves that there is no jealousy 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.480
 So for me that would be at least 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.620
 unknown though and now have that 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.910
 I often said, of course, comes 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.640
 Put the trust back into the game 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.080
 if I trust someone and best 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.630
 in a relationship when you look at yourself 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.170
 then familiar to each other is the 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.880
 jealousy much lower and that 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.410
 Actually that's what love does 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.110
 But then actually makes the relationship 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.560
 But that's the way it is now 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.680
 here 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.410
 the child fell in the well and he has 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.540
 overreacted what should do now completely 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.250
 clear box again in a relationship 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.730
 One should always be open and honest with his 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.770
 say that means I would 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.130
 his place of my partner say stop 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.840
 times because I have overreacted because all 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.550
 just say what was bothering there yes 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.490
 I do not like when I'm another guy 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.810
 dancing or whatever I have 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.040
 yes, different reasons always 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.420
 do not need that is what i can do 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.900
 Do not even say what the reasons for me 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.520
 been 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.790
 I would be open and honest 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.760
 Of course, if so, then tell us 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.160
 Maybe someone happened here 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.890
 sorry also attached yes because 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.330
 it is perhaps because unconsciously and 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.630
 thoughtlessly come a situation 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.650
 the world is totally embarrassing and me 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.660
 Just think there is one 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.940
 really excuse me more than 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.160
 appropriate 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.620
 with that we come to the second thing the 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.680
 relatively often written to me and 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.290
 this is for the relevant themes he feels 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.190
 attracted to her they meet 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:41.160
 often they get along well and it stands 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.170
 somehow im robbing that maybe 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.340
 come together but somehow speaks 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.769
 none of them 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.540
 Whenever a little bit more comes 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.790
 So also to this question 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.560
 then she dodges or he dares 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.720
 to ask the gas 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.849
 is there just already is somehow what the 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.000
 space and it is simple 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.080
 uncertainty and I always have to say that 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.120
 Of course, uncertainty is always 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.380
 bad you should so in things 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.220
 Of course not with the door into it 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.989
 fall house 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.760
 that is always bad because it is 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.890
 Of course, love and belong there 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.360
 of course, empathy with empathy 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.920
 I do not know now I'm sorry 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.980
 Googling, maybe, but ultimately 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.329
 he had to ask without question do you come 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.620
 no answer is very rare in life 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.380
 that one has an answer if 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.530
 you did not question what you did 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.820
 ask how and when and how it can 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.919
 I do not tell you that depends on that 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.960
 many factors from yes so already first 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.440
 When and where I can not do that for you 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.990
 say 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.580
 or I never know how she does 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.350
 I do not know what you are like 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.360
 he would own estimate that's 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.630
 then your relationship yes yes 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.300
 maybe not my and 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.990
 as a small tip girls stand 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:52.440
 mostly on guys the real one 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.930
 But guys are still standing 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.360
 you can feel that you have feelings too 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.400
 that actually makes real guys 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.169
 yes this whole also according to here one 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.460
 Shit does not matter I see I 'm annoyed 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.100
 I'm still unhappy with that 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.410
 So the outbursts say yes, yes 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.180
 Be open about your feelings and you 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.160
 you wonder how the women like that 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.260
 Girls do not react in vain 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.180
 they watch me because they like me 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.840
 millions of love films are there 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:21.330
 it indeed so just showed it to your 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.360
 Feelings see the world that's right 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.130
 good on it but then it should be for 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.840
 been for the gameplay today 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.130
 to the end if you have more such 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.690
 You can do things to me 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.419
 like to write who per pn 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.910
 I'm out saying you always rate 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.330
 would be nice and muolen and I hope we 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.330
 see you again
