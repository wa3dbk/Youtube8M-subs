00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.360
 the metropolis of big paris it's in 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.940
 makes a term that covers three 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.910
 different realities 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.680
 the first thing is a space 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.869
 geographic and human that gathers together 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.460
 of 12 million people and smoldering 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.939
 roughly the territory of the region 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.099
 Ile-de-France 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.470
 this is the first reality corresponds 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.660
 in the metropolis of big paris la 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.120
 second reality it's a project or 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.040
 rather several projects projects 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.570
 development projects transport is 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.239
 the best known of transportation with the 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.350
 network the new network of the big paris 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.250
 but also projects of these was 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.809
 development contracts 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.370
 which are supported by the 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.370
 communities of Ile de France 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.960
 the whole being federating regroup in a 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.730
 document to be adopted by the council 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.309
 regional to 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.480
 from me who has the director of the 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.300
 Ile de France region 3rd reality is 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.720
 an institutional evolution that is 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.430
 profile on the horizon 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.780
 it's the transformation of 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.159
 the organization of the territory and the 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.259
 governance in a number of 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.030
 areas with a debate currently at 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.710
 the national assembly to create a 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.070
 institution called metropolis 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.070
 great art 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.640
 on this institutional aspect you have to see 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.760
 that there are two great philosophies that 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.440
 arise the first that we can 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.110
 qualify as the establishment of a 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.040
 Confederate metropolis relies on the 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.020
 creation movement of 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.320
 the intercommunality that has seen its growth 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.450
 for fifteen years there are 30 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.100
 years of decentralization laws are 15 years ago 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.180
 grouping local authorities into 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.940
 is to communality there is a dynamic 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.620
 that exists is the idea that is carried by 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.510
 the proponents of this organization a 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.090
 Confederate metropolis is to lean 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.310
 on the intercommunality of the loop and 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.540
 to federate these intercommunalities in 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.890
 a metropolis that would take care of 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.280
 some skills that poses the most 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.490
 problem 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.200
 housing development the second 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.660
 philosophy is those who defend a 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.700
 another vision an integrated metropolis that 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.290
 would leave this time from above with 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.330
 basically at first 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.030
 mandatory grouping of all 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.880
 common who are inside of paris 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.950
 and the small crown to constitute 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.470
 a metropolis that would therefore be 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.500
 who would have stronger powers as soon as 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.280
 start behind these technical issues 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.170
 philosophical 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.870
 there are actually two questions that are 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.700
 deeply debated today there are 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.090
 a very important issue to know who 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.000
 controls the centralization of 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.860
 resources in the context of the metropolis 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.750
 confederates these are the opci the 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.670
 intermunicipalities within the framework of the 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.540
 integrated metropolis all the money goes back 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.100
 to the metropolis 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.930
 and then there is a second question 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.330
 important if the issue of perimeter 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.860
 with in the case currently the project 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.930
 of law a metropolis that is 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.640
 would determine on paris and small 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.170
 crown and so the question of what 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.540
 relationship between this agglomeration core 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.769
 and his new institution and the rest 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.620
 of territory with the questions you 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.489
 can imagine solidarity question 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.200
 issue of development issues 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.410
 balanced on both sides of its 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.410
 limitations 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.830
 the next step or more exactly the 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.450
 looping of the current stage is 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.040
 the completion of the parliamentary debate 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.040
 so we'll see by the end of the year 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.240
 debate in the Senate and then debate at 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.120
 the national assembly is normally the 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.310
 text would be voted end of year then we 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.200
 will see for a year the setting up 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.640
 of a prefiguration mission under 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.520
 the authority of the regional prefect who will have 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.010
 the burden of unraveling all the complexity 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.840
 transfer of skills between 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.780
 local authorities the municipalities the 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.310
 opci and the future metropolis to regulate 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.380
 resource allocation issues 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.430
 and so that's going to take all year 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.900
 2014 at the end of 2014 will have 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.790
 still a number of texts from 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.080
 decree giving to take and it will be 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.030
 the object of the year 2015 the government 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.400
 will have to take new texts 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.930
 eventually touch up the law and we 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.920
 will arrive well in early 2016 is 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.900
 normally setting up the 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.100
 metropolis is 1 January 2016 after 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.870
 the calendar that is sketched 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.370
 currently in law only to 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.200
 from 2016 the metropolis on 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.910
 will begin to work one of his 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.450
 first tasks this will be to develop a 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.160
 metropolitan project including one of 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.180
 purpose is to implement the 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.240
 master plan of the island region of 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.240
 la France
