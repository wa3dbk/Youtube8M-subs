00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
the plug they have an inline volume

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.870 
the plug they have an inline volume
control<00:02:03.329> right<00:02:03.540> here<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.079> nice<00:02:04.409> chrome

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
control right here this is nice chrome

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.670 
control right here this is nice chrome
and<00:02:05.880> then<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.360> goes<00:02:06.509> one<00:02:06.840> cable<00:02:07.140> into<00:02:07.649> the
