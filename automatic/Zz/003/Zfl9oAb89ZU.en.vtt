00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
you choose to restrict your diet just a

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.770 
you choose to restrict your diet just a
little<00:00:32.309> little<00:00:32.460> bit<00:00:32.790> everything<00:00:33.390> will<00:00:33.719> change

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
because they can't do certain things but

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.209 
because they can't do certain things but
simply<00:00:41.640> will<00:00:41.879> not<00:00:41.910> restrict<00:00:42.660> their<00:00:43.050> diet<00:00:43.350> what
