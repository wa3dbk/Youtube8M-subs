Wow Nathan another beautiful day another
truck<00:00:03.270> it<00:00:03.449> seems<00:00:03.659> like<00:00:03.810> we<00:00:03.990> were<00:00:04.049> just<00:00:04.259> here

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
truck it seems like we were just here

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.170 
truck it seems like we were just here
yesterday<00:00:04.650> I<00:00:05.040> think<00:00:05.100> we<00:00:05.339> were<00:00:05.460> that's<00:00:05.730> right

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
yesterday I think we were that's right

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.820 
yesterday I think we were that's right
we're<00:00:06.390> just<00:00:06.420> here<00:00:06.750> with<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:06.990> RAM<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.649> we

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
we're just here with the RAM and we

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.209 
we're just here with the RAM and we
thought<00:00:08.450> why<00:00:09.450> not<00:00:09.480> bring<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.139> GMC<00:00:10.679> Sierra

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
thought why not bring the GMC Sierra

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.459 
thought why not bring the GMC Sierra
Denali<00:00:11.750> because<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.900> guys<00:00:13.019> are<00:00:13.230> curious

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
Denali because you guys are curious

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.829 
Denali because you guys are curious
about<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.920> difference<00:00:14.370> between<00:00:14.839> four-wheel

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
about the difference between four-wheel

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.950 
about the difference between four-wheel
drive<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.440> all-wheel<00:00:16.949> drive<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.510> pickup

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
drive and all-wheel drive so this pickup

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.109 
drive and all-wheel drive so this pickup
is<00:00:19.170> all-wheel<00:00:19.740> drive<00:00:20.100> that's<00:00:20.460> right<00:00:20.670> baby<00:00:20.850> and

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
is all-wheel drive that's right baby and

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.340 
is all-wheel drive that's right baby and
we're<00:00:21.210> going<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.359> take<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.720> on<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.990> exact

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
we're going to take you on the exact

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.529 
we're going to take you on the exact
same<00:00:22.680> course<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.460> took<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.119> four-wheel

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
same course that we took the four-wheel

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.839 
same course that we took the four-wheel
drive<00:00:24.570> Ram<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.619> see<00:00:26.130> how<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.340> does<00:00:26.369> coming<00:00:26.699> up

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
drive Ram and see how it does coming up

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:37.970 
drive Ram and see how it does coming up
next<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.449> fast<00:00:27.720> lane<00:00:27.930> car

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:01:31.800 

we

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.539 

all<00:01:32.810> right<00:01:32.960> Nathan<00:01:33.140> how<00:01:33.530> does<00:01:33.649> it<00:01:33.770> compare<00:01:33.920> to

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
all right Nathan how does it compare to

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.480 
all right Nathan how does it compare to
the<00:01:35.180> RAM<00:01:35.829> completely<00:01:36.829> different<00:01:37.130> vehicles

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
the RAM completely different vehicles

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.770 
the RAM completely different vehicles
actually<00:01:37.640> this<00:01:38.030> one<00:01:38.210> has<00:01:38.360> a<00:01:38.390> totally

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
actually this one has a totally

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.300 
actually this one has a totally
different<00:01:39.049> personality<00:01:39.649> and<00:01:39.680> it<00:01:39.860> has<00:01:40.040> to<00:01:40.189> do

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
different personality and it has to do

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.770 
different personality and it has to do
partially<00:01:40.759> with<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:40.970> fact<00:01:41.119> it's<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:41.450> luxury

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
partially with the fact it's the luxury

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.810 
partially with the fact it's the luxury
Edition<00:01:42.140> but<00:01:42.649> also<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:43.220> fact<00:01:43.430> that<00:01:43.580> the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
Edition but also the fact that the

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.730 
Edition but also the fact that the
all-wheel-drive<00:01:44.210> system<00:01:44.539> works<00:01:45.530> in<00:01:45.680> a

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
all-wheel-drive system works in a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.350 
all-wheel-drive system works in a
completely<00:01:46.100> different<00:01:46.580> way<00:01:46.909> than<00:01:46.939> the

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
completely different way than the

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.490 
completely different way than the
four-wheel<00:01:47.689> drive<00:01:47.720> system<00:01:48.159> you<00:01:49.159> mean<00:01:49.340> it's

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
four-wheel drive system you mean it's

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.310 
four-wheel drive system you mean it's
more<00:01:51.500> capable<00:01:51.830> ok<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:53.210> might<00:01:53.630> be<00:01:53.780> more<00:01:53.899> capable

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
more capable ok it might be more capable

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.690 
more capable ok it might be more capable
and<00:01:54.470> snow<00:01:54.799> because<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:55.280> don't<00:01:55.429> have<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.580> do

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
and snow because you don't have to do

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.830 
and snow because you don't have to do
anything<00:01:55.909> you<00:01:56.030> know<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.299> touch<00:01:56.420> me<00:01:56.570> buttons

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
anything you know the touch me buttons

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.380 
anything you know the touch me buttons
pull<00:01:56.990> any<00:01:57.170> levers<00:01:57.200> it<00:01:57.560> just<00:01:57.770> goes<00:01:58.009> out<00:01:58.340> here<00:01:59.270> in

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
pull any levers it just goes out here in

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.359 
pull any levers it just goes out here in
the<00:01:59.479> mud<00:01:59.689> what<00:01:59.929> I've<00:02:00.049> noticed<00:02:00.229> is<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:01.159> rear

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
the mud what I've noticed is the rear

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:02.949 
the mud what I've noticed is the rear
end<00:02:01.610> really<00:02:02.060> starts<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.450> move<00:02:02.569> a<00:02:02.720> little<00:02:02.840> bit

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
end really starts to move a little bit

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:04.240 
end really starts to move a little bit
then<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:03.319> get<00:02:03.470> a<00:02:03.500> little<00:02:03.709> bit<00:02:03.799> of<00:02:03.890> play<00:02:04.039> in<00:02:04.159> the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
then you get a little bit of play in the

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.649 
then you get a little bit of play in the
front<00:02:04.459> end<00:02:04.580> then<00:02:04.759> it<00:02:04.880> really<00:02:05.030> starts<00:02:05.330> to<00:02:05.390> pull

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
front end then it really starts to pull

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.570 
front end then it really starts to pull
so<00:02:05.990> it's<00:02:06.530> a<00:02:06.649> little<00:02:06.860> bit<00:02:06.979> different<00:02:07.310> than<00:02:07.429> when

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
so it's a little bit different than when

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.680 
so it's a little bit different than when
you're<00:02:07.759> in<00:02:07.909> four-wheel<00:02:08.149> driving<00:02:08.509> you've

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
you're in four-wheel driving you've

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.530 
you're in four-wheel driving you've
always<00:02:08.959> got<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.410> motion<00:02:09.739> going<00:02:10.310> it's<00:02:10.880> well

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
always got the motion going it's well

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.020 
always got the motion going it's well
frankly<00:02:11.989> it's<00:02:12.230> dummy-proof<00:02:12.650> yeah<00:02:13.549> so<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.910> way

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
frankly it's dummy-proof yeah so the way

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.550 
frankly it's dummy-proof yeah so the way
this<00:02:14.180> works<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:14.690> basically<00:02:14.959> it's<00:02:15.319> an<00:02:15.380> all

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
this works is basically it's an all

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.110 
this works is basically it's an all
wheel<00:02:15.709> drive<00:02:15.769> vehicle<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.489> sends<00:02:16.760> most<00:02:16.970> of

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
wheel drive vehicle that sends most of

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.910 
wheel drive vehicle that sends most of
the<00:02:17.180> power<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.600> rear<00:02:17.780> wheels<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.769> when

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
the power to the rear wheels and when

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.190 
the power to the rear wheels and when
they<00:02:19.010> start<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.400> slip<00:02:19.610> it<00:02:19.819> sends<00:02:20.239> power<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:21.110> the

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
they start to slip it sends power to the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.850 
they start to slip it sends power to the
front<00:02:21.319> wheels

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
front wheels

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.289 
front wheels
in<00:02:22.069> other<00:02:22.250> words<00:02:22.519> sitting<00:02:22.760> power<00:02:22.970> where<00:02:23.180> it's

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
in other words sitting power where it's

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.360 
in other words sitting power where it's
needed<00:02:23.510> but<00:02:23.900> when<00:02:24.739> you're<00:02:24.890> doing<00:02:25.220> some

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
needed but when you're doing some

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.800 
needed but when you're doing some
serious<00:02:25.519> off-roading<00:02:26.150> it's<00:02:26.360> nice<00:02:26.540> to<00:02:26.690> have

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
serious off-roading it's nice to have

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.960 
serious off-roading it's nice to have
power<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.230> all<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.739> wheels<00:02:27.950> yeah<00:02:28.640> and

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
power to all the wheels yeah and

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.360 
power to all the wheels yeah and
remember<00:02:29.450> folks<00:02:29.959> we're<00:02:30.560> taking<00:02:30.860> this<00:02:31.010> up<00:02:31.220> the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
remember folks we're taking this up the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.520 
remember folks we're taking this up the
same<00:02:31.580> trails<00:02:31.940> that<00:02:32.120> we<00:02:32.269> take<00:02:32.530> crossovers

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
same trails that we take crossovers

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.380 
same trails that we take crossovers
which<00:02:33.769> also<00:02:33.950> are<00:02:34.220> all-wheel<00:02:34.640> drive<00:02:34.880> vehicles

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
which also are all-wheel drive vehicles

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.990 
which also are all-wheel drive vehicles
so<00:02:35.769> we're<00:02:36.769> not<00:02:36.950> pushing<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.549> too<00:02:37.760> terribly

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
so we're not pushing it too terribly

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.330 
so we're not pushing it too terribly
hard<00:02:38.420> but<00:02:38.630> just<00:02:38.930> enough<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.530> we<00:02:39.650> can<00:02:39.859> splash<00:02:40.130> up

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
hard but just enough so we can splash up

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.440 
hard but just enough so we can splash up
some<00:02:40.489> mud<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:40.820> make<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.000> wheel<00:02:41.150> slip<00:02:41.329> a

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
some mud and make the wheel slip a

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.390 
some mud and make the wheel slip a
little<00:02:41.540> bit<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:41.930> feel<00:02:42.350> that<00:02:42.620> change<00:02:42.890> so<00:02:43.340> you

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
little bit and feel that change so you

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.690 
little bit and feel that change so you
can<00:02:43.549> make<00:02:43.700> it<00:02:43.820> down<00:02:43.940> that<00:02:44.180> big<00:02:44.510> hill<00:02:44.750> Nathan

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
can make it down that big hill Nathan

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.920 
can make it down that big hill Nathan
yeah<00:02:46.700> sure<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:47.209> can<00:02:47.239> make<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:47.510> down<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.720> hill<00:02:47.810> no

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
yeah sure I can make it down the hill no

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.840 
yeah sure I can make it down the hill no
problem<00:02:48.230> all<00:02:48.440> right<00:02:48.590> let's<00:02:48.799> see<00:02:48.950> up<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.670> hills

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
problem all right let's see up the hills

00:02:49.850 --> 00:03:03.010 
problem all right let's see up the hills
another<00:02:50.090> question

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.890 

hey<00:03:03.740> Nathan<00:03:04.120> when<00:03:05.120> you<00:03:05.210> took<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.480> RAM<00:03:05.660> down

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
hey Nathan when you took the RAM down

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.270 
hey Nathan when you took the RAM down
there<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.260> couldn't<00:03:06.470> make<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:06.770> turn<00:03:07.070> this

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
there you couldn't make that turn this

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.830 
there you couldn't make that turn this
time<00:03:07.430> you<00:03:07.520> made<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.790> turn<00:03:08.000> yeah<00:03:08.480> it's<00:03:08.630> kind<00:03:08.810> of

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
time you made the turn yeah it's kind of

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.570 
time you made the turn yeah it's kind of
funny<00:03:09.080> this<00:03:09.260> thing's<00:03:09.470> actually<00:03:09.740> got<00:03:10.550> a

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
funny this thing's actually got a

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.640 
funny this thing's actually got a
tighter<00:03:10.970> turning<00:03:11.240> radius<00:03:11.420> just<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.380> different

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
tighter turning radius just a different

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.100 
tighter turning radius just a different
truck<00:03:12.860> here's<00:03:13.370> one<00:03:13.580> thing<00:03:13.760> folks<00:03:14.080> when<00:03:15.080> you

truck here's one thing folks when you

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.960 
truck here's one thing folks when you
have<00:03:15.290> all-wheel<00:03:15.590> drive<00:03:15.890> momentum<00:03:16.670> is<00:03:16.820> your

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970

I will prove to you right now Nathan
just<00:03:47.420> likes<00:03:47.629> going<00:03:47.900> fast<00:03:48.110> basically

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.950 

all<00:04:02.660> right<00:04:02.780> Nathan<00:04:02.990> how<00:04:03.410> does<00:04:03.590> it<00:04:03.740> do<00:04:03.890> off-road

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
all right Nathan how does it do off-road

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.750 
all right Nathan how does it do off-road
it's<00:04:05.960> surprisingly<00:04:06.620> good<00:04:06.740> you<00:04:07.340> know<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.610> old

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
it's surprisingly good you know the old

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.520 
it's surprisingly good you know the old
wheel<00:04:07.940> drive<00:04:08.240> system<00:04:08.540> is<00:04:08.930> supposed<00:04:09.200> to<00:04:09.290> kick

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
wheel drive system is supposed to kick

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.740 
wheel drive system is supposed to kick
in<00:04:09.740> once<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.460> rear<00:04:10.670> wheels<00:04:11.000> start<00:04:11.420> to<00:04:11.540> really

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
in once the rear wheels start to really

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.840 
in once the rear wheels start to really
slip<00:04:12.170> and<00:04:12.410> then<00:04:12.500> you<00:04:12.620> get<00:04:12.770> pulled<00:04:13.040> forward<00:04:13.340> so

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
slip and then you get pulled forward so

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.550 
slip and then you get pulled forward so
I'm<00:04:13.910> not<00:04:14.030> feeling<00:04:14.240> a<00:04:14.480> lot<00:04:14.600> of<00:04:14.780> that<00:04:14.930> but<00:04:15.350> you

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
I'm not feeling a lot of that but you

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.190 
I'm not feeling a lot of that but you
know<00:04:15.710> in<00:04:16.519> the<00:04:16.670> deep<00:04:16.850> mud<00:04:16.910> so<00:04:17.330> far<00:04:17.600> it's<00:04:17.780> made<00:04:18.049> it

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
know in the deep mud so far it's made it

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.930 
know in the deep mud so far it's made it
through<00:04:18.940> it<00:04:19.940> feels<00:04:20.330> tighter<00:04:21.109> smaller<00:04:21.940> lighter

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
through it feels tighter smaller lighter

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.690 
through it feels tighter smaller lighter
which<00:04:23.420> I'm<00:04:23.600> not<00:04:23.750> sure<00:04:23.900> it<00:04:24.020> is<00:04:24.170> and<00:04:24.470> lower<00:04:25.220> than

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
which I'm not sure it is and lower than

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.370 
which I'm not sure it is and lower than
the<00:04:25.940> RAM<00:04:26.120> I<00:04:26.390> think<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:26.870> one<00:04:26.990> thing<00:04:27.110> we<00:04:27.260> know

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
the RAM I think the one thing we know

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.720 
the RAM I think the one thing we know
for<00:04:27.530> sure<00:04:27.590> is<00:04:27.740> that<00:04:27.830> it's<00:04:28.130> lower<00:04:28.340> from<00:04:28.640> the

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
for sure is that it's lower from the

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.280 
for sure is that it's lower from the
inside<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.390> ran<00:04:29.570> you<00:04:29.750> feel<00:04:29.930> like<00:04:30.110> you're

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
inside the ran you feel like you're

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.440 
inside the ran you feel like you're
standing<00:04:30.590> on<00:04:30.830> top<00:04:31.010> of<00:04:31.070> a<00:04:31.280> cruise<00:04:31.520> ship<00:04:31.550> in<00:04:31.940> this

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
standing on top of a cruise ship in this

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.930 
standing on top of a cruise ship in this
you're<00:04:32.750> much<00:04:33.050> lower<00:04:33.350> down<00:04:33.680> and<00:04:33.980> frankly<00:04:34.730> it

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
you're much lower down and frankly it

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.250 
you're much lower down and frankly it
feels<00:04:35.210> a<00:04:35.330> little<00:04:35.510> bit<00:04:35.600> more<00:04:35.720> connected<00:04:35.930> to<00:04:36.170> the

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
feels a little bit more connected to the

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.130 
feels a little bit more connected to the
road<00:04:36.410> yeah<00:04:37.370> and<00:04:37.670> you<00:04:38.450> know<00:04:38.540> it<00:04:38.630> does<00:04:38.900> have

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
road yeah and you know it does have

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.690 
road yeah and you know it does have
those<00:04:39.350> running<00:04:39.650> boards<00:04:39.950> which<00:04:40.130> are<00:04:40.310> kind<00:04:40.610> of

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
those running boards which are kind of

kick<00:06:27.730> in<00:06:27.910> and<00:06:28.090> really<00:06:28.360> drag<00:06:28.630> you<00:06:28.780> out<00:06:28.900> of<00:06:29.050> a

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
kick in and really drag you out of a

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.870 
kick in and really drag you out of a
problem<00:06:29.380> you<00:06:30.160> know<00:06:30.280> they<00:06:30.400> say<00:06:30.610> it<00:06:30.670> supposed<00:06:30.850> to

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 
problem you know they say it supposed to

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.910 
problem you know they say it supposed to
be<00:06:30.940> millisecond<00:06:31.570> from<00:06:31.750> when<00:06:31.960> the<00:06:32.440> rear<00:06:32.650> wheels

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:32.920 
be millisecond from when the rear wheels

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.470 
be millisecond from when the rear wheels
start<00:06:33.190> to<00:06:33.280> slip<00:06:33.430> to<00:06:33.640> when<00:06:33.820> it<00:06:33.940> appropriate<00:06:34.450> to

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:34.480 
start to slip to when it appropriate to

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.940 
start to slip to when it appropriate to
power<00:06:34.690> to<00:06:34.870> the<00:06:34.960> front<00:06:35.200> but<00:06:35.410> it<00:06:35.500> feels<00:06:35.710> a<00:06:35.830> lot

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950 
power to the front but it feels a lot

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.590 
power to the front but it feels a lot
longer<00:06:36.130> than<00:06:36.310> it<00:06:36.580> is<00:06:36.730> a<00:06:36.760> lot<00:06:37.060> longer<00:06:37.210> part<00:06:37.570> of

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 
longer than it is a lot longer part of

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.970 
longer than it is a lot longer part of
the<00:06:37.720> reason<00:06:37.990> why<00:06:38.110> is<00:06:38.170> because<00:06:38.320> there's<00:06:38.770> a<00:06:38.860> few

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:38.980 
the reason why is because there's a few

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.170 
the reason why is because there's a few
things<00:06:39.220> that<00:06:39.280> have<00:06:39.460> to<00:06:39.580> build<00:06:39.790> up<00:06:39.940> and<00:06:40.090> create

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
things that have to build up and create

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.630 
things that have to build up and create
momentum<00:06:40.840> in<00:06:40.960> your<00:06:41.050> front<00:06:41.320> end<00:06:41.410> so<00:06:41.800> I<00:06:42.040> would

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640 
momentum in your front end so I would

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.740 
momentum in your front end so I would
highly<00:06:42.940> recommend<00:06:43.330> if<00:06:43.390> you're<00:06:43.480> going<00:06:43.510> to<00:06:43.660> go
