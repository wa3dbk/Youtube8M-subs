 Brazil 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.800
 but how will that content be? 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.869
 produced and arrive there on your small screen the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.390
 The cube program came to a

 tv and will show you now what happens 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.130
 here is behind the cameras 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.930
 to start the number of people 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.020
 involved to make a single program 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.040
 can reach 50 professionals of the 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.719
 different lighting production areas 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.600
 edition edition and also has the 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.670
 reporters and technicians who 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.860
 can be in greater or lesser numbers of 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.909
 according to the program format 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.800
 Who's on the other side of the screen? 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.690
 accompanying is sitting there in a 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.390
 An armchair chair is looking pro 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.630
 television but can not imagine from behind 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.800
 how complex is the work of 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.429
 production is sometimes for 11 a 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.280
 a small insert is 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:33.690
 of 30 seconds of 15 seconds that is 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.690
 that gives a job 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.560
 not to mention that the final product has a 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.470
 beginning long before it becomes 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.380
 reality with the idealization of the program 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.899
 This time it's worth being creative. 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.390
 have great ideas on how to set up a 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.640
 new content that will appeal to 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.420
 viewer what the program needs 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.880
 Tue 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.939
 what kind of audience do you want to reach 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.500
 It will be your language and setting these and 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.930
 other questions need to be 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.000
 answered even before work 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.640
 be distributed to the 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.950
 responsible for making the idealization 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.000
 become reality from the moment you 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.220
 we have a demand that comes from the 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.120
 tv programming industry 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.480
 then we immediately absorb 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.680
 This and we start from life is an act in a 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.810
 project is done all wrong a study is not 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.549
 also searches for what to know if 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.019
 that project is going to work 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.500
 from the moment you arrive here at 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:39.370
 in the departments of 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.799
 production sector is we have already gone 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.680
 work on and can understand 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.079
 production as synonymous with a lot of work 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.750
 run back take some have not seen 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.850
 battle for the ins of the chair where the 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.620
 presenter is seated at the 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.540
 guests of a talk show 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.549
 for the ingredients they need 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.989
 be available when recording the 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.030
 cooking table 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.930
 everything is thought and achieved by 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.480
 producers 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.580
 Your routine includes hours on the phone. 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.720
 searching for time objects and 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.090
 right people 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.040
 until every detail is in place 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.980
 so that the participants of the 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.900
 program can come and record and that's 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.140
 that came on the scene other professionals 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.510
 those who left the camera perfect light 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.379
 in the right focus and the audio at the exact point 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.109
 to finally be able to say here for example 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:32.329
 It's for this recording. 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.410
 within that environment that my room 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.109
 of direction 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.780
 We need a lot of things. 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:41.450
 You get here and turn on the light and adjust 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.569
 here and there and I have to hold something 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.599
 safe then is this is interesting 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:50.510
 from there a sequence of steps 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.790
 techniques are made until the 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.370
 result of what is being recorded 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.950
 turn a program for we have a signal 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.130
 in the home of the viewer the whole process 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.780
 here in natv appeared starts with the 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.880
 image capture inside the studio 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.530
 through the cameras we are 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.579
 using it in a given 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.470
 this signal will be cut off in the 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.329
 our twitter by a professional who 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.729
 doing this TV direction in the 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.849
 and made available to our 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:22.490
 master who in turn will put this 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:25.020
 for our transmitters will 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.599
 climb to the satellite 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.729
 and all this considering that the program 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:31.650
 is recorded only in the studio but are 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.289
 many who need capturing 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.599
 external images interviews links to 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.550
 live and office that text that you 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.900
 listening now and accompanying the 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.150
 images of matter 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.610
 after recording all this goes to the 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.000
 edition island where the raw material is 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.729
 edited and transformed into content 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.800
 finalized ready to be displayed 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:56.930
 It's a very big job so we 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.460
 has a constant challenge is to create 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.599
 development and for this the 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.860
 professionals have to be very good is 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:07.169
 there must be a lot of dedication to 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.380
 creativity and especially to make 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:27.900
 television as we have done here 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:30.630
 each each period passes for fifa 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.370

 of making off in this matter 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.500
 you can see in our fan page
