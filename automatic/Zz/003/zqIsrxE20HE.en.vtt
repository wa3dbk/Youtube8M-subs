case in my opinion the cable seems to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.319 
case in my opinion the cable seems to
get<00:01:27.390> tangled<00:01:27.900> more<00:01:28.320> often<00:01:28.710> than<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.220> does<00:01:29.820> with

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
get tangled more often than it does with

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.810 
get tangled more often than it does with
a<00:01:30.390> rubber<00:01:30.750> or<00:01:31.020> plastic<00:01:31.049> cable<00:01:31.740> however<00:01:32.280> this

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
a rubber or plastic cable however this

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.149
