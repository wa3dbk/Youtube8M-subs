it's<00:00:49.590> really<00:00:49.739> cool<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.219> did<00:00:50.579> actually<00:00:50.730> make<00:00:51.030> a

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
it's really cool I did actually make a

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.970 
it's really cool I did actually make a
video<00:00:51.270> where<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.510> said<00:00:51.750> if<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.199> if<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.800> play

this<00:00:53.010> game<00:00:53.309> mode<00:00:53.520> you're<00:00:54.059> more<00:00:54.239> likely<00:00:54.420> to

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
this game mode you're more likely to

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.270 
this game mode you're more likely to
rank<00:00:54.809> up<00:00:54.960> faster<00:00:55.410> than<00:00:55.440> probably<00:00:56.070> any<00:00:56.219> other

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
rank up faster than probably any other

yet product mr. fail I probably should

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.969 
yet product mr. fail I probably should
have<00:01:26.520> saved<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.939> on<00:01:27.030> until<00:01:27.330> later<00:01:28.259> because<00:01:28.470> I

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
have saved it on until later because I

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.469 
have saved it on until later because I
didn't<00:01:29.310> need<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.729> first<00:01:29.909> place<00:01:30.030> but

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
didn't need it in the first place but

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.420 
didn't need it in the first place but
you<00:01:30.630> know<00:01:30.750> if<00:01:31.049> you're<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:32.159> you're<00:01:32.250> building

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
you know if you're if you're building

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.190 
you know if you're if you're building
towards<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.790> high<00:01:32.939> chemistry<00:01:33.390> go<00:01:33.540> look<00:01:34.049> I'd

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
towards a high chemistry go look I'd

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.480 
towards a high chemistry go look I'd
always<00:01:34.380> advise<00:01:34.770> unless<00:01:35.159> you're<00:01:35.310> really

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
always advise unless you're really

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.859 
always advise unless you're really
really<00:01:35.759> confident<00:01:36.180> about<00:01:36.299> team<00:01:36.689> you're

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
really confident about team you're

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.710 
really confident about team you're
playing<00:01:36.900> I'd<00:01:37.770> always<00:01:38.009> advise<00:01:38.880> using<00:01:39.479> your

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
playing I'd always advise using your

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.200 
playing I'd always advise using your
killstreaks<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.979> go<00:01:41.189> towards<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.729> next<00:01:42.060> one

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
killstreaks to go towards the next one

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.090 
killstreaks to go towards the next one
instead<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.350> know<00:01:43.409> trying<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.799> think<00:01:43.950> that

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
instead of you know trying to think that

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.050 
instead of you know trying to think that
you<00:01:44.159> can<00:01:44.280> get<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.490> with<00:01:44.520> your<00:01:44.670> gun<00:01:44.820> because

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
you can get it with your gun because

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.940 
you can get it with your gun because
it's<00:01:45.240> always<00:01:45.420> safer<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.140> know<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.380> risk

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
it's always safer and you know the risk

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.249 
it's always safer and you know the risk
ratio<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.329> don't<00:01:48.360> use<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.079> die

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
ratio is if you don't use it and you die

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.050 
ratio is if you don't use it and you die
then<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.710> know<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.009> lost<00:01:50.130> your<00:01:50.579> upper<00:01:50.880> kill

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
then you know you lost your upper kill

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.630 
then you know you lost your upper kill
streaks<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.479> if<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.409> don't<00:01:52.680> use<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:52.950> then

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
streaks and if you don't use it then

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.920 
streaks and if you don't use it then
there<00:01:53.970> you're<00:01:54.119> still<00:01:54.360> going<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.540> get<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.750> kill

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
there you're still going to get a kill

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.090 
there you're still going to get a kill
with<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.170> later<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.680> it's<00:01:55.829> not<00:01:55.920> really

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
with it later on and it's not really

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.230 
with it later on and it's not really
going<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.250> make<00:01:56.399> much<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.759> difference<00:01:57.030> so

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
going to make much of a difference so

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.450 
going to make much of a difference so
yeah<00:01:57.899> unless<00:01:58.170> there's<00:01:58.439> some<00:01:58.530> advanced<00:01:58.829> UAV<00:01:59.009> or

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
yeah unless there's some advanced UAV or

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.010 
yeah unless there's some advanced UAV or
something<00:01:59.729> like<00:01:59.820> that<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.659> game<00:02:00.719> it

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
something like that but in this game it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.120 
something like that but in this game it
doesn't<00:02:01.110> work<00:02:01.380> quite<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> same<00:02:01.860> way<00:02:02.009> because

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
doesn't work quite the same way because

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.069 
doesn't work quite the same way because
that's<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.460> support<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.570> don't<00:02:03.750> guy<00:02:03.869> when

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
that's on support and you don't guy when

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.380 
that's on support and you don't guy when
you<00:02:04.200> lose<00:02:04.409> your<00:02:04.560> streak<00:02:05.130> anyway<00:02:05.399> be<00:02:06.119> still

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
you lose your streak anyway be still

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.270 
you lose your streak anyway be still
playing<00:02:06.630> black<00:02:06.780> ops<00:02:06.930> pro<00:02:07.259> tip<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.799> never<00:02:08.039> really

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
playing black ops pro tip I never really

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.559 
playing black ops pro tip I never really
mentioned<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:08.729> but<00:02:08.940> calling<00:02:09.270> your<00:02:09.390> black

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
mentioned this but calling your black

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.820 
mentioned this but calling your black
bird<00:02:09.720> after<00:02:09.959> your<00:02:10.200> streak<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.679> really

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
bird after your streak and it really

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.740 
bird after your streak and it really
helps<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.099> build<00:02:11.250> up<00:02:11.340> your<00:02:11.400> next<00:02:11.700> one<00:02:11.849> but

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
helps you build up your next one but

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.650 
helps you build up your next one but
I<00:02:12.780> was<00:02:12.900> gonna<00:02:13.020> be<00:02:13.140> playing<00:02:13.350> black<00:02:13.530> ops<00:02:13.650> I<00:02:13.800> doubt

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
I was gonna be playing black ops I doubt

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.200 
I was gonna be playing black ops I doubt
maybe<00:02:15.660> who<00:02:16.140> knows<00:02:16.490> we<00:02:17.490> might<00:02:17.610> even<00:02:17.760> find<00:02:18.030> that

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
maybe who knows we might even find that

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.820 
maybe who knows we might even find that
a<00:02:18.240> really<00:02:18.720> retarded<00:02:18.900> set<00:02:19.320> up<00:02:19.410> in<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:19.650> game

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
a really retarded set up in this game

ever on a rage quit and go back to black
ops<00:02:21.510> not<00:02:21.720> likely<00:02:22.170> but<00:02:22.380> it's<00:02:22.710> it's<00:02:23.250> plausible

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
ops not likely but it's it's plausible

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.580 
ops not likely but it's it's plausible
it's<00:02:24.510> plausible<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:25.050> mean<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.230> lot<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.500> people

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
it's plausible I mean a lot of people

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.050 
it's plausible I mean a lot of people
went<00:02:25.830> back<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.100> modern<00:02:26.280> warfare<00:02:26.400> 2<00:02:26.670> when<00:02:26.880> black

went back to modern warfare 2 when black

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.490 
went back to modern warfare 2 when black
ops<00:02:27.180> came<00:02:27.450> out<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.630> myself<00:02:28.020> didn't<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.440> just

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
ops came out I myself didn't I just

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.770 
ops came out I myself didn't I just
stopped<00:02:28.830> playing<00:02:29.070> called<00:02:29.280> in<00:02:29.550> general<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.090> i

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
stopped playing called in general and i

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.520 
stopped playing called in general and i
have<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.110> say<00:02:31.320> i<00:02:31.350> got<00:02:31.860> my<00:02:32.040> i<00:02:33.020> don't<00:02:34.020> want<00:02:34.470> to

have to say i got my i don't want to

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.650 
have to say i got my i don't want to
call<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.680> scale<00:02:35.100> back<00:02:35.310> because<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:36.150> can't

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
call it scale back because you can't

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.780 
call it scale back because you can't
really<00:02:36.870> lose<00:02:37.260> skill<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.680> was<00:02:37.770> more<00:02:38.010> like<00:02:38.580> the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
really lose skill it was more like the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.270 
really lose skill it was more like the
aim<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.000> because<00:02:39.630> using<00:02:39.870> joysticks<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.680> think<00:02:41.190> I

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
aim of because using joysticks I think I

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.310 
aim of because using joysticks I think I
mentioned<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.640> in<00:02:41.730> another<00:02:41.910> video<00:02:42.209> is<00:02:42.540> quite

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
mentioned this in another video is quite

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.660 
mentioned this in another video is quite
hard<00:02:43.500> compared<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:45.410> compared<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:47.010> damn<00:02:47.489> it<00:02:47.610> I

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
hard compared to compared and damn it I

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.940 
hard compared to compared and damn it I
dive<00:02:47.880> right<00:02:48.090> there<00:02:48.270> I<00:02:48.410> thought<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.800> know

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
dive right there I thought that you know

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
ac-130 is that good I don't think air

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.490 
ac-130 is that good I don't think air
support<00:04:20.760> is<00:04:20.789> that<00:04:20.940> good<00:04:21.120> as<00:04:21.599> I<00:04:21.750> say<00:04:21.959> when<00:04:22.140> Karen

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
support is that good as I say when Karen

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.730 
support is that good as I say when Karen
gets<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.710> triple<00:04:23.070> with<00:04:23.190> his<00:04:23.750> i<00:04:24.750> forgot<00:04:25.680> that

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
gets a triple with his i forgot that

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.600 
gets a triple with his i forgot that
school<00:04:25.979> i<00:04:26.010> think<00:04:26.250> it's

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
school i think it's

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.969 
school i think it's
Reef<00:04:26.729> stray<00:04:27.449> strike<00:04:27.840> or<00:04:28.169> stray<00:04:28.530> something

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
Reef stray strike or stray something

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.980 
Reef stray strike or stray something
it's<00:04:29.099> is<00:04:29.969> something<00:04:30.449> like<00:04:30.539> that<00:04:30.719> it's<00:04:30.870> I

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
it's is something like that it's I

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.709 
it's is something like that it's I
definitely<00:04:31.349> know<00:04:31.590> it's<00:04:31.740> called<00:04:32.009> strafe<00:04:32.719> in

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:33.719 
definitely know it's called strafe in

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:35.119 
definitely know it's called strafe in
the<00:04:33.840> beginning<00:04:34.169> but<00:04:34.199> I'm<00:04:34.469> not<00:04:34.770> sure<00:04:34.800> it<00:04:35.039> might

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:35.129 
the beginning but I'm not sure it might

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:36.589 
the beginning but I'm not sure it might
be<00:04:35.310> distressed<00:04:35.729> strike<00:04:36.030> helicopter

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599

something<00:04:36.900> simple<00:04:37.169> but<00:04:37.199> it's<00:04:37.680> pretty<00:04:37.889> cool<00:04:38.009> to

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
something simple but it's pretty cool to

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.320 
something simple but it's pretty cool to
kill<00:04:38.280> streak<00:04:38.490> on<00:04:38.639> a<00:04:38.669> map<00:04:38.849> like<00:04:39.000> this<00:04:39.060> or

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.959 
village but other than that most of the
maps<00:04:41.009> aren't<00:04:41.219> really<00:04:41.460> built<00:04:41.639> for<00:04:41.699> kills

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:41.969

because<00:04:48.840> um<00:04:49.259> i<00:04:49.789> think<00:04:50.789> i<00:04:51.030> get<00:04:51.180> this<00:04:51.270> guy<00:04:51.449> yeah

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:51.629 
because um i think i get this guy yeah

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:53.209 
because um i think i get this guy yeah
and<00:04:51.870> I<00:04:51.930> actually<00:04:52.289> almost<00:04:52.530> get<00:04:52.740> enough<00:04:52.919> racing

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:53.219 
and I actually almost get enough racing

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:55.369 
and I actually almost get enough racing
with<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.490> I<00:04:53.759> was<00:04:54.360> kind<00:04:54.539> of<00:04:54.659> hanging<00:04:54.840> around<00:04:55.169> here

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:55.379 
with a I was kind of hanging around here

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:56.510 
with a I was kind of hanging around here
because<00:04:55.650> they're<00:04:55.770> spawning<00:04:55.949> over<00:04:56.189> there<00:04:56.370> and

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
because they're spawning over there and

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.980 
because they're spawning over there and
that<00:04:56.610> is<00:04:56.699> another<00:04:56.909> pro<00:04:57.150> tip<00:04:57.389> if<00:04:57.569> you<00:04:57.810> don't

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
that is another pro tip if you don't

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.330 
that is another pro tip if you don't
know<00:04:58.050> where<00:04:58.169> they're<00:04:58.289> spawning<00:04:58.530> chill<00:04:59.189> in<00:04:59.310> the

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
know where they're spawning chill in the

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.619 
know where they're spawning chill in the
middle<00:04:59.669> and<00:04:59.849> see<00:05:00.150> where<00:05:00.300> they<00:05:00.389> come<00:05:00.599> from

00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:00.629 
middle and see where they come from

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:02.689 
middle and see where they come from
because<00:05:01.050> that's<00:05:01.590> the<00:05:01.680> safest<00:05:02.009> point<00:05:02.310> to<00:05:02.430> be<00:05:02.580> at

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
because that's the safest point to be at

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.749 
because that's the safest point to be at
especially<00:05:03.689> usual<00:05:04.590> where<00:05:04.919> your<00:05:05.159> teammates<00:05:05.340> to

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
especially usual where your teammates to

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.850 
especially usual where your teammates to
your<00:05:05.879> advantage<00:05:06.120> because<00:05:06.449> if<00:05:07.259> you<00:05:07.469> see<00:05:07.680> right

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
your advantage because if you see right

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.350 
your advantage because if you see right
now<00:05:07.889> they're<00:05:08.189> all<00:05:08.219> over<00:05:08.460> there<00:05:08.669> then<00:05:08.939> it's

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
now they're all over there then it's

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.749 
now they're all over there then it's
