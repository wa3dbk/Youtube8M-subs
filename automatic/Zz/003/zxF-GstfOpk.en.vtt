00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.150
 good your fears to a new good video 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.560
 new rumors about fallout 4 already 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.330
 long time we did not talk about fire 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.240
 4 although he is one of the most games 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.370
 really expected to be announced and 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.710
 there are many others in the list logically 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.050
 but this one is also one of them 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.580
 logically and obviously and good 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.580
 basically we all hope that it 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.109
 advertise in this 3 of 2015 bethesda 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.580
 will have its own conference and as already 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.769
 you know with what then it is expected that 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.930
 be a very important motorcycle of 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.970
 fallout 4 today seems to be that good 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.670
 several without shaders of the industry 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.109
 they have been talked about so what 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.239
 good that they are going to preserve present 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:40.249
 almost certainly the game and 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.960
 besides, it seems that good too 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:43.969
 it is rumored several several 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.499
 details of the game that I really do not 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.049
 I know if it will be true or it will be a lie 

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:49.280
 really because you already know this this 

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:51.049
 kind of rumors that you do not know very well 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.699
 Where then they come often end 

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:55.390
 mistaking other times by hitting 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.489
 but many others 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.739
 and supposedly wrong the game 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.230
 only they would leave prisoners are 4 xbox van 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.110
 ipc is not farfetched to think about 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.729
 this way surely that happens 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.190
 supposedly in the city then 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.990
 apocalyptic serious or new york or 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.270
 chicago this interferes a bit with 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.090
 all pretty solid rumors that 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.460
 they had about how good the game was 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.830
 will increase in boston and others in a 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.680
 boston post apocalyptic was already talking 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.229
 a lot about it with which I do not know 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.850
 what's going to happen in that sense I do not know if 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.300
 she goes to the end the lame new york and chicago 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.580
 or what is going to happen also what 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.700
 good that is telling you quite high 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.740
 in lamp 4 that link a very game 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.110
 well that 's that is clear, that's right 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.130
 silly to say but what good 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.679
 basically they are putting 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.330
 enough expectations in the game what 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.920
 which would be pretty good, let's see 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.300
 is to keep conserving all this I 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.850
 really what I want to see is a game 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.250
 good and that especially since it is announced 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.750
 is not announced this year supposedly 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.140
 another source because it is internalized and has also 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.020
 said that good would come in spring 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.550
 2016 with which we do not have a 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.130
 departure for this year and I did not 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.420
 but under the announcement yes that but for 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.880
 the strange but at the game's exit 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.890
 then quite so good has been 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.780
 that little things to see fallout 4 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.790
 see when they are confirming or saying 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.110
 some more than those that arrive like this 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.380
 we go in the next video until the 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.380
 next
