00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
things where you I did a lot of those

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.450 
things where you I did a lot of those
but<00:00:19.529> it's<00:00:19.619> really<00:00:19.740> distracting<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.279> see

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
but it's really distracting to see

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.490

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
like first looks like you just draw some

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.949 
like first looks like you just draw some
cards<00:02:44.310> say<00:02:45.060> okay<00:02:45.269> these<00:02:45.360> are<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.540> cards<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.840> got

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
cards say okay these are the cards I got

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.270 
cards say okay these are the cards I got
I'll<00:02:46.140> play<00:02:46.380> them<00:02:46.470> we'll<00:02:46.620> see<00:02:46.769> what<00:02:46.950> happens

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
I'll play them we'll see what happens

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.710 
I'll play them we'll see what happens
and<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.519> almost<00:02:47.670> feels<00:02:47.880> kind<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.120> like<00:02:48.239> luck

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
and it almost feels kind of like luck

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.690 
and it almost feels kind of like luck
who<00:02:49.019> won<00:02:49.260> but<00:02:49.950> that's<00:02:50.160> definitely<00:02:50.280> not<00:02:50.519> the

they're<00:04:28.259> worth<00:04:28.379> points<00:04:28.710> at<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.919> end

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
they're worth points at the end

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.830 
they're worth points at the end
another<00:04:29.580> thing<00:04:29.759> interesting<00:04:30.030> too<00:04:30.210> um<00:04:30.750> you

know Jen you know right now she's kind
of<00:04:32.909> in<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.060> hoarding<00:04:33.330> mode<00:04:33.479> coming<00:04:33.930> it<00:04:34.020> goes<00:04:34.379> one

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
of in a hoarding mode coming it goes one

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.010 
of in a hoarding mode coming it goes one
two<00:04:34.680> three<00:04:35.189> four<00:04:35.430> five<00:04:36.090> six<00:04:36.449> seven<00:04:36.870> eight<00:04:36.930> nine

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
two three four five six seven eight nine

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.350 
two three four five six seven eight nine
ten<00:04:37.379> eleven<00:04:37.680> twelve<00:04:37.770> thirteen<00:04:38.120> thirteen

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
ten eleven twelve thirteen thirteen

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.450 
ten eleven twelve thirteen thirteen
now<00:04:40.110> it's<00:04:40.259> worth<00:04:40.530> half<00:04:40.770> points<00:04:41.129> you<00:04:41.370> would

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
now it's worth half points you would

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.790 
now it's worth half points you would
think<00:04:41.669> that<00:04:41.969> means<00:04:42.330> she<00:04:42.930> gets<00:04:43.169> six<00:04:43.469> points<00:04:43.710> at

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
think that means she gets six points at

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.369 
think that means she gets six points at
the<00:04:43.860> end<00:04:44.009> no<00:04:44.310> she<00:04:44.370> gets<00:04:44.669> seven<00:04:44.969> the<00:04:45.509> the<00:04:46.139> point

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:46.379 
the end no she gets seven the the point

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:47.689 
the end no she gets seven the the point
you<00:04:46.500> get<00:04:46.590> for<00:04:46.770> hoarding<00:04:46.949> your<00:04:47.099> resources<00:04:47.460> is

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
you get for hoarding your resources is

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.409 
you get for hoarding your resources is
rounded<00:04:48.240> up<00:04:48.389> the<00:04:48.719> points<00:04:49.680> you<00:04:49.800> get<00:04:50.419> for

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
rounded up the points you get for

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:52.879 
rounded up the points you get for
everything<00:04:51.900> else<00:04:51.990> though<00:04:52.199> is<00:04:52.319> rounded<00:04:52.710> down

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
everything else though is rounded down

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:54.469 
everything else though is rounded down
and<00:04:53.219> that<00:04:53.310> makes<00:04:53.490> hoarding<00:04:53.909> a<00:04:54.030> little<00:04:54.360> bit

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
and that makes hoarding a little bit

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.029 
and that makes hoarding a little bit
more<00:04:54.599> value<00:04:54.930> than<00:04:54.960> it<00:04:55.199> valuable<00:04:55.680> than<00:04:55.919> it

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
more value than it valuable than it

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.679 
more value than it valuable than it
normally<00:04:56.129> is<00:04:56.460> so<00:04:57.240> that's<00:04:57.479> actually

00:04:57.679 --> 00:04:57.689 
normally is so that's actually

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:59.990 
normally is so that's actually
interesting<00:04:58.110> thing<00:04:58.289> too<00:04:58.500> that<00:04:59.190> you<00:04:59.430> know<00:04:59.490> the

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
interesting thing too that you know the

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.180 
interesting thing too that you know the
three<00:05:00.389> main<00:05:00.569> points<00:05:00.930> on<00:05:01.050> hoarding<00:05:01.590> stuff<00:05:01.770> to

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
three main points on hoarding stuff to

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.740 
three main points on hoarding stuff to
trade<00:05:02.550> for<00:05:02.789> points<00:05:03.030> at<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.180> end<00:05:03.300> and<00:05:03.449> rounding

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
trade for points at the end and rounding

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.390 
trade for points at the end and rounding
up<00:05:03.900> getting<00:05:04.560> majority<00:05:04.919> on<00:05:05.009> the<00:05:05.099> board<00:05:05.280> which

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
up getting majority on the board which

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.920 
up getting majority on the board which
is<00:05:05.490> very<00:05:05.729> very<00:05:05.940> powerful<00:05:06.120> if<00:05:06.449> you<00:05:06.539> play<00:05:06.780> it

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
is very very powerful if you play it

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.100 
is very very powerful if you play it
right<00:05:07.110> or<00:05:07.500> just<00:05:08.009> getting<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.310> lot<00:05:08.430> of<00:05:08.490> buildings

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
right or just getting a lot of buildings

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.360 
right or just getting a lot of buildings
which<00:05:10.110> I<00:05:10.259> mean<00:05:10.409> you<00:05:10.560> can<00:05:10.740> get<00:05:10.889> up<00:05:11.039> to<00:05:11.129> seven

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
which I mean you can get up to seven

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.890 
which I mean you can get up to seven
buildings<00:05:11.669> if<00:05:12.030> you<00:05:12.150> get<00:05:12.300> all<00:05:12.479> those<00:05:12.629> buildings

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
buildings if you get all those buildings

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.260 
buildings if you get all those buildings
up<00:05:13.259> to<00:05:13.379> like<00:05:13.500> levels<00:05:13.860> two<00:05:14.069> three<00:05:14.370> and<00:05:14.490> four<00:05:14.729> by

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
up to like levels two three and four by

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.909 
up to like levels two three and four by
really<00:05:15.810> focusing<00:05:16.169> on<00:05:16.229> buildings<00:05:16.650> more<00:05:16.800> than

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
really focusing on buildings more than

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.350 
really focusing on buildings more than
anything<00:05:17.069> else<00:05:17.310> there's<00:05:17.759> a<00:05:17.819> ton<00:05:18.029> of<00:05:18.060> points<00:05:18.210> to

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
anything else there's a ton of points to

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.360 
anything else there's a ton of points to
be<00:05:18.419> scored<00:05:18.449> there<00:05:18.779> too<00:05:18.960> so<00:05:19.409> there's<00:05:19.590> all<00:05:19.830> valid

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
be scored there too so there's all valid

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.830 
be scored there too so there's all valid
ways<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.729> go<00:05:20.819> although<00:05:21.000> really<00:05:21.240> winning<00:05:21.539> means

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
ways to go although really winning means

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.640 
ways to go although really winning means
a<00:05:21.930> combination<00:05:22.169> of<00:05:22.560> at<00:05:22.680> least<00:05:22.830> two<00:05:23.190> ways<00:05:23.430> and

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
a combination of at least two ways and

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.409 
a combination of at least two ways and
that's<00:05:25.650> it<00:05:25.919> that's<00:05:26.099> Rialto<00:05:26.729> and<00:05:26.969> that's<00:05:27.150> our

that's it that's Rialto and that's our

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.269 
that's it that's Rialto and that's our
