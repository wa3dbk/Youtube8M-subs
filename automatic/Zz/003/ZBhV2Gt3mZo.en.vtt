00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
that and put it in the background so it

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.950

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
break the experience so we created a

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.080 
break the experience so we created a
hint<00:05:32.530> system<00:05:32.650> integrated<00:05:33.370> directly<00:05:33.460> into<00:05:33.970> the
