 if not the first time along the track 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.579
 I thought quite well yes guys in principle 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.399
 pretty easy really when 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.729
 you fly to survive without creativity there 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:04.780
 should super and attempts I get already 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:07.510
 I tried 5 when I was able to guess 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.000
 squares so we drove on here 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.250

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.270

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.590
 here it is necessary to be shorter in a push and here 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.180
 such trap bindings are probably worth it 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.560

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:39.269

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:21.579
 the story is similar to that story when 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.310
 shot short stories of that story are very similar and 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:27.280
 Rooms come as the next arena of what 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.820
 we will have already rushed but I do not taste 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.609
 she ran to the other side so you can hunger 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.150

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:39.480

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.870
 refrigerator van towns to love 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:21.509
 the bowl is just with us like that for some reason 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:23.680
 a table so very long 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:26.639
 because when you fly as if you do not 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.060
 you notice she is very very fast that's all 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:33.759
 as if to jump a plot 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.460
 it will turn out that well damn well 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.889
 it's hard to set up a mouse like that 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.750
 to understand how I want to watch 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:45.550

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:31.370
 here from this descended all without 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.690
 creative we went through again 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:38.710
 without creativity it's great for a long time 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.270
 for a long time without creativity passed now 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.770
