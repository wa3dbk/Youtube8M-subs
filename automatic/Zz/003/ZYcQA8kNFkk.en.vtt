00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.230 
to get a little bit of a better

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.260 
to get a little bit of a better
thickness<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.430> way<00:01:05.670> doesn't<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:06.090> run

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
thickness so that way doesn't just run

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.930 
thickness so that way doesn't just run
off<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.480> fish<00:01:06.810> when<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.170> put<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.620> so<00:01:08.340> olive

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
off the fish when you put it on so olive

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.130 
off the fish when you put it on so olive
oil<00:01:09.090> helps<00:01:09.300> to<00:01:09.450> stay<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.840> there<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> little

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
oil helps to stay on there a little

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.370 
oil helps to stay on there a little
better<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:11.210> hopefully<00:01:12.210> I'll<00:01:12.810> get<00:01:13.020> some<00:01:13.200> good

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380

on both sides right now this is some of

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.229 
on both sides right now this is some of
the<00:03:04.890> ones<00:03:05.099> that<00:03:05.220> I've<00:03:05.430> already<00:03:05.549> flipped<00:03:06.090> all
