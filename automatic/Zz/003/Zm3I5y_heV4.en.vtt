 Well, it's like a tradition and there too 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.190
 there are little skating jokes 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.580
 all up 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.620
 what many do 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.470

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.470
 paladin 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:58.130

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.350
 here I was about fifteen Hilo 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:08.160

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:37.470
 Well, as I am now a little guide, I have long been 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.890
 was going to make a guide on the paladin retry 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.680
 and one of my favorite classes today 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.810
 i will demonstrate it fully now 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.980
 we will start with a duel 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.900
 let's score 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.410
 robber quite aggressive 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.760
 rival since having strong boost and 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.940
 good damage unnatural 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.130
 that's just not a lot of country and boosts boiling 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.860
 magicians 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.320
 but now I will demonstrate that paladin 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.140
 able to win even such a spade of adam 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.820
 most likely will now be immediately 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.600
 overboard 100 since enough 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:16.510
