00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
I would recommend this one because it's

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.990 
I would recommend this one because it's
tighter<00:00:54.379> on<00:00:54.620> your<00:00:54.800> head<00:00:55.010> and<00:00:55.309> if<00:00:55.730> you<00:00:55.850> have<00:00:55.969> a

figurehead<00:00:56.329> like<00:00:56.690> me<00:00:56.960> it<00:00:57.260> might<00:00:57.800> be<00:00:58.039> a<00:00:58.070> little

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
figurehead like me it might be a little

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.760 
figurehead like me it might be a little
tight<00:00:59.270> and<00:00:59.570> give<00:00:59.719> you<00:00:59.870> headaches<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:00.530> this

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
bigger headed people because it's loser

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
black headband which is probably my

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.350

favorite so far of all of these and this

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.949 
favorite so far of all of these and this
is<00:02:02.569> their<00:02:02.810> new<00:02:03.170> technology<00:02:04.009> which<00:02:04.690> blocks<00:02:05.690> out

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
is their new technology which blocks out

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.960 
is their new technology which blocks out
the<00:02:05.989> heat<00:02:06.470> of<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:06.649> Sun<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.280> makes<00:02:07.550> you<00:02:07.729> feel

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
the heat of the Sun and makes you feel

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.900 
the heat of the Sun and makes you feel
cooler<00:02:08.330> it<00:02:08.750> like<00:02:09.679> reflects<00:02:10.099> it<00:02:10.340> it's<00:02:10.610> this

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
cooler it like reflects it it's this

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.900 
cooler it like reflects it it's this
like<00:02:11.209> technology<00:02:11.780> anyways<00:02:12.560> these<00:02:13.250> are<00:02:13.640> so

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
like technology anyways these are so

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.400 
like technology anyways these are so
comfortable<00:02:14.180> but<00:02:14.989> I<00:02:15.020> would<00:02:15.230> definitely

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
comfortable but I would definitely

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.290 
comfortable but I would definitely
recommend<00:02:15.680> them<00:02:16.310> for<00:02:16.340> like<00:02:16.640> wearing<00:02:17.180> your

recommend them for like wearing your

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.380 
recommend them for like wearing your
hair<00:02:17.510> down<00:02:17.780> with<00:02:18.110> not<00:02:19.040> for<00:02:19.370> sports<00:02:19.730> but<00:02:20.300> I'm

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
hair down with not for sports but I'm

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.210 
hair down with not for sports but I'm
sure<00:02:20.570> you<00:02:20.690> could<00:02:20.810> run<00:02:21.020> them<00:02:21.140> for<00:02:21.350> sports<00:02:21.620> too<00:02:21.980> I

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.130 
sure you could run them for sports too I
would<00:02:22.760> just<00:02:22.940> recommend<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.480> other<00:02:23.630> ones

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
would just recommend the other ones

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.620 
would just recommend the other ones
or<00:02:24.260> for<00:02:24.860> doing<00:02:25.100> sports<00:02:25.430> with<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:25.910> this<00:02:26.330> comes

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
or for doing sports with and this comes

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.170

in<00:02:26.870> light<00:02:28.330> purple<00:02:29.440> in<00:02:30.440> grain<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:31.670> really

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
in light purple in grain and I really

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.290 
in light purple in grain and I really
love<00:02:32.420> these<00:02:32.569> vibrant<00:02:33.290> colors<00:02:33.770> and<00:02:34.100> I<00:02:35.000> really

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
love these vibrant colors and I really

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.559 
love these vibrant colors and I really
think<00:02:35.450> it's<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:35.720> great<00:02:35.870> design<00:02:36.319> and<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:36.800> has<00:02:37.569> not

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
think it's a great design and it has not

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.240 
think it's a great design and it has not
a<00:02:38.630> lot<00:02:38.900> of<00:02:38.930> grippy<00:02:39.380> stuff<00:02:39.620> that's<00:02:39.830> probably

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
a lot of grippy stuff that's probably

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.790 
a lot of grippy stuff that's probably
why<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:40.459> would<00:02:40.730> um<00:02:41.200> recommend<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.320> for<00:02:42.470> wearing

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
why I would um recommend it for wearing

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.800 
why I would um recommend it for wearing
your<00:02:42.920> hair<00:02:43.100> down<00:02:43.280> is<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.610> you<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.820> got<00:02:44.240> a<00:02:44.270> habit

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
your hair down is the you I got a habit

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.890 
your hair down is the you I got a habit
headband<00:02:45.230> which<00:02:45.830> looks<00:02:46.040> like<00:02:46.100> this<00:02:46.750> this<00:02:47.750> is

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
headband which looks like this this is

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.710 
headband which looks like this this is
another<00:02:48.140> one<00:02:48.320> like<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:48.950> other<00:02:49.130> two<00:02:49.550> which<00:02:50.450> I

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
another one like the other two which I

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.690 
another one like the other two which I
would<00:02:51.020> is<00:02:51.320> a<00:02:51.590> little<00:02:51.890> bit<00:02:52.010> tighter<00:02:52.280> on<00:02:52.550> the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
would is a little bit tighter on the

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.990 
would is a little bit tighter on the
head<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.410> um<00:02:54.410> i<00:02:55.040> would<00:02:55.340> recommend<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:55.850> for

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
head and um i would recommend it for

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.510 
head and um i would recommend it for
sports<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:56.840> maybe<00:02:57.620> wearing<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:58.280> like<00:02:58.459> a

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
sports and maybe wearing it like a

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.970 
sports and maybe wearing it like a
normal<00:02:58.820> heaven<00:02:59.450> it's<00:02:59.989> just<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.380> little<00:03:00.650> tight

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
normal heaven it's just a little tight

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.580 
normal heaven it's just a little tight
so<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:02.510> probably<00:03:02.780> wouldn't<00:03:03.080> want<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.350> wear<00:03:03.530> it

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
so you probably wouldn't want to wear it

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.800 
so you probably wouldn't want to wear it
for<00:03:03.830> long<00:03:04.340> periods<00:03:04.370> of<00:03:04.940> time<00:03:05.000> but<00:03:05.390> that's<00:03:05.600> just

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
for long periods of time but that's just

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.870 
for long periods of time but that's just
for<00:03:06.019> my<00:03:06.170> head<00:03:06.410> type<00:03:06.650> I'm<00:03:06.860> pretty<00:03:07.130> sure<00:03:07.400> it

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
for my head type I'm pretty sure it

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.430 
for my head type I'm pretty sure it
would<00:03:07.970> be<00:03:08.120> great<00:03:08.390> if<00:03:08.420> you<00:03:08.690> had<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.870> smaller<00:03:09.200> head

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
would be great if you had a smaller head

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.910 
would be great if you had a smaller head
and<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:11.330> this<00:03:11.750> is<00:03:11.900> on<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.170> website<00:03:12.380> right<00:03:12.860> now

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
and the this is on the website right now

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.270 
and the this is on the website right now
and<00:03:13.489> this<00:03:14.000> is<00:03:14.180> just<00:03:14.360> a<00:03:14.570> um<00:03:15.080> different<00:03:15.739> colors

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
and this is just a um different colors

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.840 
and this is just a um different colors
so<00:03:16.580> it's<00:03:17.209> like<00:03:17.360> this<00:03:17.739> turquoise<00:03:18.739> II<00:03:19.130> color

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
so it's like this turquoise II color

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.890 
so it's like this turquoise II color
teal<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:21.430> this<00:03:22.430> one<00:03:22.700> which<00:03:23.239> is<00:03:23.450> really

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
teal and this one which is really

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.530 
teal and this one which is really
interesting<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:25.010> cool<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.570> um<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:28.209> one<00:03:29.209> side

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
interesting and cool and um it one side

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.460 
interesting and cool and um it one side
it<00:03:29.870> says<00:03:30.380> under<00:03:30.799> armour<00:03:31.519> and<00:03:31.700> it's<00:03:32.320> pink<00:03:33.320> and

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.789 
green and it has the black like grippy
stuff<00:03:37.420> but<00:03:38.420> it's<00:03:38.600> like<00:03:38.750> different<00:03:39.260> could<00:03:39.650> be

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
stuff but it's like different could be

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.720 
stuff but it's like different could be
said<00:03:40.010> and<00:03:40.190> then<00:03:40.790> it's<00:03:40.970> reversible<00:03:41.480> so<00:03:42.459> you<00:03:43.459> can

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
said and then it's reversible so you can

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.850 
said and then it's reversible so you can
do<00:03:44.720> with<00:03:45.079> this<00:03:45.560> like<00:03:47.049> yeah<00:03:48.049> it's<00:03:48.350> like<00:03:48.500> black

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
do with this like yeah it's like black

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.550 
do with this like yeah it's like black
with<00:03:49.130> heat<00:03:49.610> cookies<00:03:50.269> so<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.780> then<00:03:51.320> this<00:03:51.500> one

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
with heat cookies so and then this one

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.949 
with heat cookies so and then this one
yeah<00:03:52.519> I<00:03:52.549> don't<00:03:52.700> link<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.150> sides<00:03:53.420> reversible

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
yeah I don't link the sides reversible

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.420 
yeah I don't link the sides reversible
but<00:03:54.170> this<00:03:54.320> one's<00:03:54.530> really<00:03:54.769> cool<00:03:55.010> because<00:03:55.190> it's

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
but this one's really cool because it's

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.509 
but this one's really cool because it's
reversible<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.769> the<00:03:57.769> colors<00:03:58.130> are<00:03:58.280> really

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
reversible and the colors are really

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.560 
reversible and the colors are really
vibrant<00:03:58.940> and<00:03:59.420> neon<00:03:59.780> which<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:01.030> it's<00:04:02.030> like<00:04:02.540> a

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
vibrant and neon which I it's like a

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.449 
vibrant and neon which I it's like a
fashion<00:04:02.900> terminus<00:04:03.560> but<00:04:03.769> not<00:04:03.890> least<00:04:04.160> is<00:04:04.430> the

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
fashion terminus but not least is the

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.289 
fashion terminus but not least is the
under<00:04:04.970> armour<00:04:05.420> um<00:04:05.950> pre<00:04:06.950> wrap<00:04:07.220> I've<00:04:07.610> never
