all<00:02:09.959> around<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.350> castle<00:02:10.530> we<00:02:11.220> utilize<00:02:11.610> a

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
all around the castle we utilize a

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.270 
all around the castle we utilize a
number<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.329> different<00:02:12.720> technical<00:02:13.110> tools<00:02:13.470> that

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
number of different technical tools that

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.280 
number of different technical tools that
have<00:02:14.370> never<00:02:14.579> been<00:02:14.760> combined<00:02:15.209> for<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.959> show<00:02:16.140> in

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
have never been combined for a show in

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.990 
have never been combined for a show in
front<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.590> castle<00:02:17.040> but<00:02:17.370> we're<00:02:17.579> mapping

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
front of the castle but we're mapping

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.509 
front of the castle but we're mapping
the<00:02:18.090> castle<00:02:18.570> with<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.470> pixel<00:02:19.829> accurate<00:02:20.220> video

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
the castle with the pixel accurate video

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.160 
the castle with the pixel accurate video
so<00:02:20.790> we<00:02:20.880> can<00:02:21.030> make<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.209> castle<00:02:21.600> do<00:02:21.690> all<00:02:21.870> kinds

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
so we can make the castle do all kinds

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.940 
so we can make the castle do all kinds
of<00:02:22.230> good<00:02:22.410> tricks

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.280 

so<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.610> Disney<00:02:28.970> Dream<00:02:29.000> show<00:02:29.270> is<00:02:29.810> actually

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
so the Disney Dream show is actually

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.410 
so the Disney Dream show is actually
