you<00:02:09.310> see<00:02:09.520> when<00:02:09.550> you<00:02:09.670> open<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:10.000> hood<00:02:10.119> so<00:02:10.600> what

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
you see when you open the hood so what

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.030 
you see when you open the hood so what
do<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:10.869> guys<00:02:10.930> do<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.260> make<00:02:11.410> them<00:02:11.560> look<00:02:11.590> stock

do you guys do to make them look stock

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.070 
do you guys do to make them look stock
well<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:13.150> bodies<00:02:13.480> are<00:02:13.510> actually

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
well the bodies are actually

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.290 
well the bodies are actually
a direct<00:02:14.680> replica<00:02:15.220> of<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.460> original<00:02:15.520> systems

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
a direct replica of the original systems

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.680 
a direct replica of the original systems
from<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.350> factory<00:02:17.770> caps<00:02:18.460> rotors<00:02:19.180> all<00:02:19.360> that

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
from the factory caps rotors all that

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.290 
from the factory caps rotors all that
look<00:02:19.990> on<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.530> outside<00:02:20.560> stock<00:02:21.370> but<00:02:22.090> on<00:02:22.180> the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
look on the outside stock but on the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.150 
look on the outside stock but on the
inside<00:02:22.330> you<00:02:22.900> know<00:02:22.990> we<00:02:23.110> use<00:02:23.260> brass<00:02:23.560> terminals

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
inside you know we use brass terminals

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.910 
inside you know we use brass terminals
on<00:02:24.400> rotor<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.180> on<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.510> caps<00:02:25.720> we<00:02:26.260> use<00:02:26.440> high

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
on rotor and on the caps we use high

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.710 
on rotor and on the caps we use high
dielectric<00:02:27.190> strength<00:02:27.580> caps<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.330> materials

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
dielectric strength caps and materials

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.150

so<00:02:29.200> essentially<00:02:29.590> you're<00:02:29.800> getting<00:02:30.100> a

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
so essentially you're getting a

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.370 
so essentially you're getting a
high-performance<00:02:31.080> street<00:02:32.080> strip

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380
