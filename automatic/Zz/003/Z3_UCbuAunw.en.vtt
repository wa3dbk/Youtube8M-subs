00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
sounds kind of silly but it actually

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.960 
sounds kind of silly but it actually
really<00:00:31.779> is<00:00:31.900> true<00:00:32.349> what<00:00:32.890> we're<00:00:33.070> able<00:00:33.370> to<00:00:33.580> do<00:00:33.760> is

really is true what we're able to do is

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.850 
really is true what we're able to do is
things<00:00:34.210> that<00:00:34.360> you<00:00:34.480> can't<00:00:34.809> do<00:00:35.080> in<00:00:35.320> any<00:00:35.620> other

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.770 
things that you can't do in any other
game<00:00:36.070> it's<00:00:36.370> really<00:00:36.699> fundamentally<00:00:37.390> different

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
game it's really fundamentally different

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.990 
game it's really fundamentally different
when<00:00:38.080> you<00:00:38.170> have<00:00:38.199> access<00:00:38.710> to<00:00:38.739> that<00:00:38.890> vehicle<00:00:39.340> at

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
all times so at that what's the fact

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.640 
all times so at that what's the fact
that<00:00:43.239> each<00:00:43.480> character<00:00:43.900> you're<00:00:44.019> the<00:00:44.110> place<00:00:44.320> has

that each character you're the place has
a<00:00:44.680> unique<00:00:45.040> ability<00:00:45.190> that<00:00:45.580> makes<00:00:45.820> it<00:00:45.940> very<00:00:46.000> very

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
a unique ability that makes it very very

mechanics<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.989> camera<00:02:45.290> is<00:02:45.320> much<00:02:45.920> tighter

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
mechanics the camera is much tighter

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.700 
mechanics the camera is much tighter
that<00:02:46.640> we<00:02:46.760> have

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
that we have

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.640 
that we have
that<00:02:47.860> really<00:02:48.100> brings<00:02:48.400> you

that really brings you

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.530 
that really brings you
the<00:02:50.129> shooting<00:02:50.430> experience<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.939> much<00:02:51.269> more

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
the shooting experience is much more

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.240 
the shooting experience is much more
engaging<00:02:51.870> much<00:02:52.230> more<00:02:52.500> meaningful<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:53.129> you

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
engaging much more meaningful to you

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.330 
engaging much more meaningful to you
because<00:02:53.849> you<00:02:54.150> have<00:02:54.390> just<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.989> more<00:02:55.340> visceral

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
because you have just a more visceral

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.729 
because you have just a more visceral
camera<00:02:57.209> position<00:02:57.689> and<00:02:57.989> that<00:02:58.200> kind<00:02:58.409> of<00:02:58.439> rippled

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
camera position and that kind of rippled

00:02:58.739 --> 00:02:59.780 
camera position and that kind of rippled
through<00:02:58.799> a<00:02:58.950> lot<00:02:59.189> of<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.370> things<00:02:59.579> we<00:02:59.670> did

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
through a lot of the things we did

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.640 
through a lot of the things we did
that's<00:03:00.000> just<00:03:00.150> maybe<00:03:00.329> one<00:03:00.569> small<00:03:00.930> example<00:03:01.079> of

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
that's just maybe one small example of

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.890 
that's just maybe one small example of
one<00:03:02.099> of<00:03:02.129> the<00:03:02.250> changes<00:03:02.459> but<00:03:02.879> I<00:03:03.090> think<00:03:03.629> this<00:03:03.720> game

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
one of the changes but I think this game

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.960 
one of the changes but I think this game
is<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:04.079> real<00:03:04.349> evolution<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.519> what<00:03:05.670> we<00:03:05.790> learned

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
is a real evolution of what we learned

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.210 
is a real evolution of what we learned
on<00:03:06.150> war<00:03:06.420> which<00:03:06.629> tribalism<00:03:07.349> was<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:07.739> good<00:03:08.010> game

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
on war which tribalism was a good game

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.979 
on war which tribalism was a good game
this<00:03:08.730> one's<00:03:08.939> a<00:03:09.060> breaking<00:03:09.510> because<00:03:09.659> of<00:03:09.810> all

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
this one's a breaking because of all

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.509 
this one's a breaking because of all
those<00:03:10.170> little<00:03:10.409> tiny<00:03:10.709> details<00:03:11.159> how<00:03:11.340> they've

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
those little tiny details how they've

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.789
