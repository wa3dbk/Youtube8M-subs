00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
it is also probably not a good idea to

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.980

to ignore the middle four minutes and

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.560 
to ignore the middle four minutes and
skip<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.010> end<00:01:47.280> after<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.790> automa<00:01:48.150> bit<00:01:48.450> is
