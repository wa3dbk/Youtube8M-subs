King at bungee yesterday and while doing

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.830 
King at bungee yesterday and while doing
so<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.490> got<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.850> play<00:00:17.940> around<00:00:18.090> with<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.330> level<00:00:18.480> 40

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
so I got to play around with a level 40

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.750 
so I got to play around with a level 40
character<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.470> level<00:00:20.130> 40<00:00:20.400> character

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
character and that level 40 character

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.519 
character and that level 40 character
came<00:00:21.300> with<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> whole<00:00:21.720> host<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:22.020> weapons<00:00:22.380> and

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
came with a whole host of weapons and

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.620 
came with a whole host of weapons and
gear<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.949> among<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.460> gear<00:00:23.730> was<00:00:24.000> an<00:00:24.150> artifact

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
gear and among that gear was an artifact

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.230 
gear and among that gear was an artifact
so<00:00:25.289> what<00:00:25.560> are<00:00:25.740> artifacts<00:00:26.369> well<00:00:26.760> if<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.090> ever

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
so what are artifacts well if you ever

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.089 
so what are artifacts well if you ever
played<00:00:27.510> an<00:00:27.689> MMO<00:00:27.779> before<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.800> closest

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
played an MMO before the closest

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.460 
played an MMO before the closest
comparison<00:00:29.429> would<00:00:29.820> be<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.060> trinket<00:00:30.480> artifacts

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
comparison would be a trinket artifacts

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.139 
comparison would be a trinket artifacts
are<00:00:31.590> effectively<00:00:31.980> another<00:00:32.460> piece<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.910> gear

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
are effectively another piece of gear

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.610 
are effectively another piece of gear
while<00:00:33.570> there<00:00:33.719> was<00:00:33.809> some<00:00:33.960> speculation<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.469> while

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
while there was some speculation a while

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.990 
while there was some speculation a while
ago<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.130> they<00:00:35.219> could<00:00:35.430> well<00:00:35.610> be<00:00:35.760> say

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
ago that they could well be say

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.430 
ago that they could well be say
something<00:00:36.360> like<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.540> King<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.870> say<00:00:37.079> relics

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
something like the King to say relics

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.930 
something like the King to say relics
because<00:00:37.649> on<00:00:37.860> bungie.net<00:00:38.160> relics<00:00:38.879> are

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
because on bungie.net relics are

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.850 
because on bungie.net relics are
referred<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.239> as<00:00:39.390> artifacts<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.649> not

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
referred to as artifacts that is not

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.979 
referred to as artifacts that is not
actually<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.399> case<00:00:41.610> artifacts<00:00:42.450> are<00:00:42.600> simply

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
actually a case artifacts are simply

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.510 
actually a case artifacts are simply
another<00:00:43.290> piece<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.680> gear<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.070> allow<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.399> to

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
another piece of gear that allow you to

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.010 
another piece of gear that allow you to
improve<00:00:44.879> different<00:00:45.420> aspects<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
improve different aspects of the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.779 
improve different aspects of the
character<00:00:46.260> if<00:00:47.039> we<00:00:47.250> take<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.430> look<00:00:47.489> at<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> one

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
character if we take a look at the one

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.670 
character if we take a look at the one
that<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:47.940> had<00:00:48.090> equipped<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.480> my<00:00:48.660> hunter<00:00:48.930> see

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
that I had equipped on my hunter see

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.439 
that I had equipped on my hunter see
that<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.219> rare<00:00:50.610> artifact<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.300> can

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
that this is a rare artifact you can

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.000 
that this is a rare artifact you can
also<00:00:51.570> get<00:00:51.750> legendary<00:00:52.110> artifacts<00:00:52.440> but<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.920> this

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
also get legendary artifacts but in this

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.160 
also get legendary artifacts but in this
case<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.399> only<00:00:53.579> had<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> rare<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.899> is

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
case I only had a rare one this is

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.290 
case I only had a rare one this is
called<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.620> newer<00:00:55.890> bezel<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.789> has<00:00:56.940> 200

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
called the newer bezel it has 200

increase your strength you can see the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.960 
increase your strength you can see the
way<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.949> have<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> set<00:01:05.280> up<00:01:05.369> right<00:01:05.519> now<00:01:05.729> it

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
way that I have a set up right now it

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.600 
way that I have a set up right now it
gives<00:01:06.180> me<00:01:06.360> +<00:01:06.630> 42<00:01:06.990> discipline<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.799> plus<00:01:08.189> 19

gives me + 42 discipline and plus 19

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.070 
gives me + 42 discipline and plus 19
strength<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.330> where<00:01:09.540> X<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.840> like<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
strength but where X is like the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.690 
strength but where X is like the
strength<00:01:10.320> one<00:01:10.560> if<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:11.070> was<00:01:11.159> more<00:01:11.310> important

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
strength one if that was more important

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.370 
strength one if that was more important
to<00:01:11.729> me<00:01:11.820> then<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.630> use<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> boost<00:01:13.260> in

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
to me then I can use it as a boost in

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.620 
to me then I can use it as a boost in
that<00:01:13.560> department<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.220> then<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> second<00:01:15.450> perk

we then quickly switch over and take a

we then quickly switch over and take a
look<00:01:24.240> at<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.630> Titans<00:01:25.020> off<00:01:25.140> fact<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.680> see
