00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.420 
swatches here I will put it in the
information<00:01:21.750> bar<00:01:21.900> down<00:01:22.170> below<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.680> think<00:01:23.220> about

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
information bar down below I think about

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.600 
information bar down below I think about
six<00:01:23.850> or<00:01:24.000> seven<00:01:24.360> branches<00:01:25.140> chance<00:01:26.100> Timor<00:01:26.460> does

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
six or seven branches chance Timor does

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.020 
six or seven branches chance Timor does
have<00:01:26.790> two<00:01:27.030> branches<00:01:27.450> by<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.930> way<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:29.030> these

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
have two branches by the way and these

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.249 
have two branches by the way and these
are<00:01:30.270> 22<00:01:30.930> titi<00:01:31.799> dollars<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.960> little<00:01:34.079> bit

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
are 22 titi dollars so it's a little bit

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.569 
are 22 titi dollars so it's a little bit
cheaper<00:01:34.619> than<00:01:34.650> what<00:01:34.920> they<00:01:35.009> sell<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.400> for

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
cheaper than what they sell it for

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.039 
cheaper than what they sell it for
online<00:01:36.000> but<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.390> think<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:36.720> because

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
online but I do you think it's because

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.700 
online but I do you think it's because
this<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:38.659> Salomon<00:01:39.659> bulk<00:01:39.930> are<00:01:40.200> they<00:01:40.380> buy<00:01:40.530> them

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
this the Salomon bulk are they buy them

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.130 
this the Salomon bulk are they buy them
in<00:01:40.829> bulk<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.570> they<00:01:42.570> probably<00:01:42.750> get<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.110> a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
in bulk so they probably get like a

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.190 
in bulk so they probably get like a
discount<00:01:43.530> or<00:01:43.740> something<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.430> have<00:01:45.200> seven

Pune I was just there for some reason

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.900 
Pune I was just there for some reason
and<00:04:08.540> I<00:04:09.410> ventured<00:04:10.069> into<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:10.400> wonderful<00:04:10.639> world

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
and they had testers but for everyone

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.319 
and they had testers but for everyone
they<00:04:14.959> were<00:04:15.019> in<00:04:15.169> this<00:04:15.290> big<00:04:16.100> container<00:04:16.340> and<00:04:16.850> they

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
they were in this big container and they

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.000 
they were in this big container and they
had<00:04:17.539> tests<00:04:17.930> for<00:04:18.079> everyone<00:04:18.470> but

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
had tests for everyone but

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.640 
had tests for everyone but
then<00:04:20.190> more<00:04:20.790> recently<00:04:21.270> I<00:04:21.540> went<00:04:21.840> to<00:04:22.020> the<00:04:22.410> one<00:04:22.530> in

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
then more recently I went to the one in

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.510 
then more recently I went to the one in
Trinity<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:23.130> they<00:04:23.190> said<00:04:23.370> they're<00:04:23.490> only

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
Trinity and they said they're only

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.430 
Trinity and they said they're only
allowed<00:04:23.850> to<00:04:23.970> have<00:04:24.090> one<00:04:24.120> tester<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:27.440> honestly

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
allowed to have one tester and honestly

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.320 
allowed to have one tester and honestly
I<00:04:28.500> don't<00:04:28.590> think<00:04:28.770> that<00:04:28.980> makes<00:04:29.250> sense<00:04:29.550> if<00:04:29.850> they

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
I don't think that makes sense if they

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.760 
I don't think that makes sense if they
don't<00:04:30.510> have<00:04:30.630> any<00:04:30.810> testers<00:04:31.380> they<00:04:31.530> should<00:04:31.680> at

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
don't have any testers they should at

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.890 
don't have any testers they should at
least<00:04:31.800> have<00:04:32.070> like<00:04:32.400> a<00:04:32.670> chart<00:04:33.480> that<00:04:33.600> has

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
least have like a chart that has

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.840 
least have like a chart that has
searches<00:04:34.500> so<00:04:35.010> you<00:04:35.130> can<00:04:35.250> see<00:04:35.430> what<00:04:35.550> they<00:04:35.670> look

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
to order it from someone and it's kind

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.960 
to order it from someone and it's kind
of<00:06:54.020> a<00:06:54.110> long<00:06:54.259> process<00:06:54.340> but<00:06:55.340> a<00:06:55.400> lot<00:06:55.550> of<00:06:55.639> people<00:06:55.849> do
