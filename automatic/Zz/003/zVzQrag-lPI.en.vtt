00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.099
 Hello dear 1000 best was to see 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.700
 we are in mallorca today and look 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.099
 take us to the new s 1000 rr from bmw 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.340
 we mpeg la is the 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.430
 Product manager of the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.039
 product manager for the svg i can 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.779
 still remember four years ago 2009 wise 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.490
 when the s 1000 brand comes 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.240
 hit like a bomb has everything 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.160
 I was torn in the ground and ground 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.410
 even two of them have 1000 of them 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.640
 bought is simply the hottest at that time 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.950
 was what you buy and still is 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.510
 is in the superbike sector and i am too 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.520
 already driven a naked bike on basis 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.530
 the s 1000 rr namely of whimsical 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.710
 this their piranha tag 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.879
 I have to say it was fun 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.289
 say it was not really one 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.120
 Harmonic driving it was nothing 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.980
 one should let go on the broad mass 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.090
 can 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.340
 Now I have a mother that we can 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.699
 but it is always possible to let go of a broad mass 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.379
 even rats monkey shaaf is how is that 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.030
 How did you go about this machine? 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.620
 I domesticated that may say so 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.629
 of course, first of all 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.280
 For weeks they got sick with the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.020
 have overturned the superbike engine 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.880
 tried what is possible we knew how 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.950
 the thing feels like and indeed 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.869
 really as long as willis 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.729
 rear-wheel drive and that has not 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.500
 really worked 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.330
 have to take motors bisserl booms 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.250
 have to change driver driver came 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.900
 work long in different directions 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.610
 At the end we come out one 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.700
 Steering head only comes also grad flat 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.430
 made the caster 10 mm length thereby 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.280
 where the vehicle is stable and we have the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.170
 wheelbase extended by 22 mm then 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.180
 additionally through the footrests easily 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.159
 to and forwardly so that the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.900
 Seating fits and the handlebar too 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.130
 need a position and have with it 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.600
 she makes it up in the airport 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.620
 best video as long as you want everything 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.390
 manageable 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.610
 that was all that was important 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.450
 points of course then have in the 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.010
 setting the world work of the snack 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.780
 I do not say so tight about it 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.860
 Supersportler thereby remains the whole 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.330
 nice on the ground 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.190
 and then it was actually our bid 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.990
 we want more pressure from the bottom 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.640
 have area and there I have the engine 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.560
 really really clean 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.410
 engine we have down at ten 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.230
 newtonmeter more 160 ps that sounds 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.240
 not two apps yet but you have 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.300
 then have and find out what kind of 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.990
 there is that really the 25th print 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.960
 Chassis and engine ok further surprised 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.970
 there it said you have the cable 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.500
 actually changed a lot in the head 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.300
 direction stability normally in 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.810
 eggebek wants to make it easier to handle 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.370
 it is not a problem now 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.930
 definitely not that was almost 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.620
 too handy that means that was 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.210
 then I'm really 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.500
 many punches and ground waves come 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.090
 then you have almost completely that 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.830
 front wheel hops and only jumps around 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.110
 What we really have more for the vehicle 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.480
 But stability is what it is 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.820
 goal was very clear that must be razor-sharp 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.050
 it has to be agile and that has to be 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.060
 be manageable were our 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.440
 important story of course 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.510
 Beginner mistakes were already mine 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.580
 inside because you have to remember that 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.920
 wide handlebar dublin much larger lever 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.730
 in the tight curves and in the 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.230
 pulsation 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.180
 when giving in, that is in truth 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.190
 this will also be a handling package 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.470
 even if you have a bit of handling 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.030
 quasi taken out has absolutely exactly in 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.890
 The direction is much bigger 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.900
 lever and that is the biggest mistake 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.610
 If you are a great athlete you do it 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.080
 a pipe link on it does it far enough 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.790
 just not you are too high up 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.760
 you pull yourself in the room all the time 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.050
 handlebars and that really managed to do that 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.060
 We then have the additional seat 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.050
 changed seems to be little 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.240
 seat height is the same 814 120 mm what 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.130
 also from the 14 but the supersport 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.080
 I sit there forward and the seat 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.880
 Goes slightly in the direction of you 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.470
 also in the right place although super sport 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.670
 is still ahead in braking and 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.410
 then at the same time as after 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.600
 At the back we have the sitting position 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.100
 made neutral the reaction of 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.680
 Driver also little into the vehicle 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.450
 works okay if you still have the 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.490
 make a distinction where to go 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.660
 are differences and where in principle has 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.190
 how should I say the real one 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.510
 superbike performance still 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.220
 So I think Ausstattungs 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.830
 has different cylinder head there 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.300
 is taken out quasi performance but 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.220
 also a big cost blocks 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.410
 taken out with the titanium valves 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.959
 Now steel valves are on the other 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.920
 page I believe in the rear shock absorber 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.959
 it was also possible in the 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.220
 relation to the series to the top player 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.470
 to save costs 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.269
 But there are also areas where you can almost 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.489
 still the superbike level to 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.690
 disposal also has its price 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.669
 not only the clutch thinks and stuff 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.230
 what else in dassow the features 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.760
 to be preserved at a price of 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.169
 envelope with actually so what 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.880
 really that's been preserved since me 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.600
 that would be the same room and that the same 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.830
 same swing have strut back 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.010
 adjustable spring base now really 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.590
 very easy with 17 - what the 3 stage 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.700
 the engine is the same up to the head 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.080
 We agreed that we have others 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.729
 Camshafts in that means we have 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.690
 now even steeper elevation curves that 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.380
 means we can fill more 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.690
 reinbringen 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.979
 we have the channels over that works 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.270
 which is even in the superbike 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.430
 have learned have the channels through 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.120
 works for even faster fulfillment 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.919
 to get 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.540
 we have on the exhaust pharma the 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.640
 interference location clamshell one for the 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.530
 above speed how were responsible at 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.960
 superbike who cares here and 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.940
 They only save up to 12,000 turn 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.200
 but nevertheless interference tubes in it from 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.210
 cylinder 1 to 4 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.220
 that means the exhaust system is almost the 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.780
 identical as in the double so 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.639
 Videos said that head 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.770
 but we have headphones that works 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.930
 you have the performance of the valves 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.060
 rausschaut valves purely other 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.250
 Camshaft for the motionless that was 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.270
 Side lower adjustment are around one 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.490
 Stepping further we have now 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.550
 here no matter so wide in a row 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.139
 This is still allowed there 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.720
 to produce homogeneous or fillings 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:38.070
 even more beautiful and tempomat logically 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.419
 Okay again and then it was up 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.830
 the eicma is presented the motorcycle 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.990
 I have the price with us 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.910
 on 1000 better communicates no ten 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.290
 minutes later with first sales manager 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.550
 specify by the Japanese manufacturer 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.550
 have pushed again 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.600
 it can not be this is really 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.220
 I understand here like corporations 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.050
 function i believe this low 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.610
 Price is possible because in truth how 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.110
 shall i say the s 1000 rr customers 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.810
 a part of the development costs already 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.060
 have paid and many things now 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.320
 no more races have been expected 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.000
 this vehicle that is from the price 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.770
 performance ratio that's pretty 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.030
 the best you can ever buy from bmw 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.380
 I guess I could or I see 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.210
 that one's the direction if that's ours 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.860
 first motorcycle would have been if we had it 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.450
 only thousands need it on the market 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.880
 this price would not work 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.680
 because it is always such a derivative 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.500
 also the advantage that comes from second 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.150
 were blown at home in private I must 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.010
 Model I have to fight water and 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.410
 Derivatives do not benefit from it 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.830
 yes that is so that has a headless there 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.940
 could realize this price 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.650
 if that is also a vehicle 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.080
 that you often see that on the streets 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.100
 many people will enjoy and me 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.120
 Hope we will be today too 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.120
 enjoy at the weather ago
