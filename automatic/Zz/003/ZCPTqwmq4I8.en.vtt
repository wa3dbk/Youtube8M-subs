00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello my name is anita and me 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.790
 Welcome to the Paul you light falls 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.649
 on youtube if you have a new one 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.849
 buy lamp you will see that you 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.490
 between different light colors 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.630
 can choose another term for 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.730
 The light color is the color temperature 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.350
 and that has a significant impact 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.330
 on how we feel 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.039
 I'll explain what you mean today 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.689
 understands and like her the color temperature 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.689
 you can use targeted 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.300
 in sunlight are infinitely many 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.950
 colors contain all together for 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.500
 give us white light 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.680
 how knows that natural or artificial 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.150
 Light is describing the color temperature 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.320
 so can a light bulb for example 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.440
 was common 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.390
 or the other day, be cool 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.430
 the color temperature in the unit calvin 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.030
 and can be roughly divided into three areas 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.239
 organize 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.000
 the first area starts at 5300 calvin 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.980
 upwards and carries the name 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.979
 daylight white 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.590
 the second area ranges from 3300 to 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.509
 5,300 calvin and turns neutral white 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.250
 called the third area ranges from 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.380
 2700 to 3300 Kelvin 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.090
 He is yellowish warm and is therefore as 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.830
 warm white designates which 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.720
 Influence has the light color on our 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.509
 feel first time back to 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.220
 the original state that depends on the 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.020
 sunlight together yet this 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.880
 changed over the day distributed the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.080
 color temperature and thus determined 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.300
 our biorhythm 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.990
 It affects how fit and 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.939
 powerful we are the later the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.159
 The more natural the day becomes 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.659
 light this warm white light is with 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.490
 connected to our inner clock 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.320
 It announces the recovery phase of the night 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.409
 and looks comfortable on us and 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.280
 relaxed for cozy and relaxed 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.979
 Light situation you should 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.790
 bulbs between 2700 and 3000 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.280
 choose kelvin 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.380
 as with the reading light the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.110
 by the way, the well-known bulb lights up 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.880
 even at 2700 kelvin and is considered by many 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.350
 felt very pleasant 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.509
 So who after the abolition of 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.340
 light bulb choose the same light color 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.239
 I just want to be a paulmann 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.640
 LED grab this also lights up 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.950
 2700 kelvin the mornings and 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.950
 afternoon sun is shining with 3300 to 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.200
 5,300 calvin and is called neutral white 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.150
 Light also refers to bulbs 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.829
 like this halogen lamp can be 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.049
 achieve neutral white light 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.510
 in the middle of the day has the sunlight 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.820
 even 8000 calvin for us is that 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.049
 most active phase of the day so take 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.280
 Lamp with a color temperature 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.440
 over 5300 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.150
 So daylight white where motivated to 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.510
 work this desk light 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.340
 For example, this generates 6400 calvin 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.020
 is ideal for learning and focused 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.420
 work so you do not confuse it 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.760
 with the color temperature is not the 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.040
 temperature in degrees celsius meant for 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.959
 when the sun gets warmer at noon 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.540
 the color temperature of the light colder 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:03.069
 with the color temperature is so 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.840
 I meant you today 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.550
 shown that the color temperature of the 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.250
 light effects on ours 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.709
 so who has the color temperature of his 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.650
 Selective choice of light bulb can thus 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.550
 active work and rest phases 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.739
 support 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.420
 for tips and questions leave one

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.459
 when choosing a color temperature up 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.459
 next time your anita
