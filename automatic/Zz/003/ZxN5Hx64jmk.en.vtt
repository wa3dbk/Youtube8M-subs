00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.249 

so<00:00:02.280> we've<00:00:02.460> talked<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:02.760> little<00:00:02.879> bit<00:00:03.030> about<00:00:03.300> how

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
so we've talked a little bit about how

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.990 
so we've talked a little bit about how
the<00:00:04.319> electricity<00:00:04.980> how<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.339> energy<00:00:05.640> company

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
the electricity how the energy company

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.600 
the electricity how the energy company
calculates<00:00:06.830> with<00:00:07.830> they<00:00:07.919> charge<00:00:08.220> you<00:00:08.370> four

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
calculates with they charge you four

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.280 
calculates with they charge you four
kilowatt<00:00:09.000> hours<00:00:09.300> so<00:00:09.780> today<00:00:09.990> what<00:00:10.080> we're<00:00:10.170> going

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
kilowatt hours so today what we're going

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.060 
kilowatt hours so today what we're going
to<00:00:10.320> do<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.500> we're<00:00:10.620> going<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.769> sort<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.010> take

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
to do is we're going to sort of take

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.490 
to do is we're going to sort of take
that<00:00:11.280> information<00:00:12.150> those<00:00:12.690> equations<00:00:13.259> and

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
that information those equations and

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.740 
that information those equations and
you're<00:00:13.950> going<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.130> calculate<00:00:14.700> how<00:00:15.599> much

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
you're going to calculate how much

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.510 
you're going to calculate how much
energy<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.320> also<00:00:16.440> how<00:00:16.650> much<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:17.010> bill<00:00:17.340> would

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
energy and also how much a bill would

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.390 
energy and also how much a bill would
cost<00:00:17.760> for<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.510> for<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> day<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.770> then<00:00:19.920> also<00:00:20.070> for

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
cost for you for a day and then also for

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.460 
cost for you for a day and then also for
a<00:00:20.460> year<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.720> first<00:00:21.750> thing<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.289> do

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
a year so the first thing you have to do

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.490 
a year so the first thing you have to do
in<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.830> very<00:00:23.580> individual<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.960> depending

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
in this is very individual so depending

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.019 
in this is very individual so depending
on<00:00:25.590> your<00:00:25.650> situation<00:00:26.130> yours<00:00:26.670> might<00:00:26.820> look<00:00:26.849> very

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
on your situation yours might look very

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.029 
on your situation yours might look very
different<00:00:27.660> from<00:00:28.439> someone<00:00:28.800> else's

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
different from someone else's

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.710 
different from someone else's
calculation<00:00:29.670> first<00:00:30.240> thing<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.420> want<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.599> do

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
calculation first thing you want to do

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.759 
calculation first thing you want to do
is<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.929> want<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.080> think<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.349> some<00:00:31.470> appliances

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
is you want to think of some appliances

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.520 
is you want to think of some appliances
and<00:00:32.309> things<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.940> use<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.450> day<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:34.230> run<00:00:34.410> on

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
and things you use in a day that run on

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.410 
and things you use in a day that run on
electricity<00:00:34.890> they<00:00:35.790> might<00:00:35.940> not<00:00:36.030> be<00:00:36.149> thing<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
electricity they might not be thing to

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.260 
electricity they might not be thing to
use<00:00:36.510> every<00:00:36.870> day<00:00:37.670> right<00:00:38.670> now<00:00:38.820> we're<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
use every day right now we're in the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.400 
use every day right now we're in the
middle<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> heat<00:00:39.660> wave<00:00:39.690> when<00:00:40.200> I'm<00:00:40.290> recording

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
middle of a heat wave when I'm recording

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.280 
middle of a heat wave when I'm recording
this<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:40.920> I'm<00:00:41.010> going<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.190> say<00:00:41.780> air<00:00:42.780> conditioner

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
this so I'm going to say air conditioner

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.049 
this so I'm going to say air conditioner
and<00:00:44.329> summer<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.660> maybe<00:00:45.960> watching<00:00:46.739> some<00:00:47.070> TV<00:00:47.250> and

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and summer so maybe watching some TV and

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
some things are going to be tough like

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.420 
some things are going to be tough like
light<00:00:55.379> bulbs<00:00:55.770> you're<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> have<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.280> sort

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
light bulbs you're going to have to sort

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.400 
light bulbs you're going to have to sort
of<00:00:56.489> make<00:00:56.640> an<00:00:56.789> estimate<00:00:57.300> how<00:00:57.780> many<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.170> have

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
of make an estimate how many you have

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.830 
of make an estimate how many you have
how<00:00:58.829> many<00:00:58.890> are<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.460> at<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.730> time<00:00:59.760> in<00:01:00.359> your<00:01:00.960> house

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
how many are on at a time in your house

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.789 
how many are on at a time in your house
next<00:01:03.840> thing<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.110> want<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.290> do<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.589> want<00:01:04.739> to

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
next thing you want to do is you want to

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.070 
next thing you want to do is you want to
find<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.700> power<00:01:05.970> rating<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.720> talked<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> little

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
find the power rating we talked a little

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.080 
find the power rating we talked a little
bit<00:01:07.229> about<00:01:07.439> what<00:01:07.740> power<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.760> how<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:08.880> can

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
bit about what power is and how we can

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.700 
bit about what power is and how we can
calculate<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.689> however<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.470> don't<00:01:10.530> really

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
calculate it however we don't really

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.649 
calculate it however we don't really
need<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.950> calculate<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.549> most<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.570> our

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
need to calculate that most of our

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.969 
need to calculate that most of our
appliances<00:01:12.960> are<00:01:13.260> just<00:01:13.470> going<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.650> tell<00:01:13.830> us

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
appliances are just going to tell us

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.190 
appliances are just going to tell us
come<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.610> tell<00:01:14.729> us<00:01:14.760> what<00:01:15.060> what<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.540> a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
come out and tell us what what it is a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.350 
come out and tell us what what it is a
lot<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.799> things<00:01:16.979> nowadays<00:01:17.189> try<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:17.939> advertise

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
lot of things nowadays try and advertise

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.570 
lot of things nowadays try and advertise
they<00:01:18.630> use<00:01:18.810> low<00:01:19.350> power<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.189> they're<00:01:20.340> really

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
they use low power so they're really

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.580 
they use low power so they're really
going<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:20.970> easy<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.210> find<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.439> there's<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
going to be easy to find so there's a

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.590 
going to be easy to find so there's a
couple<00:01:22.680> ways<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.070> do<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.340> one<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.330> just<00:01:24.509> did

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
couple ways to do this one is I just did

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.550 
couple ways to do this one is I just did
a<00:01:24.659> Google<00:01:24.840> search<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.759> I<00:01:26.759> found<00:01:26.840> a<00:01:27.840> table<00:01:28.320> with

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
a Google search and I found a table with

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.310 
a Google search and I found a table with
a<00:01:28.619> bunch<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.950> different<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.759> generic

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
a bunch of different just generic

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
a bunch of different just generic
appliance<00:01:31.320> rate<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.860> I'm<00:01:31.950> going<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.100> use<00:01:32.220> that

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
appliance rate so I'm going to use that

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.210 
appliance rate so I'm going to use that
for<00:01:32.520> my<00:01:32.610> air<00:01:32.759> conditioner<00:01:33.799> and<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.070> see

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
for my air conditioner and I can see

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.620 
for my air conditioner and I can see
right<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:35.430> I've<00:01:35.700> got<00:01:35.729> my<00:01:36.030> air<00:01:36.180> conditioner<00:01:36.600> I

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
right here I've got my air conditioner I

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.370 
right here I've got my air conditioner I
have<00:01:36.689> two<00:01:36.900> options

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
have two options

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.679 
have two options
the<00:01:38.070> room<00:01:38.369> or<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.759> central<00:01:39.210> or<00:01:39.299> say<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.479> have

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the room or the central or say I have

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.410 
the room or the central or say I have
central<00:01:40.170> air<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:41.490> I'll<00:01:41.820> go<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.390> middle

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
central air so I'll go in the middle

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.389 
central air so I'll go in the middle
that<00:01:42.720> may<00:01:42.780> be<00:01:42.840> about<00:01:42.990> 3000<00:01:45.860> for<00:01:46.860> my<00:01:47.070> wattage

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
that may be about 3000 for my wattage

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.770 
that may be about 3000 for my wattage
okay<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> units<00:01:50.759> already<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.119> tops<00:01:51.329> we<00:01:51.570> need

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
okay the units already the tops we need

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.319 
okay the units already the tops we need
to<00:01:51.869> include<00:01:52.110> those<00:01:52.790> 92<00:01:53.790> estimate<00:01:54.090> how<00:01:54.270> many

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
to include those 92 estimate how many

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.080 
to include those 92 estimate how many
hours<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.930> day<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.909> it's<00:01:56.909> not

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
hours a day that it's on it's not

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.649 
hours a day that it's on it's not
running<00:01:57.360> all<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> time<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.290> I'll<00:01:58.409> say<00:01:58.590> maybe

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
running all the time so I'll say maybe

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.990 
running all the time so I'll say maybe
eight<00:02:00.659> hours<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:03.439> my<00:02:04.439> energy<00:02:04.920> used<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:05.939> you

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
eight hours and my energy used so you

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.789 
eight hours and my energy used so you
see<00:02:06.240> here<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.540> know<00:02:06.659> our<00:02:06.810> energy<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.350> our<00:02:07.530> power

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
see here we know our energy is our power

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.529 
see here we know our energy is our power
and<00:02:08.069> watts<00:02:08.310> times<00:02:08.640> our<00:02:08.849> time<00:02:09.090> we're<00:02:09.330> going<00:02:09.450> to

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
and watts times our time we're going to

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.660 
and watts times our time we're going to
get<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.410> would<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.709> watts<00:02:11.009> times<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
get to this would be watts times the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.170 
get to this would be watts times the
number<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:11.940> hours

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
number of hours

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.460 
number of hours
so<00:02:13.390> I'm<00:02:13.450> going<00:02:13.599> to<00:02:13.629> take<00:02:13.750> three<00:02:14.019> thousand

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
so I'm going to take three thousand

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.539 
so I'm going to take three thousand
times<00:02:15.129> eight<00:02:16.439> I'm<00:02:17.439> going<00:02:17.709> to<00:02:17.769> get<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.069> use<00:02:18.370> about

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
times eight I'm going to get I use about

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.789 
times eight I'm going to get I use about
twenty<00:02:19.060> four<00:02:19.420> thousand<00:02:20.319> watt<00:02:21.069> hours<00:02:21.430> per<00:02:21.730> day

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
twenty four thousand watt hours per day

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.020 
twenty four thousand watt hours per day
and<00:02:23.799> we<00:02:24.040> know<00:02:24.189> though<00:02:24.400> that<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.670> energy

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
and we know though that the energy

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.250 
and we know though that the energy
company<00:02:25.390> isn't<00:02:25.780> going<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:25.959> charge<00:02:26.140> us<00:02:26.230> for

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
company isn't going to charge us for

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.350 
company isn't going to charge us for
what<00:02:26.470> hours<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.829> numbers<00:02:27.099> be<00:02:27.250> too<00:02:27.430> big<00:02:27.670> people

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
what hours the numbers be too big people

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.809 
what hours the numbers be too big people
won't<00:02:28.540> understand<00:02:28.959> them<00:02:29.200> so<00:02:29.379> instead<00:02:30.310> we're

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
won't understand them so instead we're

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.339 
won't understand them so instead we're
going<00:02:30.849> to<00:02:30.970> use<00:02:31.030> kilowatt<00:02:31.599> hours<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:32.200> be

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
going to use kilowatt hours to be

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.770 
going to use kilowatt hours to be
charged<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:33.129> I<00:02:33.159> need<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.459> convert<00:02:33.549> that<00:02:33.790> it's

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
charged so I need to convert that it's

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.179 
charged so I need to convert that it's
pretty<00:02:35.019> easy<00:02:35.140> conversion<00:02:35.530> going<00:02:35.859> from<00:02:36.010> watts

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:36.189 
pretty easy conversion going from watts

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.250 
pretty easy conversion going from watts
to<00:02:36.370> our<00:02:36.519> kilowatts<00:02:37.180> I'm<00:02:37.810> just<00:02:37.989> going<00:02:38.109> to<00:02:38.140> move

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
to our kilowatts I'm just going to move

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.530 
to our kilowatts I'm just going to move
the<00:02:38.379> decimal<00:02:38.409> three<00:02:39.010> places<00:02:39.269> so<00:02:40.269> I'm<00:02:40.329> going<00:02:40.480> to

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
the decimal three places so I'm going to

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.349 
the decimal three places so I'm going to
use<00:02:40.689> 24<00:02:41.439> keep<00:02:42.370> all<00:02:42.489> my<00:02:42.519> significant<00:02:43.090> digits

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
use 24 keep all my significant digits

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.979 
use 24 keep all my significant digits
there<00:02:43.540> Oh<00:02:44.250> took<00:02:45.250> them<00:02:45.370> away<00:02:45.459> anyways<00:02:45.989> 24

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
there Oh took them away anyways 24

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.039 
there Oh took them away anyways 24
kilowatt<00:02:47.769> hours<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:49.450> then<00:02:49.629> lastly<00:02:49.900> we're

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
kilowatt hours and then lastly we're

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.020 
kilowatt hours and then lastly we're
going<00:02:50.139> to<00:02:50.200> do<00:02:50.319> to<00:02:50.409> charge<00:02:50.680> an<00:02:50.980> average<00:02:51.790> charge

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
going to do to charge an average charge

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.330 
going to do to charge an average charge
nowadays<00:02:52.510> is<00:02:52.690> about<00:02:52.870> fourteen<00:02:53.379> cents<00:02:53.829> so

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
nowadays is about fourteen cents so

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.069 
nowadays is about fourteen cents so
we're<00:02:54.579> going<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.730> take<00:02:54.970> our<00:02:55.239> energy<00:02:55.930> our

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
we're going to take our energy our

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.440 
we're going to take our energy our
kilowatt<00:02:56.560> hours<00:02:56.829> times<00:02:57.459> fourteen<00:02:57.939> cents<00:02:58.299> per

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
kilowatt hours times fourteen cents per

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.500 
kilowatt hours times fourteen cents per
kilowatt<00:02:58.870> hours<00:02:59.670> to<00:03:00.670> get<00:03:00.760> our<00:03:00.879> total<00:03:01.090> costs

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
kilowatt hours to get our total costs

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.429 
kilowatt hours to get our total costs
for<00:03:01.659> one<00:03:01.689> day<00:03:02.400> now<00:03:03.400> I<00:03:03.459> can<00:03:03.639> do<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.790> same<00:03:03.939> thing

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439 
for one day now I can do the same thing

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.699 
for one day now I can do the same thing
with<00:03:05.439> my<00:03:05.650> TV<00:03:06.900> now<00:03:07.900> my<00:03:08.019> TV<00:03:08.319> I'm<00:03:08.409> going<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.620> do<00:03:08.680> a

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
with my TV now my TV I'm going to do a

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:09.960 
with my TV now my TV I'm going to do a
little<00:03:08.829> differently<00:03:09.189> I'm<00:03:09.579> actually<00:03:09.700> going<00:03:09.909> to

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
little differently I'm actually going to

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.059 
little differently I'm actually going to
look<00:03:10.209> on<00:03:10.359> the<00:03:10.480> back<00:03:10.569> of<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.840> TV<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.769> see<00:03:11.920> what

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
look on the back of the TV to see what

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.780 
look on the back of the TV to see what
my<00:03:12.189> power<00:03:12.430> rating<00:03:12.849> is<00:03:13.920> so<00:03:14.920> I'm<00:03:15.099> going<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.459> look

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
my power rating is so I'm going to look

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.099 
my power rating is so I'm going to look
and<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.090> found<00:03:16.329> out<00:03:16.480> mine<00:03:16.659> is<00:03:16.870> about<00:03:17.079> 350<00:03:17.949> watts

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
and I found out mine is about 350 watts

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.460 
and I found out mine is about 350 watts
and<00:03:20.109> we'll<00:03:20.410> say<00:03:20.590> I<00:03:20.620> watch<00:03:20.949> about<00:03:22.139> 10.5<00:03:23.139> you<00:03:23.349> can

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
and we'll say I watch about 10.5 you can

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.020 
and we'll say I watch about 10.5 you can
see<00:03:23.650> here<00:03:23.829> you<00:03:23.949> can<00:03:23.980> sort<00:03:24.310> of<00:03:24.370> estimate<00:03:24.849> and

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
see here you can sort of estimate and

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.589 
see here you can sort of estimate and
adjust<00:03:25.359> hours<00:03:26.139> per<00:03:26.379> day<00:03:26.910> so<00:03:27.910> when<00:03:28.030> I<00:03:28.060> calculate

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
adjust hours per day so when I calculate

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.640 
adjust hours per day so when I calculate
that<00:03:28.629> out<00:03:29.250> I'm<00:03:30.250> going<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.430> take<00:03:30.549> my<00:03:30.699> 1.5<00:03:31.650> times

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650
