00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
hard to do so put on our glitch dope I

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.990 
hard to do so put on our glitch dope I
wouldn't<00:03:08.770> recommend<00:03:09.010> using<00:03:09.610> it<00:03:09.850> for

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
wouldn't recommend using it for

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.260 
wouldn't recommend using it for
speedruns<00:03:10.390> but<00:03:10.650> if<00:03:11.650> you<00:03:11.890> get<00:03:12.640> good<00:03:12.790> at<00:03:12.970> it<00:03:13.000> then

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
speedruns but if you get good at it then

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.190 
speedruns but if you get good at it then
you<00:03:13.390> can<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.890> only<00:03:15.070> bad<00:03:15.190> thing<00:03:15.250> is<00:03:15.520> that<00:03:16.200> you

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
you can the only bad thing is that you

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.930 
you can the only bad thing is that you
cannot<00:03:17.650> go<00:03:18.010> back<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:20.280> because<00:03:21.280> it's<00:03:21.460> kind<00:03:21.790> of

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
cannot go back so because it's kind of

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.220 
cannot go back so because it's kind of
really<00:03:22.660> hard<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:24.090> find<00:03:25.090> this<00:03:25.570> thing<00:03:25.840> because

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
really hard to find this thing because

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.120 
really hard to find this thing because
it's<00:03:26.380> so<00:03:26.620> skinny<00:03:27.040> it's<00:03:27.250> almost<00:03:27.490> impossible<00:03:27.910> so

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130

the music receptor Thanks that took
their<00:05:42.040> lever<00:05:42.280> is<00:05:42.430> called<00:05:42.840> playing<00:05:43.840> it's

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
their lever is called playing it's

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.220 
their lever is called playing it's
called<00:05:44.200> Eclipse<00:05:44.530> actually

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
called Eclipse actually

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.020 
called Eclipse actually
but<00:05:46.800> you<00:05:46.890> can<00:05:47.070> explore<00:05:47.550> a<00:05:47.610> lot<00:05:47.790> with<00:05:48.000> that

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
but you can explore a lot with that

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.970 
but you can explore a lot with that
glitch<00:05:48.450> and<00:05:48.870> I<00:05:49.050> think<00:05:49.290> that's<00:05:49.500> pretty<00:05:49.680> cool

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
glitch and I think that's pretty cool

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.610 
glitch and I think that's pretty cool
and<00:05:50.250> I<00:05:51.090> do<00:05:51.360> believe<00:05:51.480> I<00:05:51.660> found<00:05:51.960> loaded<00:05:52.470> these

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
and I do believe I found loaded these

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.180 
and I do believe I found loaded these
glitches<00:05:52.890> so<00:05:53.430> and<00:05:54.090> you<00:05:55.080> could<00:05:55.230> skip<00:05:55.530> that<00:05:55.950> do

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
glitches so and you could skip that do

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.970 
glitches so and you could skip that do

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
that by using that glitch and just jump

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:11.090 
that by using that glitch and just jump
in<00:06:06.570> behind<00:06:06.720> the<00:06:07.560> wall<00:06:08.300> so<00:06:09.300> yeah<00:06:09.510> I<00:06:09.950> hope<00:06:10.950> you
