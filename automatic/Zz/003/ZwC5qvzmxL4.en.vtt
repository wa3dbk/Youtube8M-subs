later that coo coo I think that's his
name<00:01:53.060> whatever<00:01:54.060> they<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.420> other<00:01:54.600> big<00:01:54.990> guy

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
name whatever they the other big guy

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.350 
name whatever they the other big guy
that<00:01:55.530> was<00:01:55.890> killed<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.369> previous<00:01:56.700> chapter<00:01:56.729> or

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
that was killed the previous chapter or

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.020 
that was killed the previous chapter or
two<00:01:57.540> chapters<00:01:58.140> ago<00:01:58.259> he's<00:01:59.009> also<00:01:59.310> got<00:01:59.610> poisoned

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
two chapters ago he's also got poisoned

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.520 
two chapters ago he's also got poisoned
so<00:02:00.149> really<00:02:00.420> Wulfen<00:02:00.840> wasn't<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.320> one<00:02:01.500> that

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
so really Wulfen wasn't the one that

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.920 
so really Wulfen wasn't the one that
killed<00:02:01.829> him<00:02:02.040> Keith<00:02:02.250> he<00:02:02.549> hit<00:02:02.850> him<00:02:03.000> but<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.659> guy

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
killed him Keith he hit him but that guy

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.020 
killed him Keith he hit him but that guy
died<00:02:04.229> by<00:02:04.619> himself<00:02:05.100> because<00:02:05.399> he<00:02:05.729> was<00:02:05.880> also

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
died by himself because he was also

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.660 
died by himself because he was also
poisoned<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.719> guess<00:02:06.960> then<00:02:07.799> going<00:02:08.640> through

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
poisoned so I guess then going through

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.360 
poisoned so I guess then going through
that<00:02:08.910> scene<00:02:09.360> where<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.929> rose<00:02:10.129> poison<00:02:11.129> bomb

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370

clear bomb exploded and helping the key

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.730 
clear bomb exploded and helping the key

r-ky i believe it's being dragged out
this<00:04:53.370> should<00:04:53.580> have<00:04:53.699> ended<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.270> while<00:04:54.539> ago<00:04:54.600> but

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.870 
this should have ended a while ago but
no<00:04:55.470> it's<00:04:56.220> dragging<00:04:56.699> out<00:04:56.820> I<00:04:57.120> kind<00:04:57.600> of<00:04:57.720> feel<00:04:57.990> that

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.080 
no it's dragging out I kind of feel that
that<00:04:59.880> the<00:05:00.210> whole<00:05:00.740> the<00:05:01.740> guy<00:05:01.919> that<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.639> old<00:05:02.849> guy

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
that the whole the guy that the old guy

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.749 
that the whole the guy that the old guy
he<00:05:03.479> should<00:05:03.690> have<00:05:03.810> been<00:05:04.020> able<00:05:04.289> to<00:05:04.620> kill<00:05:05.039> the

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
he should have been able to kill the

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.180 
he should have been able to kill the
king<00:05:06.030> back<00:05:06.570> when<00:05:06.750> he<00:05:06.840> killed<00:05:07.050> him<00:05:07.229> fufu<00:05:07.860> and

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
king back when he killed him fufu and

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.950 
king back when he killed him fufu and
picou<00:05:08.910> or<00:05:09.120> whatever<00:05:09.389> the<00:05:09.509> hell<00:05:09.599> their<00:05:09.750> names

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
picou or whatever the hell their names

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.600 
picou or whatever the hell their names
are<00:05:10.139> they<00:05:10.500> shouldn't<00:05:10.860> have<00:05:10.949> saved<00:05:11.160> the<00:05:11.400> king

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
are they shouldn't have saved the king

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.790 
are they shouldn't have saved the king
that's<00:05:12.300> what<00:05:12.539> I<00:05:12.570> think<00:05:12.900> where<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:13.169> art<00:05:13.530> should

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
that's what I think where the art should

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.290 
that's what I think where the art should
have<00:05:13.949> ended<00:05:14.130> but<00:05:14.400> no<00:05:14.610> they're<00:05:14.820> dragging<00:05:15.210> it

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
have ended but no they're dragging it

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.230 
have ended but no they're dragging it
out<00:05:15.419> so<00:05:15.620> i<00:05:16.620> hope<00:05:17.190> this<00:05:17.370> art<00:05:17.669> doesn't<00:05:17.940> have<00:05:18.090> too

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
out so i hope this art doesn't have too

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.330 
out so i hope this art doesn't have too
much<00:05:18.389> because<00:05:18.599> last<00:05:19.530> chapter<00:05:19.949> was<00:05:20.130> said<00:05:20.310> that

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
much because last chapter was said that

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.529 
much because last chapter was said that
