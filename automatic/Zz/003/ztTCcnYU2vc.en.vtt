00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.900
 hi girls, how are you? 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:12.360
 well today I bring Sept. 1 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.449
 that I just did like that sinaloa style 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.480
 with much third dimension and pebbles 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:21.600
 there I will hit me now elche with this 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.530
 resin that I love sticks very well 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.380
 called zinc and this is good there and I am 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.470
 cutting up 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.470
 ah 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.239
 and here I will put next band this 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.210
 remember they are two layers there I just 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:43.409
 I show a layer and I want to share 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.409
 this tragedy look 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.320
 oh it's not that it was closed and I did not 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.540
 had realized then he threw a 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.170
 little but it's over there's no problem 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.170
 two 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.030
 well here I'm going to put a layer of 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.640
 acrylic crystal to the natural nail nothing 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.770
 more because we are going to use what is free 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.470
 and then I'm going to do it all over the nail 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.470
 that when I retire I do not want 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.470
 fight 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.610
 I want to give credit to girls for 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:28.510
 its beautiful mixtures once of sant the 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.000
 lions the other one is massive 49 11 and the 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.480
 another is mel and so many 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.480
 Thank you 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.610
 here we are going to do as a kind of 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.100
 Blurred always battled can say 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.979
 this word good and battaglia a little 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.500
 with the rosita and the lodging because as 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.229
 They were very funky they had a lot of decoration and 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.070
 then yes it is a little battle but not 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:58.310
 it's impossible true so already after 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.000
 so more or less we have left and we're going to 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.000
 encapsulate 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.590
 and 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.610
 or not 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:31.310
 then we will file very well and also 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.310
 let's polish 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.970
 then we will remove all the excess 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.240
 powder 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.830
 and we are going to clean with a wipe with 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.180
 Uruguay a little house 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.280
 ah 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.870
 well here sorry they had done 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.450
 one flower I forgot that I was not 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.230
 recording but we are going to do 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.750
 flowers really of the style that 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.230
 you want but I'm not here 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.439
 experts the flowers but there as I 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.780
 They came out and remember that I myself 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:11.549
 enough that there is that they do not have to 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.629
 leave the same because the flowers are not 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:18.870
 same but good, well, they can not 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.069
 they came out so bad really not so bad that 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.060
 let say 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.660
 and this well we are going to put flowers in 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.840
 all the nails 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.440
 I usually put like three flowers in 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:38.750
 each nail and I made some four petals 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:41.600
 others of three or three of two up to one of 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.190
 there is a petal but in all the 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.930
 We are going to make nails 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:52.829
 As you can see, look and you're done 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.079
 the third dimension finished now 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.599
 we are going to put pebbles in each of 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.930
 the flowers and we are also going to put them 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.930
 outside 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:07.320
 this part was erased girls but good 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.730
 I'm going to put the place in go the 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.040

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.640
