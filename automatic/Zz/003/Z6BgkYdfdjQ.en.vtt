00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.449
 team that loses they took the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.520
 vitamin 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.559

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.359

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.570

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.489
 mc williams fc offers us a very 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.340
 very good team with lukaku man of the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.080
 match the purses the guys you know 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.670
 look i'm not going to introduce you a 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.930
 because yes maybe you 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.040
 know better than me and not when 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.490
 even because they are pretty well known 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.810
 kevin guys we're gone that's going very 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.380
 quickly we will try to give our 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.540
 maximum 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.950
 I hope we will continue 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.869
 this series as far as possible 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.200
 until the final why not to peter 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.220
 crouch 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.710
 he spits you hot blood today 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.869
 I feel that you slept well my friend 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.460
 sense that you have not got a good one 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.390
 good morning you're ready to go 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.820
 do a good workout 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.640
 the coach was proud of you why I 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.170
 go too far as it was going to go 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.280
 why bring the score to it is not 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.170
 with a strike like that you would like 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.820
 the square post no no no no 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.320
 I want it to come empty when 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.259
 even though hey they are not three but 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.930
 left no longer ok that and to arte tyson 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.210
 fire arctic ate the lion all alone a 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.040
 little lion in fact I wanted 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.350
 tell you about something important is dead 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.180
 slice bourgois in real because we have 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.950
 a conversation with my father we went 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.799
 asked 600 balls and a march 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.450
 it was 100 balls and a march or 100 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.220
 bullets and a squarely march the bar 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.420
 chocolate so tell me ki sik had 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.950
 reason that I prove to him that they had 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.599
 wrong it's brushless next march for 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.150
 to make a game not on barry sees the 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.700
 is still a barrel 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.560
 oh no no we know how fast is like 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.450
 and the empty post and the too fast he goes 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.220
 too fast refers the adoption of boost 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.650
 lukaku is paying attention attention 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.690
 it starts very badly ok so at 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.640
 beware lukaku wild ride are the 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.350
 target of a red cross guys is not 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.700
 the small cross peter crouch for lack of 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.110
 to have a good breakfast is what 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.269

 crawls it's a crazy thing 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.090
 I have the impression that there are people 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.430
 behind who pull them all these standards 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.890

 frankly to 1 0 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.230
 the stats are pretty balanced 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.829
 frankly little my place like that it's 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.420
 too salty 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.799

 it's inevitably a fault that and that 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.830
 deserves even a very player- friendly red card 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.700

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.680

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:31.980
 roger no y'a port game for the offside 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.320
 600 meters at least serious how 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.000
 that it encapsulates the throat and its places not 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.470
 but serious and more urgent went gas 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.730
 not finished not finished not 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.990
 finished the guys there you have to mark them 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.970
 guys if we want to come back we have to score 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.260
 there is no other choice possible 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.700

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.740
 slow are like so they go to two to 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.330
 the time so we are directly and online 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.820
 in the quarterfinals it does not matter the 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.440
 this is how we will have given our 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.169
 the best we got ourselves from 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.820

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.660
 see everywhere in wholesale so guys

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.190
 competition in better bases 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.570
