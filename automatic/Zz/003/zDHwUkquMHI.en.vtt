00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:08.760
 yes hello today a video for 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.219
 Variation in German because this is here 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.200
 what is really just that 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.699
 German know there is a 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.140
 German cabaret artists act and 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:22.279
 so now was a video in German 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.170
 from mom tiny little ones 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.170
 record collection and that would be me 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.700
 today two beautiful rare 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:37.790
 show records from gerd 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:43.020
 dudenhöffer as or dudenhöffer 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.809
 better known as heinz becker and me 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.890
 believe that was here 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.559
 as far as I know the first 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.579
 release of gerd dudenhöffer 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:58.350
 aka heinz becker with the title and 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.359
 twelve apps can be found live 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.920
 cuts but also with the cuts 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:08.869
 from the studio and we already see heinz 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.000
 Becker at that time still with schnauzer so 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.619
 He actually has that relatively 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.619
 filed quickly 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:26.750
 yes even the back we are now times 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:37.500
 At the time, people liked to be without heinz becker 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.790
 costume without backup and thereby he 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.939
 then also a few words to the 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:49.130
 history like it at all or like that 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.130
 figure-Heinz Becker came 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.780
 dear 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.190
 so it is a beautiful rare 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.250
 Also in a very nice record 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.280
 very good condition 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:29.020
 and here we see what there so everything 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:31.240
 it's always a bit like that 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:37.030
 in exchange 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:41.980
 So it's already live is live 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.540
 stage experienced case is then in the studio 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:49.760
 somehow heinz becker then somehow 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:52.850
 always somehow guest at sr3 was in the 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:57.220
 studio when going to a center then 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:00.530
 Swimming pool is back on the stage 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.470
 caller austria is back in the studio 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.880
 Lotto is on stage and twelve guests 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.610
 digitally back on stage in the studio 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:15.430
 Hairdresser back on the stage in the studio 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.430
 and scratch again on the stage 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.920
 So I think that's where it comes from 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.310
 often from a time as small 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.459
 antiche started and scratch those are 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.959
 So two things where Gerd Dudenhöffer 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.829
 somehow still with another 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:36.610
 program on tour was just as the 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:40.070
 Dudenhöfer I assume where then 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:43.130
 heinz becker then only at the beginning 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:47.680
 and at the end of time a secondary character 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:50.720
 that is the first one 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.670
 heinz becker record I have 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.840
 I then have the other programs 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:59.090
 cd or im taken by tv 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.840
 pity that the new stage programs 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.510
 it's no longer on dvd or cd 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.380
 be published but only 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.780
 once a year 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.660
 somehow be shown on TV 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:16.239
 and that is the second plate I have 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.239
 have wallpaper change 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:24.199
 that's a complete one now 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:27.979
 program and the cool one is seen 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:30.650
 if you look backlighting like that here 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:33.500
 schallplatte the case looks like 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:39.280
 Such a raspberry wallpaper and feels 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.280
 also so beautifully done 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:50.960
 back yes that here are now 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.940
 in some cases you can do that too 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.050
 a bit like the family series 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:05:01.600
 heinz becker knows so the cabinet then 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:06.410
 few things from dummies us silvers from 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:09.010
 Recycling has always been there too 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.010
 been 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:16.810
 the ba that was so I believe mine too 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:19.639
 complete series by family heinz becker 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.280
 The dentist has not 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.680
 with nothing with the later 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.930
 Dental visit from family to do so 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.010
 that is something else but that 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:33.050
 Staff work that you know then again 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.780
 and jarome I still have 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.380
 nowhere else but salt 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.380
 on the record 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:57.759
 As I said the vinyl records are too 

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:57.759
 Everyone would come out here 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.010
 they're all in one too 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:39.600
 good condition must really say so 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:44.640
 no scratches or anything else that is 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:46.850
 so my 21 becker rarities that is so 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.980
 well I've had of course other 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:52.500
 program is like mp3 or somehow 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:58.670
 taken in by the tv 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:07:01.380
 or then bought just as cd so 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:04.380
 actually, I would have to do it all now 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.280
 programs from heinz becker to the ever 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.290
 has made 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.200
 I think a bug somehow 

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.760
 still somehow times on cassettes clock 

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.330
 I've even published 

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:20.900
 not exactly but otherwise I have 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:24.620
