real<00:00:20.090> to<00:00:20.119> fancy<00:00:20.840> some<00:00:21.830> of<00:00:21.949> them<00:00:22.070> don't<00:00:22.519> even

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
real to fancy some of them don't even

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.790 
real to fancy some of them don't even
really<00:00:23.029> sound<00:00:23.420> like<00:00:23.480> these<00:00:23.840> but<00:00:24.199> their<00:00:24.619> work

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
really sound like these but their work

00:00:24.800 --> 00:01:03.040 
really sound like these but their work
is<00:00:28.539> either<00:01:00.130> and<00:01:01.130> then<00:01:01.700> just<00:01:01.940> its<00:01:02.720> first

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
is either and then just its first

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.290 
is either and then just its first
emulate<00:01:03.530> to<00:01:03.740> these<00:01:03.950> come<00:01:04.220> in<00:01:04.460> going<00:01:05.059> in<00:01:05.210> the

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
emulate to these come in going in the

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.870 
emulate to these come in going in the
way<00:01:05.420> that's<00:01:06.080> why<00:01:06.290> I<00:01:06.320> use<00:01:06.560> it<00:01:06.800> for<00:01:07.400> when<00:01:07.730> they're

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
way that's why I use it for when they're

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.570 
way that's why I use it for when they're
way<00:01:08.030> out<00:01:08.270> or<00:01:08.810> when<00:01:09.680> they're<00:01:09.860> sliding<00:01:10.310> off<00:01:10.550> the

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
way out or when they're sliding off the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.090 
way out or when they're sliding off the
edge<00:01:10.760> getting<00:01:11.450> out<00:01:11.780> I<00:01:12.020> want<00:01:12.230> to<00:01:12.290> come<00:01:12.560> back

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
edge getting out I want to come back

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.190 
edge getting out I want to come back
makes<00:01:13.700> it<00:01:13.850> selling<00:01:14.210> to<00:01:14.360> DISA<00:01:14.570> go<00:01:14.840> then<00:01:15.050> they

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
makes it selling to DISA go then they

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.600 
makes it selling to DISA go then they
want<00:01:15.410> to<00:01:15.500> come<00:01:15.710> back<00:01:15.950> around<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:16.430> take

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610

want to come back around and take
another<00:01:16.850> look<00:01:17.000> at<00:01:17.330> it

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
another look at it

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
noise going because these don't really

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.520 
noise going because these don't really
did<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:29.810> know<00:01:29.930> quiet

what about the geese would come dude you
know<00:01:32.390> I<00:01:32.420> just<00:01:32.750> usually<00:01:33.320> do<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:34.010> little<00:01:34.400> bit<00:01:34.520> of

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
know I just usually do a little bit of

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:54.100 
know I just usually do a little bit of
context<00:01:35.030> stuff<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.659> shows<00:01:35.690> like<00:01:53.110> here's

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
context stuff and it shows like here's

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.620 
context stuff and it shows like here's
low<00:01:54.530> volume<00:01:55.010> so<00:01:55.280> I'll<00:01:55.430> blow<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.640> detail<00:01:56.120> but

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
low volume so I'll blow the detail but

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.440 
low volume so I'll blow the detail but
it<00:01:56.720> still<00:01:57.020> keeps<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.500> excited<00:01:58.010> sail<00:01:58.299> you<00:01:59.299> know

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
it still keeps the excited sail you know

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.240 
it still keeps the excited sail you know
it's<00:01:59.659> just<00:01:59.810> I'm<00:02:00.110> mixing<00:02:00.500> you<00:02:00.799> know<00:02:00.860> just<00:02:01.159> a

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.300 
it's just I'm mixing you know just a
couple<00:02:01.460> different<00:02:01.850> cloths<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:03.500> then<00:02:03.770> I'll<00:02:04.070> do

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
couple different cloths and then I'll do

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.670 
couple different cloths and then I'll do
that<00:02:04.490> little<00:02:04.729> what<00:02:05.180> I<00:02:05.210> call<00:02:05.540> a<00:02:05.720> stall<00:02:06.380> clock

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
that little what I call a stall clock

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.059 
that little what I call a stall clock
where<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.040> says<00:02:07.220> in<00:02:07.760> just<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.209> murmur<00:02:08.690> of

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
where it says in just a murmur of

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.440 
where it says in just a murmur of
the<00:02:09.249> clock<00:02:09.939> is<00:02:10.980> and<00:02:11.980> that<00:02:12.219> just<00:02:12.549> emulates<00:02:12.969> some

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
the clock is and that just emulates some

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.179 
the clock is and that just emulates some
geese<00:02:13.689> you<00:02:13.959> know<00:02:14.109> do<00:02:14.319> remember<00:02:14.739> some<00:02:14.980> geese

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
geese you know do remember some geese

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.459 
geese you know do remember some geese
clucking<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:16.239> know<00:02:16.359> I<00:02:16.389> just<00:02:16.659> try<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:16.900> keep<00:02:17.079> a

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.469 
clucking you know I just try to keep a

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.349 
clucking you know I just try to keep a
little<00:02:17.590> bit<00:02:17.769> of<00:02:17.859> noise<00:02:17.980> going<00:02:18.519> when<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.180> geese

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359 
little bit of noise going when the geese

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:23.459 
little bit of noise going when the geese
are<00:02:19.540> covered<00:02:19.840> in<00:02:20.579> but<00:02:21.579> not<00:02:21.939> overly<00:02:22.810> loud<00:02:23.079> I<00:02:23.319> do

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:23.469 
are covered in but not overly loud I do

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.399 
are covered in but not overly loud I do
that<00:02:23.650> I<00:02:23.829> choke<00:02:24.099> down<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.670> tall<00:02:24.879> I<00:02:25.180> use<00:02:26.049> a<00:02:26.079> flute

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
that I choke down the tall I use a flute

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.440 
that I choke down the tall I use a flute
most<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.799> time<00:02:27.010> when<00:02:27.579> I'm<00:02:27.700> out<00:02:27.819> hunting<00:02:28.090> so

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
most of the time when I'm out hunting so

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.259 
most of the time when I'm out hunting so
I<00:02:28.530> don't<00:02:29.530> know<00:02:29.799> you<00:02:30.280> know<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.639> don't<00:02:30.849> have<00:02:30.969> a<00:02:31.030> lot

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.660 
I don't know you know I don't have a lot
of<00:02:31.299> volume<00:02:31.599> as<00:02:32.019> it<00:02:32.260> is<00:02:32.439> well<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.129> took<00:02:33.189> it<00:02:33.400> down

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
of volume as it is well I took it down

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.050 
of volume as it is well I took it down
so<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.090> don't<00:02:34.150> blow<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.510> geese<00:02:34.750> out<00:02:35.879> you<00:02:36.879> know
