this<00:00:24.060> point<00:00:24.320> we've<00:00:25.320> pretty<00:00:25.529> much<00:00:25.619> got

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
this point we've pretty much got

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.269 
this point we've pretty much got
everything<00:00:26.010> except<00:00:26.789> for<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.480> upgrade<00:00:31.279> and

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
everything except for the upgrade and

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.170 
everything except for the upgrade and
get<00:00:32.520> some<00:00:32.730> better<00:00:32.910> armor<00:00:34.370> this<00:00:35.370> dungeon<00:00:36.000> is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
get some better armor this dungeon is

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.520 
get some better armor this dungeon is
obviously<00:00:37.110> covered<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:37.800> ice<00:00:37.920> andrew<00:00:38.520> slippery

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
obviously covered in ice andrew slippery

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.459 
obviously covered in ice andrew slippery
it's<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:41.239> pretty<00:00:42.239> long<00:00:42.510> just<00:00:42.989> because<00:00:43.260> we

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
it's it's pretty long just because we

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.049 
it's it's pretty long just because we
have<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.710> do<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> fair<00:00:44.219> amount<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.460> backtracking

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
have to do a fair amount of backtracking

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.300 
have to do a fair amount of backtracking
pilot<00:00:45.660> treatable<00:00:46.110> get<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.219> boss

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
pilot treatable get to the boss

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.640 
pilot treatable get to the boss
so

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.590 

but<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.370> pretty<00:00:53.700> it's<00:00:54.030> pretty<00:00:54.120> linear

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
but it's pretty it's pretty linear

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.280 
but it's pretty it's pretty linear
getting<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.960> it's<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.170> little

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
getting to that it's just a little

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.170 
getting to that it's just a little
tricky<00:00:58.560> because<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.250> kind<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.580> a<00:00:59.640> big<00:00:59.850> place

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
tricky because it is kind of a big place

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.120 
tricky because it is kind of a big place
so<00:01:02.000> pretty<00:01:03.000> much<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.680> check<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.800> out<00:01:04.920> and

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.130 
so pretty much just check it out and

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:36.179 
so pretty much just check it out and
I'll<00:01:05.610> chime<00:01:05.910> in<00:01:06.150> here<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.480> there<00:01:09.140> necessary

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.520 

I<00:01:37.189> guess<00:01:37.759> once<00:01:38.330> if<00:01:38.509> they're<00:01:38.720> beginning<00:01:38.960> was

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
I guess once if they're beginning was

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.359 
I guess once if they're beginning was
a<00:01:40.560> lot<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.159> these<00:01:41.310> floors<00:01:41.850> have<00:01:42.299> those<00:01:43.369> ice

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
a lot of these floors have those ice

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.690 
a lot of these floors have those ice
pieces<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.440> if<00:01:46.440> we<00:01:46.470> do<00:01:46.979> things<00:01:47.310> as<00:01:47.520> dash

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
pieces on and if we do things as dash

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.850 
pieces on and if we do things as dash
you<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.360> actually<00:01:48.479> help<00:01:48.720> straighten<00:01:49.140> up<00:01:49.320> so

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
you can actually help straighten up so

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.140 
you can actually help straighten up so
if<00:01:49.920> you're<00:01:50.040> having<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.310> little<00:01:50.460> hard<00:01:50.610> time<00:01:50.820> we

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
if you're having a little hard time we

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:59.110 
if you're having a little hard time we
move<00:01:51.360> away

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.700 

now<00:02:00.120> in<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.360> room<00:02:00.600> I'm<00:02:00.840> trying<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.500> get<00:02:01.650> to

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
now in this room I'm trying to get to

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.460 
now in this room I'm trying to get to
the<00:02:01.830> North<00:02:02.810> eliminate<00:02:03.810> these<00:02:03.930> guys<00:02:04.140> just

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
the North eliminate these guys just

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.469 
the North eliminate these guys just
because<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.860> fundamentally<00:02:08.210> what<00:02:09.210> you<00:02:09.330> want

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
because it fundamentally what you want

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.020 
because it fundamentally what you want
to<00:02:09.539> do<00:02:09.660> there<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:09.990> there's<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.259> spot<00:02:10.970> so<00:02:11.970> you

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
to do there is there's a spot so you

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.020 
to do there is there's a spot so you
want<00:02:12.300> bomb<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.720> either<00:02:13.230> by<00:02:13.910> flipping<00:02:14.910> the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
want bomb it either by flipping the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.550 
want bomb it either by flipping the
switch<00:02:15.300> or<00:02:15.570> just<00:02:15.750> throwing<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.140> bomb<00:02:16.320> I<00:02:16.350> think

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
switch or just throwing a bomb I think

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.980 
switch or just throwing a bomb I think
it<00:02:16.770> just<00:02:16.800> possible

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.110 

another<00:02:22.680> way<00:02:22.830> before<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.370> fall<00:02:23.640> down<00:02:23.670> there

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
another way before you fall down there

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.350 
another way before you fall down there
you<00:02:24.240> obviously<00:02:24.690> have<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.990> flip<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.260> switch<00:02:25.500> so

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
you obviously have to flip the switch so

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.850 
you obviously have to flip the switch so
trick<00:02:27.360> here<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.630> when<00:02:28.140> you'll<00:02:28.170> use<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> couple

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
trick here is when you'll use a couple

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.350 
trick here is when you'll use a couple
more<00:02:28.980> times<00:02:29.190> throughout<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.520> game<00:02:29.700> which<00:02:30.330> is

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
more times throughout the game which is

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.500 
more times throughout the game which is
throw<00:02:31.320> your<00:02:31.500> boomerang<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.070> then<00:02:32.220> run<00:02:32.550> as<00:02:33.150> it

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
throw your boomerang and then run as it

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.560 
throw your boomerang and then run as it
arcs<00:02:33.900> back<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:34.470> in<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.040> switch<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:36.300> fall

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
arcs back to you in the switch and fall

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:43.730 
arcs back to you in the switch and fall
ah<00:02:39.710> this<00:02:40.710> is<00:02:40.830> where<00:02:41.010> we<00:02:41.130> get<00:02:41.280> seeded<00:02:42.740> bombing

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
ah this is where we get seeded bombing

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.230 
ah this is where we get seeded bombing

makes this particular dungeon a lot lot

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.199 
makes this particular dungeon a lot lot
easier<00:03:59.010> I've<00:04:00.010> actually<00:04:00.220> read<00:04:00.489> that

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
easier I've actually read that

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.850 
easier I've actually read that
surprisingly<00:04:02.200> number<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:02.500> people<00:04:02.709> didn't

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860
