00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.609
 now all kids who are so welcome 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.740
 to a new top about april fools day 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.870
 basically on April 1 that 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.670
 correspond the innocent saints in the USA 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.740
 in Japan and in other foreign countries 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.690
 the how you proceed you know all 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.490
 basically they say things and try 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.660
 that people swallow them so 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.039
 taking advantage of this day they make a 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.900
 small summary of which personally 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.300
 more has caught my attention in the 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.860
 last years let's start with 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.810
 journey one of the great games of 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.010
 playstation 3 one of the most titles 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.980
 Interesting independent panorama 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.809
 of the last generation because in 2012 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.550
 thatgamecompany posted a video on the 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.100
 which showed that a 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.030
 competitive multiplayer mode in the 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.760
 protagonist picture would launch missiles 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.809
 to attack the other enemies 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.300
 obviously this was quite shocking 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.819
 but watching the trailer the thing seemed 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.899
 real it was not like that and in fact we do not know 

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:49.760
 very well how would this have fitted 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.289
 within the journey universe but 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.220
 well the thing is like a curiosity 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.080
 quite interesting 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.850
 some companies are pretty horny 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.280
 if they try to always bring a smile 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.500
 player is the case for example of mo yan 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.690
 the creator studio of minecraft that in 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.430
 2013 announced that minecraft 2 was already 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.290
 in development and in addition to a lot of 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.670
 information on what this would include 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.590
 new version of the multimillionaire game 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.660
 for example new graphic languages 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.580
 ultra realistic and even convert the 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.230
 chickens in bloodthirsty enemies 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.760
 that would have attacked the character 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.140
 style of the zelda nests saga 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.300
 a pleasure is from another study quite 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.280
 interested in laughing at herself and together 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.810
 to his fans and that is for example in 2008 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.880
 they announced world of warcraft the 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.130
 mountain with his triumphant return to 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.630
 consoles in a spin-off well no1 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.250
 warcraft that would have included a 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.730
 multiplayer for 40 people and ones 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.590
 graphics let's say pulling retro 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.290
 leaving us a little behind the year 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.210
 1999 we find in fire fantasy gaiden 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.210
 one of the great jokes of this day 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.080
 when from gaming intelligence agency 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.390
 posted some photos of what had been 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.070
 a spin-off of final fantasy 8 that had 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.050
 been starred by safer wind 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.240
 thunder vix and wells nothing more and nothing less 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.860
 there were simply images but 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.470
 also a video what made that 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.980
 outside a priori quite true in the year 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.020
 99 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.370
 obviously the internet was not so 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.620
 extended as from knives the 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.510
 evidently radical jokes 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.160
 later it was known that it was simply a 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.780
 recording with game shark of the game 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.030
 original 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.730
 we can not dissociate this day from the great 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.710
 trailer that ign created with the movie of 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.450
 denning of zelda unfortunately we know 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.310
 that will never happen nintendo has 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.470
 denied the series that 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.180
 netflix was theoretically preparing but 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.920
 the great professionalism with which 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.240
 it was clear this trailer the real 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.520
 love towards the franchise that they had 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.260
 these images it is quite sad that I read 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.380
 cell does not end in the cinema but good 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.600
 excellent trailer excellent 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.400
 I think ign and that he slipped it to us all 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.580
 and another means that can not miss 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.430
 in a compilation about the epls is and 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.320
 james or electronic mobile gaming and this 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.140
 magazine is the great veteran at the time of 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.600
 with the jokes since 1991 and by 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.760
 example in 2007 announced more ranking 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.320
 exclusive wii doha arts that had 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.820
 included not only characters from the 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.100
 king of hearts franchise citizenship 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.410
 this 41 extracted from the universe of 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.270
 nintendo even though it showed a 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.400
 image of mario nicky and is now 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.470
 using the keyblade was confirmed 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.050
 that logically that was simply 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.460
 a joke nonetheless for a few hours 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.860
 that was quite credible 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.110
 we deal with the year 2002 when james 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.920
 he published that sonic tails were characters 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.510
 controllable in super smash bros feeling 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.210
 obviously this was false but 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.160
 curiously in the sequel to super 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.620
 smash bros brawl sonic yes that was 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.020
 controllable and smash yuqin aka creator 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.490
 of the hedgehog later confirmed that they are 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.170
 and that was really planned for 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.200
 super smash bros 1000 but that for lack 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.180
 of time could not be included but the 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.250
 best of all the jokes the most classic 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.890
 of all corresponds to street fighter 2 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.540
 already the character leave this name 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.430
 He appeared in one of the plants defeat 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.200
 and it was attributed to the teacher of relief that 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.970
 which in theory was a character 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.010
 secret of the game and to get to it 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.120
 you had to complete the arcade mode with 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.710
 a series of pretty conditions 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.390
 restrictive, such as beating 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.330
 all enemies without taking damage from 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.660
 none of them premonitory or 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.100
 do not 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.750
 yoshinori or did not include this character 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.370
 in this vice between 4 that yes with the 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.890
 name of gouken and having confirmed 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.430
 that this joke of the year 2092 served them 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.430
 as a point of inspiration 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.160
 and this small cyst review of the 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.140
 most curious jokes of april fools day 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.940
 I hope you liked the video in such 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.680
 case you can support it with a like a 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.940
 thumb up and basically that's it 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.940
 guys until the next video
