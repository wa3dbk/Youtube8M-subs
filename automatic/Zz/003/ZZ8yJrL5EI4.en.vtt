00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:05.120
 welcome both honest process i'm not tucking away and that's different that we 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.349
 in the parish church that caused another episode to fall silent 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.929
 ridiculous 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.859
 The new show Pau became a power failure today we have a number 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:18.250
 experienced rot for the found you certainly appreciate during 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.019
 carnival 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.900
 one looks for the videos 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.590
 the starting manager of sven kramer who illusion a connoisseur of the olympic 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.329
 play 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.909
 gold medal polder party first 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:31.140
 m he has finally stopped once 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.250
 what gets on it gets everywhere 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.250
 yourself looking at the studio anyway 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.650
 the stentor 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.030
 23 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.920
 the Hague 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.840
 it certainly 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.600
 they are 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.510
 And we may be glad that they have to deliver or prove none 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.080
 legal duty to experience pretty shocking stijn devolder 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.490
 if everything goes like a container that works through 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.320
 storm it over the bores after the parents but it turns out that like that bore 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.380
 The rest of the television cameras stand out because Holland starts 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.870
 who created us they both wanted to be had the excursion 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.580
 Fortunately the second half of the afternoon lasted 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.340
 time off 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.620
 pot 3 the moment you are able 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.720
 there is a big bus 8 the tradition to stand a chance 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.720
 he picks up an over wage who still has five heads 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.250
 a good working atmosphere and as a period 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.080
 hoegaarden just look at what the portuguese russia did children 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.730
 k 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.090
 4 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.090
 4 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.360
 I want you to invest because they are five years old 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.789
 congratulations were the crisis 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.030
 the citizen can there has taken the parole very tempting to the wrong one 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.359
 have a job does not know that there should be two pilots but that the role 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:19.109
 steamed from the wrong place namely from the taxiway instead of 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:19.819
 about 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.019
 start and runway not entirely tactical of that best man but fortunately 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.689
 is this indicates an abandoned people have arrived at the destination 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.069
 I apparently see it appear 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.539
 may we imagine how this could have happened 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:36.309
 but maybe it's time to change course for the buffalo tom 

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:38.559
 search the runway and runway 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:40.480
 what if you live in the Netherlands 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.730
 They're sleeping 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.799
 and all it brought by King Albert 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:45.710
 very simple 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.970
 because if you found the solution in all sorts of actions but he could 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.860
 stop to acknowledge that his sex addiction might be a big one 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.889
 problem is because he has to think for himself and so he is currently going into therapy 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:01.129
 I also don't think the bad idea is to print the book with this result within gender 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.409
 fine with this says sleep dozed in time to go out 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.069
 the pole women would be normal 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:12.290
 for anyone who doesn't know yet 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.870
 there is a new temporary location 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.849
 on me 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.909
 to all russia has its entire garden onlive with romans both new and it 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.109
 I can assume that he is not really want to hit az because it is 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.999
 a bit dangerous 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:27.930
 he never got 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.649
 you never know 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:31.649
 this from the attacks 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:32.879
 next summer 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.289
 come spring 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:36.139
 Kramer do the media market 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.569
 francs of the valleys, but some have a different one there 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.509
 then there can be an extended to the holding is still a nice in bed on the p 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:46.779
 average Dutch man and woman 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:51.219
 but now that it is also scientifically proven that blondes are good in bed 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:52.680
 is nice to hear 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.499
 for the two ladies themselves 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:58.740
 don't worry where he the ladies are maybe a little less went by 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.020
 if there is a lot better than what kind of material you have that dialogue with the 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.699
 stand all bond is 8 with the cap 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:11.059
 The sound of Opel by the snowfall users is also in use Ali Chatli 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.660
 is 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.659
 I answered something against and for something 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.879
 I don't want to remember you so take a look anyway 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:21.479
 enne don't forget a little hard to do sports 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.050
 nevertheless there were especially or so this carnival for more information left and right 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.449
 bradford look i see you again on wednesday and for the work 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.410
 netherlands but a much nicer role
