00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
and have the body controller flashed

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.060 
and have the body controller flashed
which<00:00:58.350> means<00:00:58.649> program<00:00:59.219> with<00:00:59.430> new<00:00:59.579> software<00:00:59.820> a

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
which means program with new software a

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.280 
which means program with new software a
temporary<00:01:02.070> fix<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.699> try<00:01:03.030> is

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
temporary fix you can try is

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.050 
temporary fix you can try is
disconnecting<00:01:04.290> battery<00:01:04.909> waiting<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.970> little

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
disconnecting battery waiting a little

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.539 
disconnecting battery waiting a little
while<00:01:06.270> let<00:01:06.930> me<00:01:07.020> back<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.260> may<00:01:08.040> work<00:01:08.280> for<00:01:08.520> a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
while let me back up may work for a

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.060 
while let me back up may work for a
little<00:01:08.670> while<00:01:09.080> but<00:01:10.080> more<00:01:10.320> than<00:01:10.409> likely<00:01:10.710> it's

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
little while but more than likely it's

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.980 
little while but more than likely it's
either<00:01:11.310> still<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> be<00:01:12.510> having<00:01:12.930> a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
either still going to be having a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.270 
either still going to be having a
problem<00:01:13.200> or<00:01:13.560> eventually<00:01:14.010> it's<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.220> to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
problem or eventually it's going to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.039 
problem or eventually it's going to
happen<00:01:14.520> again<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.630> only<00:01:15.810> permanent

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
happen again and the only permanent

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.249 
happen again and the only permanent
solution<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.729> software<00:01:18.259> take

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
solution is to have the software take

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.310 
solution is to have the software take
care<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.939> there<00:01:20.939> was<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> bulletin<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.049> came

more<00:01:38.230> detail<00:01:38.590> on<00:01:38.620> how<00:01:38.830> to<00:01:39.070> do<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.460> update<00:01:39.820> but

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
more detail on how to do the update but

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.750

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.700 
problem as I said and it is a 2005 model
only<00:01:48.940> and<00:01:49.570> you<00:01:49.900> need<00:01:50.050> to<00:01:50.170> visit<00:01:50.320> your<00:01:50.500> local

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710

dealership<00:01:52.410> probably<00:01:53.410> don't<00:01:53.530> even<00:01:53.620> need<00:01:53.770> to

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
dealership probably don't even need to

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.100 
dealership probably don't even need to
have<00:01:54.010> them<00:01:54.100> check<00:01:54.310> it<00:01:54.340> if<00:01:54.820> both<00:01:55.450> situations

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
have them check it if both situations

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.210 
have them check it if both situations
are<00:01:56.200> happening<00:01:56.500> just<00:01:56.650> tell<00:01:56.800> them<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:56.950> go<00:01:57.130> ahead

and<00:01:57.460> flash<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.479> body<00:01:58.660> controller<00:01:59.080> that<00:01:59.500> way

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
and flash the body controller that way
