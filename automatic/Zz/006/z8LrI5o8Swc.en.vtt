long<00:00:34.890> how<00:00:35.280> about<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:35.520> get<00:00:35.790> started

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.840 

okay<00:00:43.470> so<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> start<00:00:44.220> calibrating<00:00:44.760> our

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
okay so to start calibrating our

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.500 
okay so to start calibrating our
deadzones<00:00:45.300> first<00:00:45.810> we<00:00:46.140> press<00:00:46.410> f1<00:00:47.270> after<00:00:48.270> doing

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
deadzones first we press f1 after doing

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.020 
deadzones first we press f1 after doing
that<00:00:48.660> start<00:00:49.020> scrolling<00:00:49.470> up<00:00:49.830> and<00:00:50.040> as<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.880> can

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
that start scrolling up and as you can

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.630 
that start scrolling up and as you can
see<00:00:51.410> the<00:00:52.410> cursor<00:00:52.620> will<00:00:52.890> start<00:00:53.130> to<00:00:53.220> move<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
see the cursor will start to move to the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.170 
see the cursor will start to move to the
right<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:55.800> basically<00:00:56.460> what<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.790> want<00:00:56.970> to<00:00:57.060> do

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
right so basically what you want to do

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.110 
right so basically what you want to do
is<00:00:57.510> start<00:00:57.780> scrolling<00:00:58.170> down<00:00:58.670> until<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> cursor

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
is start scrolling down until the cursor

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.350 
is start scrolling down until the cursor
completely<00:01:00.840> stops<00:01:01.370> so<00:01:02.370> there's<00:01:02.550> no<00:01:03.000> movement

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
completely stops so there's no movement

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.990 
completely stops so there's no movement
happening<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.050> background<00:01:06.830> all<00:01:08.000> right

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
happening in the background all right

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.630 
happening in the background all right
that<00:01:09.330> looks<00:01:09.540> like<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.050> it<00:01:10.350> okay<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.400> after

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
that looks like it's it okay so after

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.760 
that looks like it's it okay so after
doing<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.420> press<00:01:12.690> f1<00:01:13.080> one<00:01:13.320> more<00:01:13.530> time

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
doing that just press f1 one more time

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.770 
doing that just press f1 one more time
start<00:01:14.220> scrolling<00:01:14.520> up<00:01:14.790> again<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.360> as<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.690> can

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
start scrolling up again and as you can

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.630 
start scrolling up again and as you can
see<00:01:15.960> it'll<00:01:16.050> start<00:01:16.290> moving<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.310> diagonal

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
see it'll start moving in this diagonal

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.900 
see it'll start moving in this diagonal
motion<00:01:17.970> start<00:01:18.540> scrolling<00:01:18.960> down<00:01:19.790> you're<00:01:20.790> gonna

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
motion start scrolling down you're gonna

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.910 
motion start scrolling down you're gonna
want<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.270> do<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:23.300> about<00:01:24.300> three<00:01:24.990> more<00:01:25.530> times

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
want to do this about three more times

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.109 
want to do this about three more times
so<00:01:26.580> now<00:01:27.000> we're<00:01:27.150> gonna<00:01:27.270> do<00:01:27.509> dead<00:01:27.810> zone<00:01:27.990> three

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
so now we're gonna do dead zone three

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:37.450 
so now we're gonna do dead zone three
let's<00:01:30.119> get<00:01:30.210> scrolling<00:01:30.630> down

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.800 

for<00:01:38.830> down

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
for down

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.550 
for down
and<00:01:42.110> five

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
and five

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.860 
and five
scroll<00:01:45.400> down

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.780 

all<00:01:50.410> right<00:01:50.680> and<00:01:50.800> after<00:01:51.040> finding<00:01:51.220> each<00:01:51.550> of<00:01:51.700> the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
all right and after finding each of the

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:59.220 
all right and after finding each of the
dead<00:01:51.970> zones<00:01:52.240> just<00:01:52.360> press<00:01:52.720> f6<00:01:53.290> and<00:01:57.930> look<00:01:58.930> at<00:01:59.050> how

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
dead zones just press f6 and look at how

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.470 
dead zones just press f6 and look at how
much<00:01:59.380> smoother<00:01:59.920> that<00:02:00.100> is<00:02:00.280> than<00:02:00.520> what<00:02:01.180> it<00:02:01.330> was

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
much smoother that is than what it was

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.100 
much smoother that is than what it was
before<00:02:01.750> when<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.770> video<00:02:03.010> first<00:02:03.310> started<00:02:04.110> way

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
before when the video first started way

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.550 
before when the video first started way
better<00:02:05.730> all<00:02:06.730> right<00:02:06.940> so<00:02:07.120> now<00:02:07.390> next<00:02:08.110> we<00:02:08.229> move<00:02:08.410> on

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
better all right so now next we move on

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:16.200 
better all right so now next we move on
to<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:08.860> X&amp;Y<00:02:09.160> sensitivity

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.490 

the<00:02:17.210> next<00:02:17.540> step<00:02:17.810> in<00:02:17.990> our<00:02:18.080> advanced

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
the next step in our advanced

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.410 
the next step in our advanced
calibration<00:02:19.130> system<00:02:19.550> is<00:02:19.820> calibrating<00:02:20.390> your

your liking

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.300 
your liking
or<00:02:26.090> we<00:02:26.420> do<00:02:26.690> this<00:02:26.960> it's<00:02:27.380> important<00:02:27.920> to<00:02:28.010> first

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
or we do this it's important to first

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.310 
or we do this it's important to first
adjust<00:02:28.760> your<00:02:28.910> in-game<00:02:29.270> sensitivity<00:02:29.990> to<00:02:30.170> your

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
adjust your in-game sensitivity to your

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.470 
adjust your in-game sensitivity to your
desired<00:02:30.680> preference<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.490> like<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.120> have<00:02:32.210> a<00:02:32.300> low

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
desired preference I like to have a low

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.850 
desired preference I like to have a low
sensitivity<00:02:33.080> because<00:02:33.320> I<00:02:33.410> prefer<00:02:33.590> more

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
sensitivity because I prefer more

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.860 
sensitivity because I prefer more
control<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.520> precision<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.240> overall<00:02:35.780> speed

control and precision to overall speed
now<00:02:38.319> we're<00:02:38.470> going<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.680> start<00:02:38.890> with<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.129> X

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
now we're going to start with the X

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.789 
now we're going to start with the X
sensitivity<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:40.420> press<00:02:40.659> f2<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:41.349> start

don't<00:05:08.880> want<00:05:09.120> to<00:05:09.210> reduce<00:05:09.480> speed<00:05:09.840> too<00:05:10.320> much
