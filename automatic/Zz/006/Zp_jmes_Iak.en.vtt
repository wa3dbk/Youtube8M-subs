to<00:01:07.930> to<00:01:08.229> mates<00:01:08.500> if<00:01:08.920> you<00:01:09.310> will<00:01:09.490> there<00:01:10.420> I<00:01:10.450> guess

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
to to mates if you will there I guess

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.450

there<00:01:10.990> was<00:01:11.110> a<00:01:11.140> bet<00:01:11.439> and<00:01:11.680> so<00:01:12.009> they<00:01:12.130> ended<00:01:12.369> up

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
there was a bet and so they ended up

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.420 
there was a bet and so they ended up
racing<00:01:12.939> camels<00:01:13.149> and<00:01:13.600> in<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.800> creek<00:01:15.040> bed<00:01:15.070> that

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
racing camels and in the creek bed that

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.180 
racing camels and in the creek bed that
runs<00:01:15.670> through<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.060> town<00:01:16.090> and<00:01:16.570> so<00:01:17.010> that's<00:01:18.010> how

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
runs through the town and so that's how

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.860 
runs through the town and so that's how
the<00:01:18.250> event<00:01:18.580> got<00:01:18.729> a<00:01:18.790> start<00:01:19.150> and<00:01:19.479> you<00:01:19.630> might<00:01:19.750> be
