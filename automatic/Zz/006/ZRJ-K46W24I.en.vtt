00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.290

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.350
 human bodies their anatomy skeleton structure 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.260
 muscle organs and so on should help 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.110
 these pictures were taken somewhere 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.450
 century so in the fifteenth sixteenth in 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.090

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.900
 a cover so I don't see anything but 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.470

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.200

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.560

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.540

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.600
 just falls look it 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.950
 unfairly and no this also hesitated 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.360
 by the way the game is created on the unreal engine 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.079
 engine 3 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.680
 this is such a peculiar smoke given 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.170
 engine 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.440
 probably one of the very first but not 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.160
 less so go here everything seems to be all 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.230
 took off 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.530
 everything is good there is not yet two 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.940
 Magazine on wallpaper start to follow slazit 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.450
 see the wallpaper does not hold without our 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.599
 magazines 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.140
 okay let's remove the wallpaper too glass 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.349
 maybe you can remove this mirror no you can't 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.480
 okay 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.209
 this wallpaper is honestly a little prettier 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.640
 than these because here are these red wallpapers 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.260
 seems like something organic 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.870
 red and bloody 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.129
 I don't like it very much, but here are nice 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.330
 yellow trees 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:48.750
 bushes sheets and so on so ok 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.230
 both find the wallpaper too slashes okay them too 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.540
 take off 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.209
 sorry that you can not remove the next layer 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.500
 wallpaper has not yet removed this one okay with 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.450
 him and so here I still wonder what 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.730
 disgusting man could put 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.500
 me in this terrible room because I could 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.650
 go crazy if he hadn't shown his 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.900
 dexterity and wit I would stay in this 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.940
 a room surrounded by horrible posters 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.040
 good they disappear for taking them off on 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.159
 earth and then I already feel like my brain 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.019
 these all start to eat 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:21.310
 cosmopolitan and and other disgusting 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.040
 things so wallpaper can be removed 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.980
 but the green wallpaper is so so these 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.640
 prettier even though dazzled in the eyes of 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.250
 them and it is very bad so layer by layer 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.010
 remove all wallpapers 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.569
 straight almost verse turned out about great 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.660
 finally took all the wallpaper 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.390
 fuh though this wallpaper will be nothing but first 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.819
 the coolest the coolest and the coolest 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.630
 how did they put me here if no 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:52.510
 windows no doors no entry no exit nothing 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:56.980
 okay, both of them 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:00.010
 what we see drank threw me a new 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.540
 riddle because i have to believe that 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.959
 it was this saw that threw me into this 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:08.500
 terrible room like that I destroy the bar 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.160
 that's me 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.380
 distance ax blow wow Well 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.709
 so far everything seems to be breaking 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.389
 space may pipe damn pancake damn 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.700
 be careful because if i break 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.130
 all steam pipes will go right here in 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.600
 the room and I have nothing to breathe very 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.910
 breathing hard because all the air 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.160
 will be very hot I'll just be 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.020
 burn yourself lungs and die 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.440
 so you need to be very careful 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:40.500
 light bulbs can break I hit the light bulb 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.500
 and the ax passes by the bulb hits 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.990
 oh-oh-oh ax passes by a light bulb 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:50.289
 hits tree fucking tree okay i 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.360
 gone crazy yes i will kill kill 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:54.310

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.250

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.130
 ceiling okay ceiling not killed go 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.180
 Okay here, too, on the left, yes, a little 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.250
 podglyuchivaet but it's all nonsense 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.410
 but there are a lot of elements here 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.080
 cool here even have any 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.740
 physics though benefits on angel engine 3 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.860
 usually 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:17.789
 physics was not noticed if there was such 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.870
 know quite mediocre so so so 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.840
 so so here we are 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:26.419
 we can break into the wall nifigase y 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.419
 me ax straight cool bahu 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.530
 but this is scary what is this 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.960
 giant heart what is she doing here 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:40.180
 why he will be killed maybe this is mine 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:45.009
 heart and i'm inside of myself 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.870
 what's that pulsating warts 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:49.090
 some tumor growths 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.620
 feeling like they are about to explode 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.919
 and spat me with pus it 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.780
 disgusting sight seriously if 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.639
 the heart is all right 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.639
 blue 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:02.050
 ducts are apparently nerves and 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:04.719
 pink this apparently veins this 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.370
 giant arteries everything is clear here we are 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:09.400
 see how on these blue to nalchik 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:13.180
 There is a current that is, the nerves give signals from 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:16.180
 brain and everything is fine but these are ribs or what 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.849
 what is this monster i'm inside 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.500
 monster because it seems it 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:23.110
 ribs well, why are they in a circle 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.449
 located this a bit strange ribs 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.389
 after all not so located are not woven into 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:30.849
 our spine or not the spine in 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:33.430
 Generally there is such a plexus behind us 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:35.849
 woven well and the front too little, I 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.319
 I know a little bit of anatomy quite a bit 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:42.550
 giant heart okay scared me but 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:44.469
 but what else to do and strange music 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.800
 I played it maybe it really 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:52.139
 some horror how not to get inside I 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:55.500
 I can remove the boards I can jump down 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:55.500
 I'm jumping 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:07.600
 where I flew is the beginning of the game only 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:09.640
 or this or that or the end is not really something 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.100
 this is just the end I wanted more but 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.320
 the game was a cool idea even had 

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:17.800
 nothing could develop and develop 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:20.520
 and this end is not really tito food at the end 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.650
 sometimes captions go early so i don't 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.690
 I leave the belief that the game can be 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.820
 still going on I want to continue not she 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.840
 I like to know what it is 

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.840
 for giant hearts
