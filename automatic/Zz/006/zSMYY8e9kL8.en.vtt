00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
today is to find out which one of these

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.800 
today is to find out which one of these
two<00:00:16.440> phones<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:17.010> faster<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.730> real<00:00:17.940> life<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.420> to

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
two phones is faster in real life and to

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.689 
two phones is faster in real life and to
do<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.080> we'll<00:00:19.590> be<00:00:19.619> launching<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.220> same<00:00:20.430> apps

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
do that we'll be launching the same apps

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.970 
do that we'll be launching the same apps
side-by-side<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.960> two<00:00:22.080> phones<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.560> we'll

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
side-by-side on the two phones and we'll

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.519 
side-by-side on the two phones and we'll
be<00:00:23.100> observing<00:00:23.609> their<00:00:23.820> performance<00:00:24.449> before<00:00:25.230> we

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
be observing their performance before we

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.200 
be observing their performance before we
begin<00:00:25.800> we<00:00:25.980> just<00:00:26.189> want<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.490> say<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.910> both

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
begin we just want to say that both

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.630 
begin we just want to say that both
phones<00:00:27.449> have<00:00:27.539> just<00:00:28.050> been<00:00:28.230> reset<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.980> as<00:00:29.550> you

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
phones have just been reset and as you

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.460 
phones have just been reset and as you
can<00:00:29.789> see<00:00:29.970> there<00:00:30.179> are<00:00:30.269> no<00:00:30.390> recent<00:00:30.660> applications

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
can see there are no recent applications

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.100 
can see there are no recent applications
loaded<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:32.279> their<00:00:32.730> memory<00:00:33.030> also<00:00:33.540> we're<00:00:33.899> using

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
loaded in their memory also we're using

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.990 
loaded in their memory also we're using
the<00:00:34.380> same<00:00:34.590> user<00:00:34.890> accounts<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.520> both<00:00:35.850> devices

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the same user accounts on both devices

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.940 
the same user accounts on both devices
and<00:00:36.570> we<00:00:36.630> have<00:00:36.809> them<00:00:36.960> connected<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.680> same

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
and we have them connected to the same

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.910 
and we have them connected to the same
Wi-Fi<00:00:38.370> network<00:00:39.200> let's<00:00:40.200> start<00:00:40.469> with<00:00:40.680> something

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
Wi-Fi network let's start with something

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.319 
Wi-Fi network let's start with something
simple<00:00:41.100> like<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.940> phone<00:00:42.149> application<00:00:44.329> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
simple like the phone application the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.119 
simple like the phone application the
one<00:00:45.450> m9<00:00:45.600> was<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> little<00:00:46.379> bit<00:00:46.500> quicker<00:00:46.710> here

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
one m9 was a little bit quicker here

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.069 
one m9 was a little bit quicker here
let's<00:00:47.489> confirm<00:00:47.820> by<00:00:48.090> running<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.629> test<00:00:48.840> one

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
let's confirm by running the test one

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.380 
let's confirm by running the test one
more<00:00:49.260> time<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:51.420> point<00:00:51.690> goes<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.289> m9

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
more time and the point goes to the m9

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.790 
more time and the point goes to the m9
next<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.539> have<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.899> phone<00:00:55.110> book<00:00:57.500> again<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
next we have the phone book again the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.740 
next we have the phone book again the
one<00:00:58.920> m9<00:00:59.070> was<00:00:59.430> slightly<00:00:59.879> faster<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:00.510> we'll

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
one m9 was slightly faster but we'll

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.140 
one m9 was slightly faster but we'll
give<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> test<00:01:01.230> another<00:01:01.500> shot<00:01:04.700> it<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> point

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
give the test another shot it is a point

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.400 
give the test another shot it is a point
for<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> m9

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:20.470 

now<00:01:10.410> let's<00:01:10.620> try<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.890> messaging<00:01:11.400> application

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.330 

once<00:01:21.480> again<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.020> m9<00:01:22.440> was<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> fraction<00:01:23.190> of<00:01:23.280> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
once again the m9 was a fraction of a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.850 
once again the m9 was a fraction of a
second<00:01:23.700> faster<00:01:23.910> than<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.450> iPhone<00:01:24.710> next<00:01:25.710> is

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
second faster than the iPhone next is

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.720 
second faster than the iPhone next is
the<00:01:26.010> photo<00:01:26.220> gallery<00:01:26.400> application<00:01:28.490> okay<00:01:29.490> let's

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
the photo gallery application okay let's

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.450 
the photo gallery application okay let's
run<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.210> test<00:01:30.420> one<00:01:30.720> more<00:01:30.840> time<00:01:34.400> this<00:01:35.400> time

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
run this test one more time this time

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.550 
run this test one more time this time
the<00:01:35.790> iPhone<00:01:36.090> was<00:01:36.300> quicker<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.020> we're<00:01:37.260> giving

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
the iPhone was quicker so we're giving

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.450 
the iPhone was quicker so we're giving
it<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.740> point<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:40.380> camera<00:01:40.740> application<00:01:40.890> is

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
it a point the camera application is

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.740 
it a point the camera application is
next<00:01:43.550> wow<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:44.610> iPhone<00:01:45.120> was<00:01:45.270> definitely

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
next wow the iPhone was definitely

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.450 
next wow the iPhone was definitely
faster<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.260> this<00:01:46.410> test<00:01:46.650> but<00:01:46.980> we'll<00:01:47.190> give<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
faster in this test but we'll give the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.350 
faster in this test but we'll give the
m9<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.150> more<00:01:48.300> chance

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
m9 one more chance

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.090 
m9 one more chance
nope<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.630> iPhone<00:01:51.960> camera<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.500> definitely

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
nope the iPhone camera is definitely

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.240 
nope the iPhone camera is definitely
faster<00:01:53.870> now<00:01:54.870> let's<00:01:55.080> try<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.350> stock<00:01:55.800> email

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
faster now let's try the stock email

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.080 
faster now let's try the stock email
client<00:01:57.530> looks<00:01:58.530> like<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.890> one<00:01:59.040> m9<00:01:59.190> is<00:01:59.580> faster

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
client looks like the one m9 is faster

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.410 
client looks like the one m9 is faster
here<00:02:00.360> let's<00:02:00.810> run<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.080> test<00:02:01.260> one<00:02:01.530> more<00:02:01.710> time

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
here let's run the test one more time

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.760 
here let's run the test one more time
yep<00:02:03.420> do<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.690> want<00:02:03.869> them<00:02:03.960> nine<00:02:04.170> loaded<00:02:04.619> it's

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
yep do you want them nine loaded it's

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.180 
yep do you want them nine loaded it's
email<00:02:05.040> application<00:02:05.610> faster<00:02:06.920> next<00:02:07.920> we<00:02:08.070> have

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
email application faster next we have

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.170 
email application faster next we have
the<00:02:08.340> calendar<00:02:08.700> application<00:02:10.700> okay<00:02:11.700> let's<00:02:12.000> run

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
the calendar application okay let's run

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.490 
the calendar application okay let's run
this<00:02:12.330> test<00:02:12.540> again<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.930> point<00:02:16.200> goes<00:02:16.290> to

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
this test again and the point goes to

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.050 
this test again and the point goes to
the<00:02:16.800> m9<00:02:19.160> next<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.370> Battle<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.880> web

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
the m9 next is the Battle of the web
