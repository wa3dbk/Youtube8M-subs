00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
pearl fractional laser and and how it

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:45.029 
pearl fractional laser and and how it
works

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 
works

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.129 
works
the<00:00:46.039> laser<00:00:46.249> will<00:00:46.639> go<00:00:47.210> after<00:00:47.329> wrinkles<00:00:48.019> and

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:48.139 
the laser will go after wrinkles and

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:49.840 
the laser will go after wrinkles and
lines<00:00:48.260> in<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.559> skin<00:00:48.920> and<00:00:49.100> what<00:00:49.219> it's<00:00:49.370> doing<00:00:49.729> is

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
lines in the skin and what it's doing is

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.669 
lines in the skin and what it's doing is
it's<00:00:50.059> taking<00:00:50.210> a<00:00:50.449> regular<00:00:50.629> laser<00:00:51.019> beam<00:00:51.319> and

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:51.679 
it's taking a regular laser beam and

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:53.079 
it's taking a regular laser beam and
then<00:00:51.769> breaking<00:00:52.129> it<00:00:52.370> up<00:00:52.489> into<00:00:52.639> a<00:00:52.819> bunch<00:00:52.999> of

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
then breaking it up into a bunch of

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.750 
then breaking it up into a bunch of
little<00:00:53.149> tiny<00:00:53.479> beams<00:00:54.139> so<00:00:54.739> that<00:00:54.859> it<00:00:54.979> can<00:00:55.100> go<00:00:55.249> more

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
little tiny beams so that it can go more

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.699 
little tiny beams so that it can go more
deeply<00:00:56.059> into<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:56.420> skin<00:00:56.569> to<00:00:56.839> go<00:00:56.929> after<00:00:57.109> the<00:00:57.409> the

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:57.709 
deeply into the skin to go after the the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:59.590 
deeply into the skin to go after the the
lines<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:58.219> wrinkles<00:00:58.339> so<00:00:58.729> who<00:00:58.909> would<00:00:59.389> be

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
lines and the wrinkles so who would be

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.109 
lines and the wrinkles so who would be
who<00:00:59.870> would<00:01:00.079> be<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.100> ideal<00:01:01.459> kind<00:01:01.609> of<00:01:01.760> patient

lines<00:01:12.320> how<00:01:13.270> it<00:01:14.270> it<00:01:14.870> goes<00:01:15.110> into<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:15.860> skin<00:01:16.130> a

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
lines how it it goes into the skin a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.770 
lines how it it goes into the skin a
laser<00:01:16.430> beam<00:01:16.640> goes<00:01:16.820> into<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.180> skin<00:01:17.480> and<00:01:17.540> it

laser beam goes into the skin and it

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.900 
laser beam goes into the skin and it
actually<00:01:18.020> is<00:01:18.320> creating<00:01:18.800> little<00:01:19.010> tiny<00:01:19.430> wounds

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
actually is creating little tiny wounds

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
actually is creating little tiny wounds
and<00:01:20.030> tricking<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.540> body<00:01:20.750> into<00:01:22.150> healing<00:01:23.150> those

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
and tricking the body into healing those

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.660 
and tricking the body into healing those
little<00:01:24.260> tiny<00:01:24.470> wounds<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.010> smoothing<00:01:25.430> out<00:01:25.520> the

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
little tiny wounds and smoothing out the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.120 
little tiny wounds and smoothing out the
wrinkles<00:01:26.060> by<00:01:26.540> doing<00:01:26.840> that<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.170> it's<00:01:27.590> not<00:01:27.740> it's

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
wrinkles by doing that so it's not it's

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.120 
wrinkles by doing that so it's not it's
not<00:01:28.270> inducing<00:01:29.270> collagen<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:29.960> work<00:01:30.140> well<00:01:31.070> it

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
not inducing collagen to work well it

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.230 
not inducing collagen to work well it
does<00:01:31.340> seem<00:01:31.520> like<00:01:31.580> College<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:32.180> that's

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
does seem like College and that's

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.420 
does seem like College and that's
actually<00:01:32.540> is<00:01:33.200> how<00:01:33.500> it's<00:01:33.680> working<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:34.190> some<00:01:34.400> of

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
actually is how it's working so some of

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.400 
actually is how it's working so some of
the<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:35.090> damaged<00:01:35.570> tissue<00:01:35.810> is<00:01:36.020> vaporized

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
the the damaged tissue is vaporized

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.860 
the the damaged tissue is vaporized
actually<00:01:36.980> and<00:01:37.100> then<00:01:37.190> some<00:01:37.400> of<00:01:37.520> it<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:38.510> healing

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
actually and then some of it the healing

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.870 
actually and then some of it the healing
is<00:01:38.960> from<00:01:39.170> stimulation<00:01:40.100> of<00:01:40.190> the<00:01:40.250> collagen<00:01:40.700> I

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
is from stimulation of the collagen I

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.000 
is from stimulation of the collagen I
know<00:01:41.060> we<00:01:41.180> have<00:01:41.270> some<00:01:41.450> pictures<00:01:41.690> of<00:01:41.920> before<00:01:42.920> and

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
know we have some pictures of before and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.830 
kind of pictures let's take a look at
the<00:01:45.800> eyes<00:01:45.950> here<00:01:46.370> and<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:47.000> difference<00:01:47.390> and<00:01:47.600> how

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
the eyes here and the difference and how

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.600 
the eyes here and the difference and how
many<00:01:48.050> treatments<00:01:48.470> does<00:01:48.800> it<00:01:48.920> take<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:49.250> get<00:01:49.400> this

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
many treatments does it take to get this

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.370 
many treatments does it take to get this
after<00:01:49.790> result<00:01:50.360> this<00:01:50.690> is<00:01:50.750> one<00:01:51.050> treatment

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
after result this is one treatment

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.050 
after result this is one treatment
really<00:01:52.220> No

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
really No

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.600 
really No
yes<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.840> so<00:01:54.290> long<00:01:55.010> how<00:01:55.250> long<00:01:55.430> is<00:01:55.580> that

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
yes and so long how long is that

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.320 
yes and so long how long is that
treatment<00:01:55.909> about<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.270> week<00:01:57.820> no<00:01:58.820> this<00:01:59.090> is<00:01:59.150> well

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
treatment about a week no this is well

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.550 
treatment about a week no this is well
the<00:01:59.450> treatment<00:01:59.780> actually<00:01:59.900> to<00:02:00.260> do<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.409> whole

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
the treatment actually to do a whole

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.080 
the treatment actually to do a whole
face<00:02:00.740> takes<00:02:00.950> about<00:02:01.040> an<00:02:01.220> hour<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.640> be<00:02:01.729> honest

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
face takes about an hour to be honest

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.610 
face takes about an hour to be honest
that's<00:02:02.240> incredible<00:02:02.900> that<00:02:03.050> I<00:02:03.080> mean<00:02:03.290> there<00:02:03.440> that

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
that's incredible that I mean there that

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.290 
that's incredible that I mean there that
is<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:03.770> remarkable<00:02:04.130> before-and-after<00:02:05.120> there

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
is a remarkable before-and-after there

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.790 
is a remarkable before-and-after there
yeah<00:02:05.750> that's<00:02:05.960> a<00:02:06.080> really<00:02:06.260> nice<00:02:06.380> result<00:02:06.680> and

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
yeah that's a really nice result and

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.350 
yeah that's a really nice result and
that's<00:02:06.920> not<00:02:07.100> something<00:02:07.400> we<00:02:07.490> could<00:02:07.610> get<00:02:07.850> with

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
that's not something we could get with

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.779 
that's not something we could get with
older<00:02:09.140> laser<00:02:09.349> technologies<00:02:10.069> this<00:02:10.250> is<00:02:10.310> this<00:02:10.640> is

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
older laser technologies this is this is

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.069 
older laser technologies this is this is
brand<00:02:11.030> new<00:02:11.120> whom<00:02:11.300> you've<00:02:11.420> been<00:02:11.569> really<00:02:11.780> happy

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.079 
brand new whom you've been really happy

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.959 
brand new whom you've been really happy
with<00:02:12.319> how<00:02:12.439> this<00:02:12.560> is<00:02:12.620> working<00:02:13.069> for<00:02:13.280> us<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:13.579> it<00:02:13.790> is

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:13.969 
with how this is working for us is it is

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:15.730 
with how this is working for us is it is
it<00:02:14.120> painful<00:02:14.569> or<00:02:14.780> uncomfortable

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
it painful or uncomfortable

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.410 
it painful or uncomfortable
would<00:02:16.160> be<00:02:16.280> if<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.490> didn't<00:02:16.700> anesthetize<00:02:17.210> the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
would be if you didn't anesthetize the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.820 
would be if you didn't anesthetize the
pace<00:02:17.630> so<00:02:17.840> we<00:02:17.930> do<00:02:18.050> use<00:02:18.230> some<00:02:18.260> topical

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
pace so we do use some topical

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.380 
pace so we do use some topical
anesthesia<00:02:19.160> and<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.490> actually<00:02:19.670> do<00:02:20.000> some<00:02:20.180> little

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
anesthesia and I actually do some little

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.720 
anesthesia and I actually do some little
nerve<00:02:20.870> blocks<00:02:21.230> as<00:02:21.410> well<00:02:21.590> because<00:02:21.920> we<00:02:22.040> we<00:02:22.460> want

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
nerve blocks as well because we we want

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.520 
nerve blocks as well because we we want
people<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.090> be<00:02:23.240> comfortable<00:02:23.540> right<00:02:23.990> with<00:02:24.380> it

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
people to be comfortable right with it

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.320 
people to be comfortable right with it
and<00:02:24.680> not<00:02:24.800> stress<00:02:25.130> out<00:02:25.280> we<00:02:25.700> also<00:02:25.820> have<00:02:26.030> some

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
and not stress out we also have some

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.430 
and not stress out we also have some
other<00:02:26.420> before<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:26.840> after<00:02:27.050> pictures<00:02:27.290> well

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
other before and after pictures well

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.200 
other before and after pictures well
let's<00:02:27.590> take<00:02:27.710> a<00:02:27.740> look<00:02:28.100> at<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.250> mouth<00:02:28.490> before

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
let's take a look at that mouth before

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.420 
let's take a look at that mouth before
and<00:02:29.330> after<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:29.810> these<00:02:30.290> wrinkles<00:02:30.770> that<00:02:31.250> is

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
and after and these wrinkles that is

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.150 
and after and these wrinkles that is
really<00:02:31.870> amazing<00:02:32.870> is<00:02:32.990> there<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.200> recovery<00:02:33.709> time

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
really amazing is there a recovery time

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.460 
really amazing is there a recovery time
people<00:02:35.120> are<00:02:35.240> red<00:02:35.390> for<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:35.660> couple<00:02:35.959> weeks<00:02:35.990> after

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
people are red for a couple weeks after

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.230 
people are red for a couple weeks after
this<00:02:36.590> because<00:02:36.860> this<00:02:36.980> is<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.190> little<00:02:37.490> more

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
this because this is a little more

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.000 
this because this is a little more
aggressive<00:02:38.480> than<00:02:38.900> some<00:02:39.260> laser<00:02:39.470> procedures

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
aggressive than some laser procedures

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.680 
aggressive than some laser procedures
but<00:02:40.160> this<00:02:40.310> is<00:02:40.459> not<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.700> result<00:02:41.300> that<00:02:41.420> we<00:02:41.510> could

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
but this is not a result that we could

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.920 
but this is not a result that we could
get<00:02:41.920> with<00:02:42.920> our<00:02:43.070> older<00:02:43.340> technology<00:02:43.970> going

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
get with our older technology going

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.720 
get with our older technology going
after<00:02:45.290> lines<00:02:45.530> like<00:02:45.800> this<00:02:45.980> this<00:02:46.100> is<00:02:46.280> really

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
after lines like this this is really

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.610

who is interested in just smoothing out
her<00:03:18.500> appearance<00:03:18.890> and<00:03:19.040> making<00:03:19.310> her<00:03:19.970> overall

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
her appearance and making her overall

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.970 
her appearance and making her overall
skin<00:03:20.720> look<00:03:20.900> healthier<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:21.440> you<00:03:21.500> can<00:03:21.650> see<00:03:21.830> that

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
skin look healthier and you can see that

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.070 
skin look healthier and you can see that
the<00:03:22.340> sun<00:03:22.610> damaged<00:03:22.940> before<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:23.900> the

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
the sun damaged before and that and the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.920 
the sun damaged before and that and the
clear<00:03:24.500> smooth<00:03:25.130> skin<00:03:25.489> afterwards<00:03:25.850> and<00:03:26.540> that's

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
clear smooth skin afterwards and that's

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.330 
clear smooth skin afterwards and that's
that's<00:03:27.200> also<00:03:27.410> a<00:03:27.530> laser<00:03:27.709> treatment<00:03:28.100> to<00:03:28.160> take

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
that's also a laser treatment to take

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.090 
that's also a laser treatment to take
out<00:03:28.459> some<00:03:28.640> of<00:03:28.700> those<00:03:28.820> those<00:03:29.120> sunspots<00:03:29.510> that<00:03:30.100> is

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
out some of those those sunspots that is

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.680 
out some of those those sunspots that is
the<00:03:31.310> laser<00:03:31.489> treatment<00:03:31.820> for<00:03:31.970> that<00:03:32.060> as<00:03:32.239> well<00:03:32.450> and

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
the laser treatment for that as well and

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.050 
the laser treatment for that as well and
how<00:03:32.810> does<00:03:32.870> it<00:03:33.110> remove<00:03:33.500> that<00:03:33.799> it's<00:03:34.549> almost<00:03:34.820> like

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
how does it remove that it's almost like

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.120 
how does it remove that it's almost like
you<00:03:35.480> know<00:03:35.600> a<00:03:35.630> Photoshop<00:03:36.350> on<00:03:36.530> your<00:03:36.650> computer<00:03:37.070> or

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
you know a Photoshop on your computer or

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.830 
you know a Photoshop on your computer or
do<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:37.250> just<00:03:37.280> go<00:03:37.519> with<00:03:37.700> eraser<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.420> take

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
do you just go with eraser and take

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.900 
do you just go with eraser and take
things<00:03:39.080> out<00:03:39.290> well<00:03:39.830> it<00:03:39.890> sort<00:03:40.010> of<00:03:40.100> is<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:40.280> mean<00:03:40.580> in

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
things out well it sort of is I mean in

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.210 
things out well it sort of is I mean in
this<00:03:41.030> case<00:03:41.269> the<00:03:41.570> the<00:03:41.600> laser<00:03:42.019> technology<00:03:42.799> the

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
this case the the laser technology the

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.789 
this case the the laser technology the
laser<00:03:43.430> energy<00:03:43.760> is<00:03:43.790> being<00:03:44.060> absorbed<00:03:44.329> by<00:03:44.799> the

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
laser energy is being absorbed by the

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.509 
laser energy is being absorbed by the
surface<00:03:46.220> of<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.459> skin<00:03:46.730> and<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:49.040> pigment

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
surface of the skin and the the pigment

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.460 
surface of the skin and the the pigment
and<00:03:49.850> the<00:03:50.090> sunspots<00:03:50.540> is<00:03:50.720> in<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.049> surface<00:03:51.350> of

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
and the sunspots is in the surface of

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.949 
and the sunspots is in the surface of
the<00:03:51.560> skin<00:03:51.799> and<00:03:52.100> that'll<00:03:52.880> just<00:03:52.910> clear<00:03:53.810> that

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
the skin and that'll just clear that

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:54.370 
the skin and that'll just clear that
right<00:03:54.140> up

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
right up

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.440 
right up
dr.<00:03:55.040> Wong<00:03:55.250> that<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.670> before<00:03:56.000> and<00:03:56.120> after<00:03:56.420> of

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
dr. Wong that the before and after of

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.270 
dr. Wong that the before and after of
the<00:03:56.630> face<00:03:56.840> was<00:03:57.290> that<00:03:57.380> involved<00:03:57.709> a<00:03:57.769> pearl<00:03:57.980> laser

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
the face was that involved a pearl laser

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.729 
the face was that involved a pearl laser
just<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.850> laser<00:03:59.060> as<00:03:59.450> well<00:03:59.720> yes<00:04:00.320> that<00:04:00.530> was<00:04:00.650> the

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
just the laser as well yes that was the

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.710 
just the laser as well yes that was the
more<00:04:00.890> superficial<00:04:01.280> treatment<00:04:01.940> that<00:04:02.360> gets<00:04:02.570> the

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
more superficial treatment that gets the

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.110 
more superficial treatment that gets the
brown<00:04:02.930> spots<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:03.470> improved<00:04:03.769> skin<00:04:04.100> texture

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
brown spots and improved skin texture

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.119 
brown spots and improved skin texture
and<00:04:06.959> then<00:04:07.110> so<00:04:07.349> what's<00:04:07.560> then<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:07.860> difference

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
and then so what's then the difference

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.070 
and then so what's then the difference
between<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:09.000> laser<00:04:09.239> and<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.569> fractional

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
between the the laser and the fractional

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.339 
between the the laser and the fractional
laser<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:11.430> fractional<00:04:11.910> laser<00:04:12.120> is<00:04:12.959> what<00:04:13.230> we

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
laser the fractional laser is what we

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.320 
laser the fractional laser is what we
use<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.830> to<00:04:14.099> go<00:04:14.220> down<00:04:14.250> more<00:04:14.580> deeply<00:04:14.640> into<00:04:15.180> the

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
use to to go down more deeply into the

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.349 
use to to go down more deeply into the
skin<00:04:15.390> so<00:04:15.870> for<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.109> lines<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.799> you<00:04:16.949> know<00:04:17.729> we

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
skin so for the lines and you know we

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.969 
skin so for the lines and you know we
can<00:04:18.600> do<00:04:18.780> bolt<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.229> what<00:04:19.380> we'll<00:04:19.530> often<00:04:19.680> do<00:04:19.889> is

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
can do bolt and what we'll often do is

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.250 
can do bolt and what we'll often do is
combine<00:04:20.160> it<00:04:20.489> with<00:04:20.519> surgery<00:04:21.060> even<00:04:21.260> depending

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
combine it with surgery even depending

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.960 
combine it with surgery even depending
on<00:04:22.350> what<00:04:22.470> patients<00:04:22.919> need<00:04:22.949> so<00:04:23.370> if<00:04:23.490> it's<00:04:23.639> more<00:04:23.880> of

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
on what patients need so if it's more of

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.300 
on what patients need so if it's more of
a<00:04:24.060> superficial<00:04:24.600> sun<00:04:25.260> damage<00:04:25.650> kind<00:04:26.220> of

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
a superficial sun damage kind of

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.189 
a superficial sun damage kind of
concerned<00:04:26.970> then<00:04:27.240> we<00:04:27.419> can<00:04:27.720> use<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:28.050> regular

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
concerned then we can use the regular

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.080 
concerned then we can use the regular
pearl<00:04:28.590> laser<00:04:28.860> but<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.490> fractional

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
pearl laser but the fractional

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.879 
pearl laser but the fractional
technology<00:04:30.750> allows<00:04:31.020> us<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.350> go<00:04:31.470> after<00:04:31.620> the

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
technology allows us to go after the

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.340 
technology allows us to go after the
deeper<00:04:32.550> lines<00:04:32.699> and<00:04:32.970> that's<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:34.050> deeper

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
deeper lines and that's the the deeper

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.200 
deeper lines and that's the the deeper
lines<00:04:34.530> are<00:04:34.889> the<00:04:34.979> the<00:04:35.220> crow's<00:04:35.460> feet<00:04:35.490> right<00:04:35.940> the

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
lines are the the crow's feet right the

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.000 
lines are the the crow's feet right the
laugh<00:04:36.419> lines<00:04:36.780> are<00:04:36.990> on<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.169> face<00:04:37.380> that<00:04:37.800> kind<00:04:37.979> of

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
laugh lines are on the face that kind of

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.350 
laugh lines are on the face that kind of
stuff<00:04:38.190> that's<00:04:38.400> what<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:38.970> fractional

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
stuff that's what the the fractional

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.940 
stuff that's what the the fractional
laser<00:04:39.540> will<00:04:39.780> take<00:04:39.960> care<00:04:40.169> of<00:04:40.229> them<00:04:40.350> correct<00:04:40.740> and

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
laser will take care of them correct and

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.379 
laser will take care of them correct and
that's<00:04:41.010> new<00:04:41.340> technology<00:04:42.030> that<00:04:42.210> wasn't

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
that's new technology that wasn't

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.620 
that's new technology that wasn't
available<00:04:43.340> even<00:04:44.340> two<00:04:44.820> years<00:04:45.090> ago<00:04:45.300> what<00:04:45.570> did

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
available even two years ago what did

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.659 
available even two years ago what did
this<00:04:45.780> patient<00:04:46.050> have<00:04:46.350> done<00:04:46.500> here<00:04:46.800> she<00:04:47.520> actually

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
this patient have done here she actually

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.290 
this patient have done here she actually
had<00:04:48.030> a<00:04:48.060> facelift<00:04:48.630> a<00:04:48.960> shorter<00:04:49.380> facelift<00:04:49.950> and

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
had a facelift a shorter facelift and

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.360 
had a facelift a shorter facelift and
since<00:04:51.300> there's<00:04:51.510> only<00:04:51.720> about<00:04:51.900> a<00:04:52.050> 10<00:04:52.410> to<00:04:52.440> 12<00:04:52.740> day

since there's only about a 10 to 12 day
no<00:04:53.910> downtime<00:04:54.210> with<00:04:54.660> that<00:04:54.870> she<00:04:55.470> also<00:04:55.770> elected

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
no downtime with that she also elected

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.310
