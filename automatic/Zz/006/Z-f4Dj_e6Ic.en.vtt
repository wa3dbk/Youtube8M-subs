00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.080
Water or WARter?

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.000
About 70% of the Earth’s
surface is covered by water

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.080
But only 2.5%
of the world’s water is freshwater

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.400
Around 70% of this water
is found in uninhabited areas...

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.800
in permafrost ice and glaciers,
particularly around the Earth’s poles

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.240
70% of available freshwater
is used in irrigation...

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.200
about 22% in industry
and 8% in domestic use

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.760
Water use has been growing
at more than twice the rate

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.760
of the population increase
over the last century

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.160
Nearly 1.5 billion people
live in river basins...

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.360
where water use exceeds
minimum recharge levels

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.560
Each person needs between
at least 20-50 litres of water a day...

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.600
to ensure all their basic
drinking, cooking and cleaning needs

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.040
Many more litres will have already
been used to get the food to the table

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.200
And the world’s population
is rising rapidly...

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.520
World Population Rise

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.640
In 1990, the world population
was around 5.2 billion people...

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.560
Today it is just over 7 billion and will
reach 8 billion in just over 10 years

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.160
The future lack of water sources and
its knock on effects on food security...

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.280
could lead to geopolitical challenges

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.320
145 nations
- around 3 out of 4 in the world -

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.120
have territory
within a transboundary basin

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.240
‘...water in shared basins will
increasingly be used as leverage;

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.960
The use of water as a weapon
or to further terrorist objectives

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.120
will become more likely beyond
10 years.’ (US intelligence report)

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.120
30 nations will already
be water scarce in 2025

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.880
18 are
in the Middle East and North Africa

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.880
Yemen will probably become
the first nation to run out of water...

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.880
This may happen as soon as 2015

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.880
In India, there are fears
that new hydroelectric dams

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.200
on the stretch of water
Yarlung-Zangbo-Brahmaputra...

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.840
from China
could lead to major reductions

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.200
in the flow of water coming into India

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.680
Both India and China have
areas suffering from water scarcity

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.600
More than 60 million people
in 6 countries

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.360
from China to Vietnam
depend on the Mekong River...

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.760
Planned dams may have
a major effect on these people

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.480
Vietnam’s President Truong Tan Sang
warned in September 2012

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.840
of the importance
of dealing with water issues

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.040
‘It would not be an exaggeration
to view the water resources

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.120
of the 21st century as the oil
of the 19th and the 20th centuries.’

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.760
‘Tensions over water resources
are threatening economic growth

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.880
and presenting a source of conflict.’

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.600
The President of Uzbekistan,
Islam Karimov, said:

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.040
‘Water problems may cause
conflicts in Central Asia...’

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.360
‘...this is a serious confrontation.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.200
It may even become
a cause of war in the region.’

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.880
Finally, water conflicts
may not be confined to disputes

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.800
between countries
– but also within countries

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.640
In India, the Prime Minister’s
Office has been asked

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.760
to resolve a water sharing dispute...

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.640
between the country's
Tamil Nadu and Karnataka states

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.400
The population of just these two
states is over 130 million people...

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.640
And rising
