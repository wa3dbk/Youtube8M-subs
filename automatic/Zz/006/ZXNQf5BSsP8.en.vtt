00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
scope in i think it was a quick scope

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.450 
scope in i think it was a quick scope
after<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.600> double<00:01:54.899> tap<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.560> if<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.070> double<00:01:56.310> tap

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
after I double tap so if you double tap

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.550 
after I double tap so if you double tap
why<00:01:56.700> change<00:01:57.420> comes<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.899> guess<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.259> makes<00:01:58.380> your

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
why change comes I guess it makes your

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.889 
why change comes I guess it makes your
nose<00:01:59.189> cut<00:01:59.369> more<00:01:59.520> accurate<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.360> also<00:02:00.659> can

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
nose cut more accurate but I also can

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.289 
nose cut more accurate but I also can
make<00:02:00.930> your<00:02:01.049> quick<00:02:01.320> scopes<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.579> there's<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.180> nice

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
make your quick scopes so there's a nice

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.200 
make your quick scopes so there's a nice
clip<00:02:04.399> okay<00:02:05.399> right<00:02:05.520> here<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.969> last

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
clip okay right here this is the last

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.490 
clip okay right here this is the last
clip<00:02:06.479> I'm<00:02:06.570> going<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.719> show<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.930> guys<00:02:06.990> with<00:02:07.320> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
clip I'm going to show you guys with the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.410 
clip I'm going to show you guys with the
m<00:02:07.740> 43<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.670> 400<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> 3<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.790> see<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.940> my<00:02:11.970> team

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
m 43 and 400 a 3 so I see that my team

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.990 
m 43 and 400 a 3 so I see that my team
is<00:02:12.510> getting

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
is getting

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.740 
is getting
on<00:02:13.120> grid<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.630> do<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.930> nice<00:02:14.140> I<00:02:14.760> do<00:02:15.760> some<00:02:16.570> nice

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
on grid so I do a nice I do some nice

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.100 
on grid so I do a nice I do some nice
shots<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:18.480> woe<00:02:19.480> three<00:02:20.230> killstreak<00:02:21.990> then<00:02:22.990> I'm

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
shots and woe three killstreak then I'm

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.320 
shots and woe three killstreak then I'm
Fourier<00:02:23.530> three<00:02:24.370> as<00:02:24.490> I<00:02:24.640> said<00:02:24.820> can<00:02:25.030> be<00:02:25.060> very

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
Fourier three as I said can be very

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.040 
Fourier three as I said can be very
accurate<00:02:25.570> it's<00:02:26.290> um<00:02:26.650> it's<00:02:26.950> for<00:02:27.760> me<00:02:27.850> like<00:02:28.210> I<00:02:28.540> like

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
accurate it's um it's for me like I like

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.220 
accurate it's um it's for me like I like
that<00:02:29.260> gun<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.470> lot<00:02:29.770> it's<00:02:30.510> it's<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.690> gun<00:02:31.870> that<00:02:31.900> i

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
that gun a lot it's it's a gun that i

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.470 
that gun a lot it's it's a gun that i
play<00:02:32.560> with<00:02:32.800> like<00:02:33.130> normally<00:02:33.580> i'll<00:02:33.730> hop<00:02:34.090> on<00:02:34.209> cod4

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
play with like normally i'll hop on cod4

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.940 
play with like normally i'll hop on cod4
that's<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.110> first<00:02:35.350> time<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:35.560> i'll<00:02:35.709> choose

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
that's the first time that i'll choose

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.720 
that's the first time that i'll choose
and<00:02:37.050> it's<00:02:38.050> very<00:02:38.290> easy<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.680> use<00:02:38.770> like<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.430> have<00:02:39.610> to

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
and it's very easy to use like I have to

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.030 
and it's very easy to use like I have to
put<00:02:40.270> us<00:02:40.360> in<00:02:40.510> on<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:40.840> cog<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.590> can<00:02:41.770> easily

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
put us in on a cog and you can easily

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.790 
put us in on a cog and you can easily
learn<00:02:42.340> how<00:02:42.520> to<00:02:42.810> how<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.840> quickscope<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.590> stuff

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
learn how to how to quickscope and stuff

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.380 
learn how to how to quickscope and stuff
and<00:02:44.980> I<00:02:45.070> find<00:02:45.310> that<00:02:45.400> quick<00:02:45.730> scoping<00:02:46.090> what<00:02:46.239> this

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
and I find that quick scoping what this

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.030 
and I find that quick scoping what this
ACOG<00:02:46.750> side<00:02:47.020> is<00:02:47.170> much<00:02:47.500> easier<00:02:47.530> than<00:02:47.860> the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
ACOG side is much easier than the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.920 
ACOG side is much easier than the
intervention<00:02:48.520> I<00:02:48.700> don't<00:02:49.360> have<00:02:49.450> any<00:02:49.570> clips<00:02:49.810> with

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
intervention I don't have any clips with

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.360 
intervention I don't have any clips with
the<00:02:49.989> intervention<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.620> cock<00:02:50.860> site<00:02:51.070> but<00:02:51.220> i<00:02:51.250> do

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
the intervention a cock site but i do

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.010 
the intervention a cock site but i do
have<00:02:51.610> clips<00:02:52.090> with<00:02:52.209> intervention<00:02:52.720> i'm<00:02:52.840> going

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
have clips with intervention i'm going

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.449 
have clips with intervention i'm going
to<00:02:53.080> show<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:54.660> okay<00:02:55.660> so<00:02:56.020> uh<00:02:56.459> intervention

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
to show you it okay so uh intervention

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.220 
to show you it okay so uh intervention
is<00:02:57.580> a<00:02:57.610> nice<00:02:57.940> nap<00:02:58.209> not<00:02:58.450> saying<00:02:58.660> it's<00:02:58.810> not<00:02:58.959> i<00:02:58.989> love

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
is a nice nap not saying it's not i love

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.810 
is a nice nap not saying it's not i love
it<00:02:59.380> i<00:02:59.440> use<00:02:59.620> it<00:02:59.770> all<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.890> time<00:03:00.010> but<00:03:00.400> i<00:03:00.640> don't

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
it i use it all the time but i don't

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.050 
it i use it all the time but i don't
want<00:03:00.940> there<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.530> guess<00:03:02.530> it's<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.670> if<00:03:03.880> you

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
want there to I guess it's you if you

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.660 
want there to I guess it's you if you
want<00:03:04.270> a<00:03:04.650> model<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.890> to<00:03:06.010> come<00:03:06.220> swimming<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:06.640> a

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
want a model of it to come swimming is a

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.800 
want a model of it to come swimming is a
little<00:03:06.910> different<00:03:07.150> things<00:03:07.330> is<00:03:07.420> right<00:03:07.570> hand

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
little different things is right hand

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.020 
little different things is right hand
bro<00:03:07.959> so<00:03:08.650> if<00:03:08.920> you<00:03:09.040> want<00:03:09.190> a<00:03:09.250> quick<00:03:09.459> scope<00:03:09.760> with

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
bro so if you want a quick scope with

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.550 
bro so if you want a quick scope with
the<00:03:10.150> scope<00:03:10.420> definitely<00:03:11.020> intervention<00:03:11.470> is

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
the scope definitely intervention is

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.650 
the scope definitely intervention is
better<00:03:11.770> for<00:03:11.950> that<00:03:11.980> since<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.610> since<00:03:13.450> sleight

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
better for that since the since sleight

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.020 
better for that since the since sleight
of<00:03:13.690> hand<00:03:13.900> pro<00:03:13.959> but<00:03:14.350> um<00:03:14.620> i<00:03:15.070> like<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.489> employ<00:03:15.820> a

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
of hand pro but um i like to employ a

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.729 
of hand pro but um i like to employ a
one<00:03:16.239> with<00:03:16.390> a<00:03:16.510> cog<00:03:16.750> excite<00:03:17.049> better<00:03:17.230> for<00:03:17.530> quick

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
one with a cog excite better for quick

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.789 
one with a cog excite better for quick
scoping<00:03:18.100> but<00:03:18.310> that's<00:03:18.459> just<00:03:18.519> my<00:03:18.700> opinion<00:03:18.730> uh

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
scoping but that's just my opinion uh

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.050 
scoping but that's just my opinion uh
invention<00:03:20.799> everybody<00:03:21.519> loves<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:21.880> like

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
invention everybody loves it like

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.060 
invention everybody loves it like
there's<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.570> lot<00:03:22.720> of<00:03:22.750> good<00:03:23.440> quick<00:03:23.680> schoolers

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
there's a lot of good quick schoolers

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.850 
there's a lot of good quick schoolers
out<00:03:24.220> there<00:03:24.400> with<00:03:24.489> a<00:03:24.519> intervention<00:03:25.239> and<00:03:25.690> i<00:03:26.110> just

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
out there with a intervention and i just

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.509 
out there with a intervention and i just
think<00:03:27.130> it's<00:03:27.280> a<00:03:27.430> really<00:03:28.060> good<00:03:28.150> sniper<00:03:28.480> but<00:03:29.519> some

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
think it's a really good sniper but some

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.860 
think it's a really good sniper but some
people<00:03:30.820> don't<00:03:31.030> use<00:03:31.420> it<00:03:31.600> too<00:03:31.750> oh<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.640> um<00:03:33.840> what<00:03:34.840> I

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
people don't use it too oh and um what I

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.600 
people don't use it too oh and um what I
think<00:03:35.200> about<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.470> intervention<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.130> hit<00:03:36.280> a

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
think about the intervention to hit a

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.930 
think about the intervention to hit a
one<00:03:36.880> shot<00:03:37.090> kill<00:03:37.150> like<00:03:38.049> mezcal<00:03:38.940> although

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
one shot kill like mezcal although

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.229 
one shot kill like mezcal although
snipers<00:03:40.360> well<00:03:40.870> it's<00:03:41.170> um<00:03:41.590> that's<00:03:42.220> that's<00:03:42.880> one

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
snipers well it's um that's that's one

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.690 
snipers well it's um that's that's one
of<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.810> end<00:03:44.019> um<00:03:44.410> well<00:03:45.570> that's<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:47.079> end<00:03:47.110> of<00:03:47.440> the

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
of the end um well that's the end of the

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.420 
of the end um well that's the end of the
m4a3<00:03:48.780> versus<00:03:49.780> intervention<00:03:50.380> it's<00:03:50.739> not<00:03:51.250> the

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
m4a3 versus intervention it's not the

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.789 
m4a3 versus intervention it's not the
best<00:03:51.640> but<00:03:51.790> um<00:03:52.890> definitely<00:03:53.890> me<00:03:54.519> I<00:03:54.820> i<00:03:55.560> I'll<00:03:56.560> go
