expectation from a player's friends I

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.900 
expectation from a player's friends I
know<00:01:58.650> the<00:01:58.890> French<00:01:59.070> there's<00:01:59.490> there's<00:01:59.760> some

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
know the French there's there's some

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.050 
know the French there's there's some
more<00:02:00.120> of<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.660> some<00:02:00.840> dedicated<00:02:01.350> team<00:02:01.980> and<00:02:02.250> they

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
more of a some dedicated team and they

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.150 
more of a some dedicated team and they
hold<00:02:03.270> us<00:02:03.480> at<00:02:03.660> our<00:02:03.780> highest<00:02:04.140> mutation<00:02:04.740> which<00:02:04.980> we

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
hold us at our highest mutation which we

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160 
hold us at our highest mutation which we
do<00:02:05.310> one<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.910> ourselves<00:02:06.330> I<00:02:06.780> think<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.140> that

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
do one of ourselves I think that that

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.139 
do one of ourselves I think that that
comes<00:02:07.620> with<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.010> it's<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> lifestyle<00:02:08.700> is

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
comes with and it's the lifestyle is

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.240 
comes with and it's the lifestyle is
entwined<00:02:09.420> with<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.899> as<00:02:10.020> well<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:10.290> it's<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:11.160> a

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
entwined with it as well so it's it's a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.040 
entwined with it as well so it's it's a
lot<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.580> destruction<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.390> can<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.690> part<00:02:12.990> of

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
lot of destruction that can be a part of

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.960 
lot of destruction that can be a part of
being<00:02:13.230> gay<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:14.130> don't<00:02:14.550> think<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.760> lot<00:02:14.910> of

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
being gay so I don't think a lot of

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.760 
being gay so I don't think a lot of
people<00:02:15.060> really<00:02:15.540> see<00:02:16.020> there<00:02:16.230> they<00:02:16.380> just<00:02:16.410> your

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
people really see there they just your

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.550 
people really see there they just your
basketball<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:17.520> we<00:02:17.640> deal<00:02:17.850> with<00:02:18.530> way<00:02:19.530> more

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
basketball but we deal with way more

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.770 
basketball but we deal with way more
than<00:02:20.070> just<00:02:20.100> basketball<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.270> think<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.570> lot<00:02:21.750> of

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
than just basketball so I think a lot of

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.490 
than just basketball so I think a lot of
us<00:02:22.020> most<00:02:22.710> of<00:02:22.830> us<00:02:22.950> Hanuman's<00:02:23.430> pretty<00:02:23.730> well<00:02:23.940> I
