00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:09.770
 so golf 6 gti to see why 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.130
 so golf 6 gti 211 ps nothing really 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.390
 So move is there you can enter 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.450
 Control Module it you can be so on 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.220
 good 260 ps so far a bit less 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.290
 but so most people we get 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.540
 really at least 45 e mail a day 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.910
 Wanted to ask a bit more 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.860
 my colleague wrong 35 is almost 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:40.810
 just like that and there is a lot going on there 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:45.430
 much more in 35 53 ps ewald in your 6th 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:48.820
 gti on 350 ps isi very much we build 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.830
 place normal gti 211 ps with the small one 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.700
 load a lot of technology on the channel 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.130
 is clear once 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.020
 the loader has to be rebuilt then 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.010
 accordingly intercooler from ford 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.230
 also comes in 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.730
 the password must be changed completely 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.040
 from the train to be more effective that he is ahead 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.680
 So we sit, we build from yours 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:11.110
 normal yes at some point 211 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.509
 ps gti edition 35 hp engine complete with 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.799
 tax money all the trimmings 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:19.689
 there is a difference once dsg and 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:21.700
 once switch so beware the dsg 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.749
 guys have luck this time for the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.659
 not only the whole story costs 

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:28.829
 fathers at 9 99 euro with everything 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.219
 trimmings downpipe lada 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:37.149
 Intercooler everything else you need 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:39.159
 stop pick up 4 1090 euro 350 ps the 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.569
 is already murderously young animals 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.850
 Switches have no problem we have so 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.899
 develop a lot of torque that we do 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.069
 problem that the clutch is red 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.819
 series couplings makes it possible 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.060
 no more case 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:50.889
 that means that 6000 euro with clutch 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.229
 sachs performance coupling expressions 

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:56.200
 everything is included and also assembled by 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.359
 the coop and clearly yes, now I have 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.789
 collected enough like the death around 50 ps 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:01.810
 we come good and torque fluctuates 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.069
 that's a bit like us 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:10.929
 are so good I have a 5 times 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:12.010
 in the front yes scarce but the area I say 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:18.540
 it has already driven you friend 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.540
 murderously fable of the tacho
