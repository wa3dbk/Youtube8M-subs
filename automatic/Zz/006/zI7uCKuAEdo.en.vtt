00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.160 
it's a mystery also later by myself
because<00:00:56.489> you'll<00:00:56.699> be<00:00:56.730> dead<00:00:57.030> one<00:00:57.480> eighteen

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170

because you'll be dead one eighteen
point<00:00:58.559> two<00:00:58.769> five<00:00:59.070> pounds<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.820> wouldn't<00:01:00.660> bother

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
point two five pounds I wouldn't bother

point two five pounds I wouldn't bother
with<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.379> thing<00:01:01.620> my<00:01:01.949> guess<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.370> that

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
with that thing my guess is that

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.040 
with that thing my guess is that
touching<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.089> will<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.449> make<00:01:03.690> your<00:01:03.839> mine

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
touching it will just make your mine

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.070 
touching it will just make your mine
even<00:01:04.500> worse<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.220> I'm<00:01:05.640> with<00:01:05.820> your<00:01:05.970> legs<00:01:06.180> where
