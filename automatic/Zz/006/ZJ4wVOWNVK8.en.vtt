00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.159
 time without filling I have also seen in 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.270

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.189
 of margarine 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:19.200
 Let's go to the recipe, let's make a 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:22.130
 put condensed milk into the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.130

 I like to move well 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:47.860
 after you've mixed everything can not 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.930
 set fire 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.930
 let's move to drop the pan're 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.170
 Let me take care of you, the bottom of 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:22.239
 pan 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.239
 always moving towards him or driving 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.850
 the chestnut should also not be 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.950
 now that you can not stop fiddling 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:45.400
 in this bee-eater and with loving care of 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.400
 god thats easy pictures 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.519
 and now 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:29.050
 After that we 'll get the 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:34.690
 cookies we 're going to break do not need 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:46.210
 We speak mine is we can 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:48.130
 it's good for us just the brigadeiro to 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.150
 our straw and we will put in a 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.880
 container 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.820
 I chose these people here because they are 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.500
 big and then I can cut and 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.800
 You'll be fine, you know, I did not want to. 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:08.800
 stay a big straw so you know 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:10.720
 crow spreads in the ready container 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.600
 people now we are going to take three 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.360
 hours in the refrigerator 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:19.600
 if you prefer a thicker straw 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.360
 Like this way you know how far you get the 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.810
 container and you can stop it 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.760
 here so I prefer finer then 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.240
 That's why I did it in that container. 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.760
 bigger and there you are, it's very simple, I do not 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.640
 I did not spend it on the sugar of 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.710
 because I do not like it very much 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.570
 But it's up to you guys, it's fine then. 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.730
 This is it, I hope you have 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.860
 liked this for italian 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.080
 I really liked it, I always thought it was 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.690
 a very complicated candy to make 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.490
 When I heard the name, but nothing else is 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.920
 that a brigadier with a biscuit that I 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.110
 I always ate that you liked it, did not 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.780
 I liked it if I signed up for the channel. 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:03.210
 one more princess that's believing 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.210
