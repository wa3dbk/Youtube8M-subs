iPhone 3GS available at the app store hi
Cody<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.240> real<00:00:12.690> barcode<00:00:13.290> scanner<00:00:13.740> why<00:00:14.130> do<00:00:14.549> I

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
Cody is a real barcode scanner why do I

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.599 
Cody is a real barcode scanner why do I
say<00:00:14.849> real<00:00:15.360> because<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.289> Cody's<00:00:16.710> approach<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.430> to

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
say real because I Cody's approach is to

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.910 
say real because I Cody's approach is to
replace<00:00:18.000> any<00:00:18.359> USB<00:00:18.750> or<00:00:19.020> Bluetooth<00:00:19.439> barcodes

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
replace any USB or Bluetooth barcodes

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.060 
replace any USB or Bluetooth barcodes
can<00:00:20.010> i<00:00:20.160> connect<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.480> your<00:00:21.660> Mac<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.320> behaves

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
can i connect it to your Mac and behaves

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.450 
can i connect it to your Mac and behaves
just<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:24.029> same<00:00:24.269> way<00:00:24.510> which<00:00:24.990> means<00:00:25.460> detecting

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
just the same way which means detecting

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.790 
just the same way which means detecting
or<00:00:26.699> scanning<00:00:27.390> barcodes<00:00:27.960> detecting<00:00:28.619> them

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
or scanning barcodes detecting them

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.009 
or scanning barcodes detecting them
deciphering<00:00:29.550> them<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.880> transmit<00:00:30.420> them<00:00:30.599> to

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
deciphering them and transmit them to

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.560 
deciphering them and transmit them to
wherever<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:32.070> text<00:00:32.369> cursor<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.880> placed<00:00:33.090> in

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
wherever the text cursor is placed in

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.040 
wherever the text cursor is placed in
for<00:00:34.320> example<00:00:35.149> we<00:00:36.149> have<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.510> text<00:00:36.899> at<00:00:37.020> a

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
for example we have this text at a

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.250 
for example we have this text at a
document<00:00:37.350> here<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.329> some<00:00:39.329> example<00:00:39.840> bar<00:00:39.989> code

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
document here and some example bar code

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.910 
document here and some example bar code
the<00:00:40.469> first<00:00:40.649> one<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> ei<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:42.350> sorry<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> UPC

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the first one is a ei and sorry is a UPC

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.250 
the first one is a ei and sorry is a UPC
a<00:00:44.129> barcode<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.410> what<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.559> do<00:00:46.739> now<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.989> that<00:00:48.989> I

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
a barcode and what we do now is that I

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.670 
a barcode and what we do now is that I
will<00:00:49.559> show<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.890> how<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.670> Cody<00:00:51.410> actually<00:00:52.410> works

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
will show you how I Cody actually works

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.330 
will show you how I Cody actually works
when<00:00:53.899> you<00:00:54.899> want<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.260> scan<00:00:55.469> some<00:00:55.680> barcodes

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
when you want to scan some barcodes

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.029 
when you want to scan some barcodes
so<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.480> start<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.899> coded<00:00:58.230> from<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> iPhone

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
so you start I coded from the iPhone

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.779 
so you start I coded from the iPhone
home<00:00:59.280> screen<00:00:59.690> and<00:01:00.690> after<00:01:01.140> starting<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
home screen and after starting it the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.870 
home screen and after starting it the
scan<00:01:03.090> view<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.539> shown<00:01:03.750> directly<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.650> wish

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
scan view is shown directly if you wish

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.219 
scan view is shown directly if you wish
you<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:06.030> set<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.450> up<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> settings

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
you can set this up in the settings

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.060 
you can set this up in the settings
settings<00:01:07.860> pane<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> video<00:01:10.560> stream

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
settings pane so this is a video stream

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.190 
settings pane so this is a video stream
and<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.610> real-time<00:01:12.180> decoding<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.900> point

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
and it's a real-time decoding you point

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.090 
and it's a real-time decoding you point
it<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> barcode<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:15.439> as<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.710> see<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
it on the barcode and as you can see the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.590 
it on the barcode and as you can see the
barcode<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.580> transmitted<00:01:18.030> directly<00:01:18.150> you

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
barcode is transmitted directly you

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600 
barcode is transmitted directly you
don't<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.200> take<00:01:19.710> any<00:01:19.950> pictures<00:01:20.460> or

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
don't have to take any pictures or

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.140 
don't have to take any pictures or
snapshots<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.450> deep<00:01:22.009> decode<00:01:23.009> them<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.820> all

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
snapshots and deep decode them it's all

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.770 
snapshots and deep decode them it's all
everything<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.170> done<00:01:25.409> automatically<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:27.030> in

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
everything is done automatically and in

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.469 
everything is done automatically and in
a<00:01:27.930> live<00:01:28.110> mode<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.860> next<00:01:29.159> example<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> ean-13

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479

a live mode the next example is a ean-13
code<00:01:31.320> pointed<00:01:32.040> point<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> iPhone<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.479> let

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
code pointed point the iPhone on it let

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.920 
code pointed point the iPhone on it let
him<00:01:33.869> out<00:01:34.020> focus<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.920> scan<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.970> that's<00:01:36.600> it

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
him out focus it and scan and that's it

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.630 
him out focus it and scan and that's it
another<00:01:37.770> example<00:01:37.950> code<00:01:38.610> 128<00:01:41.960> as<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.460> see

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
another example code 128 as you can see

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.520 
another example code 128 as you can see
the<00:01:44.820> outer<00:01:44.939> focus<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.689> iPhone<00:01:45.990> 3GS<00:01:46.350> is

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
the outer focus of the iPhone 3GS is

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.600 
the outer focus of the iPhone 3GS is
necessary<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.310> make<00:01:47.939> sharp<00:01:48.829> pictures<00:01:49.829> for<00:01:50.250> for

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
necessary to make sharp pictures for for

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.359 
necessary to make sharp pictures for for
the<00:01:50.729> decoding<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.659> it's<00:01:51.810> not<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.619> important

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
the decoding but it's not so important

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.370 
the decoding but it's not so important
even<00:01:53.610> if<00:01:53.820> they<00:01:53.970> are<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> little<00:01:54.270> blurry<00:01:54.659> your

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
even if they are a little blurry your

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.830 
even if they are a little blurry your
able<00:01:55.799> or<00:01:55.979> iconians<00:01:56.610> sometimes<00:01:57.329> are<00:01:57.509> often

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
able or iconians sometimes are often

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.080 
able or iconians sometimes are often
able<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.290> detect<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.860> decode<00:01:59.189> them<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.060> a

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
able to detect and decode them this is a

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.959 
able to detect and decode them this is a
2d<00:02:00.600> barcode<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:01.110> QR<00:02:01.560> code<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:02.549> not<00:02:02.670> so

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
2d barcode a QR code it's not so

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.490 
2d barcode a QR code it's not so
problematic<00:02:03.479> because<00:02:03.810> often<00:02:04.320> they're<00:02:04.469> a

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
problematic because often they're a

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.370 
problematic because often they're a
little<00:02:04.770> big<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:06.270> they're<00:02:06.479> even<00:02:06.960> maybe<00:02:07.170> a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
little big and so they're even maybe a

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.820 
little big and so they're even maybe a
little<00:02:07.680> blurry<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> QR<00:02:08.700> codes<00:02:09.060> are<00:02:09.300> often

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
little blurry so the QR codes are often

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.070 
little blurry so the QR codes are often
can<00:02:10.830> often<00:02:11.129> be<00:02:11.280> decoded<00:02:11.940> even<00:02:12.480> on

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
can often be decoded even on

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.509 
can often be decoded even on
iPhone<00:02:13.769> 2g<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.610> 3G<00:02:15.799> versions<00:02:16.799> rarely<00:02:17.250> where

iPhone 2g and 3G versions rarely where

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.940 
iPhone 2g and 3G versions rarely where
there's<00:02:17.819> no<00:02:18.030> other<00:02:18.060> focus<00:02:18.360> on<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.989> so<00:02:19.739> we

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
there's no other focus on it so we

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.449 
there's no other focus on it so we
scanned<00:02:20.280> far<00:02:20.810> for<00:02:21.810> barcodes<00:02:22.379> now<00:02:22.650> what<00:02:23.159> we<00:02:23.280> can

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
scanned far for barcodes now what we can

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.140 
scanned far for barcodes now what we can
do<00:02:23.610> now<00:02:23.879> is<00:02:24.110> we<00:02:25.110> change<00:02:25.799> to<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.549> call<00:02:26.940> the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
do now is we change to the I call the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.240 
do now is we change to the I call the
barcode<00:02:27.599> list<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.140> take<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.319> look<00:02:28.530> at<00:02:28.650> this

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
barcode list and take a look at this

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.610 
barcode list and take a look at this
these<00:02:29.760> are<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:30.180> four<00:02:30.420> barcodes<00:02:30.900> we<00:02:31.049> scan<00:02:31.319> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
these are the four barcodes we scan the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.699 
these are the four barcodes we scan the
newest<00:02:32.010> one<00:02:32.190> at<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.459> top<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.319> what<00:02:34.319> we<00:02:34.440> can<00:02:34.590> do

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
newest one at the top and what we can do

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.210 
newest one at the top and what we can do
now<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.190> tap<00:02:35.549> on<00:02:35.730> edit<00:02:35.940> select<00:02:36.900> for<00:02:37.379> example<00:02:37.409> d3

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
now is tap on edit select for example d3

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.479 
now is tap on edit select for example d3
or<00:02:38.250> this<00:02:38.909> and<00:02:39.180> tap<00:02:40.170> on<00:02:40.319> sand<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.129> call<00:02:41.370> these

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
or this and tap on sand and I call these

could happen

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.470 
could happen
first<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:12.930> delete<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.319> text<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.970> just<00:03:14.970> go<00:03:15.420> to

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
first I delete the text I just go to

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.900

obviously no more connection because

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.259 
obviously no more connection because

you have seen it that the text document
is<00:04:04.319> empty<00:04:04.709> why<00:04:05.010> is<00:04:05.069> it<00:04:05.340> empty<00:04:05.519> because<00:04:05.879> there's

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
is empty why is it empty because there's

is empty why is it empty because there's
no<00:04:06.359> connection<00:04:06.720> okay<00:04:07.319> we<00:04:08.010> start<00:04:08.310> teeters

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
no connection okay we start teeters

again and as you can see theatres is

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.689 
again and as you can see theatres is
there<00:04:12.349> we<00:04:13.349> killed<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.650> scan<00:04:13.889> view<00:04:14.160> on<00:04:14.280> I<00:04:14.400> Cody
