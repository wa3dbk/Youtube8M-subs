 These sections can be well taxed 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.699
 and stop 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.159

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.410

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.090
 we are for India 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.190
 Character Breyer is one kilo 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.960
 whoever receives the order one almost to a customer 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.170
 also drive 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.410
 he does not expect anyone to do that 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.450
 40 percent of these customers around his ex-girlfriend and set 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.030
 and that's how it starts 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.410
 Dell on the gate 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.200
 Coach Robert Walch 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.330
 SBN finished 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.810
 Analyst Andre Remke 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.710
 we want to change 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.710
 Syngenta friends 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.900
 Rent 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.910
 Aachen 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.490
 Misses banks 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.110
 only if 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.550
 Prödl 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.550
 can 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.030
 Voice actors convinced until the end 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:14.779
 and it's clear that Spies belongs here as well 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:19.969
 Nolan Norris floors tell the story of the main character Wernscheid put and 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.969
 Vice Chancellor's dollar per Lünen 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.539
 Euro 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.139
 more 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:40.459
 nationwide want to have themselves in the clubs 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.569
 we want to prevent that in the future 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.999
 With 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.079
 No 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:21.459
 the musicians would have to worry 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.929
 is the nominal fit at any time to happen around 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:47.259
 after the crash so Goldman Sachs was 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.259
 also from an unknown island again 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.949
 a parallel world of the so-called points 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.479
 Investors ensure that is dominated by the Leyens 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:02.899
 Bremen 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:05.899
 now 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:09.979
 the importance we are very nice to look at 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.869
 but you realize that the graphics 

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:20.430
 not that about a 1 had second since the place partly too 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.879
 sterile and the certificates of participation are coming again, this also fits in turn 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.809
 Atmosphere in May 

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:29.809
 the characters have failed for 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.219
 if you have one or the other statistics and animation on one 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.360
 one can take oneself because of the witty but also serious 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.360
 Dialogues well put into the Catherine 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.120
 Long Time 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.150
 hear 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.229
 the time passed the club years we have the gameplay too, this would be 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.289
 Forster did not want to skid a big head start 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.300
 he had to be very dangerous opponent in the way 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:17.909
 perhaps 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:21.180
 be now 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.189
 Neeson, I do that 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:27.289
 that is to be fulfilled in the first half 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:32.219
 this is my own axis turn down the changes very much 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:35.219
 promising 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.930
 Here I have a movie fun even if they are currently "shitty" 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.600
 especially when they are ready, the Dinger Interior Minister 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:58.960
 it's a pity that 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.759
 an adversary 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:06.909
 Something too one-sided are mostly going to get a country 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:08.059
 What is it 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:09.039
 the 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:12.039
 very interested in the topic 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:21.639
 The same applies to the larger clubs in five sentences what the market 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.469
 This is something for everyone 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:29.479
 In addition, they could have been more spectacular than Nordenham 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:40.089
 my tour is was from that time 

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:44.369
 has been desirable so you have to firmly hold a German under the 

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:46.979
 last four 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:48.629
 by Sascha Rhyner 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:51.379
 you see, it was only now 

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:53.860
 8 hours 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.229
 so does not feel like that all the time 

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:00.089
 +++ entertained 

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:02.629
 it is fun 

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:04.249
 Dark Void opens 

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:05.249
 that you 

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:08.249
 That's why I'm looking forward to it 78 

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:24.370
 "This was my first medium to come round and not" some interesting 

00:07:24.369 --> 00:07:27.369
 to dispose 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.550
 exactly 

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:41.740
 Ho
