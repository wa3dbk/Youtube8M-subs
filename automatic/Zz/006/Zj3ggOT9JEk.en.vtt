00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.560
 ok with this 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.560
 now 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.880
 when it is not there is not close to do 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.240
 heat already here there is a 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.600
 in a camp something more turbo and here 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:02.310
 is the good looks he taught it to see if it 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.310
 locate better there is the camp 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:11.960
 the best asset of the bridge here is a 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:14.500
 Forge to climb up here I am here and now 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.500
 There is the mine 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.280
 when you pass by him through the camp 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.460
 a guard is going to say that if you can not 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.970
 happen because we are not going to 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.520
 attack 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.770
 good 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:35.869
 good to come here between that plate 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:41.200
 here in the mine there is as if there are four or 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:45.020
 five orcs working miners who do not 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.780
 they say nothing they notice 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.470
 they tell you that you can not be here and 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:57.230
 those things that your race 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.940
 they can not be good is an armor that 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.580
 and the delay 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.000
 good and as I said that here you can 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.600
 take one 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.600
 some 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.430
 30-40 ingots without problems so I made myself 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.120
 I 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.829
 this mute ebony armor also 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.969
 It serves as armor and erika 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:24.740
 you know good here is iron ore 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:27.950
 well I do not know if I do not 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.250
 no less will but this is worth this is 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.250
 iron 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.190
 valerie steele are the orcs who 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.830
 they were working here 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.080
 and this would be elevated 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.810
 and I do not give myself to take it out but 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.520
 this would be of no avail 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.100
 because all this all this is going not all 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.569
 what you see everything so silvery rocks 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.630
 silver 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:59.220
 all this is ebony here there are also 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:02.550
 all this all 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.830
 all this this week this week 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:11.010
 also look for the way to look here 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:14.730
 in the good boxes the cars and the 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.450
 soil because there may be ebony can see 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.450
 ebony mineral 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.980
 so it goes 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:28.110
 so low 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.110
 and here there is ebony we are not going 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.900
 It's funny because when I came 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.999
 and here you see it breaks all this but it 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.110
 see when you go in when it does not come out if 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:41.130
 enter 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:45.210
 be stable again I do not know 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.210
 that's all island is explored 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.510
 the sprays the mine is the mine that is not 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.730
 very long and has no cheating 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.030
 that can 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:01.230
 and shipyards 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.230
 here is a bag of coins 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.770
 marked 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.770
 once you have 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.319
 once you have the ebony 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:16.750
 Nothing to melt it 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.850
 and from the 2 mingotes 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.120
 good to make your ebony module 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:28.330
 well now hours that I will teach 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.330
 right here you have an elongated 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:36.069
 look here you have if I think that because this 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.870
 when I came here I already steal it 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.870
 so it seems that 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.650
 You can say that here I know 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.129
 it will reset things 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:53.989
 well here you have a weapon 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.989
 you use it to melt the ebony 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:02.020
 you go down here and they do not take you to 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:05.340
 each side in every two ore is a link 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.340
 so those who believe 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.570
 good you go to the forge 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:19.580
 and here I do not have now I do not have no 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:23.810
 I can do from the thread but good if 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.659
 you want if you want the 'hand and 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:32.900
 old hearts was that they sell them in 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:35.900
 nor bernal since I have six ingots 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.060
 of ebony as you can see I can create what 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.310
 whatever you want 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.050
 create everything good 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.870
 but I'm not going to create, I'm going to 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.530
 Save for good armor erika 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:52.540
 we come here and you believe what 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:55.540
 we like is the armor daggers shields 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.540
 Axes 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:04.160
 whatever you want, you come here and you do it and 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:07.510
 do not forget to give a little pass through here 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:12.160
 because here there is ebony 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:15.160
 do a little pass through here and what 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.120
 that I found afterwards that what 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.139
 you carry 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.139
 good bender people 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.669
 the miners are dominating the warriors 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.380
 rather they do not sell evans at least 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:35.410
 they do not sell me 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.410
 in this video where they say you have to 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:47.379
 here I 'll take care of everyone good 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:49.909
 I've seen videos that say you have to 

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:51.569
 keep moving forward in history so that 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:56.449
 sell you things 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:56.449
 but I do not know why I already have the roda 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.800

 but they sell it they sell it because I've seen 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:16.009
 videos that sell it but when that does not 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:17.990
