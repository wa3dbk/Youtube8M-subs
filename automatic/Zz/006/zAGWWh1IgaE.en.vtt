cables<00:00:13.720> so<00:00:14.290> you<00:00:14.349> have<00:00:14.530> these<00:00:14.650> six<00:00:14.920> little<00:00:15.190> guys

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
cables so you have these six little guys

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.210 
cables so you have these six little guys
over<00:00:15.700> here<00:00:16.349> each<00:00:17.349> one<00:00:17.560> of<00:00:17.619> them<00:00:17.770> goes<00:00:17.950> to<00:00:18.189> a

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
over here each one of them goes to a

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.229 
over here each one of them goes to a
different<00:00:18.450> speaker<00:00:19.450> inside<00:00:21.090> uses<00:00:22.090> little

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:22.239 
different speaker inside uses little

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.319 
different speaker inside uses little
orbs<00:00:22.689> over<00:00:22.869> here<00:00:23.200> I<00:00:23.710> guess<00:00:24.189> they're<00:00:24.430> chemists

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:25.329 
orbs over here I guess they're chemists

cable<00:00:34.570> it<00:00:35.379> only<00:00:35.500> has<00:00:36.090> one<00:00:37.090> jack<00:00:37.420> over<00:00:37.750> here<00:00:37.989> and

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
cable it only has one jack over here and

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.959 
cable it only has one jack over here and
this<00:00:38.469> one<00:00:38.710> guy<00:00:38.890> goes<00:00:39.129> to<00:00:39.309> all<00:00:39.429> the<00:00:39.460> pins<00:00:39.820> in

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
this one guy goes to all the pins in

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:42.509 
this one guy goes to all the pins in
here<00:00:40.120> and<00:00:40.629> these<00:00:40.870> are<00:00:41.079> all<00:00:41.199> separated<00:00:41.859> to<00:00:42.339> all

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
here and these are all separated to all

here and these are all separated to all
the<00:00:42.640> percussion<00:00:43.149> so<00:00:43.750> what<00:00:43.870> we<00:00:43.989> have<00:00:44.230> here<00:00:44.460> this

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
the percussion so what we have here this

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.000 
the percussion so what we have here this
is<00:00:45.579> the<00:00:45.609> jack<00:00:45.940> that<00:00:45.969> we're<00:00:46.329> soldering<00:00:47.050> to<00:00:47.289> so

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
is the jack that we're soldering to so

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.360 
is the jack that we're soldering to so
the<00:00:48.760> blue<00:00:48.999> goes<00:00:49.300> to<00:00:49.480> the<00:00:49.600> hot<00:00:49.839> wire<00:00:50.649> which<00:00:51.190> is

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
the blue goes to the hot wire which is

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.620 
the blue goes to the hot wire which is
that

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.620 

and<00:00:53.930> this<00:00:54.680> is<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.950> ground<00:00:55.220> and<00:00:56.060> what<00:00:56.480> you

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
and this is the ground and what you

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.790 
and this is the ground and what you
wanted<00:00:56.930> to<00:00:57.050> do<00:00:57.790> is<00:00:58.790> that<00:00:59.210> so<00:01:00.110> that<00:01:00.230> this<00:01:00.350> wraps

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
wanted to do is that so that this wraps

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.610 
wanted to do is that so that this wraps
around<00:01:01.010> here<00:01:01.520> and<00:01:01.700> you<00:01:02.270> have<00:01:02.450> perfect<00:01:03.230> length

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
around here and you have perfect length

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.800 
around here and you have perfect length
for<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.130> blue<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.550> white<00:01:04.580> to<00:01:04.910> attach<00:01:05.210> so

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
for the blue and the white to attach so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.160 
for the blue and the white to attach so
you<00:01:05.900> get<00:01:06.020> these<00:01:06.140> little<00:01:06.200> strippers<00:01:06.800> here

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:19.880 

the<00:01:12.470> same<00:01:12.860> thing<00:01:13.189> to<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:13.640> white<00:01:13.820> one

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.300 

prepare<00:01:20.310> it

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
prepare it

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.550 
prepare it
like<00:01:22.700> stick<00:01:23.420> this<00:01:23.570> one<00:01:23.630> gonna<00:01:26.350> flatten<00:01:27.350> them

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
like stick this one gonna flatten them

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.789 
like stick this one gonna flatten them
down<00:01:27.770> so<00:01:27.979> he<00:01:28.070> doesn't<00:01:28.220> go<00:01:28.430> anywhere<00:01:32.649> so<00:01:33.649> this

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
down so he doesn't go anywhere so this

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.980 
down so he doesn't go anywhere so this
is<00:01:33.920> what's<00:01:34.130> happening<00:01:34.720> squeeze<00:01:35.720> these<00:01:37.990> it's

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
is what's happening squeeze these it's

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.139 
is what's happening squeeze these it's
good<00:01:40.600> so<00:01:42.220> ideally<00:01:43.220> you<00:01:43.520> don't<00:01:43.729> want<00:01:43.970> any

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
good so ideally you don't want any

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.539 
good so ideally you don't want any
copper<00:01:44.750> hair<00:01:45.380> sticking<00:01:45.799> out<00:01:46.039> anywhere<00:01:46.429> you

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
copper hair sticking out anywhere you

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.080 
copper hair sticking out anywhere you
don't<00:01:46.700> want<00:01:46.939> to<00:01:47.060> have<00:01:47.149> a<00:01:47.210> flat<00:01:47.450> like<00:01:47.630> that<00:01:49.090> put

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
don't want to have a flat like that put

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.859 
don't want to have a flat like that put
them<00:01:50.179> in<00:01:50.329> the<00:01:50.770> helping<00:01:51.770> hands<00:01:52.479> do<00:01:53.479> that<00:01:53.659> just

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
them in the helping hands do that just

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.370 
them in the helping hands do that just
so<00:01:53.990> it<00:01:54.259> doesn't<00:01:54.289> move<00:01:55.840> getting<00:01:56.840> this<00:01:56.929> this<00:01:57.229> is

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
so it doesn't move getting this this is

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.440 
so it doesn't move getting this this is
tense<00:01:58.190> part<00:01:58.490> right<00:01:58.670> here<00:01:58.700> you<00:01:59.119> want<00:01:59.270> to<00:01:59.330> make

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
tense part right here you want to make

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.779 
tense part right here you want to make
it<00:01:59.600> nice<00:01:59.750> and<00:02:00.049> smooth<00:02:02.319> do<00:02:03.319> that<00:02:03.619> putting<00:02:04.580> some

once<00:02:30.990> again<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.500> idea<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:32.070> to<00:02:32.100> get<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.400> real

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
once again the idea is to get a real

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.830 
once again the idea is to get a real
smooth<00:02:34.940> he<00:02:35.940> ought<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.060> clip<00:02:36.330> them<00:02:38.840> plastic

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
smooth he ought to clip them plastic

goes in sheep and she goes it's pretty
hot<00:02:49.610> screwed<00:02:50.610> on<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.900> throw<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.320> at

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.490 

ok<00:02:56.990> so<00:02:58.180> I'm<00:02:59.180> sorry<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.930> grounds<00:03:00.350> together

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
ok so I'm sorry the grounds together

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.460 
ok so I'm sorry the grounds together
from<00:03:01.100> all<00:03:01.220> these<00:03:01.370> wires<00:03:01.610> and<00:03:02.300> what<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.260> did<00:03:03.440> was

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
from all these wires and what I did was

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.410 
from all these wires and what I did was
I<00:03:03.860> just<00:03:03.980> put<00:03:04.310> some<00:03:04.430> electrical<00:03:04.850> tape<00:03:04.880> around

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
I just put some electrical tape around

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.380 
I just put some electrical tape around
all<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:06.020> wires<00:03:06.310> then<00:03:07.310> it<00:03:07.460> twisted<00:03:07.910> all<00:03:08.180> the

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
all the wires then it twisted all the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.060 
all the wires then it twisted all the
grounds<00:03:08.750> together<00:03:08.900> now<00:03:09.530> I'm<00:03:09.650> putting<00:03:09.770> some

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
grounds together now I'm putting some

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.890 
grounds together now I'm putting some
solder<00:03:10.310> on<00:03:10.520> it<00:03:10.700> from<00:03:11.330> here<00:03:11.510> I'm<00:03:11.660> going<00:03:11.720> to

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
solder on it from here I'm going to

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.530 
solder on it from here I'm going to
attach<00:03:12.230> another<00:03:12.410> wire<00:03:13.090> which<00:03:14.090> is<00:03:14.240> going<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.420> go

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
attach another wire which is going to go

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.900 
attach another wire which is going to go
to<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.840> ground<00:03:15.080> on<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.950> XLR<00:03:16.370> pin<00:03:18.700> so<00:03:19.700> I'm<00:03:19.760> just

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
to the ground on the XLR pin so I'm just

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:45.710 
to the ground on the XLR pin so I'm just
going<00:03:20.060> to

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.090 

no<00:03:46.500> house<00:03:48.110> now<00:03:49.110> just<00:03:49.350> going<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.560> solder<00:03:49.950> this

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
no house now just going to solder this

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.460 
no house now just going to solder this
wire<00:03:50.400> onto<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.450> ground<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:52.020> this<00:03:52.170> is<00:03:52.290> going

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
wire onto the ground and this is going

00:03:52.470 --> 00:04:07.640 
wire onto the ground and this is going
to<00:03:52.530> go<00:03:52.680> on<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:53.760> XLR<00:03:54.360> connector

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.289 

cool<00:04:08.720> all<00:04:09.720> right<00:04:09.870> so<00:04:10.079> here<00:04:10.739> we<00:04:10.890> have<00:04:10.920> all<00:04:11.909> six

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
cool all right so here we have all six

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.479 
cool all right so here we have all six
connectors<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:13.620> ground<00:04:13.860> wire<00:04:14.129> has<00:04:14.459> been

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
connectors the ground wire has been

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.759 
connectors the ground wire has been
soldered<00:04:14.879> together<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.599> soldered<00:04:16.530> to

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
soldered together and soldered to

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.509 
soldered together and soldered to
another<00:04:17.699> wire<00:04:18.470> to<00:04:19.470> make<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.709> easier<00:04:19.949> to<00:04:20.190> solder

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
another wire to make it easier to solder

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.140 
another wire to make it easier to solder
to<00:04:20.910> this<00:04:21.359> connector<00:04:21.780> here<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:24.000> other

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
to this connector here and the other

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.840 
to this connector here and the other
wires<00:04:24.449> have<00:04:24.810> been<00:04:24.840> trimmed<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:25.680> stripped<00:04:26.009> to

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
wires have been trimmed and stripped to

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.700 
wires have been trimmed and stripped to
be<00:04:26.970> about<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.300> same<00:04:27.449> length<00:04:27.690> what<00:04:28.620> we're

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
be about the same length what we're

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.189 
be about the same length what we're
going<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:28.889> do<00:04:29.039> is<00:04:29.190> we're<00:04:29.370> going<00:04:29.460> to<00:04:29.520> take<00:04:29.610> this

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
going to do is we're going to take this

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.810 
going to do is we're going to take this
sheath<00:04:31.199> here<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:31.740> we're<00:04:32.430> going<00:04:32.520> to<00:04:32.580> slip<00:04:32.729> it

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
sheath here and we're going to slip it

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.969 
sheath here and we're going to slip it
over<00:04:32.880> here<00:04:33.210> just<00:04:33.479> to<00:04:33.660> cover<00:04:33.870> this<00:04:34.229> so<00:04:34.590> nothing

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
over here just to cover this so nothing

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.670 
over here just to cover this so nothing
shorts<00:04:35.250> out<00:04:35.400> inside<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:36.030> cable<00:04:36.389> heat<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:37.530> the

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
shorts out inside the cable heat to the

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.580 
shorts out inside the cable heat to the
shrink<00:04:37.919> wrap<00:04:38.220> just<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.180> shrink<00:04:39.419> it<00:04:39.479> down<00:04:39.539> so<00:04:40.500> it

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
shrink wrap just to shrink it down so it

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.460 
shrink wrap just to shrink it down so it
doesn't<00:04:40.620> slip<00:04:40.949> off<00:04:41.570> important<00:04:42.570> key<00:04:42.750> step<00:04:43.080> do

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
doesn't slip off important key step do

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.180 
doesn't slip off important key step do
not<00:04:43.710> forget<00:04:44.039> to<00:04:44.310> put<00:04:44.460> this<00:04:44.610> on<00:04:44.789> first

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
not forget to put this on first

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.000 
not forget to put this on first
otherwise<00:04:48.110> you'll<00:04:49.110> have<00:04:49.139> to<00:04:49.530> take<00:04:49.710> everything

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
otherwise you'll have to take everything

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.820 
otherwise you'll have to take everything
apart<00:04:50.930> and<00:04:51.930> you<00:04:52.050> will<00:04:52.169> need<00:04:52.260> to<00:04:52.410> slip<00:04:52.650> that<00:04:52.770> on

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
apart and you will need to slip that on

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.490 
apart and you will need to slip that on
one<00:04:53.160> wire<00:04:53.400> at<00:04:53.639> a<00:04:53.729> time<00:04:53.970> in<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:55.020> inside<00:04:55.260> of<00:04:55.289> a

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
one wire at a time in the inside of a

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.370 
one wire at a time in the inside of a
6-pin<00:04:55.860> connector<00:04:55.889> cable<00:04:56.580> here<00:04:56.760> and<00:04:57.720> we<00:04:58.229> are

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
6-pin connector cable here and we are

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.100 
6-pin connector cable here and we are
going<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.740> i<00:04:59.430> start<00:04:59.970> with<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.120> ground<00:05:00.449> i<00:05:00.780> don't

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
going to i start with the ground i don't

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.379 
going to i start with the ground i don't
think<00:05:01.169> it<00:05:01.440> really<00:05:01.470> matters<00:05:01.680> but<00:05:02.250> you<00:05:03.180> just

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
think it really matters but you just

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:18.640 
think it really matters but you just
slip<00:05:03.630> the<00:05:03.960> wire<00:05:04.169> through

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.710 

it's<00:05:19.650> also<00:05:19.800> a<00:05:19.980> good<00:05:20.220> idea<00:05:20.310> if<00:05:20.700> you<00:05:20.790> can<00:05:21.030> to<00:05:21.570> get

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
it's also a good idea if you can to get

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.740 
it's also a good idea if you can to get
the<00:05:21.960> back<00:05:22.200> of<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.910> connector<00:05:23.910> on<00:05:24.120> this<00:05:24.420> one<00:05:24.630> at

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
the back of the connector on this one at

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.940 
the back of the connector on this one at
least<00:05:24.780> are<00:05:25.050> the<00:05:25.140> ones<00:05:25.290> where<00:05:25.440> there's<00:05:25.620> a<00:05:25.680> hole

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
least are the ones where there's a hole

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.380 
least are the ones where there's a hole
through<00:05:26.340> it<00:05:26.370> just<00:05:27.270> so<00:05:28.190> next<00:05:29.190> we<00:05:30.060> haven't

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
through it just so next we haven't

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.390 
through it just so next we haven't
labeled<00:05:30.780> any<00:05:31.260> of<00:05:31.440> these<00:05:31.590> yet<00:05:31.860> so<00:05:32.070> it<00:05:32.190> really

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
labeled any of these yet so it really

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.850 
labeled any of these yet so it really
doesn't<00:05:33.210> matter<00:05:33.390> which<00:05:34.350> one<00:05:34.380> goes<00:05:34.800> where

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
doesn't matter which one goes where

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.920 
doesn't matter which one goes where
we'll<00:05:35.520> figure<00:05:35.730> that<00:05:36.000> out<00:05:36.060> later<00:05:36.210> when<00:05:36.540> we<00:05:36.690> test

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
we'll figure that out later when we test

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.570 
we'll figure that out later when we test
it<00:05:38.090> but<00:05:39.090> for<00:05:39.660> the<00:05:39.750> 6-pin<00:05:40.170> connector<00:05:40.430> you<00:05:41.430> can

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
it but for the 6-pin connector you can

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.970 
it but for the 6-pin connector you can
see<00:05:41.760> that<00:05:41.790> there's<00:05:42.600> one<00:05:42.870> in<00:05:42.990> the<00:05:43.080> middle<00:05:43.290> and<00:05:43.560> I

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:43.980 
see that there's one in the middle and I

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.470 
see that there's one in the middle and I
find<00:05:44.220> it's<00:05:44.370> easiest<00:05:44.640> to<00:05:44.790> solder<00:05:45.090> that<00:05:45.330> one

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
find it's easiest to solder that one

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.690 
find it's easiest to solder that one
first<00:05:45.740> just<00:05:46.740> because<00:05:46.920> when<00:05:47.220> you<00:05:47.310> have<00:05:47.340> all<00:05:47.580> the

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
first just because when you have all the

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.610 
first just because when you have all the
other<00:05:47.850> five<00:05:48.060> around<00:05:48.450> it<00:05:48.570> it<00:05:48.810> gets<00:05:49.050> very<00:05:49.140> hard

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
other five around it it gets very hard

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.750 
other five around it it gets very hard
to<00:05:50.160> get<00:05:50.310> it<00:05:50.490> that<00:05:50.670> one<00:05:50.700> slot<00:05:51.950> so<00:05:52.950> what<00:05:53.160> to<00:05:53.310> do<00:05:53.460> is

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
to get it that one slot so what to do is

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.400 
to get it that one slot so what to do is
take<00:05:54.030> the<00:05:54.420> next<00:05:54.600> wire<00:05:54.840> that<00:05:55.020> you<00:05:55.110> plan<00:05:55.290> to

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
take the next wire that you plan to

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.020 
take the next wire that you plan to
slaughter<00:05:55.620> and<00:05:55.920> you<00:05:56.430> push<00:05:56.610> it<00:05:56.760> through<00:05:56.940> the

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
slaughter and you push it through the

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.810 
slaughter and you push it through the
bottom<00:05:57.390> of<00:05:57.630> the<00:05:58.050> cap<00:05:58.260> here<00:05:58.620> pull<00:05:59.520> the<00:05:59.550> cap<00:05:59.790> back

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
bottom of the cap here pull the cap back

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.870 
bottom of the cap here pull the cap back
and<00:06:00.390> this<00:06:01.020> just<00:06:01.260> helps<00:06:01.410> keep<00:06:01.770> the<00:06:02.400> wire<00:06:02.610> you're

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
and this just helps keep the wire you're

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.370 
and this just helps keep the wire you're
working<00:06:03.180> with<00:06:03.330> separate<00:06:03.780> from<00:06:03.990> all<00:06:04.110> the<00:06:04.230> other

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
working with separate from all the other

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.890 
working with separate from all the other
ones<00:06:04.650> so<00:06:04.920> you<00:06:05.880> don't<00:06:06.030> have<00:06:06.180> too<00:06:06.420> many<00:06:06.540> around

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
ones so you don't have too many around

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:22.059 
ones so you don't have too many around
you<00:06:07.020> at<00:06:07.140> once

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:22.069 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:55.640 

so<00:06:23.069> we<00:06:23.880> are<00:06:24.090> soldered<00:06:24.539> on<00:06:24.780> all<00:06:25.169> the<00:06:25.410> connectors

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:10.730 

you'll<00:06:56.650> see<00:06:56.889> a<00:06:56.919> little<00:06:57.220> notch<00:06:57.490> in<00:06:57.760> here

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:25.619 

we're<00:07:11.740> going<00:07:11.979> to<00:07:12.069> tape<00:07:12.250> it<00:07:12.370> up<00:07:12.520> to<00:07:22.650> do<00:07:24.030> is<00:07:25.030> check

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:25.629 
we're going to tape it up to do is check

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:28.740 
we're going to tape it up to do is check
to<00:07:25.810> see<00:07:26.080> the<00:07:26.379> connections<00:07:26.949> between<00:07:27.569> which<00:07:28.569> one

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:28.750 
to see the connections between which one

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.969 
to see the connections between which one
of<00:07:28.780> these<00:07:28.990> goes<00:07:29.319> to<00:07:29.680> which<00:07:30.250> prom<00:07:30.879> in<00:07:31.270> here<00:07:31.659> and

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:31.979 
of these goes to which prom in here and

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:34.499 
of these goes to which prom in here and
then<00:07:32.979> we<00:07:33.220> will<00:07:33.370> label<00:07:33.580> them<00:07:33.849> with<00:07:33.879> masting

00:07:34.499 --> 00:07:34.509 
then we will label them with masting

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:38.650 
then we will label them with masting
masking<00:07:35.080> tape<00:07:35.289> channels<00:07:35.979> 1<00:07:36.129> through<00:07:36.159> 6

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:38.660 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:44.260 

so<00:07:39.230> because<00:07:39.920> this<00:07:40.070> one<00:07:42.520> now<00:07:43.520> that<00:07:43.970> means<00:07:44.120> that

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:44.270 
so because this one now that means that

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:49.900 
so because this one now that means that
that<00:07:44.660> is<00:07:44.840> one<00:07:46.000> all<00:07:47.000> the<00:07:47.420> recording
