00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
biology that we read about in schools

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.780 
biology that we read about in schools
when<00:00:40.899> Isaac<00:00:41.290> Newton<00:00:41.620> was<00:00:41.770> looking<00:00:42.130> at<00:00:42.340> the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
when Isaac Newton was looking at the

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.060 
when Isaac Newton was looking at the
nature<00:00:43.390> of<00:00:43.450> the<00:00:43.840> universe<00:00:43.870> and<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:44.620> movement

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
nature of the universe and the movement

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.369 
nature of the universe and the movement
of<00:00:45.160> the<00:00:45.250> planets<00:00:45.460> and<00:00:45.790> the<00:00:45.880> stars<00:00:45.960> he<00:00:46.960> invoked

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
of the planets and the stars he invoked

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.920 
of the planets and the stars he invoked
the<00:00:47.620> idea<00:00:48.070> of<00:00:48.190> Descartes<00:00:48.730> that<00:00:49.090> the<00:00:49.570> universe

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
the idea of Descartes that the universe

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.020 
the idea of Descartes that the universe
was<00:00:50.140> like<00:00:50.320> a<00:00:50.379> giant<00:00:50.649> machine<00:00:50.950> and<00:00:51.460> the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
was like a giant machine and the

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.779 
was like a giant machine and the
significance<00:00:52.690> is<00:00:52.930> that<00:00:52.989> in<00:00:53.559> his<00:00:53.860> data<00:00:54.190> the

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
significance is that in his data the

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:56.880 
significance is that in his data the
only<00:00:55.149> thing<00:00:55.390> he<00:00:55.539> offered<00:00:56.140> in<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.379> equation

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
only thing he offered in the equation

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.040 
only thing he offered in the equation
were<00:00:57.280> physical<00:00:57.850> characteristics<00:00:58.329> of<00:00:58.930> the

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
were physical characteristics of the

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.529 
were physical characteristics of the
planets<00:00:59.500> and<00:00:59.649> their<00:00:59.770> movement<00:01:00.250> no<00:01:00.789> invisible

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
planets and their movement no invisible

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.160 
planets and their movement no invisible
energetic<00:01:02.230> characteristics<00:01:03.190> so<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.690> science

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
energetic characteristics so the science

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.249 
energetic characteristics so the science
that<00:01:05.470> Newton<00:01:05.920> was<00:01:06.220> working<00:01:06.700> on<00:01:06.880> was<00:01:07.570> a<00:01:07.600> science

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
that Newton was working on was a science

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.040 
that Newton was working on was a science
based<00:01:08.500> on<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:09.160> physical<00:01:09.700> material<00:01:10.000> world<00:01:10.720> so

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
based on the physical material world so

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.990 
based on the physical material world so
the<00:01:11.200> science<00:01:11.619> that<00:01:11.800> evolved<00:01:12.399> from<00:01:12.580> Newton<00:01:12.909> has

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
the science that evolved from Newton has

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.679 
the science that evolved from Newton has
been<00:01:13.210> called<00:01:14.040> scientific<00:01:15.040> materialism<00:01:15.970> and

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
been called scientific materialism and

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.660 
been called scientific materialism and
scientific<00:01:17.380> materialism<00:01:17.920> means<00:01:18.310> if<00:01:18.400> you<00:01:18.490> want

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
scientific materialism means if you want

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.920 
scientific materialism means if you want
to<00:01:18.760> understand<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.240> nature<00:01:19.450> of<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.720> universe

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
to understand the nature of the universe

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.910 
to understand the nature of the universe
and<00:01:20.290> everything<00:01:20.320> in<00:01:20.799> it<00:01:20.830> such<00:01:21.250> as<00:01:21.600> us<00:01:22.600> then<00:01:23.560> you

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
and everything in it such as us then you

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.679 
and everything in it such as us then you
don't<00:01:24.340> have<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.580> look<00:01:24.790> for<00:01:24.939> invisible<00:01:25.420> forces

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
don't have to look for invisible forces

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:27.960 
don't have to look for invisible forces
you<00:01:25.930> just<00:01:26.140> study<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.710> physical<00:01:27.130> realm<00:01:27.400> mind

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
you just study the physical realm mind

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.719 
you just study the physical realm mind
and<00:01:28.360> and<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:29.500> invisible<00:01:30.040> forces<00:01:30.369> were

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
and and the invisible forces were

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.789 
and and the invisible forces were
eliminated<00:01:31.570> from<00:01:31.600> understanding<00:01:32.140> nature<00:01:32.560> of

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
eliminated from understanding nature of

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.950 
eliminated from understanding nature of
the<00:01:32.890> human<00:01:32.979> body<00:01:33.369> but<00:01:34.270> when<00:01:34.450> we<00:01:34.540> look<00:01:34.750> at<00:01:34.840> the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
the human body but when we look at the

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.080 
the human body but when we look at the
human<00:01:35.049> body<00:01:35.380> in<00:01:35.619> a<00:01:35.740> Newtonian<00:01:36.280> perspective

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
human body in a Newtonian perspective

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.670 
human body in a Newtonian perspective
then<00:01:37.210> we<00:01:37.360> see<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.720> human<00:01:38.020> body<00:01:38.320> as<00:01:38.500> a<00:01:38.530> machine

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
then we see the human body as a machine

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.249 
then we see the human body as a machine
it's<00:01:39.549> a<00:01:39.700> physical<00:01:40.210> element<00:01:40.750> that<00:01:40.900> can<00:01:41.140> be

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
it's a physical element that can be

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.950 
it's a physical element that can be
taken<00:01:41.650> apart<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.340> pieces<00:01:42.759> study<00:01:43.090> so

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
taken apart and the pieces study so

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.539 
taken apart and the pieces study so
scientists<00:01:44.650> started<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:44.979> take<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.369> body

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
scientists started to take the body

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.210 
scientists started to take the body
apart<00:01:45.970> first<00:01:46.750> it<00:01:46.930> was<00:01:47.079> gross<00:01:47.380> anatomy<00:01:47.740> where

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
apart first it was gross anatomy where

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.859 
apart first it was gross anatomy where
they<00:01:48.340> just<00:01:48.610> started<00:01:48.850> to<00:01:48.909> look<00:01:49.090> at<00:01:49.240> what<00:01:49.750> you

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
they just started to look at what you

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.109 
they just started to look at what you
could<00:01:50.020> see<00:01:50.200> with<00:01:50.350> your<00:01:50.439> eyes<00:01:50.619> only<00:01:50.920> later<00:01:51.880> when

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
could see with your eyes only later when

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.270 
could see with your eyes only later when
the<00:01:52.240> microscope<00:01:52.869> evolved<00:01:53.409> then<00:01:54.009> they

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
the microscope evolved then they

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.830 
the microscope evolved then they
discovered<00:01:54.970> was<00:01:55.119> called<00:01:55.390> microscopic

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
discovered was called microscopic

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.840 
discovered was called microscopic
anatomy<00:01:56.680> where<00:01:56.860> you<00:01:57.009> then<00:01:57.220> looked<00:01:57.549> at<00:01:57.700> those

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
anatomy where you then looked at those

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.460 
anatomy where you then looked at those
structures<00:01:58.390> like<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:58.750> muscles<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.350> the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
structures like the muscles and the

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.170 
structures like the muscles and the
organs<00:01:59.890> and<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.070> glands<00:02:00.369> but<00:02:00.610> you<00:02:00.729> now<00:02:00.909> looked

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
organs and the glands but you now looked

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.609 
organs and the glands but you now looked
at<00:02:01.329> them<00:02:01.450> with<00:02:01.540> a<00:02:01.600> microscope<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.320> looked<00:02:02.500> at

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
at them with a microscope and looked at

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.219 
at them with a microscope and looked at
the<00:02:02.740> cells<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.490> tissues<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:04.540> then<00:02:04.780> after

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
the cells and the tissues and then after

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.260 
the cells and the tissues and then after
that<00:02:05.409> a<00:02:05.439> new<00:02:05.649> field<00:02:06.189> came<00:02:06.579> in<00:02:06.729> which<00:02:06.909> is<00:02:07.060> called

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
that a new field came in which is called

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.300 
that a new field came in which is called
biochemistry<00:02:08.019> which<00:02:08.229> then<00:02:08.440> further<00:02:08.709> took<00:02:09.160> the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
biochemistry which then further took the

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.949 
biochemistry which then further took the
Machine<00:02:09.640> apart<00:02:09.790> down<00:02:10.209> to<00:02:10.269> smaller<00:02:10.840> and

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
Machine apart down to smaller and

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.069 
Machine apart down to smaller and
smaller<00:02:11.110> pieces<00:02:11.680> well<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:13.269> final<00:02:13.540> taking<00:02:13.989> a

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.079 
smaller pieces well the final taking a

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:15.450 
smaller pieces well the final taking a
part<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.470> body<00:02:14.680> really<00:02:15.010> occurred

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
part of the body really occurred

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.690 
part of the body really occurred
in<00:02:15.490> 1953<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.750> that's<00:02:17.230> when<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.770> double-helix

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
in 1953 and that's when the double-helix

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.490 
in 1953 and that's when the double-helix
image<00:02:19.270> offered<00:02:20.130> by<00:02:21.130> Watson<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:21.880> Crick<00:02:22.500> ended

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
image offered by Watson and Crick ended

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.560 
image offered by Watson and Crick ended
the<00:02:23.650> search<00:02:23.920> for<00:02:24.340> how<00:02:24.580> biology<00:02:24.850> worked

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
the search for how biology worked

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.410 
the search for how biology worked
because<00:02:26.320> once<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.310> double<00:02:27.640> helix<00:02:28.000> was<00:02:28.150> found

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
because once the double helix was found

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.870 
because once the double helix was found
and<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.750> DNA<00:02:29.260> was<00:02:29.470> found<00:02:29.520> science<00:02:30.520> said<00:02:30.700> oh

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
and the DNA was found science said oh

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.630 
and the DNA was found science said oh
now<00:02:31.660> we<00:02:31.720> have<00:02:32.140> an<00:02:32.410> understanding<00:02:33.220> an

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
now we have an understanding an

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.030 
now we have an understanding an
understanding<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.600> how<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.900> biology<00:02:35.740> works

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
understanding of how the biology works

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.640 
understanding of how the biology works
there's<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.460> physical<00:02:36.760> thing<00:02:37.300> called<00:02:37.660> DNA<00:02:38.320> and

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
there's a physical thing called DNA and

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.670 
there's a physical thing called DNA and
the<00:02:39.100> physical<00:02:39.550> DNA<00:02:39.850> programs<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:41.170> nature<00:02:41.560> of

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
the physical DNA programs the nature of

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.980 
the physical DNA programs the nature of
the<00:02:41.800> body<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.400> its<00:02:42.700> behavior<00:02:42.910> so<00:02:43.600> we<00:02:43.750> bought

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
the body and its behavior so we bought

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.070 
the body and its behavior so we bought
into<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.440> story<00:02:44.740> that<00:02:45.100> DNA<00:02:45.640> is<00:02:46.180> actually<00:02:46.930> the

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
into the story that DNA is actually the

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.230 
into the story that DNA is actually the
source<00:02:47.350> of<00:02:47.650> our<00:02:47.860> physical<00:02:48.580> structure<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.150> our

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
source of our physical structure and our

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.930 
source of our physical structure and our
behavioral<00:02:49.810> characteristics<00:02:50.580> since<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.730> DNA

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
behavioral characteristics since the DNA

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.200 
behavioral characteristics since the DNA
is<00:02:52.330> believed<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:53.230> control<00:02:53.740> biology<00:02:54.610> then<00:02:55.030> the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
is believed to control biology then the

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.200 
is believed to control biology then the
nucleus<00:02:55.660> is<00:02:55.930> like<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.290> cells<00:02:56.560> brain<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:57.700> the

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
nucleus is like the cells brain that the

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.750 
nucleus is like the cells brain that the
DNA<00:02:58.750> in<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.200> nucleus<00:02:59.230> controls<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.550> behavior

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
DNA in the nucleus controls the behavior

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.270 
DNA in the nucleus controls the behavior
and<00:03:01.510> development<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.440> functions<00:03:03.040> of<00:03:03.220> the

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
and development and functions of the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.940 
and development and functions of the
cell<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.510> said<00:03:04.690> well<00:03:04.810> is<00:03:05.170> this<00:03:05.320> really<00:03:05.650> true

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
cell and I said well is this really true

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.370 
cell and I said well is this really true
is<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:07.000> nucleus<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.660> brain<00:03:07.870> of<00:03:08.020> the<00:03:08.110> cell

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
is the nucleus the brain of the cell

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.230 
is the nucleus the brain of the cell
well<00:03:09.100> the<00:03:09.190> relevance<00:03:09.670> about<00:03:09.910> that<00:03:10.090> is<00:03:10.210> that

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
well the relevance about that is that

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.970 
well the relevance about that is that
very<00:03:10.420> simple<00:03:10.960> and<00:03:11.080> it<00:03:11.140> goes<00:03:11.260> like<00:03:11.470> this<00:03:11.500> it

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
very simple and it goes like this it

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.580 
very simple and it goes like this it
says<00:03:12.250> that<00:03:12.610> if<00:03:13.210> you<00:03:13.480> remove<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.080> brain<00:03:14.320> from

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
says that if you remove the brain from

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.610 
says that if you remove the brain from
an<00:03:14.740> organism<00:03:15.240> then<00:03:16.240> what<00:03:16.540> is<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.870> consequence

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
an organism then what is the consequence

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.950 
an organism then what is the consequence
of<00:03:17.830> that<00:03:17.920> action<00:03:18.880> what<00:03:19.210> happens<00:03:19.690> when<00:03:19.840> you

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
of that action what happens when you

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.630 
of that action what happens when you
remove<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:20.350> brain<00:03:20.530> from<00:03:20.710> an<00:03:20.830> organism<00:03:21.220> and

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
remove the brain from an organism and

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.610 
remove the brain from an organism and
the<00:03:22.120> answer<00:03:22.420> is<00:03:22.540> straightforward<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:23.350> simple

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
the answer is straightforward and simple

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.060 
the answer is straightforward and simple
it<00:03:24.100> basically<00:03:24.700> says<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.990> organism<00:03:26.800> dies

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
it basically says that the organism dies

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.090 
it basically says that the organism dies
and<00:03:27.640> so<00:03:28.450> that<00:03:28.720> without<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:29.080> brain<00:03:29.440> there's<00:03:29.890> no

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
and so that without a brain there's no

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.430 
and so that without a brain there's no
control<00:03:30.610> and<00:03:30.850> the<00:03:31.000> organism<00:03:31.510> dies<00:03:31.720> I<00:03:32.020> said

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
control and the organism dies I said

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.830 
control and the organism dies I said
well<00:03:32.560> okay<00:03:32.770> let's<00:03:33.040> go<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.220> a<00:03:33.280> cell<00:03:33.670> and<00:03:33.970> in<00:03:34.630> that

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
well okay let's go to a cell and in that

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.110 
well okay let's go to a cell and in that
cell<00:03:35.170> we<00:03:35.530> say<00:03:35.740> the<00:03:35.920> nucleus<00:03:36.490> is<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.880> brain<00:03:37.090> of

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
cell we say the nucleus is the brain of

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.740 
cell we say the nucleus is the brain of
the<00:03:37.300> cell<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:37.930> then<00:03:38.560> I<00:03:38.620> say<00:03:38.980> well<00:03:39.760> if<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:40.360> remove

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
the cell and then I say well if I remove

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.870 
the cell and then I say well if I remove
the<00:03:40.930> nucleus<00:03:41.440> like<00:03:41.470> removing<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.250> brain<00:03:42.490> the

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
the nucleus like removing the brain the

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.580 
the nucleus like removing the brain the
cell<00:03:43.120> should<00:03:43.390> die<00:03:43.630> it's<00:03:43.960> a<00:03:44.020> process<00:03:44.440> called

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
cell should die it's a process called

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.430 
cell should die it's a process called
enucleation<00:03:45.100> and<00:03:45.910> enucleation

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
enucleation and enucleation

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.500 
enucleation and enucleation
is<00:03:48.220> where<00:03:48.520> you<00:03:48.640> go<00:03:48.790> into<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.120> cell<00:03:49.330> with<00:03:49.480> a

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
is where you go into the cell with a

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.750 
is where you go into the cell with a
micropipette<00:03:50.200> and<00:03:50.710> you<00:03:50.800> pull<00:03:51.250> out<00:03:51.460> the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
micropipette and you pull out the

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.820 
micropipette and you pull out the
nucleus<00:03:52.240> of<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.450> cell<00:03:52.510> so<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:52.960> cell<00:03:53.170> has<00:03:53.380> no

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
nucleus of the cell so the cell has no

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.200 
nucleus of the cell so the cell has no
genes<00:03:54.100> in<00:03:54.310> it<00:03:54.430> anymore

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
genes in it anymore

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.580 
genes in it anymore
and<00:03:55.480> I<00:03:55.510> said<00:03:55.690> well<00:03:55.810> what's<00:03:56.020> the<00:03:56.050> consequence

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
and I said well what's the consequence

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.050 
and I said well what's the consequence
of<00:03:56.650> doing<00:03:56.830> that<00:03:57.040> does<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.250> cell<00:03:57.520> die<00:03:57.730> and<00:03:57.970> he

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
of doing that does a cell die and he

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.820 
of doing that does a cell die and he
answers<00:03:58.360> absolutely<00:03:58.750> not

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
answers absolutely not

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.130 
answers absolutely not
the<00:04:00.160> cell<00:04:00.400> doesn't<00:04:00.760> die<00:04:00.880> it<00:04:00.940> cell<00:04:01.450> lives<00:04:01.870> and

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
the cell doesn't die it cell lives and

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.280 
the cell doesn't die it cell lives and
his<00:04:02.230> behavior<00:04:03.130> is<00:04:03.880> exactly<00:04:04.210> the<00:04:04.810> same<00:04:05.050> it's

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
his behavior is exactly the same it's

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.170 
his behavior is exactly the same it's
unaffected<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.400> cell<00:04:06.610> can<00:04:06.790> live<00:04:07.000> for

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
unaffected and a cell can live for

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.780 
unaffected and a cell can live for
months<00:04:07.420> without<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:08.020> DNA<00:04:08.470> I<00:04:08.770> said<00:04:09.430> well<00:04:09.580> why

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
months without the DNA I said well why

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.640 
months without the DNA I said well why
is<00:04:09.880> that<00:04:10.060> relevant<00:04:10.390> our<00:04:10.810> simple<00:04:11.230> point<00:04:11.440> is

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
is that relevant our simple point is

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.410 
is that relevant our simple point is
says<00:04:11.860> well<00:04:12.370> then<00:04:12.490> the<00:04:12.610> DNA<00:04:13.090> is<00:04:13.240> not

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
says well then the DNA is not

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.780 
says well then the DNA is not
controlling<00:04:14.020> the<00:04:14.140> biology<00:04:14.740> of<00:04:14.770> the<00:04:14.950> cell<00:04:14.980> the

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
controlling the biology of the cell the

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.030 
controlling the biology of the cell the
nucleus<00:04:16.090> cannot<00:04:16.870> be<00:04:17.080> equal<00:04:17.530> to<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.799> brain<00:04:18.010> of

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
nucleus cannot be equal to the brain of

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.670 
nucleus cannot be equal to the brain of
the<00:04:18.310> cell<00:04:18.549> and<00:04:18.970> so<00:04:19.750> now<00:04:20.049> we're<00:04:20.290> left<00:04:20.440> with<00:04:20.620> a

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
the cell and so now we're left with a

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.010 
the cell and so now we're left with a
very<00:04:20.710> interesting<00:04:21.400> challenge<00:04:22.120> because<00:04:22.390> we

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
very interesting challenge because we

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.990 
very interesting challenge because we
say<00:04:23.200> well<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.560> nucleus<00:04:24.130> is<00:04:24.370> controlling

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
say well the nucleus is controlling

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.660 
say well the nucleus is controlling
everything<00:04:25.270> in<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.660> brain<00:04:25.900> and

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
everything in the brain and

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.670 
everything in the brain and
led<00:04:26.850> us<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.150> believe<00:04:27.420> what<00:04:27.690> that<00:04:28.260> led<00:04:28.500> us<00:04:28.650> to

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
led us to believe what that led us to

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.930 
led us to believe what that led us to
believe<00:04:28.890> that<00:04:29.700> DNA<00:04:30.600> makes<00:04:30.840> decisions<00:04:31.490> so<00:04:32.490> all

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
believe that DNA makes decisions so all

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.430 
believe that DNA makes decisions so all
of<00:04:33.060> a<00:04:33.120> sudden<00:04:33.510> it<00:04:33.630> says<00:04:33.840> week<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.290> whole

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
of a sudden it says week the whole

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.320 
of a sudden it says week the whole
biology<00:04:34.950> you<00:04:35.310> were<00:04:35.400> brought<00:04:35.640> up<00:04:35.790> with<00:04:35.820> a<00:04:36.000> genes

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
biology you were brought up with a genes

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.850 
biology you were brought up with a genes
control<00:04:36.690> life<00:04:36.870> turns<00:04:37.170> out<00:04:37.320> to<00:04:37.410> be<00:04:37.440> totally

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
control life turns out to be totally

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.820 
control life turns out to be totally
wrong<00:04:38.070> so<00:04:38.850> let's<00:04:39.570> go<00:04:39.780> into<00:04:40.080> a<00:04:40.110> new<00:04:40.410> biology

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
wrong so let's go into a new biology

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.190 
wrong so let's go into a new biology
let's<00:04:41.310> talk<00:04:41.580> about<00:04:41.760> something<00:04:42.630> new<00:04:42.810> but<00:04:43.020> we'll

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
let's talk about something new but we'll

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.710 
let's talk about something new but we'll
first<00:04:43.410> give<00:04:43.650> it<00:04:43.680> a<00:04:43.830> big<00:04:44.070> fact<00:04:44.550> conclusion<00:04:45.450> this

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
first give it a big fact conclusion this

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.690 
first give it a big fact conclusion this
is<00:04:45.780> an<00:04:46.020> absolute<00:04:46.590> fact<00:04:46.830> genes<00:04:47.670> do<00:04:48.240> not<00:04:48.270> control

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
is an absolute fact genes do not control

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:58.590 
is an absolute fact genes do not control
biology<00:04:50.700> that<00:04:51.000> is<00:04:51.060> a<00:04:51.270> fact
