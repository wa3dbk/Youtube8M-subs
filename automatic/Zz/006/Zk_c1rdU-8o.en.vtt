00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.230
 friends the news of the year of the month of 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.720
 century the anti-k king 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:20.320
 it is not going to apply to who in your child 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.349
 another one that enters I go but it enters not me 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:28.210
 I'm going to see what happens or see what you want 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:30.759
 democracy spain democracy is laughing 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.470
 yes but the problem is that we are 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.329
 watching all the time on television 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.440
 special programs about the king about 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:41.190
 your life great athlete 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.230
 but nobody tells us why he is now 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.320
 after a week after the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.320
 elections 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.840
 and has not chopped before or after 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.949
 open your eyes 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.960
 from here a year and a half there is again 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.350
 general elections 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.979
 and this time 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.159
 psoe and pp that are the ones that support the 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:12.310
 monarchy have had 49 percent of 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.549
 the votes in the last ones previous to 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.240
 these 81 percent is easy every 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:23.840
 a year and a half do not reach 30 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.509
 you know that for the king to abdicate 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.200
 the parliament must approve with majority 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.720
 simple the abdication and give way to his 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.150
 son 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.670
 with 51% 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.410
 it turns out that a year and a half is 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.870
 possible that between pp psoe of sumen and a 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.520
 30 because all the left groups 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.500
 Republicans who do not have monarchy 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.510
 because it is an unnecessary expense and 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.980
 great for our country where there 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.940
 people who are homeless and die 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:54.970
 of hunger and are not words are facts 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.260
 we do not need more expenses expenses of 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.700
 representation we already have the 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.500
 diplomats but remove the 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.020
 embassies and consulates 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.330
 therefore open the eyes of here a 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.030
 year and a half would not have been possible to be 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.490
 possible nothing of application is even 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.900
 that was submitted to referendum possibly 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.210
 that the monarchy exists and it would have left 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.670
 not 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.470
 Thus 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.980
 the king stops having immunity 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.310
 diplomatic but here is to mess with him 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.050
 but your child acquires it, that is, not 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.890
 can be tried 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.540
 and for a year and a half at least 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.380
 he makes sure to keep putting his hand 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.470
 and this is a truth 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.770
 that unfortunately many do not dare to 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.770
 tell 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.150
 Y 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.909
 the truth
