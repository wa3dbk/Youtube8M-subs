00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.219
 It's also here in the title. 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.520
 the person responsible for adapting the manga 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.500

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.129
 watching anime, i found it a lot 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.530
 strange and I know that this humans and 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.299
 aliens live on the streets 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.299
 how's it going 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.710
 but then I discovered that it is not was not 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.470
 aliens were beings of the underworld there 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.909
 that I stayed the design of the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.850
 characters I remembered a little 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.070
 from mib the aliens from mib i remembered 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.530
 also from star wars there are many 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.540
 aline characters remember there 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.580
 many of these characters in these movies 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.270
 sent a lot to me what 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.369
 happened was a break in the land well 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.190
 New York just for a change made an opening 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.350
 of our world with the underworld and beings 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.720
 that I was in New York and this 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.020
 be the underworld were trapped there 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.000
 inside a bubble and penetrable america 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.759
 He had an easy victory to discover 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.450
 climb actually do not dismiss any fan 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:07.640
 of the singer health andréia barros knows it 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.140
 It is very hectic the very dynamic 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.759
 things will happen very fast and 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.100
 difficult accompanies the first episode 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.470
 started with explosions sticky shootings 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.450
 breaking bus with bank robberies 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.010
 things happened very fast and 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.180
 many people to act naturally as 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.700
 if nothing had really happened 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.530
 this bubble became a place I do not know but a 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.760
 crazy crazy terrorist place 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.760
 Alkaida, I do not know. 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.050
 while all this happened 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.030
 The protagonist whose name is leonardo watch 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.480
 was narrating a letter with a 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.360
 tranquility as meekness as if 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.670
 everything was in full peace I found this 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.500
 very much because the contrast with the 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.120
 his narrative the contrast with what the 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.400
 We were watching people were very big. 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.430
 so it was half a comical moment 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:02.040
 Just a little nice, not a lot. 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:06.290
 the last touch 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.290
 Bonocô santana has not sharing 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.650
 then suddenly there in a cafe and come 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.959
 a monkey from the underworld very business 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.849
 crazy and steal a digital camera it 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.980
 because he says he's a journalist 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.540
 I do not know where he stole the camera. 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.099
 digital format calls them in such a 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.019
 recurring intense speed it goes 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.890
 run back while he's going to run 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.420
 behind 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.700
 he continues to narrate that he is 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.849
 happening it seems that in the letter he does 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.620
 It seems that everything is normal it transforms 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.829
 a story that was horrible and one 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.659
 Good story I do not know if it would be too 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.519
 positive thinking if it is just to see 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.349
 crazy even he wants to leave the person of the 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.909
 other hand think it's okay for 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.760
 example with this contract was very 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:50.450
 Of course there is nothing and technology is here. 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:56.010
 On Thursday, the cruise, nothing but I always 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:04:00.560
 I come 1103 to win at home and so 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.560
 show all other animals as currency 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.460
 So, like I already said at the first 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.590
 episode the line is going through many 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.180
 information to happen very quickly and 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.800
 be careful not to lose 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.050
 the details then a tip that I go 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.820
 giving from the first episode already tries 

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.500
 concentrate and be very attentive will not 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.300
 need to review the episode again 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.680
 to understand so much information and 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.060
 details with the tongue is passing you by 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.520
 It was difficult for me that I am. 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.290
 very slow, very distracted tone 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.480
 What I'm warning you is 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.280
 cool, I found nothing out of the ordinary 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:43.860
 but I found it very cool as I said 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:46.320
 With you, I 'm friend, our ignorance. 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.660
 but I really liked the visual effect and 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.240
 animation, especially during the hours of 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.880
 battle in the hours of fights when he 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.370
 it makes skill is very show a style 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.500
 very cool as the letters show 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.750
 very lively led to anyone who has ever watched 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.550
 and it's a word I thought was very cool 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.620
 I thought I would not see in any other animals 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.500
 Viennese and also face underworld 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.500
 who is said to be the owner of the city and 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:14.330
 It's kind of gay, I do not know. 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:21.720
 half evil and as quiet as the city 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:25.830
 turned tossia street ino fell 1 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.320
 the music soundtrack is modern but 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.480
 brings years of printing 50 years 60 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.220
 something of those years there I know more 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.790
 Fits very well in very cool li 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.470
 same 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.360
 which is what gave me the impression that 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.520
 this bubble is probably there from 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.650
 this time as this place did not evolve 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.330
 I will not be noticed, I'll think about it. 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.430
 now recording I said shit me 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.500
 Sorry, I can tell you who 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.420
 enjoys a good show in this way not 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.890
 will leave nothing to be desired as I always do 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.850
 I comment when you make your first 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.920

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.080
 I indicate that you watch anime with 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.580
 the other one lighter if you are 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.980
 watching several friends at the same time 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.890
 watch him with other light animals 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.210
 because anime is very intense or not 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.640

 his attacks do not want to enter too much 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.410
 in detail so as not to spoil and 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.600
