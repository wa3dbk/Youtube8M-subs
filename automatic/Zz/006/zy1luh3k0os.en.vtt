00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:02.156
 Hello and welcome to the movie today 

00:00:02.156 --> 00:00:04.851
 about varnish ... 

00:00:12.182 --> 00:00:15.710
 Today on the Satin Finish planer varnish. 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.168
 This outside use is a product 

00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:21.333
 high-build, solvent intended 

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.801
 above all for people who care about 

00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:28.383
 emphasizing the advantages of wood. On using the measure, 

00:00:28.383 --> 00:00:33.133
 which will leave a satiny, light gloss. If it depends 

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:37.361
 us to make our garden architecture 

00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:41.247
 it had a light flavor, it glowed slightly, 

00:00:41.247 --> 00:00:44.736
 she had a high gloss this preparation as much as possible 

00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:47.432
 is indicated. If we talk about preparations 

00:00:47.432 --> 00:00:50.882
 high-sheat, it has to be mentioned right away 

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:55.952
 about the fact that the coating applied in the right way 

00:00:55.952 --> 00:00:59.795
 they will protect the wood very well, before 

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:02.763
 UV rays, against fungi and mold, 

00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:07.044
 and through moisture. We must, of course, remember 

00:01:07.044 --> 00:01:10.836
 so that the wood is healthy, dry. Manufacturer here 

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:13.963
 gives a maximum humidity of 16%, you can be tempted 

00:01:13.963 --> 00:01:17.627
 by 18%, but more humid wood should not be. 

00:01:17.627 --> 00:01:21.004
 Of course, we must remember that it is 

00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:24.503
 varnish and it does not penetrate wood, 

00:01:24.503 --> 00:01:28.124
 it's quite dense, it stays on the surface so we have to 

00:01:28.124 --> 00:01:32.157
 apply some impregnation. In this case 

00:01:32.157 --> 00:01:37.288
 Wood Preserver. If it is said that it is 

00:01:37.288 --> 00:01:42.194
 medium quite thick. Here when it comes to indications 

00:01:42.194 --> 00:01:46.152
 manufacturer is recommended spray application 

00:01:46.152 --> 00:01:49.830
 or also with a brush. I will tell you, however, 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.059
 that after the turmoil it is quite dense. It seems to me, 

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:59.642
 that one would be tempted to try to impose this 

00:01:59.642 --> 00:02:02.441
 preparation with a roller, but if already brush 

00:02:02.441 --> 00:02:05.423
 (because not everybody has the opportunity to spray). 

00:02:05.423 --> 00:02:10.380
 If we do not have soft brushes, such strictly 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.138
 for varnish, we can take an ordinary brush 

00:02:14.138 --> 00:02:18.291
 universal and wipe it before painting 

00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:23.440
 several times on sandpaper, firstly 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.524
 it will eliminate the hair that is supposed to fall out 

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:33.415
 and it will soften the end of this brush. 

00:02:33.415 --> 00:02:38.331
 So it's worth it before each painting 

00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:45.778
 treatment done. Applying rather dry almost with a brush. 

00:02:45.778 --> 00:02:50.412
 We do not take much of this preparation because there are streaks. 

00:02:50.412 --> 00:02:55.933
 But if we took this measure too much, 

00:02:55.933 --> 00:03:00.049
 and these streaks have arisen, we do not have to stress 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.535
 because after a while we can use a clean, dry brush 

00:03:04.535 --> 00:03:08.460
 and spread out the stain varnish and stretch it 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.461
 all these streaks. The painting itself is quite 

00:03:11.461 --> 00:03:14.929
 nice. Personally, I like to use these denser drugs. 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:19.241
 You can also stretch it longer (apply), it is this one 

00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:22.856
 a margin of time to distribute possible 

00:03:22.856 --> 00:03:27.940
 streaks, streaks or small shortcomings. 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.781
 I wanted to mention one more thing. 

00:03:32.781 --> 00:03:36.853
 We must remember that when finishing the surface 

00:03:36.853 --> 00:03:40.580
 sandpaper, we have to count with it, 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.904
 that if we finish the surface with thick paper, 

00:03:43.904 --> 00:03:47.082
 quite aggressive (I finished at 80), it's a color 

00:03:47.082 --> 00:03:50.812
 it will penetrate deeper than the surface that has been left 

00:03:50.812 --> 00:03:54.266
 finished with paper 220. So, more 

00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:58.820
 a smooth surface, the color will penetrate more shallowly. 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.340
 This is very well seen with the rest. These are pine 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.160
 staves, 1 layer was applied and see 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.184
 what is the difference in color. To get a better effect 

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:19.596
 (here I have a stave where 3 layers are applied) 

00:04:19.596 --> 00:04:23.465
 Then Jarek will probably do close-ups where he can be seen 

00:04:23.465 --> 00:04:28.877
 already this gloss, but to emphasize aesthetics 

00:04:28.877 --> 00:04:32.459
 the applied layer is worth after applying 1 layer 

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:36.592
 mate her. Regarding the drying time, if 

00:04:36.592 --> 00:04:39.904
 we paint in the summer (around 20 degrees C), it's surface 

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:43.031
 this preparation dries in about 4-6 hours, 

00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:47.216
 but it is recommended before applying the next layer 

00:04:47.216 --> 00:04:50.442
 wait 16 hours. Do not hurry! Because if 

00:04:50.442 --> 00:04:53.800
 we'll coat the next layer too quickly, then 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.172
 the solvent from the second layer will start to dissolve 

00:04:57.172 --> 00:05:01.058
 drying coat of the first layer. So thinner 

00:05:01.058 --> 00:05:06.339
 layers, give it time to dry and apply 

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:10.397
 at least 3 layers. Then the effect will be 

00:05:10.397 --> 00:05:15.346
 very satisfactory. When talking about varnish stains, 

00:05:15.346 --> 00:05:20.202
 I will mention it, although we will be sure 

00:05:20.202 --> 00:05:22.867
 make a film about stains to the inside. 

00:05:22.867 --> 00:05:25.921
 How I read in the opinion of other people, 

00:05:25.921 --> 00:05:27.980
 this is the pain of many of us. Choose a stain 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.743
 and varnish or choose a varnish? I'll tell you, 

00:05:31.743 --> 00:05:34.604
 that for me a more satisfactory visual effect 

00:05:34.604 --> 00:05:38.156
 gives the use of stain and varnish, but for those 

00:05:38.156 --> 00:05:42.321
 who prefer convenience, of course varnish will be 

00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:46.226
 more desirable, but ... there are more but you have to count 

00:05:46.226 --> 00:05:49.988
 with the fact that you have to try to apply. 

00:05:49.988 --> 00:05:53.486
 One more thing that applying stain we must 

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:56.860
 reckon with the fact that it will penetrate deeper into the wood, 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.965
 than a stain varnish, i.e. the color will be more intense. 

00:05:59.965 --> 00:06:03.882
 As with other preparations that protect 

00:06:03.882 --> 00:06:08.003
 before UV rays, use as dark as possible. 

00:06:08.003 --> 00:06:11.441
 Pigment protects against these rays and if we have 

00:06:11.441 --> 00:06:13.961
 colorless this Satin Finish, let's use it 

00:06:13.961 --> 00:06:17.184
 as the last layer or to lighten the color. 

00:06:17.184 --> 00:06:22.670
 However, let us not only paint it because it will not fulfill its role. 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.657
 If we do everything according to the guidelines, 

00:06:26.657 --> 00:06:31.116
 Wood Preserver, healthy, dry wood, respectively 

00:06:31.116 --> 00:06:34.021
 applied at least 3 layers, then we can 

00:06:34.021 --> 00:06:36.312
 be calm from 5 to 8 years even. 

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:39.863
 It is also a measure that does not break, does not flake off 

00:06:39.863 --> 00:06:46.352
 it is quite resistant to mechanical damage. 

00:06:46.352 --> 00:06:51.633
 I highly recommend him. End of talking! 

00:06:51.633 --> 00:06:54.893
 I think you should try it yourself. 

00:06:54.893 --> 00:06:57.583
 On the subject of varnish today it is all. 

00:06:57.583 --> 00:07:00.837
 Thank youvery much for attention!
