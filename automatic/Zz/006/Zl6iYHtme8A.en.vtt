00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.670
 our minecraft good as the 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.180
 corrections this I will dictate or 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.030

 this and well, this is going to fix what 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.490
 what is being when the 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.680
 experience in the eyes this when you 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.000
 They created the animals will fix what 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.090
 it's been this for the zombies 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.430
 when a door is broken that vessel 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.110
 also the arrangement of the Zealots and the 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.830
 problem of what is coming 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.590
 the chickens with the heads that 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.440
 start spinning here like the exorcist 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.869
 this and good the arrangement of those of the 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.759
 ocelot tips that is when I 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.550
 domestic let's go and all that not 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.720
 correctly shows the actions of 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.830
 Some time to tame it are the 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.250
 sounds of the cenotes 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.620
 when we hit him the gray arrangement 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.110
 of the click of the graph of the bars that 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.270
 when he did not put it next to a 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.580
 piston or something like this one looked like 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.480
 invisible a part that's also going to 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.150
 fix this fixed systems of one of 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.590
 let's say that the cauldron is good 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.600
 it does not influence but what is going to be 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.760
 arranging this are going to fix the 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.440
 generation problems of the world 's 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.340
 generations of worlds with some 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.440
 this one is going to be fixed so that 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.680
 Correctly correct that is generated well as 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.720
 we want it is from the message that 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.240
 says that you can not generate this 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.820
 enemies in peaceful mode 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.030
 ss I also think that they will fix it 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.770
 I think there's a search for that and well the 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.230
 raw fish that is not removed from 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.480
 inventory the player when trying 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.519
 so domesticate an ocelot 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.640
 Well, that's going to fix this 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.610
 this is only sought in creative mode and 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.739
 that this as they see in the dogs 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.530
 when we give bone it is removed good in 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:08.640
 the ocelot not this one 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.470
 also the water that is not removed when 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.170
 we put a bucket of water that looks 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.000
 It's also what it's been like 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.010
 fill the boiler in creative mode that 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.200
 they will also fix the arrangement 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.270
 for the text that is missing in the message 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.890
 when the player is killed by a 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.660
 Iron golem also has to 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.250
 appear to have been killed by a 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.739
 iron golem a message that comes out 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.260
 when you die the arrangement for the player 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.900
 of shade and well they are also going to 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.819
 solve problems like lighting 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.530
 jungle stairs woods arrangements 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.640
 this and that burn and all that and good 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.560
 this will also add what 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.140
 it's been a limit on the number of 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.269
 settlers generated by a young 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.959
 this also will not be able to stop 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.550
 a stream of animals and good has 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.910
 added also what has been the 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:00.360
 heart shows in travel in mode in 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.670
 way love this let's say that when 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.030
 want to think that to match or something like that 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.150
 I know the truth in way mode love this as 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.920
 would we say we want this put together 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.680
 two sheep and you get good hearts 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.320
 they will also go out to these ones to 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.419
 the goals and good has also been 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.359
 solved the problem with the sound of 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:24.479
 the rain this in some biomes that 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.220
 I was not failing there the sound of 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.289
 when it rains but let's say that 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.060
 it would be that they had left it like this 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.970
 so that it does not bother so much the 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.370
 arrangement to reappear minerals 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.580
 washes water and after that of mining 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.090
 if they are five blocks away from the 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.070
 world 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.729
 that's also going to fix this 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.729
 positions 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.370
 fixed degeneration of the package world 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.560
 May when the texture pack 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.700
 he had some small ships too and 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.700
 well says that now the minecraft 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.889
 says that now more in kraft in the 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:03.150
 store this will show the prices of the 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:05.130
 local currency in place of microsoft 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.080
 points ok you see that they changed the 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.710
 micros for good money are now going to 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.479
 leave what is being the price in 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.940
 your local currency where you live you go to 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.280
 can buy it there with your local currency 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.620
 this some things I did not tell them 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.819
 because good this one is also going to 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.919
 increase what has been the 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:27.330
 main car speed to double 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:29.280
 normal speed this comfortable us 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.490
 will open now if a cat is passed 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.470
 settled in them is the good the 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.020
 fix the water filter when it crashes 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.729
 against the camera blocks this one 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.770
 has added the option to hide the 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:44.729
 thematic package of the major if what 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.529
 we are in the list of saved and 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.019
 good this one 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:50.429
 you see that when we started a world 

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:52.409
 disappears what has been the 

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:54.629
 package of textures 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:56.759

00:05:54.629 --> 00:06:00.509
