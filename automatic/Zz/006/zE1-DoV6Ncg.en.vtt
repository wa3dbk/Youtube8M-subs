00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.089
 on the first day of the event 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.250
 after rehearsed play 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.269
 artuzi who would cut a secret and asked not to tell anyone 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:12.529
 I could not 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:14.339
 not 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.900
 is that he has used 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.419
 ferreira added 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:24.279
 kept the secret is more or less as 26 I think things stand for 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.469
 prefrontal cortex but the front part of the brain without being able to contain 

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:32.980
 in your packaging redo what is always easier to tell the truth 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.980
 Greg Alcantara 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.530
 No, it's not for me, but I'll try. 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.450
 promising to incorporate the concept 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.460
 I want to be so let's go and disagree 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.660
 fast and will jump with a lie 3 what will we do right inside 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.320
 we just went on the bay 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.890
 still do not know 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.720
 using no stop 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.720
 the strategy is 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.350
 the first response that has the head and react to this in my case of January 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.689
 the words of Joseph Valentine with the experienced associate the need 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.160
 creuzin itself 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.560
 When finding the response of vehicles they have to make effort the areas of their 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.900
 brain that produce speech to prepare to tell the truth 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.910
 for me it was different, much more complicated 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.480
 the prefrontal cortex has to be able to eliminate the answer came with everything 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.960
 marcinho 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.940
 then he has to seek his supporters to make a response to the 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.940
 government of the united states other place 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.210
 this music requires the working of other regions that care for language 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.430
 in this whole mess 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.880
 a part of the brain that specializes in conflict is strongly activated 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.130
 is the anterior cingulate cortex 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.160
 then 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.009
 they are our attention to the problem to be solved 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.979
 in case 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.700
 discard the truth 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.270
 find a lie and still do not give a tongue in the teeth 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.559
 growth hides a secret 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.559
 It's like this part of the brain stays still. 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:26.859
 which leaves anyone 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.859
 but at least for the secret is to have patience with the remedy 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.579
 if you can not bear to play for real the secret but also do not want 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:35.919
 it spreads out there 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.919
 for two people at once 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.639
 you be more strict of contact 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:47.209
 so they could alleviate the anterior cingulate we talked about the secret of a 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.979
 by the other and it will be salty and the others for longer
