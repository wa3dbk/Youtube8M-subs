which<00:01:57.300> has<00:01:57.510> a<00:01:57.540> really<00:01:57.900> really<00:01:58.230> good<00:01:58.380> time<00:01:58.650> ok

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
because I even saved and quit and it

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.540 
because I even saved and quit and it
came<00:02:07.080> back<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.920> actually<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.340> know<00:02:08.459> it

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
came back in and it actually you know it

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.160 
came back in and it actually you know it
starts<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.000> from<00:02:09.269> that<00:02:09.450> checkpoint<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.959> made

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
starts you from that checkpoint you made

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.030 
starts you from that checkpoint you made
it<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:11.060> if<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.330> don't<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:13.560> know<00:02:13.680> if<00:02:13.890> you

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
it to so if you don't you know if you

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.580 
it to so if you don't you know if you
get<00:02:14.159> hung<00:02:14.400> up<00:02:14.580> on<00:02:14.760> somebody<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:16.050> better<00:02:16.290> try

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
get hung up on somebody you better try

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.899 
get hung up on somebody you better try
and<00:02:16.650> kill<00:02:16.890> yourself<00:02:17.310> right<00:02:17.430> then<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.849> there

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
and kill yourself right then and there

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.569 
and kill yourself right then and there
because<00:02:18.239> you're<00:02:18.569> gonna<00:02:18.659> be<00:02:18.840> screwed<00:02:19.519> if<00:02:20.519> you

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
because you're gonna be screwed if you

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.190 
because you're gonna be screwed if you
get<00:02:20.879> it<00:02:20.999> to<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.150> checkpoint<00:02:21.450> you're<00:02:21.780> basically

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
get it to a checkpoint you're basically

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.900 
get it to a checkpoint you're basically
gonna<00:02:22.349> have<00:02:22.409> to<00:02:22.590> replay<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.099> entire<00:02:23.189> mission

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
gonna have to replay the entire mission

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.310 
gonna have to replay the entire mission
this<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.390> very<00:02:24.630> last<00:02:24.840> part<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.260> the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
this is the very last part of the

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.290 
this is the very last part of the
mission<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.310> died<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.550> couple<00:02:26.850> times<00:02:27.030> just

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
mission so I died a couple times just

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.490 
mission so I died a couple times just
because<00:02:27.480> I'm<00:02:27.720> trying<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.990> rush<00:02:28.170> through<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.380> I

you<00:02:37.140> just<00:02:37.170> get<00:02:37.410> my<00:02:37.530> past<00:02:37.740> these<00:02:37.920> guys<00:02:38.070> we<00:02:38.250> got

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
you just get my past these guys we got

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.450 
you just get my past these guys we got
to<00:02:38.520> 24<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.150> 23<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.840> we<00:02:40.440> jump<00:02:40.680> off<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.130> we<00:02:41.250> make

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
to 24 to 23 and we jump off and we make

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.480 
to 24 to 23 and we jump off and we make
it<00:02:41.490> in<00:02:41.730> plenty<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.090> time<00:02:42.620> but<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.920> first<00:02:44.130> time

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
it in plenty of time but the first time

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.950 
it in plenty of time but the first time
like<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:44.880> actually<00:02:45.030> played<00:02:45.420> through<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.750> man

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
like I actually played through it man

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.810 
like I actually played through it man
and<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.530> takes<00:02:46.740> you<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:46.950> while<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.190> get<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.580> this

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
and it takes you a while to get to this

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.550 
and it takes you a while to get to this
spot<00:02:48.000> this<00:02:48.570> is<00:02:48.630> like<00:02:48.870> one<00:02:49.020> of<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.170> longest

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
spot this is like one of the longest

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.040 
spot this is like one of the longest
missions<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:51.060> ended<00:02:51.240> up<00:02:51.330> getting<00:02:51.540> hung<00:02:51.840> up

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
missions and I ended up getting hung up

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.930 
missions and I ended up getting hung up
but<00:02:52.380> then<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.620> didn't<00:02:52.860> kill<00:02:53.040> myself<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.760> got

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
but then I didn't kill myself and I got

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.790 
but then I didn't kill myself and I got
to<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.090> checkpoint<00:02:54.390> but<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.170> didn't<00:02:55.470> have<00:02:55.590> enough

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
to a checkpoint but I didn't have enough

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.180 
to a checkpoint but I didn't have enough
time<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.430> finish<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.930> get<00:02:58.320> off<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.680> boat<00:02:58.830> after

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
time to finish to get off the boat after

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.220 
time to finish to get off the boat after
that<00:02:59.550> checkpoint<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.240> I<00:03:00.300> just<00:03:00.480> kept<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:01.200> know

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
that checkpoint and I just kept you know

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.100 
that checkpoint and I just kept you know

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
respawning from there and I basically

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.100 
respawning from there and I basically
had<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.470> go<00:03:04.650> back<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.340> replay<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.970> entire

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
had to go back and replay the entire

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.070 
had to go back and replay the entire
damn<00:03:07.110> mission<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.890> get<00:03:08.040> back<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.460> spot

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080
