00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
to play just a chord when the when the

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:41.900 
to play just a chord when the when the

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.880 

we<00:04:42.910> also<00:04:43.090> talked<00:04:43.450> a<00:04:43.480> lot<00:04:43.720> about<00:04:43.840> very<00:04:44.260> advanced

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
we also talked a lot about very advanced

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.330 
we also talked a lot about very advanced
right-hand<00:04:45.250> techniques<00:04:45.640> of<00:04:45.850> rolling<00:04:46.240> chords

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
right-hand techniques of rolling chords

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.410 
right-hand techniques of rolling chords
so<00:04:48.340> that<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.580> notes<00:04:48.730> that<00:04:48.850> you<00:04:49.000> play<00:04:49.030> together

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
so that the notes that you play together

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.150 
so that the notes that you play together
are<00:04:49.630> not<00:04:49.780> actually<00:04:50.200> together<00:04:50.470> and<00:04:50.710> some<00:04:51.100> of

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
are not actually together and some of

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.380 
are not actually together and some of
the<00:04:51.250> techniques<00:04:51.580> to<00:04:51.700> get<00:04:51.790> good<00:04:51.940> at<00:04:52.060> that<00:04:52.090> and

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
the techniques to get good at that and

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.480 
the techniques to get good at that and
separating<00:04:53.380> bass<00:04:53.560> notes<00:04:53.800> and<00:04:53.980> melody<00:04:54.280> notes

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
separating bass notes and melody notes

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.589 
separating bass notes and melody notes
even<00:04:54.730> when<00:04:54.970> they're<00:04:55.120> together

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.549 

so<00:05:01.469> a<00:05:01.800> lot<00:05:02.189> of<00:05:02.689> kind<00:05:03.689> of<00:05:03.779> complicated

00:05:04.549 --> 00:05:04.559 
so a lot of kind of complicated

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:06.350 
so a lot of kind of complicated
techniques<00:05:04.979> that<00:05:05.159> happen<00:05:05.460> in<00:05:05.669> this<00:05:06.149> song<00:05:06.330> so

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
techniques that happen in this song so

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.519 
techniques that happen in this song so
