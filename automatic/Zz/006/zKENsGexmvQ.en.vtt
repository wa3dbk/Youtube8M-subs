00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.059
 do you know what you eat but do you know too 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.709
 where our food comes from 

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:10.860
 for example, take the slice of ham on us 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:13.620
 bread that comes from a pig but whatever 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.980
 pig actually eat 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.310
 potato peels and boat disaster peanut butter 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.230
 healthy salads or kibbles 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.820
 the pig pellets also will be 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.429
 called animal feed 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.730
 this for is made by us the 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.919
 Dutch animal feed producers 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.990
 in the netherlands there are almost 100 animal feed 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.520
 producers 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.280
 five and a half thousand work there 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.210
 people together they ensure a turnover 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.800
 of almost 6 billion euros 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.100
 let's see how your previous one 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.890
 market becomes which raw materials go and 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.950
 exists in a block with the largest part 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.150
 from nine and by-products that arise 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.790
 during the production of 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.080
 foods for ourselves 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.810
 for example, the remains that remain 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.120
 in the production of fries 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.769
 orange juice and sunflower oil also go 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.590
 to products if we do not want 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.649
 because they don't look good at all 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.450
 such as broken the cookies deformed pasta 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.369
 or broken chips 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.909
 we don't throw that away but use it 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.899
 it in animal feed and then grain and soy 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.670
 corn and finally a tuft of vitamins 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.159
 and minerals 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.049
 you now know what's in a kibble 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.729
 let's also review the production process 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.740
 going to view 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.530
 ships and trucks deliver the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.020
 raw materials to everything is stored 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.430
 in silos 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.539
 hammer mills mix the raw materials finely 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.159
 and add vitamins and minerals 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.500
 it becomes preparation for pressing 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.289
 mixture treated with steam below 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.329
 the chunks can be pressed 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.429
 a sample is made from each batch 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.659
 taken in the laboratory 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.119
 investigated 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.850
 this is very important because the animal feed 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.100
 must be healthy and safe 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.970
 all ingredients must be traceable 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.119
 nice 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.829
 we want to know where they come from 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.450
 if the lumps are approved then 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.780
 we can and fifth ready 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.150
 use 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.239
 we make a lot of different ones 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.910
 there are types for this for every hour 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:21.630
 a lump of formal or milk powder 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:25.080
 young wood outside or stole animals and even 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.970
 animal feed for summer or winter 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.489
 although the only a small part of it 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.069
 we feel very whole when we are in the world 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.660
 responsible for the world like that 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.380
 we consciously opt for sustainable 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.810
 raw materials from 2015 is in us 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.190
 animal feed only responsible soy and 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.690
 palm oil 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.769
 that's good for the South American 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.390
 farmers 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.700
 they receive a fair compensation 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.069
 their work for the environment is too 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.340
 better no trees are cut down 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.230
 for this soy production but we want 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.389
 do even more 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.359
 we constantly search with others 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.170
 organizations to better ones 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.959
 environmentally friendly raw materials 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.109
 animal feed we don't just look at the 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.000
 world but also to our own people 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.310
 we ensure a healthy and safe 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.420
 workplace and look at our own 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.889
 factory 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:20.250
 a better environment starts after all 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:23.010
 from 2012 to 2020 we use every year 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.170
 two percent less energy 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.940
 this will soon save us money 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.010
 which is equal to the annual 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.780
 energy consumption of fifteen thousand 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.280
 households' 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.130
 we do this by placing, among other things 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.170
 of solar cells and energy-saving lamps 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.840
 but we also look at transportation 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.910
 how can we be more efficient 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.519
 plans so that we have fewer miles 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.549
 having to drive 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.160
 our animal feed is getting better and better 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.049
 It has a higher nutritional value 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.169
 therefore have fewer pounds per animal 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.600
 need fewer kilos of food means that 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.979
 we need less energy for the 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.709
 production thereof 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:03.840
 fewer pounds need to transport less 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.829
 need and need raw materials 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.449
 to feed 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:12.600
 and that is also saving 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:18.269
 look here we do it for healthy 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:21.530
 animals and safe for that 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.530
 tasty and safe food
