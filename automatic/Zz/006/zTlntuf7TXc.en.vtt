00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
just is a little bit abrasive and it

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.800 
just is a little bit abrasive and it
takes<00:04:02.459> off<00:04:02.610> some<00:04:02.820> of<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.000> build-up<00:04:03.300> now<00:04:03.600> some

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
takes off some of the build-up now some

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.120 
takes off some of the build-up now some
of<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:03.959> other<00:04:04.080> tips<00:04:04.410> out<00:04:04.590> there<00:04:04.739> which<00:04:04.890> I

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
of the other tips out there which I

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.770 
of the other tips out there which I
thought<00:04:05.700> was<00:04:05.820> very<00:04:05.880> interesting<00:04:06.450> is<00:04:06.570> that<00:04:06.600> you

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
thought was very interesting is that you

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.150 
thought was very interesting is that you
say<00:04:06.930> you<00:04:06.989> should<00:04:07.200> also<00:04:07.380> eat<00:04:07.620> foods<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.070> are

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
say you should also eat foods that are

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.979 
say you should also eat foods that are
high<00:04:08.370> in<00:04:08.400> cellulose<00:04:09.000> such<00:04:09.209> as<00:04:09.360> as<00:04:09.540> we<00:04:09.840> have

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
high in cellulose such as as we have

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.470 
high in cellulose such as as we have
here<00:04:10.230> carrots<00:04:10.920> celery<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.580> kale<00:04:11.940> so<00:04:12.239> what

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
here carrots celery and kale so what

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.090 
here carrots celery and kale so what
what<00:04:12.810> a<00:04:12.840> new<00:04:13.019> food<00:04:13.350> were<00:04:13.739> to<00:04:13.860> help<00:04:13.980> you're

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
what a new food were to help you're

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.170 
what a new food were to help you're
gonna<00:04:14.160> have<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.400> lot<00:04:14.640> of<00:04:14.670> kale<00:04:14.940> right

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
gonna have a lot of kale right

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.640 
gonna have a lot of kale right
afterwards<00:04:15.690> but<00:04:15.810> what<00:04:15.959> it<00:04:16.049> does<00:04:16.230> is<00:04:16.410> it<00:04:16.530> just

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
afterwards but what it does is it just

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.170 
afterwards but what it does is it just
breaks<00:04:16.919> down<00:04:17.040> some<00:04:17.310> of<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.459> bacteria<00:04:17.609> on<00:04:18.030> your

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
breaks down some of the bacteria on your

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.670 
breaks down some of the bacteria on your
teeth<00:04:18.330> so<00:04:18.450> it<00:04:18.570> helps<00:04:18.840> so<00:04:19.260> if<00:04:19.350> you're<00:04:19.500> drinking

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
teeth so it helps so if you're drinking

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
a glass of wine you might want to think

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.580
