00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
has got a slightly higher cocoa butter

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.260 
has got a slightly higher cocoa butter
content<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.890> then<00:00:32.039> actually<00:00:32.160> Google<00:00:32.879> do<00:00:33.030> comes

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
content so then actually Google do comes

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.639 
content so then actually Google do comes
from<00:00:33.359> the<00:00:33.570> French<00:00:33.780> world<00:00:33.989> couvert<00:00:34.350> which

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
from the French world couvert which

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.770 
from the French world couvert which
means<00:00:34.890> covering<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.179> actually<00:00:36.329> has<00:00:36.569> got<00:00:36.749> a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
means covering so it actually has got a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.110 
means covering so it actually has got a
slightly<00:00:37.379> higher<00:00:37.769> fluency<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.670> runs<00:00:38.879> a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
slightly higher fluency so it runs a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.430 
slightly higher fluency so it runs a
little<00:00:39.239> bit<00:00:39.390> silky<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.019> a<00:00:40.079> little<00:00:40.350> bit

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
little bit silky and a little bit

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.110 
little bit silky and a little bit
smoother<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.100> that's<00:00:41.489> why<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.850> chocolate

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
smoother and that's why this chocolate

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.509 
smoother and that's why this chocolate
is<00:00:42.329> perfect<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:42.989> coating<00:00:43.469> truffles<00:00:44.010> coating

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
is perfect for coating truffles coating

cakes and making hollow figures etc so
the<00:00:47.399> chocolate<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:47.999> package<00:00:48.510> as<00:00:48.659> you<00:00:48.870> buy

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:49.049 
the chocolate in the package as you buy

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.689 
the chocolate in the package as you buy
it<00:00:49.109> it's<00:00:49.350> actually<00:00:49.469> perfectly<00:00:50.100> tempered<00:00:50.549> but

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
it it's actually perfectly tempered but

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.849 
it it's actually perfectly tempered but
if<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.059> want<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.690> melt<00:00:52.139> your<00:00:52.319> chocolate<00:00:52.379> down

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
if you want to melt your chocolate down

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:54.439 
if you want to melt your chocolate down
and<00:00:53.190> make<00:00:53.309> your<00:00:53.460> own<00:00:53.579> chocolate<00:00:53.999> creations

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
and make your own chocolate creations

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.899 
and make your own chocolate creations
you<00:00:54.959> will<00:00:55.199> actually<00:00:55.379> need<00:00:55.799> to<00:00:56.159> read<00:00:56.459> tempered

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
you will actually need to read tempered

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:57.439 
you will actually need to read tempered
chocolate

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
chocolate

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.599 
chocolate
so<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.749> tempering<00:00:58.199> process<00:00:58.229> will<00:00:59.190> actually

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
so the tempering process will actually

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.340 
so the tempering process will actually
give<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.909> a<00:00:59.940> chocolate<00:01:00.539> with<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.049> beautiful

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
give you a chocolate with that beautiful

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.609 
give you a chocolate with that beautiful
shine<00:01:01.739> again<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.789> beautiful<00:01:03.389> clean<00:01:03.929> crisp

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
shine again that beautiful clean crisp

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.890 
shine again that beautiful clean crisp
snap<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> way<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.970> done<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
snap so the way this is done in the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.480 
snap so the way this is done in the
traditional<00:01:07.049> way<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.890> by<00:01:08.310> pouring<00:01:08.760> 2/3<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:10.490> the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
traditional way is by pouring 2/3 of the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.690 
traditional way is by pouring 2/3 of the
hot<00:01:11.700> chocolate<00:01:11.940> onto<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:13.490> marble<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:14.640> granite

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
hot chocolate onto a marble or granite

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.550 
hot chocolate onto a marble or granite
stone<00:01:15.390> because<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.930> will<00:01:16.110> draw<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
stone because that will draw the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.730 
stone because that will draw the
temperature<00:01:17.340> out<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.510> chocolate<00:01:18.740> so

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
temperature out of the chocolate so

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.920 
temperature out of the chocolate so
remove<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.340> chocolate<00:01:20.490> around<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.810> we

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
remove the chocolate around and we

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.500 
remove the chocolate around and we
scrape<00:01:22.230> it<00:01:22.440> back<00:01:22.620> together<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:23.550> want<00:01:23.730> to<00:01:23.880> cool

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
scrape it back together we want to cool

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.530 
scrape it back together we want to cool
our<00:01:24.780> chocolate<00:01:25.230> down<00:01:25.410> to<00:01:25.650> about<00:01:26.030> 28<00:01:27.030> degrees

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
our chocolate down to about 28 degrees

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.370 
our chocolate down to about 28 degrees
Celsius<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:29.360> also<00:01:30.360> introduce<00:01:30.840> those<00:01:31.080> good

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
Celsius and also introduce those good

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.250 
Celsius and also introduce those good
crystals<00:01:31.890> back<00:01:32.160> into<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.550> chocolate<00:01:32.790> and

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
crystals back into the chocolate and

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.530 
crystals back into the chocolate and
this<00:01:34.260> continuous<00:01:34.860> movements<00:01:35.610> cools<00:01:36.270> down<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
this continuous movements cools down the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.260 
this continuous movements cools down the
chocolate<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.170> actually<00:01:37.650> starts<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.310> set<00:01:38.730> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
chocolate and actually starts to set the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.820 
chocolate and actually starts to set the
good<00:01:39.480> crystals<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.290> chocolate<00:01:40.530> together

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
good crystals in this chocolate together

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.850 
good crystals in this chocolate together
so<00:01:41.730> we<00:01:41.880> do<00:01:42.120> this<00:01:42.360> continue<00:01:43.050> to<00:01:43.200> spread<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.710> out

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
so we do this continue to spread it out

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.570 
so we do this continue to spread it out
push<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.340> together<00:01:45.080> until<00:01:46.080> we<00:01:46.470> get<00:01:46.620> this

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
push it together until we get this

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.280 
push it together until we get this
chocolate<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.090> have<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.360> consistency<00:01:49.140> of

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
chocolate to have the consistency of

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.960 
chocolate to have the consistency of
almost<00:01:50.190> cooked<00:01:50.490> custard<00:01:52.700> important<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.790> work

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
almost cooked custard important to work

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.090 
almost cooked custard important to work
clean<00:01:54.420> because<00:01:54.840> any<00:01:55.260> sort<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.590> little<00:01:55.830> specks

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
clean because any sort of little specks

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.310 
clean because any sort of little specks
of<00:01:56.310> chocolate<00:01:56.730> around<00:01:57.030> will<00:01:57.750> actually<00:01:58.050> set

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
of chocolate around will actually set

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.770 
of chocolate around will actually set
apart<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.010> we<00:01:59.610> end<00:01:59.729> up<00:01:59.850> with<00:02:00.000> lumps<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.540> some

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
apart and we end up with lumps and some

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.870 
anything in pastry cooking you need a
little<00:02:03.840> bit<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:03.990> patience<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.700> need

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
little bit of patience so you just need

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.730 
little bit of patience so you just need
to<00:02:06.030> do<00:02:06.150> this<00:02:06.360> process<00:02:06.600> until<00:02:07.260> he<00:02:07.409> gets<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
to do this process until he gets the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.830 
to do this process until he gets the
right<00:02:07.890> texture<00:02:08.340> because<00:02:09.239> if<00:02:09.390> you're<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.539> out

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
right texture because if you're just out

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.989 
right texture because if you're just out
by<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> couple<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.530> degrees<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:11.489> won't<00:02:11.819> get

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:11.999 
by a couple of degrees you won't get

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.520 
by a couple of degrees you won't get
that<00:02:12.150> nice<00:02:12.359> result<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.019> we're<00:02:13.139> after

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
that nice result that we're after

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.440 
that nice result that we're after
so<00:02:14.249> the<00:02:14.400> important<00:02:14.909> temperature<00:02:15.389> gauges<00:02:15.599> in

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
so the important temperature gauges in

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.020 
so the important temperature gauges in
tempering<00:02:17.290> chocolate<00:02:17.319> czar<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.310> completely

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
tempering chocolate czar to completely

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.820 
tempering chocolate czar to completely
melt<00:02:19.450> all<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.870> crystals<00:02:20.260> inside<00:02:20.620> the

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
melt all the crystals inside the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.920 
melt all the crystals inside the
chocolate<00:02:21.190> we<00:02:21.640> need<00:02:21.819> to<00:02:21.940> heat<00:02:22.150> it<00:02:22.330> very<00:02:22.720> gently

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
chocolate we need to heat it very gently

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.040 
chocolate we need to heat it very gently
248<00:02:23.830> degrees<00:02:23.980> Celsius<00:02:24.640> then<00:02:25.540> for<00:02:25.810> dark

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
248 degrees Celsius then for dark

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.930 
248 degrees Celsius then for dark
chocolates<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.739> will<00:02:27.099> need<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.459> cool<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.760> down

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
chocolates you will need to cool it down

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.259 
chocolates you will need to cool it down
by<00:02:28.330> tabling<00:02:28.690> like<00:02:29.080> this<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.800> 28<00:02:30.670> degrees

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
by tabling like this to 28 degrees

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.540 
by tabling like this to 28 degrees
Celsius<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:31.959> then<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.680> working<00:02:32.980> temperature

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
Celsius and then the working temperature

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.570 
Celsius and then the working temperature
for<00:02:33.940> dark<00:02:34.180> chocolate<00:02:34.630> is<00:02:34.780> actually<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.440> 31<00:02:36.280> to

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
for dark chocolate is actually a 31 to

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.610 
for dark chocolate is actually a 31 to
32<00:02:36.970> degrees<00:02:37.420> Celsius<00:02:37.690> depending<00:02:38.349> a<00:02:38.410> little

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
32 degrees Celsius depending a little

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.860 
32 degrees Celsius depending a little
bit<00:02:38.709> on<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.069> chocolate<00:02:39.310> itself<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.750> we

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
bit on the chocolate itself so we

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.120 
bit on the chocolate itself so we
actually<00:02:41.140> need<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.290> do<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.650> temperature

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
actually need to do that temperature

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.490 
actually need to do that temperature
curve<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.640> as<00:02:43.000> we're<00:02:43.209> doing<00:02:43.299> now<00:02:43.630> which<00:02:44.319> is

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
curve and as we're doing now which is

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.979 
curve and as we're doing now which is
really<00:02:45.130> gently<00:02:45.610> cooling<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.480> chocolate<00:02:46.870> down

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
really gently cooling the chocolate down

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.020 
really gently cooling the chocolate down
building<00:02:47.470> those<00:02:47.620> crystals<00:02:48.160> then<00:02:48.880> we

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
building those crystals then we

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.880 
building those crystals then we
introduce<00:02:49.450> this<00:02:49.720> back<00:02:49.989> into<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.500> warm

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
introduce this back into a warm

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.960 
introduce this back into a warm
chocolate<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:52.650> then<00:02:53.650> gently<00:02:54.040> gently<00:02:54.370> reheat

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
chocolate and then gently gently reheat

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.289 
chocolate and then gently gently reheat
it<00:02:55.180> on<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.420> water<00:02:55.780> bath<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:57.430> 31<00:02:58.060> degrees

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
it on a water bath to the 31 degrees

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.539 
it on a water bath to the 31 degrees
Celsius<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:01.000> chocolates<00:03:02.220> starting<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.340> pick

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
Celsius the chocolates starting to pick

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.920 
Celsius the chocolates starting to pick
up<00:03:03.700> now<00:03:04.019> so<00:03:05.019> this<00:03:05.170> is<00:03:05.230> pretty<00:03:05.560> much<00:03:06.930> feels

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
up now so this is pretty much feels

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.170 
up now so this is pretty much feels
completely<00:03:08.410> cold<00:03:08.739> to<00:03:08.950> touch<00:03:08.980> so<00:03:09.880> we<00:03:10.030> can

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
completely cold to touch so we can

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.390 
completely cold to touch so we can
introduce<00:03:10.390> this<00:03:10.840> back<00:03:11.650> into<00:03:11.860> our<00:03:11.980> warm

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
introduce this back into our warm

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.059 
introduce this back into our warm
chocolate<00:03:13.079> and<00:03:14.079> then<00:03:14.319> we<00:03:14.410> need<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.650> stir<00:03:14.890> this

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
chocolate and then we need to stir this

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.330 
chocolate and then we need to stir this
well<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.780> we<00:03:16.900> need<00:03:17.049> to<00:03:17.170> stir<00:03:17.440> this<00:03:17.709> in<00:03:17.769> really

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
well so we need to stir this in really

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.150 
well so we need to stir this in really
well<00:03:18.519> and<00:03:19.299> then<00:03:19.450> just<00:03:19.660> on<00:03:20.110> a<00:03:20.170> water<00:03:20.620> bath<00:03:20.950> which

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
well and then just on a water bath which

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.860 
well and then just on a water bath which
is<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.519> early<00:03:21.760> simmering<00:03:22.150> water<00:03:22.299> we<00:03:22.600> actually

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
is the early simmering water we actually

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.410 
is the early simmering water we actually
just<00:03:23.019> need<00:03:23.200> to<00:03:23.549> heat<00:03:24.549> it<00:03:24.579> up<00:03:24.819> by<00:03:25.030> just<00:03:25.269> a<00:03:25.389> couple

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
just need to heat it up by just a couple

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.890 
just need to heat it up by just a couple
of<00:03:25.840> degrees<00:03:25.989> so<00:03:26.440> very<00:03:26.680> very<00:03:27.040> gently<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:28.660> out

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
of degrees so very very gently and out

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.360 
of degrees so very very gently and out
it<00:03:29.079> comes<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.650> then<00:03:29.859> we<00:03:29.950> take<00:03:30.130> a<00:03:30.190> little

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
it comes and then we take a little

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.910 
it comes and then we take a little
sample<00:03:30.700> after<00:03:31.090> you<00:03:31.359> stirred<00:03:31.630> well<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.650> also

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
sample after you stirred well and also

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.009 
sample after you stirred well and also
the<00:03:33.040> texture<00:03:33.549> of<00:03:33.700> tempered<00:03:34.209> chocolate<00:03:34.239> is

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
the texture of tempered chocolate is

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.289 
the texture of tempered chocolate is
actually<00:03:35.470> relatively<00:03:36.010> thick<00:03:36.489> so<00:03:36.700> it<00:03:36.790> sits<00:03:37.090> up

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
actually relatively thick so it sits up

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.120 
actually relatively thick so it sits up
on<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.690> actual<00:03:37.930> surface<00:03:38.230> of<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.709> chocolate

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
on the actual surface of the chocolate

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.550 
on the actual surface of the chocolate
and<00:03:39.700> of<00:03:40.450> course<00:03:40.630> it's<00:03:40.780> always<00:03:40.900> a<00:03:41.019> good<00:03:41.200> idea<00:03:41.230> to

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
and of course it's always a good idea to

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.879 
and of course it's always a good idea to
just<00:03:41.590> take<00:03:41.980> a<00:03:42.010> little<00:03:42.220> sample<00:03:42.959> so<00:03:43.959> dip<00:03:44.260> a<00:03:44.440> spoon

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
just take a little sample so dip a spoon

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.819 
just take a little sample so dip a spoon
or<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.310> scraper<00:03:46.049> in<00:03:47.049> your<00:03:47.319> tempered<00:03:47.799> chocolate

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
or a scraper in your tempered chocolate

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.960 
or a scraper in your tempered chocolate
and<00:03:48.370> just<00:03:49.120> set<00:03:49.329> it<00:03:49.480> aside<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:51.130> this<00:03:51.310> tempered

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
and just set it aside and this tempered

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.699 
and just set it aside and this tempered
chocolate<00:03:52.000> actually<00:03:52.600> starts<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:53.049> set<00:03:53.290> within

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
chocolate actually starts to set within

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.800 
chocolate actually starts to set within
two<00:03:54.069> or<00:03:54.100> three<00:03:54.190> minutes<00:03:54.519> and<00:03:55.000> it<00:03:55.120> be<00:03:55.239> perfectly

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
two or three minutes and it be perfectly

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.080 
two or three minutes and it be perfectly
shiny<00:03:56.230> glossy<00:03:57.010> everything<00:03:57.670> we're<00:03:57.819> looking

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
shiny glossy everything we're looking

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.789 
shiny glossy everything we're looking
for<00:03:58.269> in<00:03:58.420> our<00:03:58.510> chocolate<00:03:58.690> right<00:03:59.530> if<00:03:59.680> you

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
for in our chocolate right if you

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.170
