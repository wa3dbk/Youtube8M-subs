00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.129
 a tour on their website 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.079
 well in short so do not focus on 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.120
 slugs that are present on the net 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.860

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.219
 will consist of presenting all weapons 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.269

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.820

 giving the name of the handover 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.100
 question so I hope I will be 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.740
 quite accurate I will not be too much how 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.420
 turn that so I hope it goes 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.670

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.050

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.280
 holtz vinyls so today I'm going 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.039
 present you all the weapons in 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.720
 black pebble diamond up 2 then 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.940
 we will start with assault rifles 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.039
 with the late m then I'm going to you 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.580
 to show a little seen in first 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.850
 nobody 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.800
 as well as in third person I try 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.380
 to show you a guy every angle 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.610
 from this tarn 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.470
 it's not going to be obvious I'll try 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:56.170
 to do it for all weapons 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:59.080
 so here you are you can see 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.229
 what does the diamond fda look like for 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.299
 those who had not seen him yet 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.830
 it rather not bad 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.039
 So here it is all for the hem 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.520
 wrong then we attack directly by 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.590
 the 25 years old diamond diamond of course 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.810
 as usual the small goal between 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.680
 other people i will try to you 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.660
 show life lyon from below us if 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.230
 that's not where I look at my level of 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.290
 loader is so that's where we see 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.760
 here go to diamond or not so the wii 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.590
 for the case of the tribe 25 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.629
 here 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:43.840
 no effect for the team 25 years then the 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:46.120
 owl 556 have only a view in 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.110
 first person now life in 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.210
 third person 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.390
 so there it is frankly is 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.570
 not bad huh because it's really me 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.490
 when I hand him the summer rather pretty 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:02.180
 so here I am doing you the 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:05.570
 demonstration so without effect for the 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.610
 or 156 then we go directly to 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.140
 the fal then as you can the 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.270
 to find it really hurts 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.430
 in the eyes it is a weapon that I found 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.830
 especially pretty in this case too 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.500
 black up 2 knowing she is very very 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.110
 very formidable those who already have it 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.690
 used in automatic of course but 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.910
 members blow by blow she does very 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.300
 very badly but hey there we are not for 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:33.200
 speak of armed efficiency well of their 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.970
 of their beauty well that's like that so the 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.690
 here in diamonds she is frankly 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.940
 nice then we attack with the n 27 which 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.070
 is low she too very beautiful 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.630
 it's totally worth it to play 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.400
 with knowing that anyway if you 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.170
 unlock all weapons we will even 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.970
 category wanted to unlock everything in 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.450
 diamond so why skip it 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.120
 why deprive yourself so here is the n 27 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.420
 not so bad little favorite by the 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.420
 same opportunity 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.170
 you may not agree with 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.570
 me but I find that the sq has 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.610
 not bought back if they want me 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.900
 i love to play with asca rage 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.330
 personally in the multiplayer and 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.910
 diamond manufacturers we are not top 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.590
 thanks to your opinion there you see the 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.359
 little emblem that is on the side of 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.549
 tears 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.509
 so here you go 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:27.210
 to have the not bad anyway a good 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:31.680
 here we are now the smr if I 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.690
 not mistaken here voila voilou I you 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:40.039
 let yourself see for yourself 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:43.069
 the skin delorme not bad a lot not bad 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.069
 not bad 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.409
 yeah I'm done for cm1 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:54.739
 let's move on to mx 1 now 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:57.860
 is she is terribly think that we 

00:04:54.739 --> 00:04:59.629
 can not say more I really find her 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.800
 very very beautiful death after all 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:02.659
 diamond weapons or say they are 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.899
 beautiful but that's a bit more than 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:04.899
 others 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:09.739
 now let's move on to the rifle which 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:13.669
 makes havoc in multiplayer a n 

00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:15.319
 94 not so bad as that in diamonds 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.809
 but hey it's a slamming weapon and 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:20.300
 I think because my friend the people who have 

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:22.580
 mounted the assault rifles hope or at 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.159
 see this diamond weapon so 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.979
 I think not disappointed but here 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:30.389
 I could have done a little better I think 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:33.119
 now let's go to launchers and more 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.669
 especially to this word which is 

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:38.399
 just sublime like all pitchers 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:40.049
 of stake here I let you look at me 

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:42.619
 think nothing to say I'll shut up 

00:05:40.049 --> 00:05:42.619
 for this one 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.740
 this one I always confuse with the 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.690
 jar style of course it's not the subject 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.320
 send no doubt which launcher I 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.720
 want to talk 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.120
 in any case at the skin I think 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.640
 that to my friend it must be tears or a 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:12.220
 weapons are not really nice in 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:12.220
 the most beautiful weapons in the game so here we go 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:29.150
 the rpg 7 this is this episode of weapons in 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.860
 diamond is coming to an end so that was the 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.140
 first episode of assault rifles 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.850
 as well as game pitchers will do next 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.200
 in an upcoming episode and I'll do it 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.150
 maybe 3,4 it will depend 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.730
