salmon it's a great effect looks pretty
easy<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.879> do<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.960> practice<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.739> can<00:00:40.890> do<00:00:40.980> it

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
easy to do to the practice you can do it

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:50.520

too

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.650 

hi<00:00:51.530> these<00:00:52.460> are<00:00:52.580> thick<00:00:52.730> assemblage<00:00:53.180> that<00:00:53.210> crane

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
hi these are thick assemblage that crane

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.750 
hi these are thick assemblage that crane
was<00:00:53.840> talking<00:00:54.050> about<00:00:54.080> earlier<00:00:54.700> there<00:00:55.700> are

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
was talking about earlier there are

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.640 
was talking about earlier there are
basically<00:00:55.970> two<00:00:56.240> types<00:00:56.270> one<00:00:56.690> me<00:00:56.960> going<00:00:57.260> up<00:00:57.380> when

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
basically two types one me going up when

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.370 
basically two types one me going up when
we<00:00:57.770> get<00:00:57.980> down<00:00:58.250> quite<00:00:58.610> simply<00:00:59.050> and<00:01:00.050> it's<00:01:00.200> very

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
we get down quite simply and it's very

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.020 
we get down quite simply and it's very
typical<00:01:00.500> of<00:01:00.800> Germany<00:01:01.220> Louis's<00:01:01.580> piano<00:01:01.820> playing

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
typical of Germany Louis's piano playing

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.689 
typical of Germany Louis's piano playing
style<00:01:02.390> so<00:01:03.200> if<00:01:03.770> I<00:01:03.890> just<00:01:04.070> take<00:01:04.220> them<00:01:04.309> on<00:01:04.460> going

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
style so if I just take them on going

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.910 
style so if I just take them on going
down<00:01:04.910> there<00:01:05.720> two<00:01:05.870> ways<00:01:06.050> of<00:01:06.200> doing<00:01:06.380> this<00:01:06.590> really

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
down there two ways of doing this really

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.950 
down there two ways of doing this really
some<00:01:07.130> people<00:01:07.160> use<00:01:07.490> their<00:01:07.670> fingers<00:01:08.090> slightly

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
some people use their fingers slightly

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.410 
some people use their fingers slightly
now<00:01:09.520> jleelewis<00:01:10.520> does<00:01:10.880> it<00:01:10.970> be<00:01:11.030> this<00:01:11.150> thumb

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
now jleelewis does it be this thumb

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.330 
now jleelewis does it be this thumb
which<00:01:11.630> is<00:01:11.810> a<00:01:11.990> more<00:01:12.350> precise<00:01:12.710> technique<00:01:13.160> really

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
which is a more precise technique really

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.880 
which is a more precise technique really
and<00:01:13.670> it<00:01:14.330> was<00:01:14.720> initially<00:01:15.050> a<00:01:15.440> little<00:01:15.740> bit

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
and it was initially a little bit

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.320 
and it was initially a little bit
because<00:01:16.190> you<00:01:16.369> have<00:01:16.430> to<00:01:16.610> put<00:01:16.760> a<00:01:16.820> bit<00:01:17.300> of

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
because you have to put a bit of

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.880 
because you have to put a bit of
resistance<00:01:17.600> when<00:01:17.900> your<00:01:18.050> thumb<00:01:18.229> in<00:01:18.440> if<00:01:18.800> you

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
resistance when your thumb in if you

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.500 
resistance when your thumb in if you
just<00:01:19.010> take<00:01:19.160> your<00:01:19.280> thumb<00:01:19.340> like<00:01:19.550> this<00:01:19.910> spread

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
just take your thumb like this spread

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.700 
just take your thumb like this spread
the<00:01:20.660> other<00:01:20.780> thing<00:01:21.020> there's<00:01:21.200> above<00:01:21.410> the<00:01:21.530> Black

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
the other thing there's above the Black

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.080 
the other thing there's above the Black
Keys<00:01:21.920> that's<00:01:22.190> like<00:01:22.340> he<00:01:22.460> doesn't<00:01:22.759> nice<00:01:22.880> and

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
Keys that's like he doesn't nice and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.940 
Keys that's like he doesn't nice and
flat<00:01:23.270> and<00:01:23.660> just<00:01:23.990> slide<00:01:24.259> down<00:01:26.470> you<00:01:27.470> start

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
flat and just slide down you start

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.560 
flat and just slide down you start
somewhere<00:01:28.610> around<00:01:28.970> here<00:01:29.300> where<00:01:29.360> you're

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
somewhere around here where you're

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.180 
somewhere around here where you're
playing<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.930> phrase<00:01:30.170> like<00:01:30.470> for<00:01:30.680> example<00:01:30.740> on

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
playing the phrase like for example on

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.290 
playing the phrase like for example on
our<00:01:31.280> piece<00:01:33.190> slide<00:01:34.190> down<00:01:34.430> probably<00:01:35.180> about

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
our piece slide down probably about

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.940 
our piece slide down probably about
about<00:01:35.600> middle<00:01:35.930> C<00:01:36.170> that<00:01:36.500> sounds<00:01:36.740> about<00:01:36.890> right

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
about middle C that sounds about right

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.359 
about middle C that sounds about right
and<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:38.509> other<00:01:38.630> way<00:01:38.810> is<00:01:38.840> going<00:01:39.259> on<00:01:39.410> normally

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
and the other way is going on normally

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.609 
and the other way is going on normally
use<00:01:40.520> your<00:01:40.700> second<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.090> third<00:01:41.119> finger<00:01:41.690> and

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.380 

then<00:01:45.619> you<00:01:45.890> want<00:01:46.040> to<00:01:46.130> maybe<00:01:46.280> hit<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:46.910> chord<00:01:47.240> up

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
then you want to maybe hit a chord up

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:56.290 
then you want to maybe hit a chord up
