look<00:01:52.649> like<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.979> comes<00:01:53.159> above<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.939> casing<00:01:54.390> just

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
look like it comes above the casing just

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.209 
look like it comes above the casing just
a<00:01:54.840> bit<00:01:55.110> which<00:01:55.380> means<00:01:55.619> if<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.829> were<00:01:55.950> dropping

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
a bit which means if you were dropping

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.490 
a bit which means if you were dropping
on<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.759> screen<00:01:57.030> itself<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.630> would<00:01:57.810> smash<00:01:58.259> it

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
on the screen itself you would smash it

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.260 
on the screen itself you would smash it
completely<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.430> recommend<00:01:59.909> getting<00:02:00.030> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
completely so I recommend getting the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.910 
completely so I recommend getting the
case<00:02:00.479> now<00:02:00.930> holding<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.259> phone<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:01.649> your<00:02:01.740> hand

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
case now holding the phone in your hand

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.620 
case now holding the phone in your hand
it<00:02:02.130> actually<00:02:02.369> feels<00:02:02.549> really<00:02:03.000> good<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.450> doesn't

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
it actually feels really good it doesn't

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.359 
it actually feels really good it doesn't
feel<00:02:03.869> light<00:02:04.170> or<00:02:04.380> cheap<00:02:04.740> even<00:02:05.100> though<00:02:05.219> it's
