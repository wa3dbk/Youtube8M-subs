I<00:05:17.650> look<00:05:17.860> at<00:05:17.980> my<00:05:18.100> table<00:05:18.310> concealer<00:05:19.210> many<00:05:19.510> films

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
I look at my table concealer many films

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.190 
I look at my table concealer many films
starring<00:05:20.380> Harrison<00:05:20.650> Ford<00:05:21.210> but<00:05:22.210> it<00:05:22.330> also<00:05:22.510> star

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
starring Harrison Ford but it also star

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.280 
starring Harrison Ford but it also star
or<00:05:23.440> actors<00:05:23.890> so<00:05:24.100> if<00:05:24.160> you<00:05:24.280> query<00:05:24.750> directly<00:05:25.750> for

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
or actors so if you query directly for

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.320 
or actors so if you query directly for
the<00:05:26.410> name<00:05:26.830> Harrison<00:05:27.310> Ford<00:05:27.580> you<00:05:27.730> may<00:05:27.940> not<00:05:28.150> get<00:05:28.270> a

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
the name Harrison Ford you may not get a

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.640 
the name Harrison Ford you may not get a
hit<00:05:28.510> we'll<00:05:28.810> just<00:05:28.960> look<00:05:29.080> at<00:05:29.170> data

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
hit we'll just look at data

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.730 
hit we'll just look at data
so<00:05:30.220> again<00:05:31.110> create<00:05:32.110> a<00:05:32.410> query<00:05:32.800> using<00:05:33.070> the<00:05:33.280> design

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
so again create a query using the design

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.060 
so again create a query using the design
just<00:05:35.740> like<00:05:35.860> before<00:05:36.100> we'll<00:05:36.460> add<00:05:37.350> our<00:05:38.350> table<00:05:38.620> our

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
just like before we'll add our table our

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.710 
just like before we'll add our table our
only<00:05:39.280> table<00:05:39.610> in<00:05:39.700> our<00:05:39.820> database<00:05:39.970> and<00:05:42.510> we<00:05:43.510> want

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
only table in our database and we want

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:49.950 
only table in our database and we want
to<00:05:43.960> pick<00:05:44.740> out<00:05:44.919> the<00:05:45.520> title<00:05:45.760> the<00:05:46.450> year<00:05:46.750> and<00:05:48.960> we'll

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
to pick out the title the year and we'll

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.200 
to pick out the title the year and we'll
be<00:05:49.990> looking<00:05:50.530> at<00:05:50.800> the<00:05:50.919> cast<00:05:51.190> now<00:05:51.640> we<00:05:51.700> don't<00:05:52.000> want

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
be looking at the cast now we don't want

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.350 
be looking at the cast now we don't want
to<00:05:52.300> display<00:05:52.510> the<00:05:52.780> cast<00:05:53.020> we<00:05:53.710> just<00:05:53.950> want<00:05:54.550> all<00:05:54.940> we

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
to display the cast we just want all we

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.700 
to display the cast we just want all we
want<00:05:55.540> to<00:05:55.630> know<00:05:55.750> about<00:05:55.870> the<00:05:56.050> cast<00:05:56.260> is<00:05:56.440> that

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
want to know about the cast is that

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.800 
want to know about the cast is that
Harrison<00:05:57.070> Ford<00:05:57.190> is<00:05:57.550> amongst<00:05:58.150> the<00:05:58.240> cast<00:05:58.419> so<00:05:58.690> we

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
Harrison Ford is amongst the cast so we

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.570 
Harrison Ford is amongst the cast so we
just<00:05:58.990> don't<00:05:59.140> take<00:05:59.260> that<00:05:59.500> started<00:06:00.130> in<00:06:00.220> order<00:06:00.340> of

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
just don't take that started in order of

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.080 
just don't take that started in order of
year

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
year

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.570 
year
start<00:06:01.840> with<00:06:02.020> the<00:06:02.110> lowest<00:06:02.470> year<00:06:02.800> and<00:06:03.010> ending

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
start with the lowest year and ending

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.140 
start with the lowest year and ending
with<00:06:04.410> the<00:06:05.410> most<00:06:05.740> recent<00:06:06.130> here<00:06:06.370> so<00:06:06.910> it's<00:06:07.060> an

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
with the most recent here so it's an

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.420 
with the most recent here so it's an
ascending<00:06:07.600> list<00:06:07.930> so<00:06:08.680> we'll<00:06:08.770> just<00:06:08.890> run<00:06:08.980> a<00:06:09.160> query

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
ascending list so we'll just run a query

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.040 
ascending list so we'll just run a query
to<00:06:09.580> investigate<00:06:10.270> that<00:06:10.390> we<00:06:10.510> now<00:06:10.660> have<00:06:10.900> the

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
to investigate that we now have the

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.070 
to investigate that we now have the
title<00:06:11.410> of<00:06:11.500> all<00:06:11.710> the<00:06:11.830> films<00:06:12.450> sort<00:06:13.450> an<00:06:13.690> order<00:06:13.960> up

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
title of all the films sort an order up

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.250 
title of all the films sort an order up
here<00:06:14.380> as<00:06:14.530> you<00:06:14.890> can<00:06:15.070> see<00:06:15.310> here<00:06:16.110> let's<00:06:17.110> go<00:06:17.230> back

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.260 
here as you can see here let's go back

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.590 
here as you can see here let's go back
to<00:06:17.500> design<00:06:17.650> now<00:06:18.040> and<00:06:18.340> pick<00:06:18.430> out<00:06:18.610> the<00:06:18.730> ones<00:06:18.910> just

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
to design now and pick out the ones just

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.310 
to design now and pick out the ones just
with<00:06:19.810> Harrison<00:06:20.290> Ford<00:06:20.430> so<00:06:21.430> if<00:06:21.550> you<00:06:21.640> put<00:06:21.850> in

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
with Harrison Ford so if you put in

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.970 
with Harrison Ford so if you put in
Harrison<00:06:23.320> forward<00:06:25.140> into<00:06:26.140> the<00:06:26.230> criteria<00:06:26.770> and

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:26.980 
Harrison forward into the criteria and

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.460 
Harrison forward into the criteria and
