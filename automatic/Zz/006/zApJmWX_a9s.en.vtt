welcome to Eric black money news hi and
welcome<00:00:13.280> to<00:00:13.580> my<00:00:13.700> tutorial<00:00:13.760> on<00:00:14.389> modes<00:00:15.139> of<00:00:15.530> the

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
welcome to my tutorial on modes of the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.420 
welcome to my tutorial on modes of the
major<00:00:16.219> scale<00:00:17.710> we're<00:00:18.710> going<00:00:18.890> to<00:00:18.980> talk<00:00:19.220> about

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
major scale we're going to talk about

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.660 
major scale we're going to talk about
the<00:00:19.910> C<00:00:20.210> major<00:00:20.449> scale<00:00:20.599> and<00:00:21.199> all<00:00:21.980> the<00:00:22.160> modes<00:00:22.400> in

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
the C major scale and all the modes in

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.570 
the C major scale and all the modes in
it<00:00:22.820> like<00:00:23.240> Ionian<00:00:23.990> Dorian<00:00:24.140> Phrygian<00:00:24.920> Lydian

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
it like Ionian Dorian Phrygian Lydian

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.579 
it like Ionian Dorian Phrygian Lydian
mixolydian<00:00:26.349> Aeolian<00:00:27.349> and<00:00:27.470> Locrian<00:00:29.439> and<00:00:30.439> we're

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:30.589 
mixolydian Aeolian and Locrian and we're

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.290 
mixolydian Aeolian and Locrian and we're
going<00:00:30.740> to<00:00:30.830> do<00:00:31.039> it<00:00:31.160> in<00:00:31.310> a<00:00:31.400> way<00:00:31.550> that<00:00:31.580> most<00:00:32.029> people

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
going to do it in a way that most people

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.380 
going to do it in a way that most people
can<00:00:32.450> understand<00:00:33.020> it<00:00:33.700> we're<00:00:34.700> going<00:00:34.850> to<00:00:34.940> do<00:00:35.150> this

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
can understand it we're going to do this

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.260 
can understand it we're going to do this
on<00:00:35.660> piano<00:00:36.590> because<00:00:37.430> it's<00:00:37.730> a<00:00:37.820> whole<00:00:38.030> lot<00:00:38.059> easier

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
on piano because it's a whole lot easier

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.520 
on piano because it's a whole lot easier
to<00:00:38.840> see<00:00:39.110> it<00:00:39.200> and<00:00:39.379> understand<00:00:39.950> it<00:00:40.070> at<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:40.309> piano

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
to see it and understand it at the piano

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.090 
to see it and understand it at the piano
so<00:00:42.530> let's<00:00:42.739> get<00:00:42.890> started<00:00:44.500> the<00:00:45.500> first<00:00:45.530> thing<00:00:45.980> we

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
so let's get started the first thing we

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.720 
so let's get started the first thing we
need<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.309> ask<00:00:46.640> is<00:00:47.030> what<00:00:47.989> does<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.530> word<00:00:48.800> mode

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
need to ask is what does the word mode

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.810 
need to ask is what does the word mode
mean<00:00:50.660> a<00:00:53.020> mode<00:00:54.020> simply<00:00:54.500> means<00:00:54.890> that<00:00:55.219> we're

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
mean a mode simply means that we're

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.150 
mean a mode simply means that we're
going<00:00:56.000> to<00:00:56.120> be<00:00:56.239> looking<00:00:56.570> at<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:57.140> same<00:00:57.440> thing<00:00:57.920> or

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
going to be looking at the same thing or

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.520 
going to be looking at the same thing or
the<00:00:58.579> same<00:00:58.820> scale<00:00:59.210> but<00:00:59.539> we'll<00:01:00.289> have<00:01:00.500> a

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
the same scale but we'll have a

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.689 
the same scale but we'll have a
different<00:01:01.190> emphasis<00:01:02.030> point<00:01:02.329> at<00:01:02.539> each<00:01:02.660> time

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
different emphasis point at each time

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.340 
different emphasis point at each time
you<00:01:04.699> can<00:01:04.879> think<00:01:05.090> of<00:01:05.180> it<00:01:05.330> as<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:06.110> would<00:01:06.290> a

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
you can think of it as you would a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.859 
you can think of it as you would a
baseball<00:01:08.110> this<00:01:09.110> is<00:01:09.320> mode<00:01:09.590> one<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:10.509> if<00:01:11.509> we<00:01:11.630> turn

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
baseball this is mode one and if we turn

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.820 
baseball this is mode one and if we turn
the<00:01:12.170> baseball<00:01:12.729> this<00:01:13.729> is<00:01:13.880> mode<00:01:14.060> two<00:01:14.470> it's<00:01:15.470> still

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
the baseball this is mode two it's still

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.420 
the baseball this is mode two it's still
the<00:01:16.009> same<00:01:16.220> baseball<00:01:17.680> but<00:01:18.680> it<00:01:18.860> looks<00:01:19.130> different

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
the same baseball but it looks different

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.819 
the same baseball but it looks different
from<00:01:20.240> mode<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:20.840> mode<00:01:21.259> three<00:01:22.180> mode<00:01:23.180> 4<00:01:23.650> if<00:01:24.650> you

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
from mode to mode three mode 4 if you

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.190 
from mode to mode three mode 4 if you
see<00:01:25.070> what<00:01:25.220> I<00:01:25.250> mean

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
see what I mean

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.230 
see what I mean
now<00:01:27.200> we're<00:01:27.350> going<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.619> do<00:01:27.860> that<00:01:28.630> with<00:01:29.630> scales

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
now we're going to do that with scales

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.850 
now we're going to do that with scales
we're<00:01:32.240> going<00:01:32.420> to<00:01:32.509> start<00:01:32.869> with<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.439> C<00:01:33.649> major

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
we're going to start with the C major

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:41.350 
we're going to start with the C major
scale<00:01:34.009> which<00:01:34.670> is<00:01:34.700> c<00:01:35.149> d<00:01:35.869> e<00:01:36.200> f<00:01:36.829> g<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:38.090> b<00:01:38.600> c<00:01:40.149> that<00:01:41.149> will

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
scale which is c d e f g a b c that will

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.679 
scale which is c d e f g a b c that will
be<00:01:41.479> our<00:01:41.630> first<00:01:41.899> mode<00:01:42.670> now<00:01:43.670> each<00:01:43.909> mode<00:01:44.270> has<00:01:44.299> a

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
be our first mode now each mode has a

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.350 
be our first mode now each mode has a
name<00:01:45.310> mode<00:01:46.310> one<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:46.930> Ionian<00:01:47.930> that's<00:01:48.350> c<00:01:48.770> d<00:01:49.159> e<00:01:49.430> f<00:01:49.909> G

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
name mode one is Ionian that's c d e f G

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.039 
name mode one is Ionian that's c d e f G
a<00:01:50.600> B<00:01:51.259> and<00:01:51.500> C<00:01:52.009> we're<00:01:52.610> starting<00:01:53.149> with<00:01:53.719> the<00:01:53.840> first

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
a B and C we're starting with the first

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.100 
a B and C we're starting with the first
note<00:01:54.350> of<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.710> major<00:01:54.890> scale<00:01:55.009> now<00:01:55.520> if<00:01:56.360> we<00:01:56.479> play<00:01:56.780> a

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
note of the major scale now if we play a

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.319 
note of the major scale now if we play a
couple<00:01:57.710> of<00:01:57.829> chords<00:01:58.130> along<00:01:58.520> with<00:01:58.700> that<00:01:58.909> and

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
couple of chords along with that and

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.319 
couple of chords along with that and
we're<00:01:59.450> going<00:01:59.570> to<00:01:59.630> emphasize<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:00.280> C<00:02:01.329> that's

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
we're going to emphasize the C that's

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.749 
we're going to emphasize the C that's
where<00:02:02.539> our<00:02:02.570> emphasis<00:02:02.840> is<00:02:03.439> so<00:02:04.310> we're<00:02:04.460> going<00:02:04.670> to

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
where our emphasis is so we're going to

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.330 
where our emphasis is so we're going to
play<00:02:04.939> C<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:05.810> F<00:02:06.770> on<00:02:07.490> this<00:02:07.789> hand

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
play C and F on this hand

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:19.000 
play C and F on this hand
and<00:02:08.429> then<00:02:08.550> we'll<00:02:08.700> play<00:02:08.879> on<00:02:09.030> our<00:02:09.060> scale

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.640 

now<00:02:20.010> let's<00:02:20.190> go<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.580> next<00:02:20.880> mode<00:02:21.120> which<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.320> D

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
now let's go to the next mode which is D

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.500 
now let's go to the next mode which is D
we're<00:02:23.040> going<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.310> go<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.730> second<00:02:24.240> note<00:02:24.360> in

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
we're going to go to the second note in

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.280 
we're going to go to the second note in
the<00:02:24.600> scale<00:02:24.720> which<00:02:25.650> is<00:02:25.830> D<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.970> called<00:02:27.300> Dorian

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
the scale which is D it is called Dorian

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.250 
the scale which is D it is called Dorian
now<00:02:29.160> when<00:02:29.370> we<00:02:29.490> emphasize<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.300> D<00:02:30.600> is<00:02:30.870> going<00:02:31.200> to

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
now when we emphasize the D is going to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:48.880 
now when we emphasize the D is going to
sound<00:02:31.470> slightly<00:02:31.860> different<00:02:32.460> watch<00:02:32.760> this

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.710 

notice<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.040> difference<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:50.760> see<00:02:51.120> when<00:02:51.569> we

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
notice that difference you see when we

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.980 
notice that difference you see when we
hear<00:02:52.490> the<00:02:53.490> same<00:02:53.790> notes<00:02:54.209> from<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.810> different

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
hear the same notes from a different

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.190 
hear the same notes from a different
point<00:02:55.380> they<00:02:55.890> sound<00:02:56.310> different<00:02:56.550> to<00:02:56.850> us<00:02:57.200> scale

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
point they sound different to us scale

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.220 
point they sound different to us scale
number<00:02:58.560> three<00:02:58.830> will<00:02:59.340> be<00:02:59.459> Phrygian<00:03:00.230> we'll

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
number three will be Phrygian we'll

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.830 
number three will be Phrygian we'll
start<00:03:01.620> with<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.860> third<00:03:02.069> note<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:02.730> three<00:03:03.150> means

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
start with the third note so three means

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
start with the third note so three means
Phrygian<00:03:08.959> let's<00:03:09.959> see<00:03:10.170> what<00:03:10.319> that<00:03:10.410> sounds<00:03:10.680> like

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
Phrygian let's see what that sounds like

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:24.350 
Phrygian let's see what that sounds like
with<00:03:11.280> our<00:03:11.430> chords

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.640 

that's<00:03:25.360> what<00:03:25.540> it<00:03:25.660> sounds<00:03:25.960> like<00:03:26.020> with<00:03:26.530> the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
that's what it sounds like with the

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.440 
that's what it sounds like with the
emphasis<00:03:27.160> on<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.400> e<00:03:27.730> if<00:03:28.200> we<00:03:29.200> go<00:03:29.320> to<00:03:29.380> F<00:03:30.450> the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
emphasis on the e if we go to F the

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.000 
emphasis on the e if we go to F the
fourth<00:03:31.810> mode

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
fourth mode

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:42.570 
fourth mode
that's<00:03:33.910> called<00:03:34.210> Lydian<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:41.220> that's<00:03:42.220> going<00:03:42.460> to

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
that's called Lydian and that's going to

00:03:42.580 --> 00:04:00.990 
that's called Lydian and that's going to
sound<00:03:42.880> like<00:03:43.420> this<00:03:59.220> the<00:04:00.220> next<00:04:00.400> mode<00:04:00.760> is

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
sound like this the next mode is

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.040 
sound like this the next mode is
mixolydian<00:04:02.190> that's<00:04:03.190> mode<00:04:03.460> number<00:04:03.670> five<00:04:04.060> nut

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
mixolydian that's mode number five nut

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.760 
mixolydian that's mode number five nut
number<00:04:05.260> five<00:04:05.560> one<00:04:06.010> two<00:04:06.280> three<00:04:06.310> four<00:04:07.000> five<00:04:07.770> G

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:27.090 
number five one two three four five G
mixolydian<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:11.470> it<00:04:11.590> sounds<00:04:11.950> like<00:04:11.980> this

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.960 

next<00:04:28.100> is<00:04:28.280> Aeolian<00:04:29.270> number<00:04:30.139> 6a<00:04:30.710> which<00:04:31.550> is<00:04:31.790> the

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
next is Aeolian number 6a which is the

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.170 
next is Aeolian number 6a which is the
relative<00:04:32.360> minor<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:33.350> the<00:04:33.380> key<00:04:33.710> of<00:04:33.830> C<00:04:34.160> so<00:04:35.000> we've

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
relative minor to the key of C so we've

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:53.230 
relative minor to the key of C so we've
got<00:04:50.470> last<00:04:51.470> but<00:04:52.010> certainly<00:04:52.040> not<00:04:52.520> least<00:04:52.729> is

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
got last but certainly not least is

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.520 
got last but certainly not least is
Locrian<00:04:54.050> that's<00:04:54.620> be<00:04:55.310> and<00:04:55.580> that's<00:04:56.540> mode<00:04:56.900> number

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
Locrian that's be and that's mode number

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.580 
Locrian that's be and that's mode number
seven<00:04:57.950> one<00:04:58.310> two<00:04:58.610> three<00:04:58.880> four<00:04:59.120> five<00:04:59.450> six<00:04:59.870> seven

major now all other scales would act the

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.600 
major now all other scales would act the
same<00:05:26.670> way<00:05:26.930> for<00:05:27.930> example<00:05:27.960> in<00:05:28.560> the<00:05:29.100> key<00:05:29.280> of<00:05:29.310> G
