suppose<00:00:04.750> farmers<00:00:05.109> have<00:00:05.200> become<00:00:05.439> aware<00:00:05.710> of<00:00:05.770> the

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:06.009 
suppose farmers have become aware of the

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.299 
suppose farmers have become aware of the
scheme<00:00:07.080> over<00:00:08.080> the<00:00:08.170> last<00:00:08.379> over<00:00:08.830> the<00:00:08.920> last<00:00:09.100> few

scheme over the last over the last few

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:10.590 
scheme over the last over the last few
weeks<00:00:09.549> but<00:00:09.730> certainly<00:00:10.090> there's<00:00:10.299> been<00:00:10.389> a<00:00:10.420> lot

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:10.600 
weeks but certainly there's been a lot

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.209 
weeks but certainly there's been a lot
of<00:00:10.629> work<00:00:11.080> going<00:00:11.320> on<00:00:11.379> in<00:00:11.559> the<00:00:11.619> background<00:00:11.830> a<00:00:12.100> lot

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:12.219 
of work going on in the background a lot

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:13.830 
of work going on in the background a lot
of<00:00:12.309> negotiations<00:00:12.969> of<00:00:13.090> brothels<00:00:13.240> and<00:00:13.539> whatnot

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
of negotiations of brothels and whatnot

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.080 
of negotiations of brothels and whatnot
maybe<00:00:14.500> if<00:00:14.770> I<00:00:14.860> could<00:00:14.980> just<00:00:15.010> ask<00:00:15.279> you<00:00:15.430> what's<00:00:15.969> the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
maybe if I could just ask you what's the

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.200 
maybe if I could just ask you what's the
objectives<00:00:16.720> of<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:18.130> scheme<00:00:18.429> and<00:00:18.670> what

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
objectives of this scheme and what

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.419 
objectives of this scheme and what
changes<00:00:19.449> are<00:00:19.750> we<00:00:19.900> like<00:00:20.050> to<00:00:20.170> see<00:00:20.500> and<00:00:20.830> on<00:00:21.160> how

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:21.429 
changes are we like to see and on how

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:23.730 
changes are we like to see and on how
and<00:00:21.789> what<00:00:22.359> would<00:00:22.839> that<00:00:23.019> is<00:00:23.230> that<00:00:23.380> is<00:00:23.529> designed

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
and what would that is that is designed

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.589 
and what would that is that is designed
in<00:00:24.070> such<00:00:24.099> a<00:00:24.249> way<00:00:24.369> to<00:00:24.519> deliver<00:00:24.939> those<00:00:25.179> changes

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
in such a way to deliver those changes

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.029 
in such a way to deliver those changes
and<00:00:25.630> what<00:00:26.169> I<00:00:26.199> suppose<00:00:26.439> what<00:00:26.589> are<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:26.890> changes

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
and what I suppose what are the changes

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.159 
and what I suppose what are the changes
well<00:00:27.820> Justin<00:00:28.210> it's<00:00:28.419> about<00:00:28.660> the<00:00:28.779> development

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
well Justin it's about the development

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.079 
well Justin it's about the development
of<00:00:29.199> the<00:00:29.320> major<00:00:29.499> sector<00:00:29.829> and<00:00:30.009> that's<00:00:30.640> something

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:31.089 
of the major sector and that's something

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:32.490 
of the major sector and that's something
everyone<00:00:31.570> around<00:00:31.779> the<00:00:31.900> table<00:00:31.960> here<00:00:32.349> has<00:00:32.470> a

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
everyone around the table here has a

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.229 
everyone around the table here has a
common<00:00:32.829> interest<00:00:32.950> in<00:00:33.250> and<00:00:33.640> it's<00:00:34.149> about

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
common interest in and it's about

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.420 
common interest in and it's about
positioning<00:00:34.899> the<00:00:35.230> software<00:00:35.590> heard<00:00:35.770> as<00:00:36.010> part

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
positioning the software heard as part

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.299 
positioning the software heard as part
of<00:00:36.550> this<00:00:36.719> dynamic<00:00:37.890> from<00:00:38.890> a<00:00:38.980> public<00:00:39.280> policy

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
of this dynamic from a public policy

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.910 
of this dynamic from a public policy
perspective<00:00:40.289> the<00:00:41.289> department<00:00:41.829> of<00:00:41.859> the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
perspective the department of the

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.200 
perspective the department of the
minister<00:00:42.280> thinks<00:00:42.579> that<00:00:42.670> the<00:00:42.760> software<00:00:42.910> herd

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
minister thinks that the software herd

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.330 
minister thinks that the software herd
has<00:00:43.390> a<00:00:43.420> very<00:00:43.660> important<00:00:44.079> part<00:00:44.260> to<00:00:44.559> play<00:00:44.590> in<00:00:45.039> the

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
has a very important part to play in the

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.959 
has a very important part to play in the
production<00:00:45.699> of<00:00:45.910> quality<00:00:46.539> Irish<00:00:46.780> beef<00:00:47.019> and<00:00:47.969> we

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
production of quality Irish beef and we

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.720 
production of quality Irish beef and we
know<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:50.260> there<00:00:50.440> are<00:00:50.469> significant<00:00:51.399> problems

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
know that there are significant problems

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.750 
know that there are significant problems
with<00:00:51.879> poor<00:00:52.210> profitability<00:00:52.660> in<00:00:53.019> the<00:00:53.199> beef<00:00:53.350> herd

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
with poor profitability in the beef herd

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.720 
with poor profitability in the beef herd
we<00:00:54.760> know<00:00:54.969> that<00:00:55.449> a<00:00:55.719> that<00:00:56.530> is<00:00:56.739> at<00:00:57.100> least<00:00:57.340> in<00:00:57.550> part

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
we know that a that is at least in part

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.639 
we know that a that is at least in part
attributable<00:00:58.000> for<00:00:58.750> genetics<00:00:59.260> on<00:00:59.440> the

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
attributable for genetics on the

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.610 
attributable for genetics on the
maternal<00:01:00.100> side<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.780> this<00:01:02.170> game<00:01:02.379> is<00:01:02.530> about

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
maternal side and this game is about

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.079 
maternal side and this game is about
addressing<00:01:02.949> those<00:01:03.309> weaknesses<00:01:03.609> and

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
addressing those weaknesses and

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.120 
addressing those weaknesses and
ultimately<00:01:04.510> about<00:01:04.870> improving<00:01:05.440> farmer

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
ultimately about improving farmer

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.030 
ultimately about improving farmer
profitability<00:01:06.990> now<00:01:07.990> of<00:01:08.320> course<00:01:08.740> there<00:01:08.950> are

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
profitability now of course there are

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.130 
profitability now of course there are
other<00:01:09.160> impacts<00:01:09.610> also<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.390> because<00:01:10.960> by

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
other impacts also and because by

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.290 
other impacts also and because by
improving<00:01:11.650> efficiency<00:01:12.430> and<00:01:12.610> profitability

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
improving efficiency and profitability

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.170 
improving efficiency and profitability
on<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:14.500> beef<00:01:14.680> herd<00:01:14.920> we<00:01:15.190> also<00:01:15.370> improve<00:01:15.970> the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
on the beef herd we also improve the

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.780 
on the beef herd we also improve the
greenhouse<00:01:16.510> gas<00:01:16.750> intensity<00:01:17.500> of<00:01:17.650> the<00:01:18.610> beef

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
greenhouse gas intensity of the beef

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.690 
greenhouse gas intensity of the beef
sector<00:01:19.750> and<00:01:20.140> that's<00:01:20.860> very<00:01:21.100> important<00:01:21.520> from<00:01:21.580> a

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
sector and that's very important from a

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.970 
sector and that's very important from a
number<00:01:21.940> of<00:01:21.970> perspectives<00:01:22.500> firstly<00:01:23.500> in<00:01:23.680> the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
number of perspectives firstly in the

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.490 
number of perspectives firstly in the
context<00:01:24.490> of<00:01:24.610> international<00:01:25.600> discussions<00:01:26.260> on

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
the future of livestock industries it's

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.360 
the future of livestock industries it's
very<00:01:28.960> important<00:01:29.470> to<00:01:29.500> position<00:01:29.890> Ireland's

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
very important to position Ireland's

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.440 
very important to position Ireland's
already<00:01:30.910> strong<00:01:32.820> environmental<00:01:33.820> credentials

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
already strong environmental credentials

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.840 
already strong environmental credentials
but<00:01:34.840> also<00:01:35.140> to<00:01:35.380> improve<00:01:36.130> on<00:01:36.400> those<00:01:36.550> in<00:01:36.760> the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
but also to improve on those in the

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.190 
but also to improve on those in the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.440 
climate change and secondly of course
the<00:01:41.740> fact<00:01:42.250> that<00:01:42.370> Ireland<00:01:42.820> has<00:01:42.850> a<00:01:43.030> very

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
the fact that Ireland has a very

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.800 
the fact that Ireland has a very
environmentally<00:01:44.290> sustainable<00:01:45.420> industry<00:01:46.420> and

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
environmentally sustainable industry and

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.750 
environmentally sustainable industry and
that<00:01:46.840> we<00:01:47.290> are<00:01:47.560> taking<00:01:48.070> strides<00:01:48.370> from<00:01:48.550> proved

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
that we are taking strides from proved

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.120 
that we are taking strides from proved
is<00:01:49.060> a<00:01:49.120> key<00:01:49.780> part<00:01:49.810> of<00:01:50.170> our<00:01:50.290> marketing<00:01:50.710> strategy

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
is a key part of our marketing strategy

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.040 
is a key part of our marketing strategy
and<00:01:51.250> international<00:01:51.700> markets<00:01:52.030> so<00:01:52.660> for<00:01:52.900> all<00:01:53.020> of

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
and international markets so for all of

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.500 
and international markets so for all of
these<00:01:53.230> reasons<00:01:53.350> this<00:01:54.340> scheme<00:01:54.550> is<00:01:54.790> a<00:01:55.180> very

these reasons this scheme is a very
important<00:01:55.960> step<00:01:56.790> it's<00:01:57.790> about<00:01:58.080> serious

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
important step it's about serious

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.710 
important step it's about serious
software<00:01:59.590> farmers<00:02:00.030> making<00:02:01.030> commitments<00:02:01.270> to

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
software farmers making commitments to

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.260 
software farmers making commitments to
improve<00:02:02.080> their<00:02:02.320> own<00:02:02.410> efficiency<00:02:02.950> but<00:02:03.550> also<00:02:03.670> to

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
improve their own efficiency but also to

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.490 
improve their own efficiency but also to
improve<00:02:04.510> the<00:02:04.750> environmental<00:02:05.200> sustainability

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
improve the environmental sustainability

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.710 
improve the environmental sustainability
of<00:02:06.010> their<00:02:06.100> herd<00:02:06.250> so<00:02:06.430> really<00:02:06.700> it's<00:02:06.820> twofold<00:02:07.210> to

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
of their herd so really it's twofold to

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.599 
of their herd so really it's twofold to
push<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.170> profitability<00:02:08.619> by<00:02:08.979> producing<00:02:09.340> more

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:09.609 
push the profitability by producing more

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.059 
push the profitability by producing more
and<00:02:09.849> reducing<00:02:10.599> the<00:02:10.810> carbon<00:02:11.109> footprint<00:02:11.680> by

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
and reducing the carbon footprint by

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.069 
and reducing the carbon footprint by
producing<00:02:12.400> more<00:02:12.609> from<00:02:12.879> laughs<00:02:13.090> exactly<00:02:13.959> and

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.079 
producing more from laughs exactly and

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:15.809 
producing more from laughs exactly and
it<00:02:14.319> really<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.799> addresses

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
it really it addresses

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.119 
it really it addresses
and<00:02:15.969> weaknesses<00:02:16.599> that<00:02:16.870> are<00:02:17.170> widely<00:02:17.499> accepted

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
and weaknesses that are widely accepted

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.319

and<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.459> course<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.819> don't<00:02:18.939> have<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.209> learn

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
and of course you don't have to learn

the department's word for that because
we<00:02:20.920> have<00:02:21.069> experts<00:02:21.549> like<00:02:21.819> Andrew<00:02:22.239> crow<00:02:22.450> me

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:29.499 
extensively on this maternal index also

extensively on this maternal index also
just<00:02:29.829> and<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:30.239> there<00:02:31.239> is<00:02:31.359> a<00:02:31.389> difficulty<00:02:32.019> there

just and so there is a difficulty there

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.920 
just and so there is a difficulty there
and<00:02:32.409> this<00:02:32.560> scheme<00:02:32.889> is<00:02:33.269> intended<00:02:34.269> to<00:02:34.299> improve

and this scheme is intended to improve

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.349
