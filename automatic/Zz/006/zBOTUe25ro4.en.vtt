00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
oh that's a great question

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.010

dogs<00:02:41.520> actually<00:02:41.760> have<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:42.480> their<00:02:42.660> gut<00:02:42.840> bacteria

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
dogs actually have in their gut bacteria

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.780 
dogs actually have in their gut bacteria
it's<00:02:43.440> very<00:02:43.620> different<00:02:43.890> than<00:02:44.160> humans<00:02:44.489> because

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
it's very different than humans because

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.130 
it's very different than humans because
they<00:02:44.940> eat<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.120> lot<00:02:45.209> of<00:02:45.360> dead<00:02:45.600> things<00:02:45.780> in<00:02:46.020> the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
they eat a lot of dead things in the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.050 
they eat a lot of dead things in the
wild<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:46.920> they've<00:02:47.040> got<00:02:47.190> much<00:02:47.400> stronger<00:02:47.760> gut

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
wild so they've got much stronger gut

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.699 
wild so they've got much stronger gut
bacteria<00:02:48.270> than<00:02:48.780> humans<00:02:49.140> do<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.470> they've<00:02:49.560> got

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
bacteria than humans do and they've got

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.070 
bacteria than humans do and they've got
stronger<00:02:50.220> stomach<00:02:50.550> acids<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.150> their<00:02:51.600> systems

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
stronger stomach acids so their systems

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.630 
stronger stomach acids so their systems
will<00:02:52.260> kill<00:02:52.470> things<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:52.920> our<00:02:53.010> systems<00:02:53.370> can't

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
will kill things that our systems can't

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.190 
will kill things that our systems can't
they<00:02:53.760> can<00:02:53.910> totally<00:02:54.090> handle<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.660> in<00:02:54.780> front<00:02:55.080> you

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
they can totally handle it in front you

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.449 
they can totally handle it in front you
know<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.560> reason<00:02:55.800> we<00:02:55.890> want<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.190> put<00:02:56.340> the

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
know and the reason we want to put the

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.210 
know and the reason we want to put the
egg<00:02:56.610> in<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.360> shampoo<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:58.050> why<00:02:58.260> because<00:02:59.070> it's

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
egg in the shampoo is why because it's

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.160
