00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
like mine where I can't do the tension

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.130 
like mine where I can't do the tension
and<00:00:56.010> hold<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.850> work<00:00:57.030> with<00:00:57.449> my<00:00:57.660> left<00:00:57.870> hand<00:00:59.090> so

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
and hold the work with my left hand so

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.929 
and hold the work with my left hand so
you<00:01:01.140> start<00:01:01.440> off<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:03.830> the<00:01:04.830> thimble<00:01:05.070> should<00:01:05.640> fit

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
you start off and the thimble should fit

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.020 
you start off and the thimble should fit
on<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:07.320> pinky<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.979> may<00:01:08.220> not<00:01:08.430> go<00:01:08.580> all<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.820> way

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
on the pinky and may not go all the way

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.620 
on the pinky and may not go all the way
down<00:01:09.420> your<00:01:09.689> pinky<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.200> does<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.619> my<00:01:10.799> pinky<00:01:11.630> but

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
down your pinky it does on my pinky but

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.539 
down your pinky it does on my pinky but
I<00:01:12.659> found<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.380> works<00:01:13.500> best<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> pinky

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
I found it works best on the pinky

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.030 
I found it works best on the pinky
because<00:01:14.729> that's<00:01:15.380> closest<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.409> what<00:01:16.860> is

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
because that's closest to what is

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.850 
because that's closest to what is
normally<00:01:17.460> done<00:01:18.200> when<00:01:19.200> you're<00:01:19.320> guiding<00:01:19.710> your

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
your working yarn you're gonna thread it

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.280 
your working yarn you're gonna thread it
through<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.729> back<00:01:26.939> loop<00:01:29.210> up<00:01:30.210> through<00:01:31.170> the

through the back loop up through the
back<00:01:31.439> loop<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.829> then<00:01:32.040> down<00:01:32.750> through<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
back loop and then down through the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.679 
back loop and then down through the
front<00:01:34.920> loop<00:01:37.790> taking<00:01:38.790> care<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.060> make<00:01:39.329> sure<00:01:39.509> you

you<00:03:11.500> can<00:03:11.680> see<00:03:11.919> the<00:03:12.099> tension<00:03:12.569> can<00:03:13.569> use<00:03:14.879> as<00:03:15.879> you

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
you can see the tension can use as you

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.909 
you can see the tension can use as you
can<00:03:16.120> see<00:03:16.269> that<00:03:16.540> I<00:03:16.750> am<00:03:17.260> getting<00:03:17.409> the<00:03:17.560> tension

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:17.919 
can see that I am getting the tension

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:26.750 
can see that I am getting the tension
tighter<00:03:18.540> by<00:03:19.540> creating<00:03:20.019> more<00:03:20.169> friction

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.709 

and<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.150> little<00:03:27.450> bit<00:03:27.540> too<00:03:27.750> tight<00:03:27.989> oh<00:03:28.050> yes

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:33.719 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:36.929 

and<00:03:34.719> you<00:03:34.870> can<00:03:35.079> make<00:03:35.230> it<00:03:35.349> looser<00:03:35.799> by<00:03:36.219> creating

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:36.939 
and you can make it looser by creating

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.780 
and you can make it looser by creating
less<00:03:37.209> tension<00:03:38.040> by<00:03:39.040> pulling<00:03:39.400> some<00:03:39.609> of<00:03:39.730> the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
less tension by pulling some of the

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.179 
less tension by pulling some of the
slack<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:42.840> wanted<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:43.959> explain<00:03:44.680> one<00:03:44.920> other

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:45.189 
slack I wanted to explain one other

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:46.530 
slack I wanted to explain one other
thing

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
thing

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.390 
thing
the<00:03:46.930> Norwegian<00:03:47.439> thimble<00:03:47.799> is<00:03:47.920> really<00:03:48.189> neat

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
the Norwegian thimble is really neat

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.929 
the Norwegian thimble is really neat
because<00:03:48.640> of<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.629> way<00:03:49.780> it's<00:03:49.959> open<00:03:50.379> spiral<00:03:51.069> on

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:51.939 
because of the way it's open spiral on

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:55.199 
because of the way it's open spiral on
both<00:03:52.299> sides<00:03:53.219> if<00:03:54.219> you<00:03:54.280> wanted<00:03:54.760> to<00:03:54.939> switch

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
both sides if you wanted to switch

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.569 
both sides if you wanted to switch
projects<00:03:55.989> you<00:03:56.139> don't<00:03:56.409> have<00:03:56.709> to<00:03:56.980> keep<00:03:57.189> the

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
projects you don't have to keep the

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.789 
projects you don't have to keep the
thimble<00:03:57.819> on<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:59.049> project<00:03:59.530> that<00:03:59.620> you're

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
thimble on the project that you're

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:06.270 
thimble on the project that you're
working<00:03:59.829> on<00:04:00.450> you<00:04:01.450> simply<00:04:03.209> work<00:04:04.209> it<00:04:04.359> through<00:04:05.280> on

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
working on you simply work it through on

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.699 
working on you simply work it through on
both<00:04:06.549> sides<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:08.680> then<00:04:09.669> you<00:04:10.389> can<00:04:10.569> take<00:04:10.780> the

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
both sides and then you can take the

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.500 
both sides and then you can take the
thimble<00:04:11.950> off<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.639> use<00:04:12.819> on<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.180> different

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
thimble off to use on a different

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.300 
thimble off to use on a different
project<00:04:15.959> this<00:04:16.959> allows<00:04:17.320> you<00:04:17.560> to<00:04:17.680> use<00:04:17.889> the<00:04:18.099> same

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
project this allows you to use the same

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:25.950 
project this allows you to use the same
symbol<00:04:19.019> for<00:04:20.099> multiple<00:04:21.990> projects<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:25.690> also

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
symbol for multiple projects it also

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:33.360 
symbol for multiple projects it also
allows<00:04:26.440> you<00:04:26.889> to<00:04:27.310> get<00:04:28.139> the<00:04:30.180> yarn<00:04:31.180> back<00:04:31.780> in<00:04:32.370> if

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
allows you to get the yarn back in if

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.050 
allows you to get the yarn back in if
you<00:04:34.060> were<00:04:34.180> to<00:04:34.360> accidentally<00:04:34.930> get<00:04:35.259> it<00:04:35.410> off<00:04:36.060> in

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
you were to accidentally get it off in

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:53.330 
you were to accidentally get it off in
the<00:04:37.330> middle<00:04:37.539> of<00:04:37.720> a<00:04:37.750> project

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.090 

takes<00:04:53.880> a<00:04:54.030> little<00:04:54.150> bit<00:04:54.270> of<00:04:54.650> getting<00:04:55.650> it<00:04:55.770> to<00:04:55.920> get

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
takes a little bit of getting it to get

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.240 
takes a little bit of getting it to get
it<00:04:57.140> the<00:04:58.140> direction<00:04:58.320> you<00:04:58.800> want<00:05:00.980> but<00:05:01.980> you<00:05:02.130> get

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
it the direction you want but you get

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.530 
it the direction you want but you get
the<00:05:02.370> basic<00:05:02.490> idea<00:05:03.470> thank<00:05:04.470> you
