00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.167
 "Doctors' ignorance of nutrition" 

00:00:03.167 --> 00:00:10.467
 The World Health Organization believes that the intake of insufficient vegetables and fruits causes millions of deaths each year. 

00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:13.000
 Almost as much as the impact of smoking. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.975
 If we care about ourselves and our family, donâ€™t smoke, 

00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:24.409
 We should work harder on eating vegetables and fruits. 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:28.175
 We should regard eating vegetables and fruits as a matter of life and death. 

00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:30.042
 Because in some ways, this is indeed the case. 

00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:36.583
 So why not many people have heard of the advice of eating 9 servings instead of 5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day? 

00:00:36.583 --> 00:00:38.583
 The US government spends $10 million a year on healthy eating education. 

00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:48.125
 And the candy industry spends at least twice as much money as it is to introduce new candy. 

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:55.058
 But why do most doctors not pass this information? 

00:00:55.058 --> 00:00:59.992
 Because your doctor probably never learned this. 

00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:05.899
 Less than a quarter of medical schools have a course on nutrition. 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:13.433
 Less than 6% of doctors have had any formal nutrition training. 

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:21.375
 Your doctor may only have 3 hours of nutrition training compared to thousands of hours spent on clinical science. 

00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:29.941
 There has been such a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition to compare doctors and patients. 

00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:36.250
 Knowledge about basic nutrition - simple judgment questions. 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.183
 Guess who won? 

00:01:38.183 --> 00:01:44.983
 It is a patient! As for nutrition, ordinary people know more than doctors. 

00:01:44.983 --> 00:01:50.120
 But we will still consult the doctor about nutrition advice. 

00:01:50.124 --> 00:01:55.660
 Doctors recommend that patients eat it may hurt them. 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:04.500
 Not long ago, doctors recommended that pregnant women use smoking to help with pregnancy reactions. 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:13.930
 Until doctors have more nutrition training, their advice on diet may be like a doctor-assisted suicide. 

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:21.740
 There is a doctor that everyone believes. Probably the most famous doctor in history. 

00:02:21.742 --> 00:02:24.510
 Dr. Benjamin Spock. 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.000
 Always a pioneer in social issues. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.550
 In the final version of his best-selling American book (because the Bible is second) 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:42.720
 He suggested that all children should eat a diet without meat and dairy products to prevent cancer.
