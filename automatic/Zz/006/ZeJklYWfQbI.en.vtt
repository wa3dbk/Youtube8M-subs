don't sort of move left and right it's a

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.500 
don't sort of move left and right it's a
bit<00:04:02.760> confusing<00:04:03.050> and<00:04:04.050> it<00:04:04.230> makes<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.800> enemies

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
bit confusing and it makes the enemies

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.120 
bit confusing and it makes the enemies
or<00:04:06.510> it<00:04:06.900> makes<00:04:07.080> it<00:04:07.230> easier<00:04:07.560> for<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.770> enemies<00:04:08.040> to

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
or it makes it easier for the enemies to

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.500 
or it makes it easier for the enemies to
hit<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:08.370> once<00:04:08.520> you<00:04:08.640> see<00:04:08.790> yellow<00:04:09.150> up<00:04:09.270> here

hit you once you see yellow up here
that's<00:04:09.720> pretty<00:04:10.110> much<00:04:10.230> it<00:04:12.740> wait<00:04:13.740> for<00:04:13.920> the

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
that's pretty much it wait for the

platform to extend before you drop just

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.710 
platform to extend before you drop just
insane

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720

fire that one might take a bit of
experimentation<00:04:46.470> for<00:04:46.890> you<00:04:47.010> but<00:04:47.100> once<00:04:47.250> you<00:04:47.340> get
