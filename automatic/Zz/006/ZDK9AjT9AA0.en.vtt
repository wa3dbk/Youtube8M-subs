I'm going to go through the three main
common<00:00:32.770> ones<00:00:33.010> one<00:00:33.460> being<00:00:33.730> rail<00:00:34.059> one<00:00:34.930> being

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
common ones one being rail one being

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.930 
common ones one being rail one being
game<00:00:35.500> helper<00:00:35.890> and<00:00:36.070> the<00:00:36.280> other<00:00:36.399> being<00:00:36.640> long

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
game helper and the other being long

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.210 
game helper and the other being long
long<00:00:37.360> a<00:00:37.390> pushed<00:00:37.840> right<00:00:38.620> now<00:00:38.800> I'm<00:00:38.890> going<00:00:39.040> to<00:00:39.100> go

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
ahead and take you in games so I can

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.540 
ahead and take you in games so I can
explain<00:00:40.989> some<00:00:41.290> of<00:00:41.320> them<00:00:41.559> with<00:00:41.829> my<00:00:42.010> g<00:00:42.340> series

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
explain some of them with my g series

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.050 
explain some of them with my g series
notebook<00:00:43.180> and<00:00:43.950> obviously<00:00:44.950> right<00:00:45.190> now<00:00:45.250> rail<00:00:45.910> is

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.060 
notebook and obviously right now rail is

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.570 
notebook and obviously right now rail is
the<00:00:46.210> most<00:00:46.420> diverse<00:00:46.660> of<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.440> two<00:00:47.710> of<00:00:48.220> the<00:00:48.340> three

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.580 
the most diverse of the two of the three

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.640 
the most diverse of the two of the three
positions<00:00:49.030> that<00:00:49.150> i<00:00:49.240> mentioned<00:00:49.720> the<00:00:50.320> reason

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
positions that i mentioned the reason

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.810 
positions that i mentioned the reason
why<00:00:50.800> is<00:00:50.860> because<00:00:51.010> there's<00:00:51.520> many<00:00:51.730> different

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
why is because there's many different

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.400 
why is because there's many different
angles<00:00:52.180> that<00:00:52.450> you<00:00:52.570> can<00:00:52.720> hold<00:00:52.840> such<00:00:53.110> as<00:00:53.260> this

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
angles that you can hold such as this

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.660 
angles that you can hold such as this
one<00:00:53.650> on<00:00:53.890> top<00:00:54.730> of<00:00:54.910> this<00:00:55.000> actual<00:00:55.420> rail<00:00:55.750> and<00:00:56.670> then

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
one on top of this actual rail and then

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.480 
one on top of this actual rail and then
right<00:00:57.880> here<00:00:57.910> on<00:00:58.150> top<00:00:58.180> of<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:58.570> actual<00:00:58.900> box<00:00:59.490> i'm

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.490 
right here on top of the actual box i'm

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.680 
right here on top of the actual box i'm
going<00:01:00.640> to<00:01:00.700> go<00:01:00.880> ahead<00:01:00.910> and<00:01:01.150> explain<00:01:01.390> all<00:01:01.660> of

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
going to go ahead and explain all of

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.630 
going to go ahead and explain all of
them<00:01:01.960> right<00:01:02.140> now<00:01:02.320> but<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:02.890> reason<00:01:03.040> why<00:01:03.340> I<00:01:03.370> like

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
them right now but the reason why I like

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.280 
them right now but the reason why I like
this<00:01:03.820> one<00:01:03.880> a<00:01:04.059> lot<00:01:04.150> is<00:01:04.449> because<00:01:04.629> it's<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.079> least

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
this one a lot is because it's the least

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.950 
this one a lot is because it's the least
common<00:01:05.850> use<00:01:06.850> out<00:01:07.119> of<00:01:07.240> all<00:01:07.420> of<00:01:07.450> them<00:01:07.630> because

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
common use out of all of them because

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.069 
common use out of all of them because
you're<00:01:08.500> more<00:01:08.740> exposed<00:01:09.189> in<00:01:09.460> this<00:01:10.210> one<00:01:10.479> compared

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079 
you're more exposed in this one compared

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.469 
you're more exposed in this one compared
to<00:01:11.200> all<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.380> other<00:01:11.530> ones<00:01:11.920> and<00:01:12.250> obviously<00:01:13.210> it's

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
to all the other ones and obviously it's

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.570 
to all the other ones and obviously it's
nice<00:01:13.689> to<00:01:13.899> bring<00:01:14.110> this<00:01:14.290> angle<00:01:14.710> back<00:01:14.860> because<00:01:15.340> at

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
nice to bring this angle back because at

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.310 
nice to bring this angle back because at
the<00:01:15.670> end<00:01:15.700> of<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:15.970> day<00:01:16.030> when<00:01:16.240> T's<00:01:16.750> piqued<00:01:17.170> the

throw<00:01:48.100> some<00:01:48.250> flash<00:01:48.549> bangs<00:01:48.880> up<00:01:49.150> in<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.390> sky<00:01:49.630> to

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
throw some flash bangs up in the sky to

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.410 
throw some flash bangs up in the sky to
potentially<00:01:50.710> take<00:01:50.890> another<00:01:51.190> pic<00:01:51.490> but<00:01:52.240> now

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
potentially take another pic but now

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.170 
potentially take another pic but now
this<00:01:53.409> is<00:01:53.619> easily<00:01:53.920> my<00:01:54.189> favorite<00:01:54.700> spot<00:01:54.939> and<00:01:55.119> the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
this is easily my favorite spot and the

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.730 
this is easily my favorite spot and the
reason<00:01:55.479> why<00:01:55.630> it's<00:01:55.780> my<00:01:55.900> favorite<00:01:55.930> spot<00:01:56.590> is

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
reason why it's my favorite spot is

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.950 
reason why it's my favorite spot is
because<00:01:57.100> if<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:58.060> see<00:01:58.240> teams<00:01:58.479> starting<00:01:58.900> to

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
because if you see teams starting to

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.810 
because if you see teams starting to
throw<00:01:59.170> flash<00:01:59.470> bangs<00:01:59.770> out<00:01:59.979> from<00:02:00.159> catwalk<00:02:00.610> and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
throw flash bangs out from catwalk and

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.370 
throw flash bangs out from catwalk and
even<00:02:01.119> sometimes<00:02:01.360> they<00:02:01.720> like<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:01.869> throw<00:02:01.990> sky

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
even sometimes they like to throw sky

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.260 
even sometimes they like to throw sky
flashes<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:03.010> just<00:02:03.159> blow<00:02:03.430> up<00:02:03.610> in<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:04.030> middle<00:02:04.210> of

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
flashes it just blow up in the middle of

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.390 
flashes it just blow up in the middle of
the<00:02:04.330> sky<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:04.840> fall<00:02:05.049> down<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:06.070> reason<00:02:06.310> why

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
the sky and fall down the reason why

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.830 
the sky and fall down the reason why
this<00:02:06.430> spot<00:02:06.759> is<00:02:06.850> so<00:02:07.030> effective<00:02:07.299> because<00:02:07.479> in

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
this spot is so effective because in

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.179 
this spot is so effective because in
order<00:02:07.960> for<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.259> avoid<00:02:08.500> every<00:02:08.860> single

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:09.189 
order for you to avoid every single

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:10.830 
order for you to avoid every single
flash<00:02:09.399> bang<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:10.239> only<00:02:10.450> thing<00:02:10.599> that<00:02:10.720> you<00:02:10.780> have

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
flash bang the only thing that you have

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.839 
flash bang the only thing that you have
to<00:02:10.959> do<00:02:11.140> is<00:02:11.230> hold<00:02:11.409> duck<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:12.400> reason<00:02:12.670> why<00:02:12.819> this

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
to do is hold duck the reason why this

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.280 
to do is hold duck the reason why this
is<00:02:13.060> effective<00:02:13.480> is<00:02:13.569> because<00:02:13.599> when<00:02:14.019> you<00:02:14.140> hold

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
is effective is because when you hold

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.110 
is effective is because when you hold
duck<00:02:14.560> this<00:02:15.489> wall<00:02:15.819> covers<00:02:16.360> your<00:02:16.540> whole<00:02:16.750> entire

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
duck this wall covers your whole entire

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.360 
duck this wall covers your whole entire
sky<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.480> you're<00:02:20.290> basically<00:02:20.590> your<00:02:20.859> upper<00:02:21.129> view

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
sky and you're basically your upper view

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.360 
sky and you're basically your upper view
this<00:02:21.819> will<00:02:22.060> allow<00:02:22.269> you<00:02:22.329> to<00:02:22.569> get<00:02:22.749> half

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
this will allow you to get half

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.330 
this will allow you to get half
at<00:02:23.760> max<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.510> will<00:02:25.110> allow<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.620> basically

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
at max and will allow you to basically

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.979 
at max and will allow you to basically
the<00:02:26.760> way<00:02:26.879> you<00:02:26.940> want<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.299> have<00:02:27.420> this<00:02:27.569> done<00:02:27.780> is

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
the way you want to have this done is

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.530 
the way you want to have this done is
maybe<00:02:28.680> take<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.040> shot<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.700> voice<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.330> flash

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
maybe take a shot of voice and flash

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.570 
maybe take a shot of voice and flash
bangs<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.019> pop<00:02:31.200> right<00:02:31.440> back<00:02:31.470> up<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:32.400> don't

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
bangs and pop right back up you don't

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.979 
bangs and pop right back up you don't
want<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.849> sit<00:02:33.030> there<00:02:33.060> for<00:02:33.390> too<00:02:33.540> long<00:02:33.720> because

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
want to sit there for too long because

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.259 
want to sit there for too long because
at<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.830> end<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.129> day<00:02:35.250> if<00:02:35.400> they<00:02:35.610> jump<00:02:36.030> and

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
at the end of the day if they jump and

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.210 
at the end of the day if they jump and
peak<00:02:36.569> they<00:02:36.840> can<00:02:36.989> potentially<00:02:37.290> see<00:02:37.799> your<00:02:37.830> head

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
peak they can potentially see your head

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.920 
peak they can potentially see your head
so<00:02:38.819> you<00:02:38.849> don't<00:02:39.150> want<00:02:39.299> to<00:02:39.390> be<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> sitting<00:02:39.900> duck

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
so you don't want to be a sitting duck

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.050 
so you don't want to be a sitting duck
here<00:02:40.319> basically<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:41.340> want<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.610> try<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:41.940> take

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
here basically you want to try and take

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.670 
here basically you want to try and take
a<00:02:42.120> shot<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.599> if<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.810> feel<00:02:42.989> like<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:43.290> can<00:02:43.440> hide

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
a shot and if you feel like you can hide

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.280 
a shot and if you feel like you can hide
then<00:02:44.310> do<00:02:44.549> that<00:02:44.579> but<00:02:45.060> if<00:02:45.150> not<00:02:45.329> you<00:02:45.659> need<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.110> take

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
then do that but if not you need to take

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.140 
then do that but if not you need to take
a<00:02:46.319> shot<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.799> run<00:02:47.010> away<00:02:47.159> again<00:02:47.310> just<00:02:47.940> like<00:02:48.090> the

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
a shot and run away again just like the

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.080 
a shot and run away again just like the
other<00:02:48.420> spots<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.549> obviously<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:50.730> main<00:02:50.879> thing

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
other spots and obviously the main thing

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.670 
other spots and obviously the main thing
that<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.329> want<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.569> do<00:02:51.750> when<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.230> take<00:02:52.440> one

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
that you want to do when you take one

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.649 
that you want to do when you take one
shot<00:02:52.950> or<00:02:53.129> they're<00:02:53.400> running<00:02:53.670> at<00:02:53.849> you<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.360> still

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
shot or they're running at you it still

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.720 
shot or they're running at you it still
flashes<00:02:55.170> in<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.349> sky<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.950> hope<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.609> your

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
flashes in the sky and hope that your

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.460 
flashes in the sky and hope that your
teammates<00:02:57.239> from<00:02:57.420> long<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.690> will<00:02:58.019> help<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.319> with

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
teammates from long a will help you with

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.440 
teammates from long a will help you with
some<00:02:58.650> flashes<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.310> cut<00:02:59.519> off<00:02:59.640> angles<00:03:00.060> like<00:03:00.150> the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
some flashes to cut off angles like the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.890 
some flashes to cut off angles like the
elbow<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.099> whatnot<00:03:02.099> because<00:03:02.690> if<00:03:03.690> you're

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
elbow and whatnot because if you're

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.599 
elbow and whatnot because if you're
playing<00:03:04.109> rail<00:03:04.440> you've<00:03:05.010> basically<00:03:05.190> made<00:03:05.579> a

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
playing rail you've basically made a

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.039 
playing rail you've basically made a
decision<00:03:06.000> in<00:03:06.269> your<00:03:06.390> mind<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:06.780> you're<00:03:06.930> going

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
decision in your mind that you're going

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.199 
decision in your mind that you're going
to<00:03:07.109> die<00:03:07.410> with<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.799> bomb<00:03:07.980> with<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.760> bomb<00:03:08.940> site

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
to die with the bomb with the bomb site

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.940 
to die with the bomb with the bomb site
because<00:03:09.900> there's<00:03:10.109> really<00:03:10.140> no<00:03:10.530> way<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.829> you

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
because there's really no way that you

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.890 
because there's really no way that you
can<00:03:11.099> escape<00:03:11.489> once<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.180> team<00:03:12.329> is<00:03:12.510> all<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.810> way

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
can escape once the team is all the way

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.839 
can escape once the team is all the way
up<00:03:13.079> in<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.319> elbow<00:03:13.620> there's<00:03:14.190> no<00:03:14.370> way<00:03:14.519> for<00:03:14.579> you

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
up in the elbow there's no way for you

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.910 
up in the elbow there's no way for you
to<00:03:14.879> really<00:03:15.150> run<00:03:15.480> out<00:03:15.750> long<00:03:16.079> a<00:03:16.109> without<00:03:16.620> getting

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
to really run out long a without getting

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.860 
to really run out long a without getting
killed<00:03:17.129> it's<00:03:17.730> extremely<00:03:18.209> difficult<00:03:18.359> and

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
killed it's extremely difficult and

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.149 
killed it's extremely difficult and
that's<00:03:19.409> why<00:03:19.560> I'm<00:03:19.620> going<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:19.829> go<00:03:19.920> ahead<00:03:20.040> and

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
that's why I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.680 
that's why I'm going to go ahead and
explain<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.579> you<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.760> next<00:03:20.970> spot<00:03:21.269> which<00:03:21.540> is

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
explain to you the next spot which is

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.880 
explain to you the next spot which is
something<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.019> we<00:03:22.170> like<00:03:22.349> to<00:03:22.470> call<00:03:22.650> game

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
something that we like to call game

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.860 
something that we like to call game
helper<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:24.090> reason<00:03:24.239> why<00:03:24.540> it's<00:03:24.720> called

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
helper and the reason why it's called

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.420 
helper and the reason why it's called
game<00:03:25.049> helpers<00:03:25.440> obviously<00:03:25.920> because<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.340> this

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
game helpers obviously because of this

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.150 
game helpers obviously because of this
tag<00:03:26.700> in<00:03:26.909> the<00:03:27.000> back<00:03:27.180> of<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.720> wall<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.200> you

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
tag in the back of the the wall and you

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.710 
tag in the back of the the wall and you
know<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.400> main<00:03:29.639> power<00:03:29.910> of<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.299> is<00:03:30.540> you're

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
know the main power of this is you're

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.589 
know the main power of this is you're
able<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:31.079> take<00:03:31.260> this<00:03:31.470> angle<00:03:31.980> in<00:03:32.510> you<00:03:33.510> know

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
able to take this angle in you know

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.150 
able to take this angle in you know
essentially<00:03:33.959> try<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.410> avoid<00:03:34.620> some<00:03:34.889> flash

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
essentially try and avoid some flash

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.159 
essentially try and avoid some flash
bangs<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.700> get<00:03:35.849> one<00:03:36.060> kill<00:03:36.359> but<00:03:36.959> then<00:03:37.049> you're

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
bangs and get one kill but then you're

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.650 
bangs and get one kill but then you're
easily<00:03:37.410> able<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.980> run<00:03:38.190> away<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.790> take<00:03:39.299> shots

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
easily able to run away and take shots

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.589 
easily able to run away and take shots
like<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:40.169> or<00:03:40.709> go<00:03:41.519> and<00:03:41.730> run<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.209> hide<00:03:42.329> in<00:03:42.510> the

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
like this or go and run and hide in the

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.569 
like this or go and run and hide in the
pit<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:43.349> reason<00:03:43.650> why<00:03:43.769> this<00:03:43.829> is<00:03:44.129> so<00:03:44.340> powerful

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
pit the reason why this is so powerful

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.849 
pit the reason why this is so powerful
is<00:03:45.090> because<00:03:45.450> of<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.019> fact<00:03:46.230> that<00:03:46.379> you<00:03:46.590> stay

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
is because of the fact that you stay

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.430 
is because of the fact that you stay
alive<00:03:47.190> for<00:03:47.579> the<00:03:47.700> retake<00:03:48.200> obviously<00:03:49.200> if<00:03:49.290> you

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
alive for the retake obviously if you

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.530 
alive for the retake obviously if you
get<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.620> pic<00:03:49.889> or<00:03:49.919> two<00:03:50.069> it<00:03:50.459> helps<00:03:51.000> like<00:03:51.269> crazy

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
get a pic or two it helps like crazy

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.960 
get a pic or two it helps like crazy
because<00:03:51.810> now<00:03:52.230> when<00:03:52.829> your<00:03:53.129> team<00:03:53.370> is<00:03:53.400> retaking

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
because now when your team is retaking

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.059 
because now when your team is retaking
the<00:03:54.060> bomb<00:03:54.239> site<00:03:54.510> no<00:03:55.199> one<00:03:55.410> should<00:03:55.590> really<00:03:55.919> be

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
the bomb site no one should really be

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.339 
the bomb site no one should really be
dying<00:03:56.370> since<00:03:56.699> everyone<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.239> playing<00:03:57.569> a<00:03:57.840> retake

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
dying since everyone is playing a retake

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.559 
dying since everyone is playing a retake
this<00:03:59.129> will<00:03:59.400> allow<00:03:59.609> you<00:03:59.669> to<00:03:59.790> be<00:04:00.090> able<00:04:00.209> to

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
this will allow you to be able to

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.659 
this will allow you to be able to
essentially<00:04:01.349> run<00:04:01.500> up<00:04:01.799> into<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.190> bomb<00:04:02.370> site

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
essentially run up into the bomb site

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.550 
essentially run up into the bomb site
and<00:04:02.940> they<00:04:03.269> say<00:04:03.449> if<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.660> bomb<00:04:03.840> is<00:04:04.049> planted<00:04:04.109> in<00:04:04.470> a

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
and they say if the bomb is planted in a

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.830 
and they say if the bomb is planted in a
default<00:04:05.010> position<00:04:05.489> like<00:04:05.639> this<00:04:05.669> you're<00:04:06.569> able

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
default position like this you're able

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.720 
default position like this you're able
to<00:04:06.989> let's<00:04:07.230> say<00:04:07.379> jump<00:04:07.739> over<00:04:07.980> here<00:04:08.220> and<00:04:08.430> then

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
to let's say jump over here and then

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.330 
to let's say jump over here and then
cover<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.120> really<00:04:09.569> nice<00:04:09.750> angle<00:04:10.230> while<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.160> bomb

cover a really nice angle while the bomb
is<00:04:11.549> planted<00:04:11.579> and<00:04:12.030> your<00:04:12.239> team<00:04:12.449> is<00:04:12.599> trying<00:04:12.750> to

jump<00:04:48.900> out<00:04:49.080> here<00:04:49.320> and<00:04:49.380> try<00:04:49.800> and<00:04:49.950> hold<00:04:50.130> this

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
jump out here and try and hold this

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.880 
jump out here and try and hold this
angle<00:04:50.820> a<00:04:51.000> lot<00:04:51.600> of<00:04:51.720> teams<00:04:51.930> like<00:04:52.140> to<00:04:52.290> rush<00:04:52.560> long<00:04:52.860> a

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
angle a lot of teams like to rush long a

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.890 
angle a lot of teams like to rush long a
so<00:04:53.340> you<00:04:53.400> want<00:04:53.670> to<00:04:53.760> try<00:04:53.970> and<00:04:54.120> take<00:04:54.300> a<00:04:54.330> shot<00:04:54.660> and

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
so you want to try and take a shot and

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.370 
so you want to try and take a shot and
then<00:04:55.110> run<00:04:55.380> away<00:04:55.430> but<00:04:56.430> if<00:04:57.180> a<00:04:57.630> team<00:04:57.840> doesn't<00:04:58.200> rush

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
then run away but if a team doesn't rush

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.440 
then run away but if a team doesn't rush
and<00:04:58.560> you<00:04:58.620> can<00:04:58.770> hold<00:04:58.980> this<00:04:59.130> angle<00:04:59.610> this<00:05:00.180> is<00:05:00.300> very

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
and you can hold this angle this is very

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.090 
and you can hold this angle this is very
powerful<00:05:00.780> because<00:05:01.080> once<00:05:01.590> you've<00:05:01.770> cleared

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
powerful because once you've cleared

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.730 
powerful because once you've cleared
this<00:05:02.400> your<00:05:03.270> teammates<00:05:03.780> that<00:05:04.020> maybe<00:05:04.230> had<00:05:04.440> a<00:05:04.470> bad

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
this your teammates that maybe had a bad

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.890 
this your teammates that maybe had a bad
spot<00:05:05.070> or<00:05:05.460> maybe<00:05:05.850> are<00:05:06.030> exchanging<00:05:06.540> guns<00:05:06.750> or

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
spot or maybe are exchanging guns or

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.860 
spot or maybe are exchanging guns or
something<00:05:07.290> are<00:05:07.880> really<00:05:08.880> late<00:05:09.210> in<00:05:09.390> crossing

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
something are really late in crossing

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.140 
something are really late in crossing
too<00:05:10.080> long<00:05:10.290> a<00:05:10.320> this<00:05:11.070> allows<00:05:11.370> you<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:11.760> cut<00:05:11.970> off

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
too long a this allows you to cut off

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.210 
too long a this allows you to cut off
this<00:05:12.330> angle<00:05:12.840> as<00:05:12.990> well<00:05:13.590> as<00:05:13.710> protect<00:05:14.100> your

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
this angle as well as protect your

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.680 
this angle as well as protect your
teammates<00:05:14.610> from<00:05:14.730> getting<00:05:15.030> into<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.390> position

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
teammates from getting into the position

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.720 
teammates from getting into the position
that<00:05:16.130> essentially<00:05:17.130> they<00:05:17.310> shouldn't<00:05:17.700> have

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
that essentially they shouldn't have

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.850 
that essentially they shouldn't have
been<00:05:18.060> in<00:05:18.090> because<00:05:18.660> of<00:05:18.930> you<00:05:19.140> know<00:05:19.260> that<00:05:19.530> spawns

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
been in because of you know that spawns

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.070 
been in because of you know that spawns
are<00:05:20.190> trading<00:05:21.000> guns<00:05:21.240> are<00:05:21.480> figuring<00:05:21.930> out<00:05:22.050> a

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
are trading guns are figuring out a

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.620 
are trading guns are figuring out a
money<00:05:22.350> situation<00:05:22.770> you<00:05:23.730> know<00:05:23.820> this<00:05:24.060> allows<00:05:24.390> you

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
money situation you know this allows you

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.080 
money situation you know this allows you
to<00:05:24.810> have<00:05:24.960> essentially<00:05:25.680> a<00:05:25.710> normal<00:05:26.100> round<00:05:26.340> when

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
to have essentially a normal round when

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.940 
to have essentially a normal round when
sometimes<00:05:27.930> you<00:05:28.140> would<00:05:28.290> not<00:05:28.470> have<00:05:28.680> a<00:05:28.710> normal

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
sometimes you would not have a normal

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.550 
sometimes you would not have a normal
round<00:05:29.400> and<00:05:29.700> one<00:05:30.660> of<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:30.870> main<00:05:31.050> things<00:05:31.320> that<00:05:31.410> I

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
round and one of the main things that I

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.140 
round and one of the main things that I
like<00:05:31.770> to<00:05:31.920> do<00:05:32.100> when<00:05:32.460> it<00:05:32.610> comes<00:05:32.820> to<00:05:32.940> picking

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
like to do when it comes to picking

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.780 
like to do when it comes to picking
along<00:05:33.480> a<00:05:33.510> is<00:05:33.980> jumping<00:05:34.980> here<00:05:35.190> and<00:05:35.340> taking<00:05:35.670> this

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
along a is jumping here and taking this

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.940 
along a is jumping here and taking this
angle<00:05:36.210> and<00:05:36.300> holding<00:05:36.630> it<00:05:36.720> especially<00:05:37.680> when<00:05:37.920> my

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
angle and holding it especially when my

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.220 
angle and holding it especially when my
teammates<00:05:38.580> don't<00:05:38.850> have<00:05:39.090> good<00:05:39.570> spawns<00:05:39.930> that

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
teammates don't have good spawns that

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.680 
teammates don't have good spawns that
play<00:05:40.440> a<00:05:40.470> like<00:05:41.430> I<00:05:41.550> said<00:05:41.790> earlier<00:05:41.820> it's<00:05:42.360> really

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
play a like I said earlier it's really

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.150 
play a like I said earlier it's really
good<00:05:42.870> because<00:05:42.990> you<00:05:43.320> can<00:05:43.350> help<00:05:43.650> your<00:05:43.800> teammates

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
good because you can help your teammates

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.490 
good because you can help your teammates
cross<00:05:44.520> but<00:05:45.300> then<00:05:45.450> you<00:05:45.630> can<00:05:45.780> jump<00:05:46.110> back<00:05:46.230> to<00:05:46.470> a

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
cross but then you can jump back to a

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.560 
cross but then you can jump back to a
position<00:05:46.710> like<00:05:46.980> game<00:05:47.340> helper<00:05:47.760> where<00:05:48.240> you<00:05:48.420> can

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
position like game helper where you can

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.990 
position like game helper where you can
have<00:05:48.750> two<00:05:48.780> guys<00:05:49.230> set<00:05:49.470> up<00:05:49.500> long<00:05:49.860> a<00:05:49.890> that<00:05:50.760> are<00:05:50.910> on

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
have two guys set up long a that are on

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.090 
have two guys set up long a that are on
your<00:05:51.150> team<00:05:51.420> so<00:05:51.750> when<00:05:51.870> you<00:05:51.960> take<00:05:52.140> a<00:05:52.169> shot<00:05:52.470> you

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
your team so when you take a shot you

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.310 
your team so when you take a shot you
can<00:05:53.280> run<00:05:53.460> away<00:05:53.610> and<00:05:53.880> be<00:05:53.970> basically<00:05:54.930> have<00:05:55.169> your

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
can run away and be basically have your

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.990 
can run away and be basically have your
teammates<00:05:55.740> save<00:05:55.950> you<00:05:56.190> and<00:05:56.400> you<00:05:56.490> can<00:05:56.640> hide<00:05:56.850> this

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
teammates save you and you can hide this

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.960 
teammates save you and you can hide this
for<00:05:57.360> example<00:05:57.780> in<00:05:57.870> the<00:05:57.990> pit<00:05:58.200> for<00:05:59.040> retake<00:05:59.580> on<00:05:59.790> a

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
for example in the pit for retake on a

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.970 
for example in the pit for retake on a
because<00:06:00.690> staying<00:06:01.020> alive<00:06:01.260> is<00:06:01.470> one<00:06:01.650> of<00:06:01.740> the<00:06:01.800> most

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980 
because staying alive is one of the most

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.830 
because staying alive is one of the most
important<00:06:02.490> and<00:06:02.610> crucial<00:06:02.730> things<00:06:03.150> as<00:06:03.330> an<00:06:03.450> opera

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
important and crucial things as an opera

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.280 
important and crucial things as an opera
especially<00:06:04.770> when<00:06:05.070> you<00:06:06.000> know<00:06:06.030> its<00:06:06.300> uppers

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
especially when you know its uppers

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.900 
especially when you know its uppers
don't<00:06:07.500> essentially<00:06:08.190> always<00:06:08.460> waste<00:06:08.700> their

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
don't essentially always waste their

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.760 
don't essentially always waste their
flash<00:06:09.150> bangs<00:06:09.450> and<00:06:09.690> grenades<00:06:10.020> first<00:06:10.530> thing

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
flash bangs and grenades first thing

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.800 
flash bangs and grenades first thing
because<00:06:11.160> you<00:06:11.790> have<00:06:11.940> to<00:06:12.060> have<00:06:12.210> your<00:06:12.330> scope<00:06:12.630> out

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
because you have to have your scope out

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.570 
because you have to have your scope out
it<00:06:12.990> takes<00:06:13.140> a<00:06:13.290> second<00:06:13.680> or<00:06:13.710> two<00:06:13.860> to<00:06:14.010> bring<00:06:14.430> your

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
it takes a second or two to bring your

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.190 
it takes a second or two to bring your
scope<00:06:14.850> out<00:06:15.060> once<00:06:15.330> you've<00:06:15.480> taken<00:06:15.660> out<00:06:15.900> your<00:06:16.020> gun

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
scope out once you've taken out your gun

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.560 
scope out once you've taken out your gun
so<00:06:16.800> it's<00:06:16.919> not<00:06:17.100> easy<00:06:17.400> to<00:06:17.730> be<00:06:17.880> able<00:06:17.970> to<00:06:18.180> take<00:06:18.390> out

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
so it's not easy to be able to take out

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.960 
so it's not easy to be able to take out
flash<00:06:18.930> bangs<00:06:19.230> and<00:06:19.470> grenades<00:06:19.790> essentially<00:06:20.790> in

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
flash bangs and grenades essentially in

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.760 
flash bangs and grenades essentially in
the<00:06:21.180> heat<00:06:21.360> of<00:06:21.390> the<00:06:21.540> battle<00:06:21.690> so<00:06:22.440> you're<00:06:22.590> staying

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
the heat of the battle so you're staying

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.980 
the heat of the battle so you're staying
alive<00:06:23.100> for<00:06:23.610> the<00:06:23.640> retake<00:06:24.060> is<00:06:24.210> very<00:06:24.450> important

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
alive for the retake is very important
