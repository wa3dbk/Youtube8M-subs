00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.920
 yes 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.680
 Y 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.059
 hello how about youtube friends greets you 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.590
 the lack 90 with a new video and good 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.480
 as you can appreciate sir we are going to be 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.800
 the full review of the iphone 5 as already 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.189
 could have seen the boxing is a 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.509
 iphone 5 or 16 gb in white and good color 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.689
 before starting this I want to do the 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.250
 comparative again with the iphone 4 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.980
 so that they can really check what 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.620
 is the thickness since this iphone is 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.970
 much thinner than the iphone 4 and 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.590
 also what regards the screen as 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.850
 can see if the increase is very 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.680
 big enough that they gave me a bishop 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.330
 extra icons otherwise we noticed 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.920
 different than the camera to make face 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.690
 issue is now at the top and not 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.239
 as before knowing the part the lateral 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.620
 of the handset and good we had a little 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.000
 now the most technical details of what 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.649
 what is this new iphone in what 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.680
 this thickness will form more 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.170
 It has 0.76 centimeters and a weight of 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.820
 112 grams this is summarized in 18 by 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.670
 hundred and thinner that is a tensor 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.140
 iphone 4s and 20 lighter though many 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.309
 think that the design did not change much 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.020
 truth is that the jump itself was 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.180
 surprising and changed quite a bit 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.670
 example how can you appreciate everything 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.180
 the outline of the iphone has this 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.770
 small polished aluminum bar which 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.960
 makes it look very well and good the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.510
 bottom now we see what they are 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.460
 for our headphones our 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.140
 microphone to make calls on 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.030
 lighting connector and what is the speaker 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.040
 from the phone to 9 I want to notice 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.900
 also talking about loudspeaker increased 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.280
 quite what is the sound and improved 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.140
 much the sound quality of yielding 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.119
 speaker they had previously the 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.740
 iphone 4s now in the back what 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.000
 we see that it is completely in aluminum 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.619
 difference of the top e 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.270
 lower that are white in this 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.590
 case for being the white and good iphone 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.600
 as already on Saturday they included the new 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.820
 nano sim that is much smaller than the 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.440
 micro synth included iphone 4s with what 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.200
 regards to networks this iphone run 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.840
 lte a 4G network high speed and now 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.729
 has an 802.11 n wireless connection 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.289
 of double band to do with this can 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.570
 Support speeds in wifi up 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.979
 150 megabits per second as 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.990
 regards the processor now we count 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.899
 with about 6 dual-core in your cpu 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.580
 running at 1.2 gigahertz and in your gpu or 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.869
 graphic processing unit account 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.399
 with a quad core which gives us a 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.930
 very nice experience in our 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.940
 games something that I really liked in the 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.610
 change was what is the screen the 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.720
 screen increase in good shape already 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.819
 that now I can see the sounds in 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.400
 full resolution and how can you see the 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.049
 gaming experience is much better at 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.800
 this screen that good is a screen 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.290
 multitouch 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.800
 4 inches diagonally with a 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.980
 resolution of 1,136 pixels x 640 with 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.900
 326 pixels per inch as you can 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.480
 appreciate what is the experience of 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.920
 game is very very good the truth and good 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.990
 with regard to the camera we counted 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.640
 with an 8-megapixel eye side camera 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.190
 that has the ability to record video 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.760
 in full hd 1080p and up to 30 frames 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.350
 per second 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.670
 now also counting on the new 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.950
 option to be able to take photos 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.930
 panoramic which is a very option 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.180
 incredible how can you learn can you 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.290
 take pictures in an excellent way the 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.170
 Front camera noticeably improve 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.800
 now counting on the possibility of 1.2 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.120
 megapixels and record video in hd 720 p and 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.620
 good with regards to the battery to 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.750
 despite implementing one more screen 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.610
 large and a processor with much more 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.200
 performance continues to maintain the same 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.080
 durability time for example eight 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.360
 hours with three than 225 hours at rest 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.820
 eight hours in internet browsing by 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.440
 3g and 10 hours with wifi browsing 10 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.030
 hours of video playback and 40 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.260
 hours of music playback and watch 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.380
 friends how to comment to staff from 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.510
 true the iphone is amazing what it is 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.370
 the hardware is very very well done is 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.270
 incredibly fast and I do not notice much 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.030
 more because I was coming 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.070
 iphone 4 to an iphone 5 and I did not go through 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.840
 the iphone 4s so the 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.670
 increase in performance notice 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.260
 too much those recommendations if you 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.850
 you have an iphone 4s I think it's not worth 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.440
 So much the penalty that you make the guy because 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.630
 your device is still very well 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.760
 but if you have an iphone 4 or lower 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.570
 it's very much worth it that you do it and 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.550
 good to have is a very good 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.230
 device I am very happy with him already 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.630
 that offered me incredible performance 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.670
 the camera is very good the audio of 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.830
 recording is very good performance in 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.610
 games is superior and good friend I hope 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.900
 that you liked this video 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.490
 remember that if you liked leave a 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.290

 about the iphone with the video t is 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.910
 a photo test a test of what 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.440
 is the performance of the wifi and also 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.850
 so that they can check it and good if it is 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.290
 any specific test leave on the 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.210
