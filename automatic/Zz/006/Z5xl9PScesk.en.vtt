00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:26.020
 the decision to locate velasco in these 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:30.250
 rooms and transform the rooms has 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.910
 what to do with a renovation project 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.610
 full of the permanent collection 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.150
 velasco is the best represented artist 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:44.739
 in the collections of the National Museum of 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:46.660
 art and perhaps the artist also with 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.650
 greater representation in the collections 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.650
 national 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.980
 this exhibition what is giving us is 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.800
 the opportunity to discover velasco 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.350
 seen in another way is the opportunity 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.170
 to see a large set of works 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.500
 artistic're talking about 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:12.030
 110 pieces in this sample 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.760
 but within this group of works of 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.460
 art there are about 30% of works that 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.700
 they had never been seen I think what 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.910
 what is important is how we see 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.020
 velasco do not neglect to cover candles n 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.659
 in his power and in his energy to have the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.979
 distance 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.829
 the depth of seeing these windows that 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:40.280
 they open us on the horizon that is the other 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:43.510
 velasco that maybe we're talking about 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.560
 we had not seen before 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.350
 and one can see 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.159
 a story in which there can be a 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.310
 drawing or a photograph 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.950
 graphic next to a great painting and see 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.359
 how they work in the different 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.359
 disciplines and techniques 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.229
 is an expression that speaks of many 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.259
 things we see here the great panoramas 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.660
 of the mexico valley but we're also going to 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.349
 see how velasco goes back to the 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.989
 humid lands and travels those landscapes 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:22.049
 that are different in a way maybe 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.200
 a little closer more intimate or as 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.660
 also what happens after the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.260
 the war of reform the secularization 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.050
 of the goods will change the life 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.200
 urban 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.900
 what is the development of the cities 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.270
 to transform the convents into spaces 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.870
 are going to count many 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:48.890
 stories that occur within a century 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:53.000
 It is key to the decision to make 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.390
 velasco the heart of the national museum of 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.390
 art 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.740
 starts with the sheet of mexico paint 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.740
 in 66 by josé maría velasco is how 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.660
 is representing over the decades 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.180
 until now how are they going 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.240
 transforming spaces and how they go 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.360
 being populated or conquered 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.830
 territorially by the characters of 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.240
 each era with its fashions with its styles 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.580
 then that is what is done in these 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.270
 educational communication exercises 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:36.580
 as a space in time is going to have 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.580
 a transformation and how it is being populated 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.890
 the national museum of art that 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:47.700
 found in the palace of 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.549
 communications is has the fortune of 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.599
 have the most beautiful buildings in 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:57.359
 all over the country without a doubt and we wanted that 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:04:00.090
 let this be the sample of how we will go 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.489
 moving forward in the next two years in 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.790
 recover all these spaces and 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:09.150
 make them more extensive in having more with 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.730
 better prospects better shots than 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.340
 the 100 people feel comfortable 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.500
 wandering through the spaces a 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.320
 worthy scenario that does not compete with the 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.289
 mastery of the works and their affairs but 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.630
 that if I give one we can say one 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.210
 scenography a dignified theatricality that 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.319
 they reveal us 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.630
 in painting things that many that 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:36.520
 we know very closely these 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.520
 pictures we had not seen
