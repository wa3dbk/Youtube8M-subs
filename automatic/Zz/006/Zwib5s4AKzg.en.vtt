all<00:00:01.500> right<00:00:01.770> this<00:00:01.920> is<00:00:02.040> my<00:00:02.190> third<00:00:02.520> time

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
all right this is my third time

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.980 
metal given the metals binding energy
the<00:00:16.650> light<00:00:17.010> needs<00:00:17.520> at<00:00:17.730> least<00:00:17.760> as<00:00:18.300> much<00:00:18.660> energy

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
the light needs at least as much energy

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.310 
the light needs at least as much energy
as<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:20.279> binding<00:00:20.699> energy<00:00:21.150> if<00:00:21.390> an<00:00:21.660> electron<00:00:22.199> is

going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.680> be<00:00:22.830> removed<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:24.000> all<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:24.449> need<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.689> do

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
going to be removed so all we need to do

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.070 
going to be removed so all we need to do
is<00:00:25.050> calculate<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.980> frequency<00:00:26.760> that

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
is calculate the frequency that

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.529 
is calculate the frequency that
corresponds<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.590> energy<00:00:29.269> how<00:00:30.269> our

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
energy and frequency related the answer

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.370 
energy and frequency related the answer
is<00:00:33.570> e<00:00:33.750> equals<00:00:34.440> H<00:00:34.649> times<00:00:34.710> nu<00:00:35.340> or<00:00:36.140> if<00:00:37.140> you're

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
is e equals H times nu or if you're

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.869 
is e equals H times nu or if you're
solving<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:38.180> frequency<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.410> energy

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
solving for frequency it's the energy

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.380 
solving for frequency it's the energy
divided<00:00:41.879> by<00:00:42.079> Planck's<00:00:43.079> constant<00:00:43.789> so<00:00:44.789> the

divided by Planck's constant so the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.380 
divided by Planck's constant so the
minimum<00:00:45.899> frequency<00:00:46.200> needed<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.910> binding

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
minimum frequency needed is the binding

the energy needed to the wavelength is

with this formula and if we were solving
for<00:01:33.540> lambda<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.320> could<00:01:34.470> rearrange<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
for lambda you could rearrange the

equation if you get HC over E so the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.770
