00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
is going to G form it I don't think he

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.220

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
wants to really play G for this would be

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.390 
wants to really play G for this would be
would<00:03:24.230> be<00:03:24.409> a<00:03:24.439> strange<00:03:25.310> decision<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.980> say<00:03:28.220> the

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
would be a strange decision to say the

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.900 
would be a strange decision to say the
least

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.470 

ya<00:03:36.510> need<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.900> need<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.260> speed<00:03:37.740> up<00:03:37.770> here<00:03:38.480> as

neither<00:04:55.290> for<00:04:55.800> with<00:04:55.979> the<00:04:56.190> gain<00:04:56.790> of<00:04:56.970> tempo<00:04:57.360> also

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.180 

hard<00:05:08.800> to<00:05:08.980> see<00:05:09.220> how<00:05:10.350> you<00:05:11.350> could<00:05:11.530> give<00:05:12.400> defend

position<00:05:58.000> here<00:05:58.510> but<00:05:58.690> I<00:05:58.900> think<00:05:59.620> a<00:05:59.740> white<00:05:59.950> goes

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
position here but I think a white goes

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.580 
position here but I think a white goes
for<00:06:01.050> Bishop<00:06:02.050> h3<00:06:02.620> here<00:06:04.140> shouldn't<00:06:05.140> shouldn't

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
for Bishop h3 here shouldn't shouldn't

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.720 
for Bishop h3 here shouldn't shouldn't
be<00:06:06.090> a<00:06:07.090> huge<00:06:07.720> problem<00:06:07.960> for<00:06:08.260> him<00:06:08.620> because<00:06:09.040> he's

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
be a huge problem for him because he's

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.470 
be a huge problem for him because he's
getting<00:06:10.150> rid<00:06:10.300> of<00:06:10.330> his<00:06:10.800> mentorship<00:06:11.800> as<00:06:12.100> well

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
getting rid of his mentorship as well

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.040 
getting rid of his mentorship as well
but<00:06:13.480> he<00:06:13.660> played<00:06:15.090> this<00:06:16.090> is<00:06:16.360> this<00:06:16.660> kind<00:06:16.930> of

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
but he played this is this kind of

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.800 
but he played this is this kind of
position<00:06:17.440> is<00:06:17.530> really<00:06:17.890> without<00:06:18.070> any<00:06:18.810> good

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
position is really without any good

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.200 
position is really without any good
prospects<00:06:20.440> there<00:06:20.980> for<00:06:21.520> white<00:06:22.380> you<00:06:23.380> cannot

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
prospects there for white you cannot

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:30.570 
prospects there for white you cannot
gain<00:06:25.210> any<00:06:25.420> space<00:06:25.840> and<00:06:28.380> it's<00:06:29.460> already<00:06:30.460> very

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
gain any space and it's already very

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.770

nice<00:06:31.000> position<00:06:31.540> for<00:06:32.020> black<00:06:32.970> but<00:06:33.970> this<00:06:34.150> this<00:06:34.450> is

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
nice position for black but this this is

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.340 
nice position for black but this this is
really<00:06:35.440> really<00:06:36.040> really<00:06:36.520> bad<00:06:36.850> I<00:06:37.140> just<00:06:38.140> I<00:06:38.320> just

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
really really really bad I just I just

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
really really really bad I just I just
see<00:06:38.830> here<00:06:39.820> I<00:06:39.880> also<00:06:40.420> could<00:06:40.810> have<00:06:40.840> played<00:06:41.370> night

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
h5 should have been a good move because

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.280 
h5 should have been a good move because
some<00:06:46.870> it's<00:06:47.200> hard<00:06:47.410> to<00:06:47.590> defend<00:06:48.070> III<00:06:48.870> yeah<00:06:49.870> okay
