 well let's celebrate or let's 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.040
 remember someone very 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.769
 that has a lot of spiritual value a lot 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:15.090
 emotional value represents love 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.070
 represents connection to nature 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.310
 it is a 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.930
 God is almost I think that better than a 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.539
 human because humans are sometimes 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.630
 very bad and sometimes we are moderate 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.789
 we judge and this and this this companion 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.540
 what I'm talking about is this friend who 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.239
 is taking care and is going to meet two years of 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:39.120
 go with diosito and is a dog that has 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.540
 caused a sensation a phenomenon of 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.360
 love a phenomenon of global acceptance 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.100
 I was in Costa Rica to all the Ticos 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.440
 thank you very much for receiving us at costa 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.320
 rich with so much love many pit bulls in 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.149
 costa rica super well behaved if all 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.030
 the world wanted to see the ari they did not know that 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.969
 would be to know that Dari had died and then 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.920
 now we are celebrating his two years of 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:06.270
 what happened and it's a dog that has 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.979
 caused a transformation simply 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.200
 for being this is not a dog that has 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.020
 made marches, that's not a dog that 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.350
 has written and less or 'twitter' type 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.649
 facebook type simply the fact of 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.320
 to be he accepts the way he enters 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.950
 came into the rooms and now we're going 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.830
 to celebrate his second year of dying in 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.210
 body but not die in spirit and that 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.430
 is what he represents for all 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.450
 us here on websites for my 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.759
 children for me personally 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.829
 It's a dog that really has 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.590
 taught a lot what is love what that 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:45.619
 acceptance what it is not to judge and what 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.409
 is what I have learned from him is 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.490
 forget things that hurt you or people 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.350
 that have hurt you and this second year 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.530
 we want to celebrate it in this way 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.289
 that we forget in memory of him 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.240
 the people who have hurt us or 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.399
 things that have hurt us to be able to 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.710
 live in the moment and continue towards 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.450
