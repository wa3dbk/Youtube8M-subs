recalled from episode 7 of this series
but<00:00:56.780> I<00:00:56.959> wasn't<00:00:57.260> really<00:00:57.559> where<00:00:57.739> I<00:00:57.769> wanted<00:00:58.159> to<00:00:58.219> be

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
but I wasn't really where I wanted to be

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.759 
but I wasn't really where I wanted to be
I<00:00:58.489> was<00:00:58.729> swinging<00:00:59.029> at<00:00:59.239> pitches<00:00:59.269> that<00:01:00.199> were<00:01:00.619> out

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
I was swinging at pitches that were out

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.500 
I was swinging at pitches that were out
of<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.010> zone<00:01:01.039> I<00:01:01.459> really<00:01:01.789> wasn't<00:01:01.999> getting<00:01:02.299> many

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
of the zone I really wasn't getting many

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.149 
of the zone I really wasn't getting many
strikes<00:01:02.869> thrown<00:01:03.229> to<00:01:03.409> me<00:01:03.440> and<00:01:03.709> i<00:01:03.769> think<00:01:04.010> that

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
strikes thrown to me and i think that

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.889 
strikes thrown to me and i think that
the<00:01:04.280> AI<00:01:04.460> for<00:01:04.969> the<00:01:05.089> team's<00:01:05.299> really<00:01:05.659> took

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
the AI for the team's really took

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.389 
the AI for the team's really took
advantage<00:01:06.049> that<00:01:06.590> i<00:01:06.649> was<00:01:06.920> getting<00:01:07.159> a<00:01:07.189> lot<00:01:07.369> of

breaking balls out of the zone and I was

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.289 
breaking balls out of the zone and I was
just<00:01:09.710> stupidly<00:01:10.250> chasing<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:10.880> lot<00:01:10.969> of<00:01:11.119> pitches

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
back and trying to hit that again so

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.679 
back and trying to hit that again so
that<00:01:42.920> was<00:01:43.490> my<00:01:43.520> problem<00:01:43.850> as<00:01:44.119> well<00:01:44.299> as<00:01:44.450> I<00:01:44.539> was

good<00:04:52.280> they<00:04:52.520> got<00:04:52.550> up<00:04:52.910> early<00:04:53.300> on<00:04:53.449> in<00:04:53.630> games<00:04:53.870> I'm

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199

swinging<00:04:54.680> at<00:04:54.740> weird<00:04:54.949> pitches<00:04:55.669> and<00:04:55.940> that<00:04:56.330> ends

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
swinging at weird pitches and that ends

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.960 
swinging at weird pitches and that ends
up<00:04:57.080> being<00:04:57.380> a<00:04:57.560> safe<00:04:57.949> call<00:04:58.250> at<00:04:58.370> first<00:04:58.520> base<00:04:58.729> by

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
up being a safe call at first base by

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.629 
up being a safe call at first base by
the<00:04:59.000> umpire<00:04:59.389> I<00:04:59.419> was<00:04:59.840> safe<00:05:00.199> for<00:05:00.590> sure<00:05:00.830> but<00:05:01.550> I
