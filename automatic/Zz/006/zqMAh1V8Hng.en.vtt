00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
controls in just a second up here and

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.609 
controls in just a second up here and
then<00:01:42.299> here's<00:01:42.509> another<00:01:42.659> example<00:01:42.780> from<00:01:43.140> twenty

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
then here's another example from twenty

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.899 
then here's another example from twenty
years<00:01:43.770> just<00:01:43.920> buzzing<00:01:44.310> asteroid<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.790> i<00:01:44.850> do

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
years just buzzing asteroid a and i do

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.569 
years just buzzing asteroid a and i do
recommend<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.570> from<00:01:45.780> roughly<00:01:46.159> 15<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.310> 20

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
recommend this from roughly 15 to 20

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.280 
recommend this from roughly 15 to 20
yards<00:01:47.820> nothing<00:01:47.970> beyond<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.840> here's<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
yards nothing beyond that so here's the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.080 
yards nothing beyond that so here's the
control<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.860> gotta<00:01:50.009> hold<00:01:50.399> down<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:50.909> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
control so you gotta hold down be to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.240 
control so you gotta hold down be to
charge<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.450> shot<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.840> then<00:01:52.259> hold<00:01:52.530> lb<00:01:52.920> as<00:01:53.040> well

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
charge a shot and then hold lb as well

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.649 
charge a shot and then hold lb as well
while<00:01:53.460> you're<00:01:53.640> charging<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> shot<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.420> keep

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
while you're charging the shot and keep

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.330 
while you're charging the shot and keep

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
they'll be held throughout the whole

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.160 
they'll be held throughout the whole
power<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.909> shot<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.270> i'll<00:01:57.360> go<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.960> show

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
power of the shot and i'll go to show

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.660 
power of the shot and i'll go to show
you<00:01:58.229> what<00:01:58.500> power<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.829> need<00:01:59.009> for<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.310> shot<00:01:59.490> now

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
you what power you need for the shot now

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.370 
you what power you need for the shot now
as<00:01:59.880> well<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.810> as<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.020> see<00:02:01.200> they're<00:02:01.350> just

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
as well so as you can see they're just

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.010 
as well so as you can see they're just
over<00:02:02.070> two<00:02:02.460> bears<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.689> should<00:02:03.869> be

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
over two bears and you that should be

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.420 
over two bears and you that should be
perfect<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.530> won't<00:02:04.680> hit<00:02:04.799> off<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.040> post<00:02:05.250> and

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
perfect that won't hit off the post and

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.760 
perfect that won't hit off the post and
went<00:02:05.640> straight<00:02:05.729> in

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
went straight in

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.830 
went straight in
here's<00:02:07.549> a<00:02:07.609> couple<00:02:07.909> of<00:02:07.969> examples<00:02:08.269> that<00:02:08.569> you<00:02:08.629> get

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
here's a couple of examples that you get

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.380 
here's a couple of examples that you get
rebounds<00:02:09.170> on<00:02:09.489> so<00:02:10.489> there's<00:02:10.729> quite<00:02:10.849> a<00:02:10.970> good<00:02:11.180> shot

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
rebounds on so there's quite a good shot

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.729 
rebounds on so there's quite a good shot
if<00:02:11.540> four<00:02:11.690> rebounds<00:02:12.140> as<00:02:12.230> well<00:02:12.379> because<00:02:12.650> the

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
if four rebounds as well because the

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.290 
if four rebounds as well because the
keeper<00:02:13.040> usually<00:02:13.370> cannot<00:02:13.670> hold<00:02:13.879> these<00:02:14.090> if<00:02:14.269> you

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
keeper usually cannot hold these if you

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.690 
keeper usually cannot hold these if you
put<00:02:14.510> enough<00:02:14.540> power<00:02:14.840> onto<00:02:15.080> them<00:02:15.319> and<00:02:15.700> just

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
put enough power onto them and just

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.150 
put enough power onto them and just
another<00:02:16.940> couple<00:02:17.239> of<00:02:17.300> examples<00:02:17.599> here<00:02:18.160> easy

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
another couple of examples here easy

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.339 
another couple of examples here easy
rebound<00:02:19.670> easy<00:02:20.030> goal<00:02:20.390> so<00:02:20.720> I<00:02:20.750> that's<00:02:21.200> pretty

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
rebound easy goal so I that's pretty

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.690 
rebound easy goal so I that's pretty
