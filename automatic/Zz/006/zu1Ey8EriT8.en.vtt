00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.710
 hello you elena again and good 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.530
 recipes 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.250
 today i will show you the lasagna recipe with 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.920
 spinach 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.680
 I will use frozen spinach 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.420
 but if you have freshly spinach of course 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.420
 preferable to use it 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.820
 bechamel sauce recipe for cooking 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.820
 lasagna see in my previous video 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:55.949
 heated add salt and fry 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.970
 no need to fry so can you over 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.559
 defrosted spinach fresh if it 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.979
 just fry for a couple of minutes 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.680
 for starters, I fry under the lid to 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:13.110
 defrost the back then remove the cover and 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:19.190
 fry some more spinach ready to spinach 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.190
 add the feta cheese and hash small 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:30.590
 lasagna mold pour sauce 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.590
 bechamel 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.610
 distribute it along the bottom 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.760
 like this 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.509
 spread on top of the sauce plate 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:52.869
 lasagna parallel to each other but no 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.869
 no case overlap like this 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.710
 over the power of the eyes do not spread 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.710
 spinach with feta filling 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.759
 evenly distribute it among the sheets 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.319
 climbing so that the filling 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.319
 covered completely lasagna sheets 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.470
 Now fill the filling with small 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.470
 amount of bechamel sauce 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.180
 distribute again 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.800
 and spread on top of the following sheets 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:42.960
 lasagna in the same way as the most 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:45.980
 first repeat the previous steps 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.980
 we lay out the stuffing 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.720
 pour sauce 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.379
 and level 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.049
 the next layer I'm going to do 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:08.890
 a little different not with spinach and stuffing 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:11.129
 and with hard cheese spread sheets 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.129
 lasagna 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.129
 and sprinkle with grated cheese 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:35.000
 thick enough now again 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.000
 sauce 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.780
 still want to notice pay attention to 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.610
 indication on the package of lasagna sheets 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.620
 some manufacturers write them 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.820
 lasagna sheets need to be pre 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:02.170
 boil and I have lasagna 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.460
 pre-cooking does not require 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.550
 repeat all these actions until 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.020
 run out of lasagna sheets 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.260
 the last row of lasagna sheets is just 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:15.370
 pour bechamel sauce 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:19.420
 the stuffing is not necessary here we lay out 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.420
 leveling the sauce 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.160
 and sprinkle with grated cheese 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.830
 and then send the lasagna to the oven 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:37.030
 preheated to eat at 180 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:40.629
 degrees Celsius half an hour half an hour 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.409
 increase the temperature of 210-220 degrees 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:46.770
 Celsius and bake another ten minutes 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:49.500
 to form a ruddy crust 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.159
 spinach lasagna ready 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.349
 remove from oven and cool slightly 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:05:02.590
 then cut into portions and 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:04.509
 serving hot hopefully 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.169

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:08.379
