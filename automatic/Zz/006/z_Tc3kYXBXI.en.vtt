right here in the community if you're
gonna<00:02:00.459> build<00:02:00.729> this<00:02:00.940> system<00:02:01.420> you<00:02:01.509> got<00:02:01.630> to<00:02:01.750> build

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
gonna build this system you got to build

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.230 
gonna build this system you got to build
it<00:02:02.080> right<00:02:02.110> you<00:02:02.590> got<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:02.950> put<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.729> stations

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
it right you got to put the stations

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.180 
it right you got to put the stations
where<00:02:04.390> they<00:02:04.599> need<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:04.810> be<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.470> I<00:02:05.679> think<00:02:05.979> that's

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
where they need to be and I think that's

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.760 
where they need to be and I think that's
a<00:02:06.310> lesson<00:02:06.550> for<00:02:06.929> anyone<00:02:07.929> building<00:02:08.410> a<00:02:08.530> system

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
a lesson for anyone building a system

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.100 
a lesson for anyone building a system
include<00:02:09.490> people<00:02:09.759> on<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.209> ground<00:02:10.450> floor<00:02:10.810> and

community organizations need to get

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
involved stay involved because we can

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.699 
involved stay involved because we can
make<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.209> difference<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:16.840> we<00:02:17.050> can<00:02:17.080> actually

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
make a difference and we can actually

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.979 
make a difference and we can actually
build<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.640> system<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.209> way<00:02:19.330> it's<00:02:19.510> supposed<00:02:19.840> to

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
build a system the way it's supposed to

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.500 
build a system the way it's supposed to
be<00:02:20.110> built<00:02:20.319> I<00:02:20.760> owned<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.910> business<00:02:22.090> on<00:02:22.390> the

be built I owned the business on the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.390 
be built I owned the business on the
Avenue<00:02:22.840> if<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.319> also<00:02:23.500> live<00:02:23.830> two<00:02:24.010> blocks<00:02:24.040> from

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
Avenue if I also live two blocks from

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.729 
Avenue if I also live two blocks from
here<00:02:24.640> so<00:02:24.970> as<00:02:25.569> a<00:02:25.630> business<00:02:26.140> owner<00:02:26.290> it's<00:02:26.620> a

here so as a business owner it's a

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.740 
here so as a business owner it's a
resident<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.580> see<00:02:27.970> it's<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.150> benefit<00:02:28.569> for

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
resident I see it's a benefit for

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.740 
resident I see it's a benefit for
overall<00:02:29.200> business<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.880> community<00:02:31.030> and

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
overall business and the community and

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.770 
overall business and the community and
so<00:02:32.530> now<00:02:32.709> you've<00:02:32.890> got<00:02:33.130> light<00:02:33.400> rail<00:02:33.670> or<00:02:34.540> we'll

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
so now you've got light rail or we'll

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.010 
so now you've got light rail or we'll
have<00:02:34.959> light<00:02:35.170> rail<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.680> little

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
have light rail and a little

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.120 
have light rail and a little
for<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.260> year<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:38.120> ability<00:02:38.540> for<00:02:38.570> people<00:02:39.130> to

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
for a year and the ability for people to

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.310 
for a year and the ability for people to
see<00:02:40.430> this<00:02:40.700> as<00:02:40.910> an<00:02:41.030> attractive<00:02:41.600> place<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:42.080> come

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
see this as an attractive place to come

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.860 
see this as an attractive place to come
to<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:43.220> this<00:02:43.370> becomes<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.910> destination<00:02:44.420> point

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
to so this becomes a destination point

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.840 
to so this becomes a destination point
not<00:02:45.170> just<00:02:45.500> where<00:02:45.800> we<00:02:45.950> want<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.250> pass<00:02:46.460> through

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
not just where we want to pass through

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.690 
not just where we want to pass through
that<00:02:47.060> has<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.930> ability<00:02:48.350> to<00:02:48.380> raise<00:02:49.340> the

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
that has the ability to raise the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.970 
that has the ability to raise the
economic<00:02:50.300> status<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.230> health<00:02:51.410> status<00:02:51.830> of

economic status and the health status of

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.220 
economic status and the health status of
people<00:02:52.340> that<00:02:52.490> live<00:02:52.700> here<00:02:52.730> so<00:02:53.510> these<00:02:53.810> kinds<00:02:54.200> of

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
people that live here so these kinds of

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.980 
people that live here so these kinds of
decisions<00:02:54.560> that<00:02:55.130> we<00:02:55.310> make<00:02:55.670> around<00:02:56.150> transit<00:02:56.720> or

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
decisions that we make around transit or

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.830 
decisions that we make around transit or
public<00:02:57.320> investments<00:02:58.040> or<00:02:58.280> how<00:02:59.210> we<00:02:59.270> design<00:02:59.810> our

public investments or how we design our

public investments or how we design our
communities<00:03:00.530> have<00:03:01.130> everything<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.940> do<00:03:02.120> with

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
communities have everything to do with

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.150 
communities have everything to do with
investments<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:03.290> we<00:03:03.410> make<00:03:03.590> in<00:03:03.740> future

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
investments that we make in future

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.770 
investments that we make in future
health<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:04.550> our<00:03:04.760> children<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.330> our<00:03:05.420> families
