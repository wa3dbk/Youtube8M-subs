00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
starts out on the E string and it's

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.310 
starts out on the E string and it's
really<00:00:24.160> fast

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
really fast

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:34.020 
really fast
17<00:00:26.320> 16<00:00:26.680> 13<00:00:30.600> and<00:00:31.600> then<00:00:31.720> you<00:00:31.840> go<00:00:31.990> to<00:00:32.040> 15<00:00:33.040> on<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.880> B

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
17 16 13 and then you go to 15 on the B

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:42.830 
17 16 13 and then you go to 15 on the B
string<00:00:34.090> and<00:00:35.460> then<00:00:36.460> back<00:00:36.640> up

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:51.490 

you<00:00:43.840> do<00:00:43.990> that<00:00:44.140> it's<00:00:44.260> all<00:00:44.410> paid

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.540 

they'll<00:00:52.500> be<00:00:52.590> tabs<00:00:52.800> inscription<00:00:53.220> by<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.400> way

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
they'll be tabs inscription by the way

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.150 
they'll be tabs inscription by the way
but<00:00:53.910> so

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:07.010 

this<00:01:00.060> switches<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:01.790> 1716<00:01:02.790> 12

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.330 

and<00:01:07.890> then<00:01:08.009> to<00:01:08.100> 14<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.670> bee

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:22.830 

same<00:01:13.909> thing<00:01:14.150> same<00:01:14.180> pattern

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:47.840 

then<00:01:23.840> it<00:01:23.960> goes<00:01:24.110> to<00:01:24.140> 17<00:01:25.100> 18<00:01:30.790> 17<00:01:31.790> 13<00:01:33.790> 15<00:01:34.790> on<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:35.000> B

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.670 

it<00:01:48.850> goes<00:01:49.000> to<00:01:49.240> after<00:01:49.510> he<00:01:49.780> goes<00:01:50.880> 16<00:01:51.880> 15<00:01:52.210> 14<00:01:52.240> 13<00:01:52.900> is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
it goes to after he goes 16 15 14 13 is

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.920 
it goes to after he goes 16 15 14 13 is
chromatic<00:01:54.340> scale<00:01:54.520> pretty<00:01:54.700> much<00:01:57.690> is<00:01:58.690> that

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
chromatic scale pretty much is that

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:07.169 
chromatic scale pretty much is that
twice

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.590 

after<00:02:08.179> does<00:02:08.330> that<00:02:08.509> twice<00:02:08.959> you<00:02:10.180> guys<00:02:11.180> back<00:02:11.390> up

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
after does that twice you guys back up

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:23.650 
after does that twice you guys back up
so<00:02:11.870> 16<00:02:12.770> 15<00:02:13.160> 14<00:02:13.190> 13<00:02:15.250> 14<00:02:16.360> 15<00:02:17.530> 16<00:02:18.530> them<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:22.660> then

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
so 16 15 14 13 14 15 16 them and then

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.080 
so 16 15 14 13 14 15 16 them and then
once<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.020> get<00:02:24.110> back<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.440> 13<00:02:24.920> 15<00:02:25.459> on<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.760> second

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
once you get back to 13 15 on the second

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.240 
once you get back to 13 15 on the second
time<00:02:26.209> through<00:02:26.420> you<00:02:27.170> go<00:02:27.319> up<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:29.770> 17<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:31.100> then

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
time through you go up to 17 and then

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.370 
time through you go up to 17 and then
you<00:02:31.340> do<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.580> same<00:02:31.760> thing<00:02:32.319> 17<00:02:33.319> 16<00:02:33.830> 15<00:02:34.310> 14<00:02:35.050> 15<00:02:36.050> 16

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
you do the same thing 17 16 15 14 15 16

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:43.360 
you do the same thing 17 16 15 14 15 16
17

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.470 

so<00:02:44.370> this

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:03:01.619 

oh<00:02:58.050> my<00:02:59.050> bad<00:02:59.200> on<00:02:59.349> that<00:02:59.379> so<00:02:59.739> you<00:02:59.800> don't<00:02:59.950> go<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.629> 14

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
oh my bad on that so you don't go to 14

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.600 
oh my bad on that so you don't go to 14
on<00:03:01.810> that<00:03:01.989> last<00:03:02.200> one<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:03.580> you<00:03:03.640> go<00:03:03.730> back<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:03.940> 13

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
on that last one and you go back to 13

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.880 
on that last one and you go back to 13
my<00:03:06.610> bad<00:03:06.760> on<00:03:06.910> that<00:03:07.060> but<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:07.480> caps<00:03:08.410> will<00:03:08.590> be<00:03:08.680> right

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
my bad on that but so caps will be right

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.699 
my bad on that but so caps will be right
so<00:03:09.310> just<00:03:09.610> all<00:03:09.849> those<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.260> is<00:03:11.319> that<00:03:11.500> same

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
so just all those that it is that same

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:22.449 
so just all those that it is that same
thing<00:03:11.890> again

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:40.670 

something<00:03:23.459> right<00:03:23.550> here<00:03:33.920> except<00:03:34.920> you<00:03:35.040> go<00:03:35.190> to

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:50.170 

I<00:03:40.760> think<00:03:41.760> that's<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.300> 21st<00:03:43.200> Brett<00:03:44.810> 21.8<00:03:47.599> 1915

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
I think that's a 21st Brett 21.8 1915

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.420 
I think that's a 21st Brett 21.8 1915
1901<00:03:51.180> one<00:03:51.360> with<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.599> bend<00:03:51.780> so<00:03:52.340> that's<00:03:53.340> the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
1901 one with the bend so that's the

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.060 
1901 one with the bend so that's the
whole<00:03:53.550> solo<00:03:53.790> says
