I'm<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:21.560> somewhat<00:02:22.280> expert<00:02:22.610> on<00:02:22.730> switches<00:02:23.150> what

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
I'm a somewhat expert on switches what

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.750 
I'm a somewhat expert on switches what
do<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:23.750> think<00:02:23.840> of<00:02:23.990> some<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.260> new<00:02:24.350> switches

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
do you think of some of the new switches

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.250 
do you think of some of the new switches
coming<00:02:25.760> out<00:02:25.820> of<00:02:25.850> China<00:02:26.120> Korea<00:02:26.630> other<00:02:26.900> places

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
coming out of China Korea other places

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.200 
coming out of China Korea other places
but<00:02:27.710> it<00:02:27.830> sort<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.100> cherry<00:02:28.550> MX<00:02:28.700> Cologne<00:02:29.060> to

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
but it sort of the cherry MX Cologne to

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.340 
but it sort of the cherry MX Cologne to
be<00:02:29.300> been<00:02:29.480> able<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.720> play<00:02:29.870> with<00:02:29.990> any<00:02:30.110> of<00:02:30.260> them

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
be been able to play with any of them

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.350 
be been able to play with any of them
yeah<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:30.890> mean<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.610> was<00:02:31.760> part<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.150> process

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
yeah I mean that was part of the process

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.390 
yeah I mean that was part of the process
we<00:02:32.840> looked<00:02:33.080> at<00:02:33.230> maybe<00:02:33.530> about<00:02:33.740> six<00:02:34.070> months<00:02:34.220> ago

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
we looked at maybe about six months ago

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.700 
we looked at maybe about six months ago
is<00:02:34.730> evaluating<00:02:35.690> all<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.140> switches<00:02:36.380> on<00:02:36.620> the

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
is evaluating all the switches on the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.910 
is evaluating all the switches on the
market<00:02:37.270> not<00:02:38.270> only<00:02:38.450> cherry<00:02:38.900> MX<00:02:39.050> switches<00:02:39.350> and

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
market not only cherry MX switches and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.130 
market not only cherry MX switches and
what<00:02:40.670> we<00:02:40.790> found<00:02:41.030> was<00:02:41.360> none<00:02:41.690> can<00:02:41.900> really

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
what we found was none can really

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.620 
what we found was none can really
matched<00:02:42.380> cherry<00:02:42.860> MX<00:02:43.360> reliability<00:02:44.360> standpoint

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
matched cherry MX reliability standpoint

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.410 
matched cherry MX reliability standpoint
and<00:02:45.380> performance<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.880> know<00:02:46.970> some<00:02:47.240> of<00:02:47.270> the

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
and performance you know some of the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.360 
and performance you know some of the
clones<00:02:47.840> which<00:02:48.170> is<00:02:48.350> out<00:02:48.500> there<00:02:48.770> they<00:02:49.310> be

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
clones which is out there they be

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.260 
clones which is out there they be
inconsistent<00:02:50.120> over<00:02:50.870> many<00:02:51.290> keys<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.850> they

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
inconsistent over many keys and they

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.670 
inconsistent over many keys and they
would<00:02:53.450> they<00:02:53.660> would<00:02:53.690> sound<00:02:54.140> different<00:02:54.620> than

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
would they would sound different than

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.890 
would they would sound different than
cherry<00:02:54.980> MX<00:02:55.130> switches<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.360> big<00:02:56.510> one<00:02:56.720> for

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
cherry MX switches and the big one for

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.320 
cherry MX switches and the big one for
me<00:02:57.050> is<00:02:57.080> when<00:02:57.380> you<00:02:57.470> look<00:02:57.680> at<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:57.950> data<00:02:58.270> of<00:02:59.270> the

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
me is when you look at the data of the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.210 
me is when you look at the data of the
testing<00:03:00.050> none<00:03:00.410> of<00:03:00.440> them<00:03:00.620> just<00:03:00.830> could<00:03:01.040> match

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
testing none of them just could match

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.490 
testing none of them just could match
the<00:03:01.400> quality<00:03:01.520> of<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:01.880> cherry<00:03:02.120> MX<00:03:02.270> switch<00:03:02.690> what

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
the quality of a cherry MX switch what

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.630 
the quality of a cherry MX switch what
do<00:03:03.560> you<00:03:03.680> what<00:03:04.010> do<00:03:04.070> you<00:03:04.130> think<00:03:04.280> about<00:03:04.340> like

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
do you what do you think about like

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.430 
do you what do you think about like
changing<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.540> actuation<00:03:06.020> points<00:03:06.320> if<00:03:06.380> you

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
changing the actuation points if you

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.540 
changing the actuation points if you
guys<00:03:06.560> thought<00:03:06.740> about<00:03:06.800> doing<00:03:07.100> anything<00:03:07.400> like

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
guys thought about doing anything like

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.150 
guys thought about doing anything like
that<00:03:07.610> or<00:03:07.760> doing<00:03:08.000> any<00:03:08.240> tests<00:03:08.600> or<00:03:08.660> if<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:08.930> like

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
that or doing any tests or if you like

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.680 
that or doing any tests or if you like
cherry<00:03:10.160> already<00:03:10.460> has<00:03:10.580> it<00:03:10.730> pretty<00:03:10.790> much<00:03:11.060> I<00:03:11.540> mean

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
cherry already has it pretty much I mean

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.990 
cherry already has it pretty much I mean
no<00:03:12.200> cherries<00:03:12.590> been<00:03:12.770> making<00:03:13.100> switches<00:03:13.520> for<00:03:13.700> 30

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
no cherries been making switches for 30

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.580 
no cherries been making switches for 30
years<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.510> they<00:03:14.750> perfected

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
years and they perfected

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.949 
years and they perfected
with<00:03:16.099> their<00:03:16.250> manufacturing<00:03:16.940> made<00:03:17.629> in<00:03:17.780> Germany

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
with their manufacturing made in Germany

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.080 
with their manufacturing made in Germany
over<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:18.739> over<00:03:18.860> you<00:03:19.489> know<00:03:19.580> would<00:03:19.760> be<00:03:19.790> have

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
over and over you know would be have

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.759 
over and over you know would be have
looked<00:03:20.330> at<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:20.599> a<00:03:20.660> little<00:03:20.780> bit<00:03:21.019> but<00:03:21.290> I<00:03:21.349> think

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
looked at it a little bit but I think

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.910 
looked at it a little bit but I think
the<00:03:22.489> market<00:03:23.330> tells<00:03:23.540> us<00:03:23.810> that<00:03:23.989> people<00:03:24.410> like<00:03:24.739> the

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
the market tells us that people like the

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.979 
the market tells us that people like the
cherry<00:03:25.160> switches<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:26.060> don't<00:03:26.300> want<00:03:26.540> want<00:03:26.900> you

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
cherry switches and don't want want you

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.680 
cherry switches and don't want want you
to<00:03:27.050> change<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.440> cherries<00:03:27.709> switches<00:03:28.220> cool<00:03:29.150> all

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
to change the cherries switches cool all

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.930 
to change the cherries switches cool all
right<00:03:29.840> man<00:03:29.959> anything<00:03:30.890> else<00:03:31.040> crazy<00:03:31.640> we<00:03:31.819> should

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
right man anything else crazy we should
