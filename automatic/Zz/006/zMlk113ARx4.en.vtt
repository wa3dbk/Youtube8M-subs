these<00:00:19.949> island<00:00:20.369> details<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.789> little<00:00:20.910> bit<00:00:21.150> more

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
these island details a little bit more

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.689 
these island details a little bit more
carefully<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> first<00:00:22.470> island<00:00:22.949> what

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
carefully so on the first island what

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.300 
carefully so on the first island what
we've<00:00:23.850> done<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.420> we<00:00:24.689> have<00:00:24.900> expressed<00:00:25.470> on<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
we've done is we have expressed on the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.830 
we've done is we have expressed on the
ends<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.730> island<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.060> look<00:00:27.269> like<00:00:27.449> table

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
ends of the island to look like table

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.540 
ends of the island to look like table
legs<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.349> way<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.680> we've<00:00:28.800> done<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:29.279> is

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
legs and the way that we've done that is

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.700 
legs and the way that we've done that is
we've<00:00:29.760> created<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.630> piece<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.320> three

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
we've created this piece that is three

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.590 
we've created this piece that is three
inches<00:00:32.040> by<00:00:32.250> three<00:00:32.610> inches<00:00:32.640> wide<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.450> it's

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
inches by three inches wide and it's

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.600 
inches by three inches wide and it's
lacquered<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.680> goes<00:00:34.860> from<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
lacquered and it goes from the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.520 
lacquered and it goes from the
countertop<00:00:36.149> all<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.750> way<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.110> floor<00:00:37.230> so

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
countertop all the way to the floor so

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.440 
countertop all the way to the floor so
it<00:00:37.620> looks<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.920> table<00:00:38.309> leg<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.879> order<00:00:39.329> to

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
it looks like a table leg in order to

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.420 
it looks like a table leg in order to
make<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.750> read<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.440> three<00:00:40.770> dimensions<00:00:41.250> we

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
make this read in three dimensions we

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.180 
make this read in three dimensions we
have<00:00:41.460> setback<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.840> gable<00:00:43.260> ends<00:00:43.680> about<00:00:44.010> an

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
have setback the gable ends about an

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.430 
have setback the gable ends about an
inch<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.879> pops<00:00:45.210> out<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:46.110> other<00:00:46.230> thing

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
inch so this pops out the other thing

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.420 
inch so this pops out the other thing
that<00:00:46.559> we've<00:00:46.680> done<00:00:46.710> which<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.190> really

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
that we've done which is really

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.900 
that we've done which is really
interesting

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
interesting

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.240 
interesting
zoomed<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.050> right<00:00:49.260> here<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.620> we've<00:00:49.770> created<00:00:49.980> a

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
zoomed in right here is we've created a

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.459 
zoomed in right here is we've created a
bit<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.579> reveal<00:00:51.030> between<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> three-quarter

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
bit of a reveal between a three-quarter

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.069 
bit of a reveal between a three-quarter
inch<00:00:52.500> counter<00:00:53.070> top<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.730> top<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.719> leg

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
inch counter top and the top of this leg

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.080 
inch counter top and the top of this leg
to<00:00:55.590> make<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.949> countertop<00:00:56.430> look<00:00:56.730> like<00:00:56.910> it's

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
to make the countertop look like it's

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.760 
to make the countertop look like it's
floating<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:58.020> other<00:00:58.170> thing<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.649> pay

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
floating the other thing to pay

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.470 
floating the other thing to pay
attention<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> toe<00:00:59.730> kick<00:00:59.940> because<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
attention to is the toe kick because the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.270 
attention to is the toe kick because the
toe<00:01:00.660> kick<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.170> we've<00:01:01.620> done<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> same

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
toe kick here we've done in the same

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.640 
toe kick here we've done in the same
redwood<00:01:02.969> as<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.629> floating<00:01:03.960> mill<00:01:04.229> workpiece

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
redwood as this floating mill workpiece

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.289 
redwood as this floating mill workpiece
which<00:01:04.860> divides<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> living<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.850> dining<00:01:06.000> room

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
which divides the living and dining room

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.390 
which divides the living and dining room
from<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.869> kitchen<00:01:06.900> well<00:01:07.770> that's<00:01:07.920> one<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
from the kitchen well that's one of the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.950 
from the kitchen well that's one of the
island<00:01:08.729> details<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.210> let's<00:01:09.360> come<00:01:09.570> around<00:01:09.600> and

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
island details so let's come around and

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.330 
island details so let's come around and
look<00:01:10.049> at<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.200> other<00:01:10.380> islands<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> other

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
look at the other islands so the other

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.120 
look at the other islands so the other
island<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.869> red<00:01:13.140> mahogany<00:01:13.380> wood<00:01:13.920> and

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
island is in this red mahogany wood and

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.460 
island is in this red mahogany wood and
it's<00:01:14.250> legs<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:14.700> slightly<00:01:15.090> different<00:01:15.390> we<00:01:16.290> have

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
it's legs are slightly different we have

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.499 
it's legs are slightly different we have
a<00:01:16.500> wider<00:01:16.920> leg<00:01:17.340> here<00:01:17.670> because<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.150> wanted<00:01:18.450> to

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
a wider leg here because we wanted to

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.899 
a wider leg here because we wanted to
include<00:01:18.900> our<00:01:19.229> electrical<00:01:19.950> outlets<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
include our electrical outlets on the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:21.649 
include our electrical outlets on the
side<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.180> it

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
side of it

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.080 
side of it
so<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.799> more<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.280> utilitarian

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
so this is just more of a utilitarian

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.760 
so this is just more of a utilitarian
leg<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.540> comes<00:01:24.720> all<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> way<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.500> ground

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
leg that comes all the way to the ground

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.950 
leg that comes all the way to the ground
and<00:01:26.040> then<00:01:26.490> our<00:01:26.640> cabinetry<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.299> set<00:01:27.509> back<00:01:27.659> not

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
and then our cabinetry is set back not

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.270 
and then our cabinetry is set back not
as<00:01:28.170> much<00:01:28.350> as<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> other<00:01:28.740> one<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:28.979> about

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
as much as the other one just about

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.440 
as much as the other one just about
three<00:01:29.610> quarters<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.000> an<00:01:30.210> inch

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
three quarters of an inch
