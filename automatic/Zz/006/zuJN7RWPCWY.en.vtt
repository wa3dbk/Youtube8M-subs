00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.580
 what to remember from this match we felt that 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.570
 it lacked peps of bread beach 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.760
 of inspiration sometimes remember not big 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.310
 thing if only congratulate our 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.670
 adversary so who did them a good 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.930
 match 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.490
 so that's a lot more impact than 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.440
 we and then as we could not 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.750
 put our game in place in the 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.810
 difference is logical here is a 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.449
 explanation to that heavy people 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.949
 implications explanations first the 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.440
 value of the amiens team so who at 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.870
 cam what was needed so for us 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.940
 to annoy us a lot of aggressiveness 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.379
 especially in the first half so this 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.710
 what is legitimate 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:51.690
 who is good and we face sÃ¨te 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.460
 this aggressiveness we could not get out 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.319
 is reassembled on the pressure we made 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.749
 a lot of unusual mistakes missed 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:01:00.420
 of mobility so face sÃ¨te 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:01.799
 facing this pressure is therefore inevitably 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.969
 the balance of power has reversed 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:05.519
 they have the chance to open the score 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.110
 soon enough so that's no, but I think 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.950
 that deserved everything just from him 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.960
 as his victory that spoke of 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.050
 possible overconfidence on the part 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.720
 from the harbor 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.920
 yes and no no I think today 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.190
 we had too many players who were 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.760
 really below their value so 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:29.230
 especially to especially so indoors 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:31.490
 we had too much waste inside 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.630
 lack of control which makes one 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.210
 can not put our game in place 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.560
 so what makes sense here what 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.030
 balance sheet you pull your preparation that's 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.980
 the first defeat of your matches 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.450
 friendly which final balance sheet the balance sheet the 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.370
 balance is that we still have a lot 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.610
 work to be done 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:53.840
 so that's what we know so we need to 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.450
 it's almost a new season but 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.900
 a blank page so a talk of 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.390
 acquired or my choice not acquired so this 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.980
 it is necessary to start the championship 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.630
 and see a little bit about how 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.630
 will be able to address it so 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.560
 on this match we missed we missed 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.160
 freshness so lacking aggressiveness this 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.480
 which is more embarrassing that we will try to 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.849
 correct the shot before starting the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.750
 championship in strength and liveliness 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.010
 that's his strength and attack him 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.360
 first you have to have a better 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.730
 control that to reinforce the attacked 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.989
 because the attacker needs to have 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.450
 good balloons today nothing has not had 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.860
 enough 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.910
 you speak of mastery it's a match 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.090
 friendly this is the first time we see 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.440
 the hac undergone a settlement since sir 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.140
 championship friendly matches included 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.019
 this is the first time he's first 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.370
 because because we quickly let go 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:53.700
 because lack of character also a 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.370
 little our part especially inside at 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.370
 inside I expect a lot more 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.620
 our players so cadre who who have to 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.190
 better control this kind of situation 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.769
 but hey it's not going very well and has 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.640
 not passed like that lack of mobility 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.470
 also from all of our team so 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.030
 not everything is based on it today 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.030
 I did not have any necessarily 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.700
 we can not develop our game I will 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.829
 I will not say that again when we can 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.150
 not develop our game bah it's not 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.849
 with the templates we've got 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.319
 power for example stood out against 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.989
 amiens who has other others 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:35.640
 player characteristics so here you go 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:37.620
 today it's this finding so has it to 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.970
 many very athletic players who 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.739
 have taken over in a lot of 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.629
 domains we have to have other 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.489
 virtues of other qualities it is our 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:48.739
 players who are like that like we did 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.739
 could not play on his qualities there and well 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:56.450
 it's logical that amiens and could switch 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.959
 the balance of power in his favor 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.709
 of course she is always difficult 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.419
 it's still a lot of arguments 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.510
 to boost the troops before before 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:09.090
 this first day live the tare 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.280
 in the speech maybe troops are going 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.989
 we want to boost a little more than they are 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.470
 boosted today but there is some 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.390
 tired 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.390
 there are players 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:25.919
 I would not want for example some 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:27.810
 like walid as like roman suffers 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.810
 adductors so what annoys me a 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.270
 little what compared to the balance sheet of at 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.169
 report of this meeting 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.850
 greedy we saw a rac team in 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.539
 difficulty or even very great 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:43.080
 difficulty tonight we saw it should 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:45.330
 that the result there is no there no 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.910
 miracle when it's rare when we play 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.380
 badly that we manage to win a match 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.840
 so far passed tonight so after aulas 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.669
 do not question everything either 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.180
 we all missed our match 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:02.820
 so we'll have to do the debrief 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:06.360
 as early as Sunday to see what did 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.490
 not work and try to solve 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.720
 these problems and that's better 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.340
 maybe it happens on a match of 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.680
 prepa that on the beginning of the championship 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.720
 so now we have one more 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.590
 week to prepare well for the 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.030
 moving 2 arles avignon is from 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.560
 do everything to start well 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.610
 championship 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.599
 seen from above we felt right away 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.650
 that you were not in the game is this 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.699
 that you too on the ground as early as 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.009
 first few minutes you're told there's no 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.349
 is not 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:31.870
 here we have felt ben 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:34.300
 to warm up that 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:38.500
 the legs were a little bit the other is a 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:41.530
 problem with with the bus where we arrived 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.130
 a little late so we had to try 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.470
 to quickly get into the match on 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.969
 is a little bad at first even a lot 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.199
 so after 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:56.199
 that we have a lot of running 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:59.349
 sometimes even an evil 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:02.469
 after it's a gear and it's 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:06.699
 difficult to get out of it so there you have to 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:09.159
 shoot something from this match is 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:11.409
 not to question everything because 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:15.129
 that it is a match of preparation even 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:16.929
 if these and so here is a good 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:19.509
 slap in preparation is it that can 

00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:22.749
 to be salvateur that yeah no but it's 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:26.079
 true because until now we had 

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:29.079
 managed to make good matches against 

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:30.669
 teams of the same level as us and 

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:32.169
 there to take a slap in front of a 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:35.319
 lower team that shows us that 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:37.719
 here we must we must respect 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:40.149
 also our opponents whoever they are 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:43.329
 be they from our level 

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:46.029
 from the lower level so now to 

00:06:43.329 --> 00:06:49.089
 we do the right thing during the 

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:53.439
 week we have left for all 

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:57.569
 put everything back in place and make it a 

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:57.569
 good result in arles avignon
