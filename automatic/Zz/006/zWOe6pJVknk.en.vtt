first<00:00:02.850> of<00:00:03.000> all<00:00:03.090> we'll<00:00:03.510> take<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:03.750> look<00:00:03.990> at<00:00:04.290> how<00:00:04.470> a

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
first of all we'll take a look at how a

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.990 
first of all we'll take a look at how a
drift<00:00:04.859> machine<00:00:05.009> should<00:00:05.460> be<00:00:05.520> tuned<00:00:05.790> and

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
drift machine should be tuned and

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.259 
drift machine should be tuned and
modified<00:00:06.450> looking<00:00:07.290> at<00:00:07.379> this<00:00:07.529> s14<00:00:08.400> Sylvia<00:00:08.849> with

modified looking at this s14 Sylvia with
limited<00:00:09.660> modifications<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.679> only<00:00:10.860> the

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
limited modifications to only the

limited modifications to only the
suspension<00:00:11.700> area<00:00:12.000> you<00:00:12.690> can<00:00:12.840> say<00:00:13.019> that

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
suspension area you can say that

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.620 
suspension area you can say that
drifting<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:13.740> not<00:00:14.099> about<00:00:14.340> power<00:00:14.630> goin

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
drifting is not about power goin

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.050 
drifting is not about power goin

sideways relying on only brute power is

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.140 
sideways relying on only brute power is
not<00:00:18.330> what<00:00:18.539> sukiya<00:00:18.930> age<00:00:19.199> for<00:00:19.820> so<00:00:20.820> how<00:00:20.970> should

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
not what sukiya age for so how should

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.970 
not what sukiya age for so how should
the<00:00:21.240> beginner<00:00:21.570> set<00:00:22.109> up<00:00:22.199> his<00:00:22.380> or<00:00:22.560> her<00:00:22.680> machine

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
the beginner set up his or her machine

the beginner set up his or her machine
to<00:00:23.369> trip<00:00:23.699> like<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.180> king<00:00:27.439> okay<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:28.830> what's<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
to trip like the king okay so what's the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.250 
to trip like the king okay so what's the
least<00:00:29.910> amount<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.300> tuning<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.720> need<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.990> drift

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
least amount of tuning you need to drift

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260 
least amount of tuning you need to drift
we<00:00:31.949> had<00:00:32.070> lots<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.399> stuff<00:00:32.640> done<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.910> our<00:00:33.059> car

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
we had lots of stuff done to our car

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.880 
we had lots of stuff done to our car
right<00:00:33.510> here<00:00:33.540> but<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.469> don't<00:00:34.590> need<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.710> go<00:00:34.860> all

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
right here but you don't need to go all

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.000 
right here but you don't need to go all
crazy<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.790> start<00:00:36.059> drifting<00:00:36.440> first<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.590> all<00:00:37.680> you

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
crazy to start drifting first of all you

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.490 
crazy to start drifting first of all you
have<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.820> start<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.210> suspension<00:00:39.660> but<00:00:40.379> then

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
have to start with a suspension but then

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.869 
have to start with a suspension but then
you<00:00:40.620> should<00:00:40.770> also<00:00:40.860> change<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> brake<00:00:41.640> pads

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
you should also change the brake pads

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.959 
you should also change the brake pads
and<00:00:42.090> brake<00:00:42.270> fluid<00:00:42.600> that's<00:00:43.260> about<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.010> if

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
and brake fluid that's about it and if

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.549 
and brake fluid that's about it and if
you're<00:00:45.270> lucky<00:00:45.420> enough<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.930> be<00:00:46.050> able<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.350> spend

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
you're lucky enough to be able to spend

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.069 
you're lucky enough to be able to spend
some<00:00:46.829> more<00:00:46.950> upgrading<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.940> CPU<00:00:48.510> exhaust

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079

sideways and then we'll try what's

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.380 
sideways and then we'll try what's

I<00:05:18.770> used<00:05:19.770> to<00:05:19.920> do<00:05:20.040> this<00:05:20.190> when<00:05:20.400> I<00:05:20.460> couldn't<00:05:20.880> drift

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
I used to do this when I couldn't drift

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.510 
I used to do this when I couldn't drift
yet<00:05:21.330> I<00:05:21.540> break<00:05:22.140> like<00:05:22.380> this<00:05:22.410> and<00:05:22.890> try<00:05:23.100> to<00:05:23.160> drift

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
yet I break like this and try to drift

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.340 
yet I break like this and try to drift
but<00:05:24.030> I<00:05:24.090> couldn't<00:05:24.510> because<00:05:24.570> I<00:05:24.900> was<00:05:25.050> too<00:05:25.200> scared

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
but I couldn't because I was too scared

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.740 
but I couldn't because I was too scared
so<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:26.370> only<00:05:26.490> thing<00:05:26.610> I<00:05:26.790> could<00:05:26.850> do<00:05:27.120> was<00:05:27.150> to<00:05:27.540> step

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
so the only thing I could do was to step

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.330
