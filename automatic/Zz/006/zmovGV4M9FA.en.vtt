00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.430
 collect enemies from youtube well 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:14.510
 welcome to a new tutorial les 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:16.340
 speak as always this is what today 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.700
 let's learn are those functions 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.070
 that allows us the keyboard of a laptop 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.110
 this video I do because many of 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.960
 you do not know what the 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.240
 true keyboard functions or 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.350
 some keys that we do not know why 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.900
 they serve without more words let's start and 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.570
 Well, here we are already on a laptop 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.089
 and good as I told you these 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.449
 keyboards always bring a key that 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:47.989
 it's also on these keyboards and the key 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:52.129
 is this that is fn that means function 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:55.460
 and well then on f2 and f3 depending 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.699
 the model brings some icons like these 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.150
 what they do is depending on the 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.820
 model is how these icons look good 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.180
 what they do and how they are activated 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.020
 correctly is with the function key 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.020
 fn 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.380
 what we have to do is type the and 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.860
 at the same time without releasing our key 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.229
 to tighten what would be the 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.500
 icon depending on us what 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:28.069
 We want it to be active and turn off the 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.100
 wireless as we can see here and the 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:33.890
 off and that way then what 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.229
 learn and well then here is also 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.439
 for usually it always has the 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.150
 raise and lower the brightness as we can 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.570
 see here 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.870
 it also brings when we connect to our 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.080
 screen here comes and also brings 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.260
 this function to turn our 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.140
 there we paid for it and there the 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:01.070
 we face again as we can see 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.260
 brings different different icons this 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.260
 to increase the volume are basically 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.410
 the basics and apart from those that already brings 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.350
 inside our computer also in 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.040

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.040
