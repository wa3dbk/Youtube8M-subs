octonaut video of the GUP art this was
from<00:00:11.719> the<00:00:11.960> UK<00:00:12.440> so<00:00:12.500> we<00:00:12.830> had<00:00:13.190> to<00:00:13.429> order<00:00:13.730> it<00:00:13.969> online

00:00:25.389 --> 00:00:25.399 
there's the other gulps the gup-d gup-b

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:30.700 
there's the other gulps the gup-d gup-b
got<00:00:26.180> eath<00:00:26.540> and<00:00:27.110> got<00:00:27.320> see<00:00:28.779> it<00:00:29.779> shows<00:00:30.079> it<00:00:30.500> has

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
sail pops up so we'll check that out

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.590 
sail pops up so we'll check that out
I'll<00:00:57.829> be<00:00:57.890> right<00:00:58.070> back

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
okay I open it and here's Kwazii of his

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.710 
okay I open it and here's Kwazii of his
helmet<00:01:02.810> on

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:18.520 

and<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.590> swordfish<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:14.880> years<00:01:15.420> look<00:01:16.230> up<00:01:16.500> our

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
and the swordfish it years look up our

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.760 
and the swordfish it years look up our
so<00:01:19.700> this<00:01:20.700> one<00:01:21.000> shielded<00:01:21.570> him<00:01:21.720> put<00:01:22.020> down<00:01:22.050> and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
so this one shielded him put down and

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:33.070 
so this one shielded him put down and
then<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:30.420> pointy<00:01:31.110> part<00:01:31.340> it

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
then the the the the the pointy part it

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.740 
then the the the the the pointy part it
flips<00:01:34.080> out<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.060> then<00:01:36.920> these<00:01:37.920> thing<00:01:38.750> these

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
flips out and then these thing these

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.940 
flips out and then these thing these
jets<00:01:40.410> it<00:01:41.070> had<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.730> Octonauts<00:01:42.240> symbol<00:01:45.950> and

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
jets it had the Octonauts symbol and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.280 
jets it had the Octonauts symbol and

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
then I think you press this down and

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.920 
then I think you press this down and
then<00:01:49.500> de<00:01:49.770> snow<00:01:50.670> pops<00:01:50.940> up<00:01:51.150> just<00:01:51.360> see<00:01:51.750> what<00:01:51.900> I

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
then de snow pops up just see what I

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.040 
then de snow pops up just see what I
gotta<00:01:52.200> put<00:01:53.750> it<00:01:54.750> down<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.800> then

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
gotta put it down like that and then

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.860 
gotta put it down like that and then
pops<00:01:58.050> up<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:01.490> those<00:02:02.490> there's<00:02:03.030> only<00:02:03.330> two

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
pops up and those there's only two

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.389 
pops up and those there's only two
features<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.830> it<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:06.110> you<00:02:07.110> can<00:02:07.290> put<00:02:07.560> quasi

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
features of it and you can put quasi

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.930 
features of it and you can put quasi
yeah<00:02:09.240> Anika<00:02:10.050> doc<00:02:10.260> so<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:11.280> about<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.580> rescue

pop-up dorsal fin and wings that lower
for<00:02:55.650> hydroplane<00:02:56.370> mode<00:02:56.670> well<00:02:57.659> that<00:02:57.780> must<00:02:57.959> be<00:02:58.049> a

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
for hydroplane mode well that must be a

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.479 
for hydroplane mode well that must be a
say<00:02:58.739> this<00:02:58.890> must<00:02:59.099> be<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.310> sailfish<00:03:01.250> yeah<00:03:02.250> it's

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
say this must be a sailfish yeah it's

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.099 
say this must be a sailfish yeah it's
not<00:03:02.609> definitely<00:03:02.940> not<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.090> swordfish<00:03:03.569> probably
