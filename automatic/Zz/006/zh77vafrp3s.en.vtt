00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:11.629
 You're one of those who loves heart but 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.699
 do not know the difference between edf and mdp in 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.830
 time to compose your environment 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:18.410
 we went up to the new sc 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.010
 for all doubts 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.010
 accompany 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.480
 O 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.680
 I lost 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.210
 is 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.960
 ef 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.460
 nowadays it is increasingly difficult 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.369
 find furniture in wood and when 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.009
 we found the price is k there salty 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.509
 As a solution the furniture market brings 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:18.180
 a good option the MDF and mpt about it 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.880
 on the island bittencour the furniture 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.640
 contemporary take our doubts 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.799
 Hi guys, today I 'm here to 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.130
 talk a little more to you about 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.470
 difference of mdf and idp 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.729
 so what happens to the basic difference 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.270
 between the two is in the acronym faith in the acronym 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.840
 P 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.479
 the ne10 means medium density api 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.729
 so the mdf are wood fibers 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.619
 medium density and the mdp are 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.960
 wood particles 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.810
 so the basic difference between 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.880
 they are the amount of raw material that 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.520
 is within the material but the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.670
 resistance of each other tests that 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.860
 we do in the factory with the two are 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.140
 only banks are made the same tests as 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.579
 guarantee is the same what changes is the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.459
 use 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:12.209
 mdp we can use more in 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.799
 tops we can make doors are sound 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.540
 products that led to more use 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.620
 straight lines you do not need to do 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.340
 body 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.560
 mdf not mpf it is more used 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.070
 for machining which means only 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.579
 machining can detail 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.079
 in wood boff the padded tips 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.910
 as I have this example here one 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.930
 door that little boy that has this detail 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.650
 of an image 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.260
 we only allow in the mdf that is in the fiber 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.000
 if it were done the dt the mini particles 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.660
 do not allow me this koff 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.930
 so details of a fairy details 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.049
 from d 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.900
 in the case of lists or cuts even if 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:56.079
 you have to make it much easier for you 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.230
 doing the mdf than in mp but the 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.269
 use the durability and the 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.170
 as I said before is the same 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.790
 so forget that mdp is not legal 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.219
 that people should not use in 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.189
 Sometimes closets are even more interesting 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:14.560
 because the particles work more 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.969
 so I found more space to work and 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.730
 when you put a lot of weight on 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:21.579
 shelf and suddenly it goes on - 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.519
 so it depends a lot on the place that you 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.889
 will use the product in not stay with 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.290
 idea that mgf is much higher than 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:31.180
 I have in time what this myth is already 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:43.780
 We have to work the 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:44.590
 product in place of the inner 4a or the 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.590
 external 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.879
 both are interesting in the composition of 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.629
 environment 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:56.650
 some cuts and details are specific 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:04:00.190
 of these materials there was a good idea 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.859
 of team by md thinks no particle 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.349
 it would be nice if they used the kitchen or 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:08.349
 because it was wetted area resistance 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.810
 smaller but this here but no longer exists 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.629
 because the infected material of 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.900
 factory then so all the feet that are 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:19.930
 made in mdp and mdf the resistance to 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.780
 People use a tape to reveal the water. 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.509
 that she is a people so you can 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.449
 use in the kitchen or in an area 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:30.250
 wet both mdf and dp 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.229
 the only difference will really be 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.509
 so in your kitchen you will want 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.630
 cushioned doors or in some detail 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:41.729
 amd machining of mp will not allow 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.889
 this is your image of the material only in 10 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:48.020
 but it's you can opt for the in of your 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.020
 andef calming anyone of the 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:59.370
 clear that the architects have always 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.349
 his good architect recommendations he has 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.960
 this idea actually formulated the 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:08.069
 architect he does not there sometimes the client 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.960
 not live with the material and 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:12.629
 without this idea is that the independent 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.430
 left but access is not that it has not 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:17.729
 this idea so sometimes even to 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.830
 you cheapen the cost as rdp it has 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.050
 a lower raw material concentration 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.229
 and consequently the value of ea 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.689
 inferior is not very much but it is a 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.389
 suddenly a large amount of project 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.860
 you will get a reduction until 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.110
 suitable for customer's pocket 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.360
 then up to several times the penalty if 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.969
 Do you want to close your whole apartment? 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.610
 want to do it all the way side that has 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:43.409
 guarantee that you will work with 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.999
 the assembly industry with everyone 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.310
 will not have that problem 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:49.289
 delay and everything then sometimes it 's up to 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.770
 more interaction of working with mp 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:56.520
 but the architect has a lot of 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:00.889
 quality and be a fan dp is there is not 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.889
 it's a distinct thing to tell us 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.780
 zeca 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.970
