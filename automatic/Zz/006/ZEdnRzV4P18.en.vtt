one of these misconceptions out there I

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.050 
one of these misconceptions out there I
don't<00:00:27.750> know<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.380> policy<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.060> specifically

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
don't know of a policy that specifically

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.479 
don't know of a policy that specifically
excludes<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:31.199> use<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.500> automotive<00:00:32.009> fuel<00:00:32.250> if

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
excludes the use of automotive fuel if

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.370 
excludes the use of automotive fuel if
it's<00:00:32.700> approved<00:00:33.000> for<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.300> airplane<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.989> even

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
it's approved for the airplane and even

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.870 
it's approved for the airplane and even

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
if it's not approved for the airplane I

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.569 
if it's not approved for the airplane I
can't<00:00:36.780> think<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.200> point<00:00:37.500> where<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:38.340> would<00:00:38.460> be

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
can't think of a point where it would be

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.220 
can't think of a point where it would be
excluded<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.329> event<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.690> loss<00:00:39.870> now

by the fuel itself in other words to the
engine<00:00:55.640> you<00:00:56.640> know<00:00:56.699> one<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.210> things<00:00:57.390> out

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
engine you know one of the things out

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.760 
engine you know one of the things out
there<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:57.930> you'll<00:00:58.079> start<00:00:58.260> having<00:00:58.440> valve

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
there is that you'll start having valve

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.430 
there is that you'll start having valve
sticking<00:00:59.489> that<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.660> foul<00:01:00.870> up<00:01:01.050> parts<00:01:01.379> of

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
sticking that it can foul up parts of

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.479 
sticking that it can foul up parts of
the<00:01:01.500> engine<00:01:01.649> that's<00:01:01.829> what<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.280> talking

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
the engine that's what it's talking

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.009 
the engine that's what it's talking
about<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.030> policy<00:01:03.449> as<00:01:03.539> far<00:01:03.719> as<00:01:03.840> not

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
about in the policy as far as not

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.460 
about in the policy as far as not
covering<00:01:04.409> however<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.930> cannot<00:01:06.930> think<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.350> a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
covering however I cannot think of a

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.649 
covering however I cannot think of a
point<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:07.979> any<00:01:08.159> policy<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.670> says<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.060> cannot

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
point in any policy that says you cannot

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.840 
point in any policy that says you cannot
use<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.080> or<00:01:10.260> if<00:01:10.380> there<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.650> an<00:01:10.830> accident<00:01:11.430> due<00:01:11.640> to

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
use it or if there is an accident due to

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.300 
use it or if there is an accident due to
the<00:01:11.970> use<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.530> won't<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.890> covered

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
the use of it that it won't be covered

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.330 
the use of it that it won't be covered
so<00:01:14.570> we<00:01:15.570> run<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.930> pretty<00:01:16.439> frequently<00:01:16.979> it's

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
so we run it pretty frequently it's

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.770 
so we run it pretty frequently it's
cheaper<00:01:17.790> it's<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.360> proof<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
cheaper it's it's a proof for the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.749 
cheaper it's it's a proof for the
airplane<00:01:19.110> haven't<00:01:19.590> seen<00:01:19.770> any<00:01:19.979> issues<00:01:20.189> with<00:01:20.610> it
