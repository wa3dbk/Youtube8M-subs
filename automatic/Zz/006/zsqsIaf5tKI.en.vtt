I<00:01:57.459> hit<00:01:57.759> it<00:01:57.789> for<00:01:58.110> 249<00:01:59.220> then<00:02:00.220> right<00:02:01.000> here<00:02:03.000> 1071

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
I hit it for 249 then right here 1071

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.240 
I hit it for 249 then right here 1071
that's<00:02:04.629> a<00:02:04.750> big<00:02:05.170> difference<00:02:05.590> in<00:02:05.739> damage<00:02:06.069> that's

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
that's a big difference in damage that's

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.240 
that's a big difference in damage that's
a<00:02:06.369> very<00:02:06.759> very<00:02:07.420> big<00:02:07.750> difference<00:02:07.929> in<00:02:08.229> damage<00:02:08.379> now

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
a very very big difference in damage now

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.400 
a very very big difference in damage now
what<00:02:09.580> was<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.970> cause<00:02:10.209> for<00:02:10.239> that<00:02:10.509> my

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
what was the cause for that my

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.430 
what was the cause for that my
distancing<00:02:12.270> distancing<00:02:13.270> is<00:02:13.480> key<00:02:13.870> with<00:02:14.260> this

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
distancing distancing is key with this

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.619 
distancing distancing is key with this
weapon<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.580> previous<00:02:16.000> showcase<00:02:16.450> I

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
weapon in a previous showcase I

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.569 
weapon in a previous showcase I
mentioned<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.319> there<00:02:17.560> are<00:02:17.680> sweet<00:02:18.010> spots<00:02:18.310> and

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
mentioned that there are sweet spots and

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:19.990 
mentioned that there are sweet spots and
certain<00:02:19.030> weapons<00:02:19.359> and<00:02:19.569> this

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
certain weapons and this

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.180 
certain weapons and this
is<00:02:20.240> a<00:02:20.570> prime<00:02:20.960> example<00:02:20.990> of<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.680> weapon<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:22.070> has

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
is a prime example of a weapon that has

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.140 
is a prime example of a weapon that has
a<00:02:22.490> sweet<00:02:22.790> spot<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:24.140> sweet<00:02:24.380> spot<00:02:24.620> being<00:02:25.150> just

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
a sweet spot the sweet spot being just

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.850 
a sweet spot the sweet spot being just
the<00:02:26.300> tip<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.900> want<00:02:27.020> to<00:02:27.140> hit<00:02:27.230> with<00:02:27.410> just<00:02:27.710> the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
the tip you want to hit with just the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.610 
the tip you want to hit with just the
tip<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:28.220> get<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.150> little<00:02:29.420> pokey<00:02:29.780> spear<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.500> go

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
tip and get the little pokey spear to go

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.310 
tip and get the little pokey spear to go
out<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.100> I<00:02:31.640> think<00:02:31.880> their<00:02:32.150> idea<00:02:32.390> behind<00:02:32.840> this

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
out and I think their idea behind this

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.200 
out and I think their idea behind this
weapon<00:02:33.680> is<00:02:33.860> that<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.400> would<00:02:34.520> hit<00:02:34.640> them<00:02:34.850> with

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
weapon is that you would hit them with

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.990 
weapon is that you would hit them with
the<00:02:35.480> prongs<00:02:35.830> they<00:02:36.830> would<00:02:37.010> spread<00:02:37.370> out<00:02:37.520> causing

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
the prongs they would spread out causing

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.400 
the prongs they would spread out causing
more<00:02:38.209> damage<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.720> then<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.930> spear<00:02:39.260> would

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
more damage and then the spear would

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.410 
more damage and then the spear would
stab<00:02:39.709> into<00:02:40.100> cause<00:02:40.280> even<00:02:40.760> more<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:40.970> think<00:02:41.090> that's

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
stab into cause even more I think that's

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.140 
stab into cause even more I think that's
their<00:02:41.660> concept<00:02:42.380> behind<00:02:42.640> why<00:02:43.640> this<00:02:43.850> weapon

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
their concept behind why this weapon

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.650 
their concept behind why this weapon
works<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.720> way<00:02:44.840> it<00:02:44.959> does<00:02:45.310> but<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:47.450> being

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
works the way it does but that being

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.530 
works the way it does but that being
said<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:48.260> don't<00:02:48.980> know<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.459> mean<00:02:50.240> that's<00:02:50.360> what

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
said I don't know I mean that's what

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.940 
said I don't know I mean that's what
makes<00:02:50.660> sense<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.080> me<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.470> why<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.650> would<00:02:51.860> do

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
makes sense to me and why it would do

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.160 
makes sense to me and why it would do
that<00:02:52.100> and<00:02:52.400> maybe<00:02:53.180> if<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:53.480> even<00:02:53.750> slow<00:02:54.020> it<00:02:54.050> down

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
that and maybe if you even slow it down

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.870 
that and maybe if you even slow it down
to<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.560> frame<00:02:54.860> by<00:02:55.010> frame<00:02:55.040> you<00:02:55.400> can<00:02:55.520> see<00:02:55.580> the

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
to a frame by frame you can see the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.180 
to a frame by frame you can see the
damage<00:02:56.060> build<00:02:56.570> up<00:02:56.780> like<00:02:57.020> that<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.470> really<00:02:58.010> don't

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
damage build up like that I really don't

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.949 
damage build up like that I really don't
know<00:02:58.459> I<00:02:58.489> don't<00:02:59.000> feel<00:02:59.060> like<00:02:59.209> trying<00:02:59.570> to<00:02:59.720> check

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
know I don't feel like trying to check

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.290 
know I don't feel like trying to check
that<00:03:00.110> out<00:03:00.260> but<00:03:00.530> if<00:03:01.160> any<00:03:01.340> of<00:03:01.459> you<00:03:01.580> guys<00:03:01.760> do<00:03:02.150> know

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
that out but if any of you guys do know

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.020 
that out but if any of you guys do know
that<00:03:02.330> or<00:03:02.750> when<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.020> PC<00:03:03.350> release<00:03:03.500> comes<00:03:04.000> get<00:03:05.000> a

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
that or when the PC release comes get a

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.150 
that or when the PC release comes get a
good<00:03:05.540> look<00:03:05.660> into<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.959> code<00:03:06.140> let<00:03:06.800> me<00:03:06.920> know<00:03:07.010> what

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
good look into the code let me know what

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.800 
good look into the code let me know what
you<00:03:07.250> think<00:03:07.370> about<00:03:07.580> that<00:03:07.790> because<00:03:08.239> that's<00:03:08.540> my

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
opinion in there and honestly it makes

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.510 
opinion in there and honestly it makes

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
not really it just timed out but that's

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.039 
not really it just timed out but that's
what<00:04:15.170> it<00:04:15.260> looks<00:04:15.410> like<00:04:15.590> so<00:04:15.709> it's<00:04:15.860> kind<00:04:16.040> of<00:04:16.070> cool

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
what it looks like so it's kind of cool

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.530 
what it looks like so it's kind of cool
anyone<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:19.700> fight<00:04:19.880> someone<00:04:20.180> using<00:04:20.450> this

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
weapon you need to stay right on top of

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.260 
weapon you need to stay right on top of
them<00:04:23.150> and

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
them and

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.080 
them and
and<00:04:24.810> just<00:04:25.050> make<00:04:25.289> sure<00:04:25.319> that<00:04:25.530> you're<00:04:26.190> right

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
against them using a weapon with low

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.920 
against them using a weapon with low
range<00:04:30.479> say<00:04:31.380> like<00:04:31.620> a<00:04:31.650> battle<00:04:32.069> ax<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.520> mace<00:04:32.930> that

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
range say like a battle ax and mace that

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.570 
range say like a battle ax and mace that
would<00:04:34.139> be<00:04:34.259> ideal<00:04:34.440> for<00:04:34.740> fighting<00:04:35.220> this<00:04:35.310> as

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
would be ideal for fighting this as

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.219 
would be ideal for fighting this as
strange<00:04:36.060> as<00:04:36.210> that<00:04:36.240> sounds<00:04:36.599> because<00:04:37.050> that

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
strange as that sounds because that

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.260 
strange as that sounds because that
requires<00:04:37.380> you<00:04:37.710> to<00:04:37.740> be<00:04:37.860> close<00:04:38.220> it<00:04:38.849> puts<00:04:39.090> you<00:04:39.240> in

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
requires you to be close it puts you in

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.870 
requires you to be close it puts you in
your<00:04:39.419> optimal<00:04:40.050> range<00:04:40.259> and<00:04:40.470> them<00:04:40.680> out<00:04:41.430> of<00:04:41.699> their

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
your optimal range and them out of their

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.050 
your optimal range and them out of their
optimal<00:04:42.330> range<00:04:42.620> so<00:04:43.620> that's<00:04:44.550> always<00:04:44.789> a<00:04:44.910> good

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
optimal range so that's always a good

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.110 
optimal range so that's always a good
thing<00:04:45.560> now<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.919> biggest<00:04:47.099> Pro<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:47.610> weapon<00:04:47.910> of

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
thing now the biggest Pro the weapon of

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.969 
thing now the biggest Pro the weapon of
course<00:04:48.780> it's<00:04:49.050> going<00:04:49.229> to<00:04:49.380> be<00:04:49.500> that<00:04:49.650> our<00:04:49.800> to

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
course it's going to be that our to

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:51.320 
course it's going to be that our to
attack<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.520> amount<00:04:50.699> of<00:04:50.759> damage<00:04:51.120> it<00:04:51.240> can

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
attack and the amount of damage it can

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.020 
attack and the amount of damage it can
do<00:04:51.509> it's<00:04:52.110> also<00:04:52.289> very<00:04:52.680> deceiving<00:04:53.130> in<00:04:53.550> how<00:04:53.849> much

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
do it's also very deceiving in how much

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.760 
do it's also very deceiving in how much
damage<00:04:54.330> it<00:04:54.509> can<00:04:54.630> do<00:04:54.750> because<00:04:54.990> people<00:04:55.590> will

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
damage it can do because people will

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.170 
damage it can do because people will
look<00:04:55.949> at<00:04:56.039> this<00:04:56.160> thing<00:04:56.400> they'll<00:04:56.699> see<00:04:56.849> it's<00:04:57.000> got

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
look at this thing they'll see it's got

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.879 
look at this thing they'll see it's got
a<00:04:57.210> low<00:04:57.479> base<00:04:57.720> damage<00:04:58.229> doesn't<00:04:58.530> really<00:04:58.710> have

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
a low base damage doesn't really have

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.050 
a low base damage doesn't really have
much<00:04:58.919> in<00:04:59.220> the<00:04:59.250> way<00:04:59.310> of<00:04:59.490> scaling<00:04:59.759> and<00:04:59.909> they'll

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
much in the way of scaling and they'll

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.640 
much in the way of scaling and they'll
be<00:05:00.150> like<00:05:00.270> oh<00:05:00.419> yeah<00:05:00.720> whatever<00:05:01.020> not<00:05:01.380> really

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
be like oh yeah whatever not really

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.249 
be like oh yeah whatever not really
worth<00:05:01.800> my<00:05:01.949> time<00:05:02.330> but<00:05:03.330> it<00:05:03.449> really<00:05:03.479> is<00:05:04.080> a<00:05:04.110> very

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
worth my time but it really is a very

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.770 
worth my time but it really is a very
dangerous<00:05:04.830> weapon<00:05:05.370> and<00:05:05.669> people<00:05:06.479> wouldn't

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
dangerous weapon and people wouldn't

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.140 
dangerous weapon and people wouldn't
expect<00:05:07.020> it<00:05:07.169> so<00:05:07.319> that's<00:05:07.470> kind<00:05:07.680> of<00:05:07.740> cool

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
expect it so that's kind of cool

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.600 
expect it so that's kind of cool
um<00:05:09.150> biggest<00:05:09.930> town<00:05:10.169> of<00:05:10.289> the<00:05:10.349> weapon<00:05:10.650> I<00:05:10.830> would

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
um biggest town of the weapon I would

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.800 
um biggest town of the weapon I would
have<00:05:11.729> to<00:05:11.819> say<00:05:11.970> that<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.300> biggest<00:05:12.479> time

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
have to say that the biggest time

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.320 
have to say that the biggest time
probably<00:05:13.409> would<00:05:13.530> be<00:05:13.680> how<00:05:14.250> easy<00:05:14.639> it<00:05:14.970> is<00:05:15.090> to

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
probably would be how easy it is to

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.300 
probably would be how easy it is to
counter<00:05:15.720> I<00:05:15.930> mean<00:05:16.319> the<00:05:16.830> fact<00:05:17.039> that<00:05:17.190> you<00:05:17.280> just

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
counter I mean the fact that you just

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.309 
counter I mean the fact that you just
need<00:05:17.639> to<00:05:17.819> stay<00:05:18.060> close<00:05:18.330> to<00:05:18.630> someone<00:05:18.960> in<00:05:19.139> order

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 
need to stay close to someone in order

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.770 
need to stay close to someone in order
to<00:05:19.470> counter<00:05:19.919> it<00:05:20.039> that's<00:05:20.759> really<00:05:21.150> mean<00:05:21.630> that

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
to counter it that's really mean that

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.960 
to counter it that's really mean that
doesn't<00:05:22.110> take<00:05:22.259> much<00:05:22.470> at<00:05:22.650> all<00:05:22.800> it's<00:05:23.430> the

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
doesn't take much at all it's the
