00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
what I'm looking at is here is a slide

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.600 
what I'm looking at is here is a slide
out<00:03:12.140> here's<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.770> fascia<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.340> slide<00:03:13.580> out

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
out here's the fascia of the slide out

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.220 
out here's the fascia of the slide out
right<00:03:14.510> next<00:03:14.840> here<00:03:15.020> is<00:03:15.050> the<00:03:15.560> wall<00:03:16.160> of<00:03:16.460> the

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
probably see a push up icon that's all

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.440 
probably see a push up icon that's all
rot<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:29.410> that's<00:03:30.410> all<00:03:30.620> rotted<00:03:31.180> because<00:03:32.180> water

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
rot and that's all rotted because water

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.180 
rot and that's all rotted because water
got<00:03:32.750> in<00:03:32.840> there<00:03:32.989> and<00:03:33.080> look<00:03:33.320> I<00:03:33.440> can<00:03:33.620> poke<00:03:33.980> my

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
got in there and look I can poke my

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.310 
got in there and look I can poke my
finger<00:03:34.580> right<00:03:34.790> through<00:03:34.850> there<00:03:35.300> it's<00:03:35.870> rotted

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
finger right through there it's rotted

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.060 
finger right through there it's rotted
so<00:03:36.500> bad<00:03:36.709> okay<00:03:37.989> and<00:03:38.989> that<00:03:39.350> like<00:03:39.590> I<00:03:39.709> say<00:03:39.860> would

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
so bad okay and that like I say would

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.630 
so bad okay and that like I say would
have<00:03:40.160> been<00:03:40.300> preventable<00:03:41.300> if<00:03:41.660> we<00:03:42.620> had<00:03:42.920> slide

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
have been preventable if we had slide

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.520 
have been preventable if we had slide
toppers<00:03:44.120> on<00:03:44.270> this<00:03:44.450> because<00:03:44.660> I'm<00:03:45.020> sure<00:03:45.050> what
