this<00:00:00.780> is<00:00:00.960> my<00:00:01.170> brief<00:00:01.860> introduction<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.580> tulip

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
this is my brief introduction to tulip

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.390 
this is my brief introduction to tulip
ll<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:04.440> ID<00:00:04.650> their<00:00:05.580> main<00:00:05.759> idea<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.330> ll<00:00:07.080> it<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:07.980> to

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
ll the ID their main idea of ll it is to

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.070 
ll the ID their main idea of ll it is to
get<00:00:08.700> all<00:00:09.170> the<00:00:10.170> stickers<00:00:11.160> facing<00:00:12.059> up<00:00:12.269> on<00:00:12.540> the

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
get all the stickers facing up on the

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.039 
get all the stickers facing up on the
last<00:00:13.290> layer<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:13.799> you've<00:00:13.950> already<00:00:14.099> completed

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
last layer so you've already completed

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.420 
last layer so you've already completed
the<00:00:16.049> first<00:00:16.230> two<00:00:16.529> layers<00:00:16.710> so<00:00:17.160> you'd<00:00:17.310> normally

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
the first two layers so you'd normally

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.279 
the first two layers so you'd normally
be<00:00:17.640> cross<00:00:17.970> if<00:00:18.270> you're<00:00:18.480> doing<00:00:18.660> keeping<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.080> seat

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
be cross if you're doing keeping a seat

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.349 
be cross if you're doing keeping a seat
for<00:00:19.470> itself<00:00:19.800> then<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.580> do<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.880> first<00:00:21.090> two

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
for itself then you do the first two

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.000 
for itself then you do the first two
layers<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.810> complete<00:00:22.109> them<00:00:22.260> by<00:00:22.380> making<00:00:22.769> pairs

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
layers you complete them by making pairs

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.240 
layers you complete them by making pairs
and<00:00:23.220> inserting<00:00:23.730> them<00:00:23.930> and<00:00:24.930> now<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.710> aim<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.099> to

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
and inserting them and now the aim is to

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.330 
and inserting them and now the aim is to
get<00:00:26.340> all<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.910> yellow<00:00:27.180> stickers<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.779> case

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
get all the yellow stickers in this case

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.650 
get all the yellow stickers in this case
facing<00:00:29.340> up<00:00:29.429> if<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.730> solved<00:00:30.090> say<00:00:30.330> an<00:00:30.420> orange

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
facing up if you solved say an orange

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.030 
facing up if you solved say an orange
cross<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.140> need<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.529> get<00:00:31.650> all<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.890> red

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
cross you need to get all the red

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.280 
cross you need to get all the red
thickness<00:00:32.640> facing<00:00:32.969> up<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.780> basically<00:00:33.930> all

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
thickness facing up it's basically all

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.280 
thickness facing up it's basically all
the<00:00:34.500> stickers<00:00:34.770> facing<00:00:35.460> up<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:36.360> Oh<00:00:36.570> L<00:00:37.140> L

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
the stickers facing up it's Oh L L

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.280 
the stickers facing up it's Oh L L
stands<00:00:37.649> for<00:00:37.739> orient<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.610> last<00:00:38.820> layer<00:00:39.079> and<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
stands for orient the last layer and the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.869 
stands for orient the last layer and the
idea<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.649> just<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.950> put<00:00:41.489> them<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.730> right<00:00:41.850> way

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
idea is just to put them the right way

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.510 
idea is just to put them the right way
up<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.960> there<00:00:43.140> are<00:00:43.230> four<00:00:43.440> cases<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.340> get

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
up so there are four cases you can get

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.660 
up so there are four cases you can get
to<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.539> first<00:00:45.750> part<00:00:46.079> because<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.280> tulip

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
to the first part because this is tulip

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.139 
to the first part because this is tulip
LOL<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> first<00:00:48.960> look<00:00:49.370> is<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.700> aim<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.120> to

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
LOL so the first look is the aim is to

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.290 
LOL so the first look is the aim is to
make<00:00:51.329> an<00:00:51.719> entire<00:00:52.350> cross<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.789> get<00:00:54.000> all<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
make an entire cross so get all the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.350 
make an entire cross so get all the
edges<00:00:54.660> oriented<00:00:55.559> correctly<00:00:56.059> you<00:00:57.059> can<00:00:57.180> see

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
edges oriented correctly you can see

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.510 
edges oriented correctly you can see
this<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.750> first<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.199> there<00:00:58.739> are<00:00:58.890> no<00:00:59.129> edges

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
this is the first one there are no edges

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.180 
this is the first one there are no edges
oriented<00:01:00.180> correctly<00:01:00.359> here<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.829> can<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
oriented correctly here you can have a

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.690 
oriented correctly here you can have a
case<00:01:02.489> where<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.149> an<00:01:03.270> L<00:01:03.510> shape<00:01:04.670> which<00:01:05.670> is

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
case where you have an L shape which is

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.420 
case where you have an L shape which is
two<00:01:06.150> edges<00:01:06.450> oriented<00:01:06.960> correctly<00:01:07.280> you<00:01:08.280> can

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
two edges oriented correctly you can

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.940 
two edges oriented correctly you can
have<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> case<00:01:08.909> where<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.479> line<00:01:09.799> where<00:01:10.799> it's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
have a case where it's a line where it's

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.640 
have a case where it's a line where it's
these<00:01:11.280> two<00:01:11.610> edges<00:01:11.939> oriented<00:01:12.630> correctly<00:01:12.780> or

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
these two edges oriented correctly or

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.880 
these two edges oriented correctly or
you<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> cross<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.729> which<00:01:14.880> case

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
you can have a cross in which case

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.160 
you can have a cross in which case
you've<00:01:16.890> solved<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.939> first<00:01:18.240> part<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.900> up

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
you've solved that first part of the up

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.010 
you've solved that first part of the up
so<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> algorithm<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.180> f<00:01:21.950> R<00:01:23.270> u<00:01:24.270> R

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
so the algorithm for this is f R u R

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.880 
so the algorithm for this is f R u R
prime<00:01:25.439> u<00:01:25.950> prime<00:01:26.090> F<00:01:27.090> Prime<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.560> will<00:01:28.710> give

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
prime u prime F Prime and that will give

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.859 
prime u prime F Prime and that will give
you<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.640> second<00:01:30.030> case<00:01:30.210> where<00:01:30.509> you've<00:01:30.630> got<00:01:30.780> an

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
you the second case where you've got an

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.090 
you the second case where you've got an
L<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.979> orient<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.920> looks

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
L so you orient it so that the it looks

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.730 
L so you orient it so that the it looks
like<00:01:35.189> an<00:01:35.430> L<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:36.030> wouldn't<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:36.630> that

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
like an L you wouldn't have it like that

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.469 
like an L you wouldn't have it like that
you<00:01:37.740> make<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:38.040> look<00:01:38.189> like<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.970> then<00:01:39.390> you

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you make it look like that and then you

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.249 
you make it look like that and then you
repeat<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.049> algorithm<00:01:40.290> again<00:01:42.079> okay<00:01:44.689> you<00:01:45.689> are

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
repeat the algorithm again okay you are

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.039 
repeat the algorithm again okay you are
prime<00:01:46.590> u<00:01:46.920> prime<00:01:46.979> F<00:01:47.579> Prime<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.810> get<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
prime u prime F Prime and you get the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.350 
prime u prime F Prime and you get the
bar<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:52.200> then<00:01:52.799> two<00:01:53.220> if<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.700> did<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> third

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
bar and then two if you did it a third

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.639

time F R u R prime G prime you get a

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:08.109 
time F R u R prime G prime you get a
full<00:01:58.920> cross<00:02:00.619> now<00:02:01.619> there<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.219> um<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:03.110> little<00:02:04.110> bit

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.500 

a<00:02:08.179> little<00:02:08.989> bit<00:02:09.110> of<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.289> cheat<00:02:09.679> so<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:10.580> what<00:02:11.420> you

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
a little bit of a cheat so and what you

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.729 
a little bit of a cheat so and what you
can<00:02:11.659> do<00:02:11.810> is<00:02:11.930> you<00:02:12.019> can<00:02:12.140> do<00:02:12.290> that<00:02:12.409> algorithm

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
can do is you can do that algorithm

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.410 
can do is you can do that algorithm
backwards<00:02:13.489> so<00:02:13.849> instead<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.209> F<00:02:14.510> R<00:02:15.370> u<00:02:16.370> R<00:02:16.790> prime<00:02:17.150> u

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
backwards so instead of F R u R prime u

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.550 
backwards so instead of F R u R prime u
prime<00:02:17.450> F<00:02:17.959> Prime

you<00:02:19.549> can<00:02:19.760> do<00:02:19.940> f<00:02:20.409> u<00:02:21.409> R<00:02:21.940> u<00:02:22.940> prime<00:02:23.239> R<00:02:23.510> prime<00:02:23.540> F<00:02:23.989> Prime

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
you can do f u R u prime R prime F Prime

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.250 
you can do f u R u prime R prime F Prime
when<00:02:24.769> you<00:02:24.920> get<00:02:25.129> the<00:02:25.430> L<00:02:26.390> case<00:02:26.860> F<00:02:27.860> u<00:02:28.670> R<00:02:29.150> u<00:02:29.690> prime<00:02:29.959> R

when you get the L case F u R u prime R

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.809 
when you get the L case F u R u prime R
prime<00:02:30.319> X<00:02:30.950> Prime<00:02:31.159> and<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.400> would<00:02:31.549> take<00:02:31.670> you

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
prime X Prime and that would take you

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:32.920

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
the bar so that is the first of the two

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
looks in tulip LLL it will give you a

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.399 
looks in tulip LLL it will give you a
solid<00:02:37.909> cross<00:02:38.239> on<00:02:38.480> top<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.900> means<00:02:39.140> all<00:02:39.290> your

solid cross on top it means all your

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.740 
solid cross on top it means all your

you<00:02:42.560> should<00:02:42.739> have<00:02:42.859> learned<00:02:43.040> this<00:02:43.160> from<00:02:43.549> the

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
you should have learned this from the

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.720 
you should have learned this from the
beginners<00:02:44.420> method<00:02:44.599> anyway<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:46.310> that's<00:02:46.459> that

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
beginners method anyway so that's that

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.839 
beginners method anyway so that's that
the<00:02:47.510> next<00:02:47.810> step<00:02:48.019> is<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.590> solve<00:02:48.950> all<00:02:49.250> of<00:02:49.310> the

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
the next step is to solve all of the

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.330 
the next step is to solve all of the
corners<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.870> make<00:02:50.900> them<00:02:51.200> all<00:02:51.349> face<00:02:51.739> up<00:02:51.980> or<00:02:52.190> the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.030 
four and there are seven cases in total
six<00:03:09.049> where<00:03:09.260> you<00:03:09.349> actually<00:03:09.440> have<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.739> perform

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
six where you actually have to perform

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.470 
six where you actually have to perform
an<00:03:10.190> algorithm<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:10.790> one<00:03:11.000> which<00:03:11.239> would

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
an algorithm and one which would

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.870 
an algorithm and one which would
obviously<00:03:11.569> be<00:03:12.079> solved<00:03:12.919> -<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.099> first<00:03:13.280> case<00:03:13.609> is

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
obviously be solved - the first case is

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.240 
obviously be solved - the first case is
no<00:03:15.040> corners<00:03:16.040> oriented<00:03:16.519> correctly<00:03:17.200> so<00:03:18.250> what

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
no corners oriented correctly so what

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.650 
no corners oriented correctly so what
you<00:03:19.400> will<00:03:19.549> have<00:03:19.730> is<00:03:19.970> you'll<00:03:20.239> have<00:03:20.419> two

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
you will have is you'll have two

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.780 
you will have is you'll have two
headlights<00:03:21.079> and<00:03:21.829> two<00:03:22.069> headlights<00:03:22.459> this<00:03:22.669> is

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
headlights and two headlights this is

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.309 
headlights and two headlights this is
called<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.120> headlights<00:03:23.450> case<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:24.099> and<00:03:26.319> you

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
called the headlights case and and you

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.080 
called the headlights case and and you
would<00:03:27.440> hold<00:03:27.709> it<00:03:27.919> so<00:03:28.459> that<00:03:28.489> the<00:03:28.790> headlights

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
would hold it so that the headlights

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.280 
would hold it so that the headlights
face<00:03:29.329> in<00:03:29.480> front<00:03:29.540> of<00:03:29.660> users<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:29.989> matically

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
face in front of users and matically

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.650

if you held it like that you're gonna do

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.539 
if you held it like that you're gonna do
it<00:03:35.599> wrong<00:03:35.750> and<00:03:35.989> it's<00:03:36.799> just<00:03:37.040> repeating<00:03:37.489> the

it wrong and it's just repeating the

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
R prime u Prime and then you do the F

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.319 
R prime u Prime and then you do the F
prime<00:03:54.199> so<00:03:54.829> instead<00:03:55.040> of<00:03:55.099> doing<00:03:55.370> an<00:03:55.489> F<00:03:55.699> prime<00:03:56.060> and

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
then start off an F you obviously don't

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:59.619 
then start off an F you obviously don't
need<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.370> do<00:03:58.430> that<00:03:58.489> because<00:03:58.669> an<00:03:58.879> F<00:03:59.030> and<00:03:59.329> then<00:03:59.540> F

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
need to do that because an F and then F

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.199 
need to do that because an F and then F
prime<00:03:59.690> is<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.889> same<00:04:00.949> thing<00:04:01.340> so<00:04:01.970> that<00:04:02.000> would

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
prime is the same thing so that would

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.140 
prime is the same thing so that would
solve<00:04:02.419> your<00:04:02.510> first<00:04:02.870> case<00:04:03.109> it'll<00:04:03.290> give<00:04:03.440> you<00:04:03.560> all

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
solve your first case it'll give you all

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.449 
solve your first case it'll give you all

stickers facing out as you'd hold it
like<00:06:52.210> this<00:06:52.240> and<00:06:52.630> you<00:06:53.139> would<00:06:53.229> do<00:06:53.470> a<00:06:54.240> smaller

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
like this and you would do a smaller
