00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
disappointed a lot of surface noise on

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.150 
disappointed a lot of surface noise on
it<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:30.150> couple<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.480> marks<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:31.679> thought<00:00:32.040> I'd

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
it and a couple of marks I thought I'd

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.639 
it and a couple of marks I thought I'd
give<00:00:32.309> record<00:00:32.610> revirginized<00:00:33.180> or<00:00:33.329> ago<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.840> it

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
which has got some surface noise on it

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.440 
which has got some surface noise on it
and<00:00:43.920> then<00:00:44.160> we're<00:00:44.280> going<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.430> show<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:44.940> how<00:00:45.210> to

come back at a later stage peel it off

00:00:50.039 --> 00:01:11.630 
come back at a later stage peel it off
and<00:00:50.309> have<00:00:50.969> another<00:00:51.210> listen

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.910 

hello

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.230 

wow<00:01:17.920> that<00:01:18.159> sounded<00:01:18.399> pretty<00:01:18.610> terrible<00:01:18.969> didn't

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
wow that sounded pretty terrible didn't

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.789 
wow that sounded pretty terrible didn't
it<00:01:19.299> alright<00:01:19.990> well<00:01:20.140> now<00:01:20.259> we're<00:01:20.380> going<00:01:20.469> to<00:01:20.530> apply

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
it alright well now we're going to apply

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.350 
it alright well now we're going to apply
record<00:01:21.189> revirginize<00:01:21.729> er<00:01:21.759> to<00:01:21.969> the<00:01:22.060> record

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
record revirginize er to the record

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.870 
record revirginize er to the record
surface<00:01:23.100> okay<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.219> first<00:01:24.369> thing<00:01:24.579> to<00:01:24.670> do<00:01:24.759> is

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
surface okay the first thing to do is

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.460 
surface okay the first thing to do is
make<00:01:24.909> sure<00:01:25.060> we<00:01:25.270> shake<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:25.600> bottle<00:01:25.780> vigorously

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
make sure we shake the bottle vigorously

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.520 
make sure we shake the bottle vigorously
for<00:01:27.220> about<00:01:27.490> 30<00:01:27.789> seconds<00:01:28.180> or<00:01:28.299> so<00:01:28.360> and<00:01:28.659> then<00:01:29.380> they

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
for about 30 seconds or so and then they

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.940 
for about 30 seconds or so and then they
say<00:01:29.770> to<00:01:30.149> pour<00:01:31.500> around<00:01:32.850> 15<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:34.030> 20<00:01:34.329> mil<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:35.590> the

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
say to pour around 15 to 20 mil on the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.880 
say to pour around 15 to 20 mil on the
record<00:01:36.280> surface<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.869> we're<00:01:38.500> just<00:01:38.530> going<00:01:38.770> to

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
record surface so we're just going to

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.309 
record surface so we're just going to
estimate<00:01:39.310> that<00:01:39.759> just<00:01:40.659> dribble<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.079> around

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:41.319 
estimate that just dribble it around

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.559 
estimate that just dribble it around
like<00:01:41.500> this<00:01:41.560> so<00:01:42.009> I<00:01:42.670> could<00:01:42.819> even<00:01:43.119> sort<00:01:43.509> of

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
like this so I could even sort of

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:53.249 
like this so I could even sort of
distribution<00:01:51.689> obviously<00:01:52.689> the<00:01:52.780> more<00:01:52.929> you<00:01:52.990> put

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
distribution obviously the more you put

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.600 
distribution obviously the more you put
on<00:01:53.289> the<00:01:53.500> easier<00:01:53.799> it's<00:01:53.920> going<00:01:54.039> to<00:01:54.099> be<00:01:54.189> to<00:01:54.340> peel

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
on the easier it's going to be to peel

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.969 
on the easier it's going to be to peel
off<00:01:54.789> but<00:01:56.429> just<00:01:57.429> a<00:01:57.549> won't<00:01:58.030> last<00:01:58.209> as<00:01:58.420> long<00:01:58.979> then

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
off but just a won't last as long then

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.270 
off but just a won't last as long then
we<00:02:00.450> use<00:02:01.450> our<00:02:01.630> fingers<00:02:02.049> to<00:02:02.170> gently<00:02:02.349> massage<00:02:02.770> it

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
we use our fingers to gently massage it

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.359 
we use our fingers to gently massage it
into<00:02:04.149> the<00:02:04.330> grooves<00:02:04.740> trying<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.830> get<00:02:05.920> an<00:02:06.009> even

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
into the grooves trying to get an even

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.210 
into the grooves trying to get an even
distribution<00:02:07.030> of<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.750> fluid<00:02:08.649> all<00:02:08.829> over<00:02:08.860> the

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
distribution of the fluid all over the

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.539 
distribution of the fluid all over the
record<00:02:13.590> just<00:02:14.590> work<00:02:14.829> your<00:02:14.980> way<00:02:15.099> around<00:02:15.220> like

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
record just work your way around like

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.490 
record just work your way around like
this<00:02:15.640> in<00:02:15.819> circles<00:02:16.239> trying<00:02:17.079> to<00:02:17.140> get<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.380> all

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
this in circles trying to get it all

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:33.120 
this in circles trying to get it all
even

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:44.890 

there<00:02:33.640> we<00:02:33.820> go

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.530 

and<00:02:45.900> then<00:02:46.170> we<00:02:46.290> just<00:02:46.440> put<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:47.300> little<00:02:48.300> bit<00:02:48.420> of

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
and then we just put a little bit of

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.729 
and then we just put a little bit of
paper<00:02:48.750> on<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.110> edge<00:02:49.230> there

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
paper on the edge there

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.740 
paper on the edge there
and<00:02:49.830> we're<00:02:50.610> done<00:02:50.790> we<00:02:50.970> come<00:02:51.150> back<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.510> around

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
and we're done we come back and around

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.229 
and we're done we come back and around
five<00:02:52.379> six<00:02:52.739> hours<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.250> we'll<00:02:53.819> peel<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.180> off

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
five six hours and we'll peel that off

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.770 
five six hours and we'll peel that off
and<00:02:54.629> have<00:02:55.560> another<00:02:55.739> listen<00:02:56.360> okay<00:02:57.360> so<00:02:57.420> here<00:02:57.750> we

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
and have another listen okay so here we

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.839 
and have another listen okay so here we
are<00:02:57.870> six<00:02:58.200> hours<00:02:58.440> later<00:02:58.650> now<00:02:59.370> we're<00:02:59.550> going<00:02:59.700> to

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
are six hours later now we're going to

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.740 
are six hours later now we're going to
