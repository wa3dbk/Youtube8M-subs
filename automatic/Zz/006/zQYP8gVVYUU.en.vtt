calibration<00:01:14.600> my<00:01:15.600> motherboard<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> little

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
calibration my motherboard is a little

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.399 
calibration my motherboard is a little
funky<00:01:16.830> about<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.640> haven't<00:01:17.970> enabled<00:01:18.409> um

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
funky about this I haven't enabled um

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.810 
funky about this I haven't enabled um
what<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.159> does<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.750> it<00:01:21.979> when<00:01:22.979> your<00:01:23.159> CPU<00:01:23.610> needs

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
what this does is it when your CPU needs

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.170 
what this does is it when your CPU needs
more<00:01:24.180> voltage<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.900> will<00:01:25.020> add<00:01:25.229> more<00:01:25.710> voltage<00:01:26.250> to

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
more voltage it will add more voltage to

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.700 
more voltage it will add more voltage to
it<00:01:27.390> like<00:01:27.869> say<00:01:28.159> idling<00:01:29.159> I'm<00:01:29.369> at<00:01:31.880> 11.4<00:01:32.880> 1<00:01:33.150> volts

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
it like say idling I'm at 11.4 1 volts

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.530 
it like say idling I'm at 11.4 1 volts
but<00:01:34.710> then<00:01:34.890> when<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.130> start<00:01:35.369> gaming<00:01:35.579> load<00:01:36.329> line

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
but then when I start gaming load line

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.700 
but then when I start gaming load line
calibration<00:01:36.570> will<00:01:37.320> set<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.310> UM

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
calibration will set it up to UM

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.590 
calibration will set it up to UM
about<00:01:41.420> 1.4<00:01:42.420> 9<00:01:43.130> which<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.310> really<00:01:44.850> overkill<00:01:45.299> if

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
about 1.4 9 which is really overkill if

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.080 
about 1.4 9 which is really overkill if
I<00:01:46.409> could<00:01:46.590> hard<00:01:46.799> set<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.280> voltage<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.850> would<00:01:47.939> be

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
I could hard set the voltage it would be

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.499 
I could hard set the voltage it would be
around<00:01:48.390> one<00:01:48.990> point<00:01:49.259> four<00:01:49.560> seven<00:01:50.479> one<00:01:51.479> point

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
around one point four seven one point

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.380 
around one point four seven one point
four<00:01:51.930> six<00:01:52.200> volts<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.460> know<00:01:53.610> whatever

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
four six volts but you know whatever

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.340 
four six volts but you know whatever
also<00:01:55.170> make<00:01:55.380> sure<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.649> have<00:01:55.799> a

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
background don't worry about any of this

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.960 
background don't worry about any of this
other<00:02:09.750> voltage<00:02:10.350> stuff<00:02:10.619> just<00:02:10.950> just<00:02:11.820> worry

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
other voltage stuff just just worry

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.140 
other voltage stuff just just worry
about<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.210> CPU<00:02:12.570> manual<00:02:13.380> voltage<00:02:13.830> also<00:02:14.250> make

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
about the CPU manual voltage also make

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.780 
about the CPU manual voltage also make
sure<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.450> set<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.140> CPU<00:02:16.650> Northbridge<00:02:17.340> voltage

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
sure you set the CPU Northbridge voltage

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.330 
sure you set the CPU Northbridge voltage
to<00:02:18.780> manual<00:02:19.260> over<00:02:19.830> here<00:02:23.510> alright

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
to manual over here alright

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.970 
to manual over here alright
also<00:02:26.340> if<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.790> go<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:29.180> where<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.450> at

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
also if you go to where is it at

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.720 
also if you go to where is it at
pretty<00:02:31.980> much<00:02:32.100> you're<00:02:32.220> going<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.400> want<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.580> turn

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
pretty much you're going to want to turn

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.330 
pretty much you're going to want to turn
off<00:02:32.850> turbo<00:02:33.270> core<00:02:33.450> mode<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.930> seeonee<00:02:34.770> support

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
off turbo core mode and seeonee support

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.810 
off turbo core mode and seeonee support
also<00:02:36.260> there's<00:02:37.260> another<00:02:37.380> thing<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.459> found

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
also there's another thing that I found

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
also there's another thing that I found
here<00:02:39.450> gotta<00:02:39.840> find<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.290> again<00:02:40.620> oh<00:02:43.280> hold<00:02:44.280> on

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.140 

alright<00:02:48.840> umm<00:02:49.050> also<00:02:49.440> when<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:49.830> overclock<00:02:50.190> go

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
alright umm also when you overclock go

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.740 
alright umm also when you overclock go
to<00:02:51.209> you're<00:02:51.600> gonna<00:02:51.690> go<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.260> CPU<00:02:52.770> ratio<00:02:53.310> and

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
to you're gonna go to the CPU ratio and

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.410 
to you're gonna go to the CPU ratio and
just<00:02:54.750> press<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.350> plus<00:02:55.650> button<00:02:56.030> and<00:02:57.030> your

to<00:04:19.889> worry<00:04:20.040> about<00:04:20.130> um<00:04:22.070> so<00:04:23.070> make<00:04:23.520> sure<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:24.030> stay

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
to worry about um so make sure you stay

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.740 
to worry about um so make sure you stay
under<00:04:25.100> 62<00:04:26.100> Celsius<00:04:26.669> I<00:04:26.880> never<00:04:27.120> reach<00:04:27.419> above

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
under 62 Celsius I never reach above

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.970 
under 62 Celsius I never reach above
myself<00:04:28.650> um<00:04:29.270> 58<00:04:30.470> Celsius<00:04:31.470> on<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.740> course

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
myself um 58 Celsius on the course

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.790 
myself um 58 Celsius on the course
that's<00:04:32.490> under<00:04:32.730> max<00:04:33.120> load<00:04:33.510> which<00:04:34.350> I<00:04:34.470> don't<00:04:34.650> ever

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
that's under max load which I don't ever

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.760 
that's under max load which I don't ever
reach<00:04:35.040> that<00:04:35.070> while<00:04:35.460> gaming<00:04:36.410> so<00:04:37.410> just<00:04:37.650> make

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
reach that while gaming so just make

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.790 
reach that while gaming so just make
sure<00:04:37.800> you<00:04:38.010> turn<00:04:38.130> off<00:04:38.310> c1<00:04:38.639> each<00:04:38.820> support<00:04:39.240> and

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
sure you turn off c1 each support and

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.220 
sure you turn off c1 each support and
turbo<00:04:40.800> core

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.620 

and<00:04:43.560> there<00:04:44.010> is<00:04:44.100> another<00:04:44.460> thing<00:04:44.580> that<00:04:44.970> I<00:04:45.240> found

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
and there is another thing that I found

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.300 
and there is another thing that I found
but<00:04:45.960> it's<00:04:46.140> not<00:04:46.320> in<00:04:46.500> here<00:04:46.680> anymore

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
but it's not in here anymore

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.630 
but it's not in here anymore
maybe<00:04:47.610> it's<00:04:47.760> under<00:04:47.940> tools<00:04:49.370> nope

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
maybe it's under tools nope

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.000 
maybe it's under tools nope
oh<00:04:50.670> well<00:04:51.660> guys<00:04:52.080> are<00:04:52.320> worried<00:04:52.650> about<00:04:52.680> I<00:04:52.860> never

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
oh well guys are worried about I never

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.050 
oh well guys are worried about I never
did<00:04:54.950> also<00:04:55.950> um

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
did also um

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.260 
did also um
another<00:04:57.990> good<00:04:58.230> thing<00:04:58.260> to<00:04:58.530> do<00:04:58.680> is<00:04:59.210> kind<00:05:00.210> of

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
another good thing to do is kind of

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.380 
another good thing to do is kind of
overclock<00:05:00.690> your<00:05:00.720> cpu<00:05:00.950> Northbridge<00:05:01.950> but<00:05:02.390> just

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
overclock your cpu Northbridge but just

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.430 
overclock your cpu Northbridge but just
make<00:05:03.600> sure<00:05:03.980> um<00:05:05.330> you<00:05:06.330> know<00:05:06.450> you<00:05:06.510> only<00:05:06.750> boost<00:05:07.230> it

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
make sure um you know you only boost it

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.500 
make sure um you know you only boost it
up<00:05:07.530> once<00:05:08.180> run<00:05:09.180> OCC<00:05:09.840> T<00:05:10.050> uh<00:05:10.850> it<00:05:11.850> will<00:05:12.030> test<00:05:12.270> the

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
up once run OCC T uh it will test the

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.820 
up once run OCC T uh it will test the
memory<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:12.960> everything<00:05:13.110> because<00:05:13.650> that's

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
memory and everything because that's

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.950 
memory and everything because that's
what<00:05:14.010> North<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.610> North<00:05:14.820> Bridge<00:05:15.090> is<00:05:15.300> it

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
what North the North Bridge is it

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.020 
what North the North Bridge is it
regulates<00:05:16.740> memory<00:05:17.160> and<00:05:17.310> everything<00:05:17.640> so<00:05:17.850> just

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
regulates memory and everything so just

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.420 
regulates memory and everything so just
make<00:05:18.210> sure<00:05:18.240> you<00:05:18.620> you<00:05:19.620> know<00:05:19.740> it<00:05:20.040> boost<00:05:20.220> that<00:05:20.400> up

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
make sure you you know it boost that up

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:27.170 
make sure you you know it boost that up
I<00:05:20.670> went<00:05:20.880> from<00:05:22.490> 2200<00:05:23.490> to<00:05:24.090> 2600<00:05:24.930> so<00:05:26.060> you<00:05:27.060> know

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
I went from 2200 to 2600 so you know

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.790 
I went from 2200 to 2600 so you know
it's<00:05:27.360> a<00:05:27.420> decent<00:05:27.780> boost<00:05:27.960> you'll<00:05:28.200> notice<00:05:28.500> quite

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
it's a decent boost you'll notice quite

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.660 
it's a decent boost you'll notice quite
a<00:05:28.830> bit<00:05:29.010> of<00:05:29.630> difference<00:05:30.630> from<00:05:30.780> that<00:05:30.990> also<00:05:32.060> um<00:05:34.670> at

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
a bit of difference from that also um at

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.350 
a bit of difference from that also um at
least<00:05:35.730> I<00:05:36.030> know<00:05:36.090> my<00:05:36.530> my<00:05:37.530> motherboard<00:05:38.040> it

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
least I know my my motherboard it

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.510 
least I know my my motherboard it
actually<00:05:39.360> I<00:05:39.630> think<00:05:40.230> it<00:05:41.810> clocked<00:05:42.810> down<00:05:43.500> my<00:05:43.830> ram

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
actually I think it clocked down my ram

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.580 
actually I think it clocked down my ram
or<00:05:45.000> it<00:05:45.300> just<00:05:45.480> set<00:05:45.630> the<00:05:45.750> timings<00:05:46.200> weird

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
or it just set the timings weird

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.920 
or it just set the timings weird
he<00:05:47.070> was<00:05:47.190> like<00:05:47.310> eleven<00:05:47.760> eleven<00:05:48.150> eleven<00:05:48.240> twenty

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
he was like eleven eleven eleven twenty

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.620 
he was like eleven eleven eleven twenty
nine<00:05:49.130> so<00:05:50.130> I<00:05:50.160> had<00:05:50.370> to<00:05:50.490> set<00:05:50.700> it<00:05:50.730> down<00:05:51.060> to<00:05:51.270> nine

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
nine so I had to set it down to nine

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.660 
nine so I had to set it down to nine
nine<00:05:51.870> nine<00:05:51.900> twenty<00:05:52.470> four<00:05:52.710> just<00:05:53.250> make<00:05:53.520> sure

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
nine nine twenty four just make sure

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.590 
nine nine twenty four just make sure
that<00:05:54.110> that's<00:05:55.110> there<00:05:56.120> here<00:05:57.120> just<00:05:57.360> be<00:05:57.480> under

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
that that's there here just be under

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.860 
that that's there here just be under
DRAM<00:05:58.200> timing<00:05:58.590> control<00:05:58.920> and<00:05:59.330> you<00:06:00.330> changed<00:06:00.720> the

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
DRAM timing control and you changed the

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.180 
DRAM timing control and you changed the
first<00:06:01.110> four

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:12.410 

so<00:06:06.760> 9<00:06:07.270> 9<00:06:07.570> 9<00:06:07.780> 24<00:06:08.260> um<00:06:09.510> that's<00:06:10.510> a<00:06:10.750> basic<00:06:11.200> way<00:06:12.100> to

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:12.420 
so 9 9 9 24 um that's a basic way to

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.810 
so 9 9 9 24 um that's a basic way to
overclock<00:06:13.420> everything<00:06:14.350> in<00:06:14.470> your<00:06:14.560> system<00:06:14.980> if
