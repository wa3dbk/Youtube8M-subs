you<00:00:08.910> really<00:00:09.090> hear<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.240> lot<00:00:09.360> about<00:00:09.590> design

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
you really hear a lot about design

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.799 
you really hear a lot about design
you've<00:00:11.370> been<00:00:11.519> hearing<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.090> lot<00:00:12.120> about<00:00:12.240> design

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
you've been hearing a lot about design

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.870 
you've been hearing a lot about design
and<00:00:13.160> difference<00:00:14.160> between<00:00:14.340> planning<00:00:14.759> and

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
and difference between planning and

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.450 
and difference between planning and
design<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.740> lot<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.859> people<00:00:17.039> write<00:00:17.430> about

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
design a lot of people write about

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.720 
design a lot of people write about
school<00:00:18.180> reform<00:00:19.189> and<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.490> talk<00:00:20.670> about

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
school reform and we talk about

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.960 
school reform and we talk about
reforming<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.779> schools<00:00:22.490> our<00:00:23.490> whole<00:00:23.760> argument

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
reforming the schools our whole argument

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.320 
reforming the schools our whole argument
is<00:00:24.420> that's<00:00:24.810> not<00:00:24.990> enough<00:00:26.029> reforming<00:00:27.029> simply

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
is that's not enough reforming simply

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.529 
is that's not enough reforming simply
means<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.720> form<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.470> over<00:00:28.710> again<00:00:29.269> we<00:00:30.269> really

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
means to form it over again we really

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.590 
means to form it over again we really
have<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.750> transform<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.980> schools<00:00:32.329> we<00:00:33.329> have<00:00:33.450> to

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
have to transform the schools we have to

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.380 
have to transform the schools we have to
move<00:00:33.840> them<00:00:34.020> from<00:00:34.140> one<00:00:34.230> form<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.890> another

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
move them from one form to another

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.450 
move them from one form to another
there's<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.480> certain<00:00:36.719> extent<00:00:37.200> degree<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.309> which

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
there's a certain extent degree to which

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.040 
there's a certain extent degree to which
we're<00:00:39.180> talking<00:00:39.420> about<00:00:39.600> something<00:00:39.840> like

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
we're talking about something like

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.830 
we're talking about something like
metamorphosis<00:00:40.940> it's<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.390> know<00:00:42.510> thinking

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
metamorphosis it's you know thinking

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.369 
metamorphosis it's you know thinking
about<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.250> butterfly<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.670> cocoon<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.379> we

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
about a butterfly in a cocoon and we

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.440 
about a butterfly in a cocoon and we
have<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.680> understand<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.430> those<00:00:47.879> things<00:00:48.149> that

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
have to understand it those things that

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.189 
have to understand it those things that
take<00:00:48.660> place<00:00:48.870> are<00:00:49.700> changing<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> whole<00:00:51.570> set<00:00:52.079> of

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
take place are changing the whole set of

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.939 
take place are changing the whole set of
assumptions<00:00:52.910> caterpillars<00:00:53.910> can't<00:00:54.210> fly<00:00:54.949> there

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
assumptions caterpillars can't fly there

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.080 
assumptions caterpillars can't fly there
are<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> lot<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.219> things<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.489> caterpillars

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
are a lot of things that caterpillars

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.630 
are a lot of things that caterpillars
can't<00:00:57.449> do<00:00:57.739> their<00:00:58.739> limited<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.370> their<00:00:59.489> mobility

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
can't do their limited in their mobility

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.599 
can't do their limited in their mobility
their<00:01:00.270> limited<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.750> what<00:01:00.870> they<00:01:00.930> can<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.410> and

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
their limited in what they can do and

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.160 
their limited in what they can do and
then<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.789> caterpillar<00:01:03.359> eats<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.750> whole<00:01:03.899> bunch

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
then that caterpillar eats a whole bunch

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.820 
then that caterpillar eats a whole bunch
of<00:01:04.290> stuff<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.799> goes<00:01:05.369> into<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> cocoon<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.830> in

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
of stuff and goes into a cocoon and in

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.030 
of stuff and goes into a cocoon and in
some<00:01:08.400> ways<00:01:08.580> what<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> design<00:01:10.080> team<00:01:10.380> really<00:01:10.830> is

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
some ways what the design team really is

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.850 
some ways what the design team really is
as<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> cocoon<00:01:12.170> it's<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.290> place<00:01:13.500> where<00:01:13.530> you're

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
as a cocoon it's a place where you're

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.020 
as a cocoon it's a place where you're
protected<00:01:14.840> to<00:01:15.840> think<00:01:16.430> because<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.909> real

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
protected to think because in the real

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.690 
protected to think because in the real
world<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.630> you're<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.990> out<00:01:19.229> there<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:20.520> don't

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.300 
world that you're in out there you don't
have<00:01:21.000> time<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.720> think<00:01:21.750> you're<00:01:22.530> too<00:01:22.680> busy<00:01:22.860> doing

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310

design<00:01:29.189> team<00:01:29.490> your<00:01:30.180> job<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.720> get<00:01:30.930> inside

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
design team your job is to get inside

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.950 
design team your job is to get inside
that<00:01:31.409> cocoon<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.369> think<00:01:32.970> hard<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.840> you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
that cocoon and think hard so that you

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.590 
that cocoon and think hard so that you
can<00:01:34.079> transform<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.979> system<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.299> means

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
can transform the system and that means

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.370 
can transform the system and that means
you<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.960> be<00:01:37.200> prepared<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.280> dumb<00:01:39.380> what

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
you have to be prepared to be dumb what

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.170 
you have to be prepared to be dumb what
I<00:01:40.409> mean<00:01:40.650> by<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:42.000> have<00:01:42.030> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
I mean by that is you have you have to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.569 
I mean by that is you have you have to
take<00:01:42.420> risks<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.079> design<00:01:43.409> team<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:44.369> might

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
take risks in the design team you might

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.310 
take risks in the design team you might
not<00:01:44.820> take<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.479> school<00:01:45.720> planning<00:01:45.990> team

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
not take in a school planning team

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.679 
not take in a school planning team
you've<00:01:47.280> got<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.520> be<00:01:47.549> asking<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.090> lot<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.270> what<00:01:48.509> if

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
you've got to be asking a lot of what if

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.960 
you've got to be asking a lot of what if
questions<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:50.159> got<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.399> be<00:01:50.490> prepared<00:01:50.670> to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
questions and you got to be prepared to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.370 
questions and you got to be prepared to
act<00:01:51.180> like<00:01:51.570> you're<00:01:51.810> going<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.020> do<00:01:52.110> something

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
act like you're going to do something

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.010 
act like you're going to do something
you<00:01:52.500> want<00:01:52.770> turns<00:01:53.100> out<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.430> be<00:01:53.460> stupid<00:01:54.020> but

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
you want turns out to be stupid but

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.389 
you want turns out to be stupid but
unless<00:01:55.290> you're<00:01:55.439> prepared<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.950> act<00:01:56.130> like

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399

you're<00:01:56.549> going<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.759> turn<00:01:56.880> do<00:01:57.299> something<00:01:57.659> is

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
you're going to turn do something is

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.050 
you're going to turn do something is
likely<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.740> be<00:01:58.829> stupid<00:01:59.340> you'll<00:01:59.729> never<00:01:59.880> do

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
likely to be stupid you'll never do

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.600 
likely to be stupid you'll never do
something<00:02:00.299> as<00:02:00.509> smart<00:02:01.009> because<00:02:02.009> quite<00:02:02.340> often

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
something as smart because quite often

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.889 
something as smart because quite often
what<00:02:02.880> we<00:02:02.939> do<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.229> away<00:02:04.530> with<00:02:04.560> good<00:02:05.070> ideas

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
what we do is we do away with good ideas

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.300 
what we do is we do away with good ideas
simply<00:02:06.899> because<00:02:07.259> we're<00:02:07.890> worried<00:02:08.190> that

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
team is the norm of confidentiality so

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.940 
team is the norm of confidentiality so
the<00:02:21.510> right<00:02:21.660> somebody<00:02:22.200> doesn't<00:02:22.380> walk<00:02:22.560> out<00:02:22.800> and

but<00:03:26.010> Johns<00:03:26.220> Hopkins<00:03:26.459> did<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.600> he<00:03:28.260> did<00:03:28.440> it

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
but Johns Hopkins did it and he did it

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.790 
but Johns Hopkins did it and he did it
because<00:03:28.650> they<00:03:28.830> were<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.160> new<00:03:29.400> university<00:03:29.880> and

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
because they were a new university and

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.920 
because they were a new university and
Abraham<00:03:31.800> flexion<00:03:32.190> was<00:03:32.340> asked<00:03:32.760> by<00:03:32.850> someone<00:03:32.930> how

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
Abraham flexion was asked by someone how

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.740 
Abraham flexion was asked by someone how
could<00:03:34.260> they<00:03:34.410> do<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:35.240> Harvard<00:03:36.240> couldn't<00:03:36.600> do

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
could they do that Harvard couldn't do

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.310 
could they do that Harvard couldn't do
it<00:03:37.490> the<00:03:38.490> great<00:03:38.700> universities<00:03:38.970> Yale<00:03:39.840> couldn't

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
it the great universities Yale couldn't

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.260 
it the great universities Yale couldn't
do<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.560> none<00:03:41.100> of<00:03:41.250> them<00:03:41.340> could<00:03:41.490> do<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:41.760> but<00:03:41.940> but

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
do it none of them could do it but but

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.199 
do it none of them could do it but but
Johns<00:03:42.930> Hopkins<00:03:43.140> could<00:03:43.860> do<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.130> they<00:03:44.970> said

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
Johns Hopkins could do it they said

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.880 
Johns Hopkins could do it they said
because<00:03:45.570> they<00:03:45.990> were<00:03:46.050> in<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.170> position<00:03:46.440> do<00:03:46.740> the

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
because they were in the position do the

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
because they were in the position do the
logical<00:03:47.480> rather<00:03:48.480> than<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.780> prudent<00:03:49.170> thing

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
logical rather than the prudent thing

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.270 
logical rather than the prudent thing
because<00:03:50.910> they<00:03:51.060> didn't<00:03:51.360> have<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:52.590> habits<00:03:53.010> of

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
because they didn't have the habits of

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.449 
because they didn't have the habits of
the<00:03:53.910> past<00:03:54.380> they<00:03:55.380> could<00:03:55.530> invent<00:03:55.830> a<00:03:56.040> new<00:03:56.070> future

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
the past they could invent a new future

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.870 
the past they could invent a new future
and<00:03:57.320> so<00:03:58.320> what<00:03:58.620> we<00:03:58.770> have<00:03:58.950> to<00:03:58.980> do<00:03:59.250> is<00:03:59.490> have<00:03:59.850> a

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
and so what we have to do is have a

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.080 
and so what we have to do is have a
place<00:04:00.350> called<00:04:01.350> a<00:04:01.440> design<00:04:01.800> team<00:04:02.100> that<00:04:02.910> doesn't

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
place called a design team that doesn't

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.900 
place called a design team that doesn't
have<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.570> habits<00:04:03.990> of<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.200> past<00:04:04.580> so<00:04:05.580> you<00:04:05.640> can

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
have the habits of the past so you can

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.699 
have the habits of the past so you can
think<00:04:05.940> about<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:06.690> invent<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.890> new<00:04:07.920> future<00:04:08.760> and

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
think about and invent a new future and

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.260
