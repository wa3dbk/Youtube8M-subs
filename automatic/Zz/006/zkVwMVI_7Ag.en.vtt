00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
really know what about it in the UK they

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.620 
really know what about it in the UK they
don't<00:02:58.370> really<00:02:58.760> know<00:02:58.850> that<00:02:58.880> much<00:02:59.120> about<00:02:59.180> Korea

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
don't really know that much about Korea

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.360 
don't really know that much about Korea
I'm<00:02:59.810> speaking<00:03:00.200> for<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.709> broadly<00:03:00.980> obviously

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
I'm speaking for it broadly obviously

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.660 
I'm speaking for it broadly obviously
and<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:02.660> so<00:03:03.290> wanting<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:03.829> be<00:03:03.950> able<00:03:04.069> to<00:03:04.280> bridge

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
and and so wanting to be able to bridge

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.009 
and and so wanting to be able to bridge
those<00:03:04.850> gaps<00:03:04.910> I<00:03:05.420> think<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:05.660> was<00:03:05.750> just<00:03:05.930> very

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
those gaps I think it was just very

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.270 
those gaps I think it was just very
natural<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.560> me<00:03:06.680> actually<00:03:06.829> there's

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
kind of whole registers of difference

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.300 
kind of whole registers of difference
that<00:03:20.450> are<00:03:20.540> so<00:03:20.750> great<00:03:20.959> compared<00:03:21.739> with<00:03:21.950> what<00:03:22.190> we

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
that are so great compared with what we

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.580 
that are so great compared with what we

used to in Europe or North America but

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.140 
used to in Europe or North America but
it<00:03:24.739> seems<00:03:24.950> such<00:03:25.280> a<00:03:25.310> difficult<00:03:25.760> culture<00:03:26.030> to

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
it seems such a difficult culture to
