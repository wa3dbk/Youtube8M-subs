application called carbon has been
released<00:00:13.410> by<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.620> guys<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:14.009> created<00:00:14.370> the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
released by the guys that created the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.140 
released by the guys that created the
clockworkmod<00:00:15.570> which<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.680> popular<00:00:17.430> robbing

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150
