berries as long as they do not crash
this<00:01:17.299> method<00:01:18.299> should<00:01:18.450> work<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.350> first<00:01:19.770> out<00:01:19.979> our

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
this method should work so first out our

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.910 
this method should work so first out our
friend<00:01:20.369> go<00:01:20.729> check<00:01:20.939> out<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.090> GE<00:01:21.590> look<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.740> white

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
friend go check out the GE look of white

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.560 
friend go check out the GE look of white
berries<00:01:23.399> and<00:01:23.640> see<00:01:23.759> how<00:01:23.820> they're<00:01:23.970> doing<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
berries and see how they're doing on the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.749 
berries and see how they're doing on the
market<00:01:25.549> these<00:01:26.549> prices<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.360> think<00:01:27.780> our<00:01:28.759> 1284

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
market these prices I think our 1284

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:45.460 
market these prices I think our 1284
it's<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> for-sure<00:01:31.140> gas<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:31.920> i<00:01:32.509> guess<00:01:41.810> um

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
other ways to make money but this is by

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.610 
other ways to make money but this is by
the<00:03:40.239> best<00:03:40.510> way<00:03:40.720> because<00:03:40.780> a<00:03:41.080> table<00:03:41.440> clocks

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
the best way because a table clocks

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:55.309 
the best way because a table clocks
Pompey's<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:42.730> they're<00:03:43.480> about<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:52.200> and

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.130 

blaming<00:03:56.319> you<00:03:56.709> might<00:03:56.890> get<00:03:57.100> time<00:03:57.780> you<00:03:58.780> stay<00:03:59.110> I

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
blaming you might get time you stay I

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.539 
blaming you might get time you stay I
think<00:03:59.560> it's<00:03:59.650> way<00:03:59.830> better<00:04:00.010> because<00:04:00.340> the

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
think it's way better because the

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.120 
think it's way better because the
triffids<00:04:01.030> taken<00:04:01.540> I<00:04:01.750> have<00:04:02.350> you<00:04:02.440> swamped<00:04:02.799> a<00:04:02.890> jar

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
triffids taken I have you swamped a jar

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.970 
triffids taken I have you swamped a jar
that<00:04:03.459> I<00:04:03.989> just<00:04:04.989> recommend<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.470> white<00:04:05.650> berries

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
that I just recommend the white berries

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.070 
that I just recommend the white berries
over<00:04:06.160> them<00:04:06.459> home<00:04:07.390> times<00:04:07.630> you<00:04:07.690> can<00:04:07.810> find<00:04:07.959> make

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
over them home times you can find make

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.820 
over them home times you can find make
about<00:04:08.230> entertain<00:04:08.799> our<00:04:09.239> but<00:04:10.380> easier<00:04:11.380> to<00:04:11.500> get<00:04:11.620> to

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
about entertain our but easier to get to

about entertain our but easier to get to
also<00:04:12.750> but<00:04:13.750> I<00:04:14.049> think<00:04:14.769> it's<00:04:14.860> hard<00:04:15.670> to<00:04:15.790> pay<00:04:19.260> so

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
also but I think it's hard to pay so

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.029 
also but I think it's hard to pay so
normally<00:04:21.549> there<00:04:21.609> take<00:04:22.060> me<00:04:22.470> what<00:04:23.470> about<00:04:23.620> time

normally there take me what about time

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.790 
normally there take me what about time
but<00:04:25.080> noticing<00:04:26.080> that<00:04:26.169> there's<00:04:26.350> another<00:04:26.560> guy

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
but noticing that there's another guy

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.880 
but noticing that there's another guy
there<00:04:27.070> and<00:04:27.190> I'm<00:04:27.280> also<00:04:27.490> recording<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.120> video

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:38.550 

seconds<00:04:34.770> then<00:04:35.770> does<00:04:36.550> kind<00:04:36.850> of<00:04:36.880> get<00:04:37.030> born<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.570> I

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
seconds then does kind of get born and I

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.250 
seconds then does kind of get born and I
might<00:04:38.740> do<00:04:38.890> like<00:04:39.039> two<00:04:39.220> trips<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.760> then<00:04:40.260> losing

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
might do like two trips and then losing

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.529 
might do like two trips and then losing
to<00:04:41.380> eat<00:04:41.590> but<00:04:42.100> I<00:04:43.140> like<00:04:44.140> that<00:04:44.320> they<00:04:44.650> break<00:04:45.539> which

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
guess it isn't me 1009 it's 35

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.410 
guess it isn't me 1009 it's 35
