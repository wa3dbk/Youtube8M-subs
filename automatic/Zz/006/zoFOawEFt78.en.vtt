00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.670
 hello friends with you denis workshop 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.560
 an online magazine of civil radio communications and 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.800
 today there will be a small report on 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.500
 radio station gadget rework 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.029
 this radio station ordered nikita from 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.340
 Moscow Nikita here is yours 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.580
 radio station here and serial number 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.000
 it is she who will go to your nearest 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.790
 time 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.219
 Well, let's go through the standard tests 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.200
 let's see how it takes as transfers 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.739
 How does he eat or how much to give 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.910
 power it gives out we start with power 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:50.489
 Now we have a fm mode. fm mode 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.660
 We start the transfer of the vfm station from us gives 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:01:02.100
 about 8 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:06.479
 vlad 8 lats fmk now a m and m too 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.450
 about 8 watts is the perfect rate 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:14.100
 standard for these megajet radios 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.740
 450 per gadget of 658 watts is perfect 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:23.119
 ok now let's see how u 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:28.290
 We are working show bought start from the doorway 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:30.479
 on the handle there is a small free play 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.750
 This means that there is a hysteresis. 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.850
 the radio station is then refined it is very 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.400
 great because such a noise canceller 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.979
 will not open on all sorts of left 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.460
 noises very weak signals will not 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.159
 annoy us with your behavior 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.720
 let's see how he reacts to the transfer with 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.280
 control station as 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:56.689
 control station we have here 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.689
 yosan evolution and go 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.370
 works now let's see how it works 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:14.020
 automatic at you 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:15.640
 automatic noise suppressor all 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.380
 working fine now let's 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.550
 let's listen to how radio stations we have 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.710
 takes the signal 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.650
 We will pass with ash to listen to us 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:30.850
 gadget now we have fm here we have 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.950
 fm a time two three 4 5 times two three 4 5 a 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:43.300
 only one two three four five times two 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:45.910
 three 4 5 in all is good and m and m and m two three 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.370
 4 5 but they are here a little bit off the beaten path 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.450
 and leha leha one two three four five times 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.120
 two three 4 5 aleu 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.400
 now let's see how it is 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.110
 works in the opposite direction 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:06.910
 We will transmit the gadget to listen to it 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:08.019
 yes they are mm times two three 4 5 times two three 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.560
 4 5 a olya 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:15.810
 one two three four five times two three 4 5 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.810
 my work now listen 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.770
 fmr m 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:26.130
 times two three 4 5 times two three 4 5 times two 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:29.640
 three 4 5 times two three 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 too 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:34.040
 everything works fine the transmission works 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:38.630
 Wonderful, that the reception and transmission 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.370
 running capacity within the stated 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.290
 noise suppressors modified also work 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.260
 wonderful modulation nice beautiful 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.170
 ringing Nikita I hope you like this 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.100
 everyone will like the radio station 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.000
 all the best 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.000
