you<00:02:11.190> can<00:02:11.220> now<00:02:11.610> get<00:02:11.970> different<00:02:12.270> chemistry

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
you can now get different chemistry

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.670 
you can now get different chemistry
sales<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.440> if<00:02:13.470> you

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
