that Guillermo Rigondeaux currently

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.979 
that Guillermo Rigondeaux currently
holds<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:41.070> i'm<00:00:41.160> guessing<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.670> WBA<00:00:42.270> decided<00:00:42.899> to

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
holds so i'm guessing the WBA decided to

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.290 
holds so i'm guessing the WBA decided to
strip<00:00:43.290> him<00:00:43.440> off<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> belt<00:00:44.040> that's<00:00:45.030> what<00:00:45.180> I'm

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
strip him off the belt that's what I'm

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.510 
strip him off the belt that's what I'm
guessing<00:00:45.510> am<00:00:46.440> i<00:00:46.590> right<00:00:46.770> or<00:00:46.829> they<00:00:47.250> did

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
guessing am i right or they did

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.369
