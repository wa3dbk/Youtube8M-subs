 so friends continue our video tutorials and 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:22.020
 today we will analyze how to make a hand 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.320
 on the key in three options first need 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:34.590
 understand in general how the hand principle is done 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:37.070
 the movement is likely to come to the key 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:42.030
 caste possible dance 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:45.690
 you must become on put data on 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.420
 your partner cut the side let 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.610
 go down and turn her 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.199
 imitating key rotation in the lock 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.620
 while your partner should turned 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:04.729
 in one place remained to sink but it 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.590
 will work if your partner 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:12.840
 frame works 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.950
 works connect the shoulder and body 1 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:21.310
 and I'm all scenes of me 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:24.890
 rezinochka someone connected it will 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.899
 all this needs to be done simultaneously with 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.960
 movement along with the steps 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:33.020
 simultaneity of the figure imperceptibly but 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.899
 first you need to earn money and there 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.869
 basic step just dancing on 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.579
 table video partner we omit him 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:46.659
 hand on the key and immediately return to yourself 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:46.659
 very simple very comfortable very clear 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.229
 second option from american and 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.549
 which is more common in discos 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.829
 or contests on for convenience after 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:08.739
 main movement partner needs 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.739
 take a step towards a partner 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:19.310
 times two three 4 5 six 7 8 times two three 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:26.560
 Further, in principle, the technique of work is such 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.560
 that is, we do with a cross for a step not 2 and 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.769
 6 religious shah immediately conduct 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.220
 these are all options without losing dynamics 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.530
 us at pear gymnast could have 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.769
 option such 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:51.200
 Olya ball slide it is beautiful but he 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.260
 contract to do it with any bombing 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.470
 which is not 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:00.060
 It does not work because we find America 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:09.530
 we need to skip step to 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:09.530
 be together two times three 4 5 six 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.040
 people's habits of the ability to set about 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:39.359
 pause 7 small layer 1 2 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:42.889
 mind stopping turning to my 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:04:10.919
 this moment I have a little hand 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:04:13.370
 hide elbows change here here by 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:16.440
 telly still some the most important thing to 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:21.359
 triggered framework should get 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:24.690
 beautiful this figure looks dynamic 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:28.550
 since turning is always acceleration 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:31.910
 but here you must stop 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.910
 continue running 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.700
 drama
