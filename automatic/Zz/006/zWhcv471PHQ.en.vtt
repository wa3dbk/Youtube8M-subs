00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
that so i'm going to get this out of the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:51.750 
that so i'm going to get this out of the
box<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.329> we<00:00:36.450> can<00:00:36.630> see<00:00:37.020> what<00:00:37.050> looks<00:00:37.170> like

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.300 

the<00:00:52.760> first<00:00:52.970> thing<00:00:53.120> that<00:00:53.240> we<00:00:53.300> see<00:00:53.510> here<00:00:53.540> is<00:00:54.020> the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
the first thing that we see here is the

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.680 
the first thing that we see here is the
Europe<00:00:55.310> adapter<00:00:55.910> so<00:00:56.090> if<00:00:56.180> you're<00:00:56.360> going<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:56.570> be

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
Europe adapter so if you're going to be

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.060 
Europe adapter so if you're going to be
traveling<00:00:57.050> anything<00:00:57.470> I<00:00:57.590> guess<00:00:57.740> you<00:00:57.860> could<00:00:57.890> use

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
traveling anything I guess you could use

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.620 
traveling anything I guess you could use
this<00:00:58.220> little<00:00:58.280> adapter<00:00:58.700> so<00:00:59.120> you<00:00:59.180> can<00:00:59.330> plug<00:00:59.480> it

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
this little adapter so you can plug it

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.270 
this little adapter so you can plug it
in<00:00:59.780> in<00:00:59.930> another<00:01:00.350> country<00:01:00.620> so<00:01:00.950> let's<00:01:01.070> go<00:01:01.160> and

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
in in another country so let's go and

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.890 
in in another country so let's go and
get<00:01:01.340> to<00:01:01.460> the<00:01:01.489> main<00:01:01.670> device<00:01:01.940> pull<00:01:02.630> this<00:01:02.720> out<00:01:02.870> of

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
get to the main device pull this out of

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
get to the main device pull this out of
the<00:01:03.020> box<00:01:03.200> here<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.440> first<00:01:03.620> thing<00:01:03.680> that<00:01:03.860> I

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
the box here the first thing that I

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.560 
the box here the first thing that I
notice<00:01:04.160> it's<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:04.520> really<00:01:04.730> good<00:01:04.850> looking<00:01:05.270> device

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
notice it's a really good looking device

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.390 
notice it's a really good looking device
it's<00:01:05.900> obviously<00:01:06.530> going<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:06.740> be<00:01:06.830> a<00:01:06.890> fingerprint

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
it's obviously going to be a fingerprint

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.060 
it's obviously going to be a fingerprint
magnet<00:01:07.550> but<00:01:08.390> really<00:01:08.840> overall<00:01:09.290> it's<00:01:09.590> I<00:01:09.770> like<00:01:09.950> it

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.300 
it's sleek in the black and the yellow
really<00:01:11.960> pop<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:12.560> another<00:01:12.950> things<00:01:13.190> you're

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
really pop and another things you're

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.380 
really pop and another things you're
gonna<00:01:13.400> notice<00:01:13.640> in<00:01:13.729> your<00:01:13.760> segments<00:01:14.270> it

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
gonna notice in your segments it

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.870 
gonna notice in your segments it
actually<00:01:14.690> has<00:01:14.810> two<00:01:15.080> USB<00:01:15.260> ports<00:01:15.560> one<00:01:16.550> is<00:01:16.670> for

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
actually has two USB ports one is for

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.280 
actually has two USB ports one is for
something<00:01:17.060> that'll<00:01:17.360> you<00:01:17.479> do<00:01:17.750> an<00:01:17.869> optimized

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
something that'll you do an optimized

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.960 
something that'll you do an optimized
charge<00:01:18.650> like<00:01:18.920> an<00:01:19.040> iPhone<00:01:19.340> or<00:01:19.369> an<00:01:19.520> iPad<00:01:19.910> or

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
charge like an iPhone or an iPad or

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.520 
charge like an iPhone or an iPad or
something<00:01:20.420> like<00:01:20.510> that<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:20.900> then<00:01:21.410> the<00:01:21.500> other

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
something like that and then the other

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.200 
something like that and then the other
one<00:01:21.800> is<00:01:21.830> a<00:01:21.920> general<00:01:22.430> port<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:22.940> you<00:01:23.000> can<00:01:23.119> just

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
one is a general port and you can just

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.120 
one is a general port and you can just
plug<00:01:23.390> in<00:01:23.479> anything<00:01:23.600> USB<00:01:24.200> in<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:24.740> won't<00:01:24.950> use

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
plug in anything USB in and it won't use

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.560 
plug in anything USB in and it won't use
an<00:01:25.280> optimized<00:01:25.670> charge<00:01:25.940> so<00:01:26.150> it<00:01:26.240> won't<00:01:26.360> charge

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
an optimized charge so it won't charge

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.210 
an optimized charge so it won't charge
it<00:01:26.750> as<00:01:26.840> well<00:01:27.020> as<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.380> optimized<00:01:27.800> port<00:01:28.100> would

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
it as well as the optimized port would

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.650 
it as well as the optimized port would
but<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:28.580> can<00:01:28.700> also<00:01:28.820> charge<00:01:29.060> up<00:01:29.330> to<00:01:29.360> two

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
but you can also charge up to two

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.330 
but you can also charge up to two
devices<00:01:29.990> at<00:01:30.259> one<00:01:30.530> time<00:01:30.740> with<00:01:30.920> this<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:31.190> that's

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
devices at one time with this so that's

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.980 
devices at one time with this so that's
really<00:01:31.520> cool<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.300> this<00:01:32.390> thing<00:01:32.540> is<00:01:32.660> just<00:01:32.720> so

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
really cool and this thing is just so

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.780 
really cool and this thing is just so
good-looking<00:01:33.200> it's<00:01:33.530> real<00:01:33.680> glossy<00:01:34.220> there<00:01:34.700> you

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
good-looking it's real glossy there you

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.280 
good-looking it's real glossy there you
