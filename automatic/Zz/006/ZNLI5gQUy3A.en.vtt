okay<00:00:01.920> now<00:00:02.129> that<00:00:02.310> we<00:00:02.429> have<00:00:02.639> I<00:00:02.669> guess<00:00:03.000> our<00:00:03.179> tune

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
okay now that we have I guess our tune

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.720 
okay now that we have I guess our tune
like<00:00:03.720> that<00:00:03.959> it<00:00:04.470> might<00:00:04.740> rattle<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.279> little<00:00:05.580> bit

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
like that it might rattle a little bit

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.460 
like that it might rattle a little bit
because<00:00:05.970> of<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.299> fact<00:00:06.390> that<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.960> strength<00:00:07.290> of

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
because of the fact that the strength of

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.730 
because of the fact that the strength of
below<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.220> then<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.870> lightness<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.559> the

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
below and then the lightness of the

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.280 
below and then the lightness of the
gauge<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.010> strength<00:00:11.639> because<00:00:12.540> if<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:12.870> had<00:00:13.139> it

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
gauge of strength because if you had it

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.079 
gauge of strength because if you had it
if<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.920> had<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.099> seven<00:00:14.460> string<00:00:14.639> guitar<00:00:14.670> of

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
if you had a seven string guitar of

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.060 
if you had a seven string guitar of
course<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.990> strings<00:00:16.350> would<00:00:16.560> be<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.859> right

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
course the strings would be the right

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.240 
course the strings would be the right
thickness<00:00:17.600> but<00:00:18.600> now<00:00:18.810> what<00:00:19.740> we're<00:00:19.890> going<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.070> do

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
thickness but now what we're going to do

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.099 
thickness but now what we're going to do
we're<00:00:20.460> gonna<00:00:20.550> give<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> real<00:00:21.330> real<00:00:21.600> simple

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
we're gonna give you a real real simple

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.310 
we're gonna give you a real real simple
lesson<00:00:23.100> what<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.150> do<00:00:24.359> okay<00:00:24.720> let's<00:00:25.109> say<00:00:25.260> you

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
lesson what you do okay let's say you

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.189 
lesson what you do okay let's say you
play<00:00:25.590> C<00:00:25.859> chord<00:00:26.130> now<00:00:27.060> instead<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.930> point<00:00:28.140> you

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
play C chord now instead of point you

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.750 
play C chord now instead of point you
see<00:00:28.470> we<00:00:28.590> would<00:00:28.740> like<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.429> don't<00:00:29.550> want<00:00:29.699> to

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
see we would like that you don't want to

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.389 
see we would like that you don't want to
do<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.060> because<00:00:30.840> now<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.679> have<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.980> strings

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
do that because now we have the strings

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.090 
do that because now we have the strings
actually<00:00:33.000> tuned<00:00:33.360> upside<00:00:33.870> down<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:34.950> is

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
actually tuned upside down so this is

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.930 
actually tuned upside down so this is
going<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> be<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.640> see<00:00:35.880> board<00:00:36.800> so<00:00:37.800> now<00:00:38.010> what

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
going to be you see board so now what

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.670 
going to be you see board so now what
we're<00:00:39.090> gonna<00:00:39.180> do<00:00:41.870> instead<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.410> be<00:00:43.590> an

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
we're gonna do instead of it be an

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.979 
we're gonna do instead of it be an
opposite<00:00:44.219> way<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.700> now<00:00:45.450> if<00:00:45.539> you're<00:00:45.660> gonna<00:00:45.750> play

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
opposite way so now if you're gonna play

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.170 
opposite way so now if you're gonna play
rhythm<00:00:46.469> you're<00:00:46.680> gonna<00:00:46.770> play<00:00:49.969> and<00:00:50.969> you

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
rhythm you're gonna play and you

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.479 
rhythm you're gonna play and you
actually<00:00:51.449> played<00:00:52.110> an<00:00:52.320> octave<00:00:52.739> lower<00:00:52.770> than

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
actually played an octave lower than

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.100 
actually played an octave lower than
what<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.270> would<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.510> been<00:00:54.660> playing<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
what you would have been playing the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.770 
what you would have been playing the
bass<00:00:55.289> before<00:00:55.829> if<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.760> used<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.180> playing<00:00:57.420> six

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
actually take and play just by rotating

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.030 
actually take and play just by rotating
the<00:01:20.610> root<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> fifth<00:01:21.479> upside<00:01:22.020> down<00:01:22.380> so

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
the root and the fifth upside down so

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:50.590 
the root and the fifth upside down so
we're<00:01:23.159> going<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.340> start<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.759> off<00:01:23.880> like<00:01:24.090> this

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
that's all you're doing if you rotate in

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.790 
that's all you're doing if you rotate in
root<00:01:59.000> and<00:01:59.240> fifth<00:01:59.540> just<00:01:59.840> to<00:02:00.020> make<00:02:00.200> it<00:02:00.229> simple

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
root and fifth just to make it simple

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.180 
root and fifth just to make it simple
you're<00:02:01.460> rotating<00:02:01.670> it<00:02:02.180> upside<00:02:02.660> down<00:02:03.040> in<00:02:04.040> other

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
you're rotating it upside down in other

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.710 
you're rotating it upside down in other
words<00:02:04.430> where<00:02:04.760> your<00:02:04.910> fifth<00:02:05.150> string<00:02:05.390> would<00:02:05.570> be

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
words where your fifth string would be

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.990 
words where your fifth string would be
now<00:02:05.900> your<00:02:06.080> sixth<00:02:06.409> string<00:02:06.650> is<00:02:06.860> where<00:02:07.580> your<00:02:07.729> six

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
now your sixth string is where your six

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.760 
now your sixth string is where your six
string<00:02:08.240> would<00:02:08.390> be<00:02:08.600> now<00:02:08.840> your<00:02:09.020> fifth<00:02:09.289> string<00:02:09.530> is

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
string would be now your fifth string is

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.310 
string would be now your fifth string is
so<00:02:10.670> now<00:02:10.910> what<00:02:11.540> I'm<00:02:11.660> gonna<00:02:11.750> do<00:02:11.990> I'm<00:02:12.260> gonna
