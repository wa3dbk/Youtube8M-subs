00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
actually like a strategy there is one

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.200 
actually like a strategy there is one
tip<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.719> very<00:00:49.170> crucial<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:50.210> completing

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
tip that is very crucial to completing

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.170 
tip that is very crucial to completing
these<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.530> knowing<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.670> there<00:00:53.969> is

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
these and that is knowing that there is

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.689 
these and that is knowing that there is
a<00:00:54.210> cool<00:00:54.719> down<00:00:54.930> for<00:00:55.230> each<00:00:55.500> thing<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.550> for

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
a cool down for each thing so like for

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.209 
a cool down for each thing so like for
this<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.059> hatched<00:00:57.329> dragons<00:00:57.829> use<00:00:58.829> dragon

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
this one is hatched dragons use dragon

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.010 
this one is hatched dragons use dragon
fury<00:00:59.399> win<00:00:59.670> battles<00:01:00.030> that's<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.420> step<00:01:00.660> I'm<00:01:00.809> on

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
fury win battles that's the step I'm on

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.410 
fury win battles that's the step I'm on
so<00:01:01.530> when<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.710> say<00:01:01.980> cool<00:01:02.250> down<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.640> mean<00:01:02.850> like<00:01:03.149> for

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
so when I say cool down I mean like for

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.020 
so when I say cool down I mean like for
this<00:01:03.510> one<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.049> can<00:01:04.320> only<00:01:04.619> hatch<00:01:05.220> two

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
this one like I can only hatch two

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.000 
this one like I can only hatch two
dragons<00:01:06.630> say<00:01:07.350> every<00:01:07.830> hour<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.460> only<00:01:08.880> do<00:01:09.360> I

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
dragons say every hour I can only do I

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.630 
dragons say every hour I can only do I
believe<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.479> to<00:01:12.479> dragon<00:01:13.049> fury<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
believe it to dragon fury and for the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.300 
believe it to dragon fury and for the
battles<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.600> only<00:01:15.720> do<00:01:16.049> three<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.740> think<00:01:17.189> it's

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
battles I can only do three I think it's

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.499 
battles I can only do three I think it's
actually<00:01:17.580> longer<00:01:17.700> than<00:01:17.850> an<00:01:18.000> hour<00:01:18.060> maybe<00:01:18.330> like

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
actually longer than an hour maybe like

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.539 
actually longer than an hour maybe like
an<00:01:18.600> hour<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:19.020> half<00:01:19.200> or<00:01:19.380> two<00:01:19.439> hours<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:20.400> so

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
an hour and a half or two hours but so

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.010 
an hour and a half or two hours but so
when<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.850> start<00:01:21.119> doing<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.750> figure

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
when you start doing this you can figure

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.719 
when you start doing this you can figure
it<00:01:22.229> out<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.560> when<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.189> first<00:01:23.400> start

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
it out like when you first start

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.240 
it out like when you first start
whatever<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.420> was<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.080> first<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.530> you

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
whatever it was on that first one you

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.249 
whatever it was on that first one you
can<00:01:26.430> kind<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.729> figure<00:01:26.880> out<00:01:27.030> how<00:01:27.840> many<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.140> it

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
can kind of figure out how many is it

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.420 
can kind of figure out how many is it
going<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.439> let<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.680> do<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.340> let

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
you do two three or four is it only

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.289 
you do two three or four is it only
going<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.710> let<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.070> one<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.579> then<00:01:32.640> when

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
you notice that you're not getting them

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.850 
you notice that you're not getting them
anymore<00:01:35.040> stop<00:01:35.880> wait<00:01:36.509> an<00:01:36.630> hour<00:01:36.810> or<00:01:37.380> an<00:01:37.650> hour<00:01:37.740> and

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
the farms there's another one that also

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.090 
the farms there's another one that also
when<00:02:33.480> you're<00:02:33.630> collecting<00:02:33.810> food<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.620> easiest

food just do the despite cherries for
the<00:02:40.020> 30<00:02:40.560> seconds<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.640> if<00:02:41.760> I'm<00:02:41.910> trying<00:02:42.150> to

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
the 30 seconds so if I'm trying to

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.080 
the 30 seconds so if I'm trying to
collect<00:02:42.540> gold<00:02:42.870> I'll<00:02:43.380> do<00:02:43.620> each<00:02:43.920> farm<00:02:44.310> by<00:02:44.670> itself

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
collect gold I'll do each farm by itself

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.940

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
instead of doing a multi plant and when

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.170 
instead of doing a multi plant and when
it's<00:02:49.260> collecting<00:02:49.770> food<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.130> just<00:02:50.370> find<00:02:50.940> the

more<00:03:42.660> difficult<00:03:42.960> so<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.710> way<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:43.920> can<00:03:44.400> build

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
more difficult so that way you can build

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:53.670
