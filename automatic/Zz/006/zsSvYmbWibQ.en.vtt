swiping<00:03:08.459> down<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.360> got<00:03:10.110> here

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
swiping down you got here

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.710 
swiping down you got here
oh<00:03:10.760> okay<00:03:11.760> you've<00:03:11.910> got<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.090> be<00:03:12.150> very<00:03:12.270> precise

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
oh okay you've got to be very precise

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.470 
oh okay you've got to be very precise

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
wasn't a big fan so if I press on it and

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.350 
wasn't a big fan so if I press on it and

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.720 
so where we used to have colorful icons
down<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.080> side<00:03:43.290> it's<00:03:44.100> not<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.280> small<00:03:44.489> black<00:03:44.700> and

effect<00:04:32.440> I<00:04:32.830> believe<00:04:33.810> this<00:04:34.810> means<00:04:35.280> you<00:04:36.280> go<00:04:36.400> to

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
effect I believe this means you go to

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.670 
effect I believe this means you go to
nine<00:04:36.730> mode<00:04:36.970> it<00:04:37.180> only<00:04:37.330> uses<00:04:37.690> certain<00:04:38.080> LEDs<00:04:40.680> you

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
nine mode it only uses certain LEDs you

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.810 
nine mode it only uses certain LEDs you
can<00:04:41.800> have<00:04:41.920> a<00:04:41.980> widget<00:04:42.160> on<00:04:42.310> your<00:04:42.370> screen<00:04:42.700> that

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
can have a widget on your screen that

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.610 
can have a widget on your screen that
you<00:04:42.850> tap<00:04:43.060> and<00:04:43.240> it<00:04:43.270> does<00:04:43.480> that<00:04:43.660> and<00:04:43.990> why<00:04:44.560> you

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
you tap and it does that and why you

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.270 
you tap and it does that and why you
might<00:04:45.040> ask<00:04:45.250> well<00:04:45.580> it<00:04:45.760> just<00:04:45.910> uses<00:04:46.240> a<00:04:46.270> lot<00:04:46.720> less

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
might ask well it just uses a lot less

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.010 
might ask well it just uses a lot less
battery<00:04:48.280> power<00:04:48.490> if<00:04:49.120> it's<00:04:49.300> only<00:04:49.480> using<00:04:49.720> the<00:04:49.870> red

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
battery power if it's only using the red

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.100 
battery power if it's only using the red
LEDs<00:04:50.410> as<00:04:50.560> opposed<00:04:50.890> to<00:04:51.010> all<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:51.400> LEDs<00:04:51.760> I

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
LEDs as opposed to all the LEDs I

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.410 
LEDs as opposed to all the LEDs I
believe<00:04:53.280> this<00:04:54.280> is<00:04:54.340> one<00:04:54.550> thing<00:04:54.700> I<00:04:54.790> loved<00:04:55.150> when<00:04:55.390> I

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
believe this is one thing I loved when I

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.230 
believe this is one thing I loved when I
did<00:04:55.600> use<00:04:55.810> this<00:04:56.200> on<00:04:56.440> my<00:04:56.500> Nexus<00:04:56.800> One<00:04:57.090> so<00:04:58.090> the

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
did use this on my Nexus One so the

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.900 
did use this on my Nexus One so the
automatic<00:04:58.560> lighting<00:04:59.560> caused<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.640> to<00:05:00.730> annoy

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
automatic lighting caused you to annoy

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.130 
automatic lighting caused you to annoy
me<00:05:00.940> a<00:05:01.090> little<00:05:01.270> bit<00:05:01.450> because<00:05:01.600> it<00:05:01.870> was<00:05:01.900> always

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
me a little bit because it was always

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.350 
me a little bit because it was always
just<00:05:02.290> slightly<00:05:03.190> darker<00:05:03.850> than<00:05:03.970> I<00:05:04.060> would<00:05:04.240> want

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
just slightly darker than I would want

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.340 
just slightly darker than I would want
it<00:05:04.980> so<00:05:05.980> by<00:05:06.160> enabling<00:05:06.370> custom<00:05:07.320> you<00:05:08.320> can

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
it so by enabling custom you can

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.320 
it so by enabling custom you can
actually<00:05:08.590> edit<00:05:08.890> the<00:05:09.100> levels<00:05:12.210> exactly<00:05:13.210> how

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
actually edit the levels exactly how

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.120 
actually edit the levels exactly how
this<00:05:13.450> works<00:05:13.800> okay<00:05:15.870> I<00:05:16.870> believe<00:05:17.050> the<00:05:17.800> number<00:05:18.040> on

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
this works okay I believe the number on

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.920 
this works okay I believe the number on
the<00:05:18.250> side<00:05:18.490> there<00:05:18.790> is<00:05:18.970> how<00:05:19.300> bright<00:05:19.660> the

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
the side there is how bright the

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.010 
the side there is how bright the
proximity<00:05:20.380> sounds<00:05:20.920> like<00:05:21.070> sensing<00:05:21.750> as<00:05:22.750> you<00:05:22.930> can

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
proximity sounds like sensing as you can

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.780 
proximity sounds like sensing as you can

buttons<00:05:34.050> so<00:05:35.050> in<00:05:35.110> fact<00:05:35.260> the<00:05:35.350> buttons<00:05:35.650> come<00:05:35.860> on

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
buttons so in fact the buttons come on

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.820 
buttons so in fact the buttons come on
just<00:05:36.670> we<00:05:36.850> go<00:05:36.970> underneath<00:05:37.270> 90<00:05:37.930> and<00:05:38.500> they<00:05:38.710> are

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
just we go underneath 90 and they are

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.880 
just we go underneath 90 and they are
and<00:05:39.820> then<00:05:39.970> quite<00:05:40.210> now<00:05:40.390> we<00:05:40.540> can<00:05:40.720> kind<00:05:41.620> of<00:05:41.650> get<00:05:41.770> in

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
and then quite now we can kind of get in

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.150 
and then quite now we can kind of get in
over<00:05:42.010> 90<00:05:42.550> so<00:05:43.230> face<00:05:44.230> it<00:05:44.440> up<00:05:44.530> towards<00:05:44.860> the<00:05:44.920> light

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
over 90 so face it up towards the light

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:55.020 
over 90 so face it up towards the light
nope<00:05:46.890> 440<00:05:47.890> in<00:05:47.980> fact<00:05:48.900> 90<00:05:53.070> but<00:05:54.070> in<00:05:54.190> theory<00:05:54.430> I<00:05:54.790> got

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
nope 440 in fact 90 but in theory I got

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.640 
nope 440 in fact 90 but in theory I got
it<00:05:55.120> up<00:05:55.210> over<00:05:55.450> 90<00:05:55.840> in<00:05:55.900> the<00:05:56.020> lights<00:05:56.230> along<00:05:56.500> the

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
it up over 90 in the lights along the

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.360 
it up over 90 in the lights along the
button<00:05:56.920> on<00:05:57.280> the<00:05:57.430> buttons<00:05:57.700> go<00:05:57.970> off<00:05:58.470> so<00:05:59.470> yeah

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
button on the buttons go off so yeah

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.660 
button on the buttons go off so yeah
that<00:06:00.820> was<00:06:00.970> on<00:06:01.090> my<00:06:01.210> favourite<00:06:01.660> features<00:06:02.050> a

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.670 
that was on my favourite features a

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.160 
that was on my favourite features a
status<00:06:03.670> bar<00:06:03.940> we<00:06:04.150> can<00:06:04.180> tweak<00:06:04.570> so<00:06:04.780> you<00:06:04.840> can<00:06:05.020> have

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.170 
status bar we can tweak so you can have

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.500 
status bar we can tweak so you can have
it<00:06:05.290> so<00:06:05.440> it<00:06:05.530> shows<00:06:05.830> the<00:06:06.430> actual<00:06:06.580> percentage<00:06:07.300> in

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
it so it shows the actual percentage in

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.870 
it so it shows the actual percentage in
the<00:06:07.950> in<00:06:08.950> the<00:06:09.100> battery<00:06:09.520> I<00:06:11.370> was<00:06:12.370> anyway<00:06:12.700> I<00:06:12.730> think

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
the in the battery I was anyway I think

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.260 
the in the battery I was anyway I think
you<00:06:14.100> can<00:06:15.100> turn<00:06:15.280> off<00:06:15.490> the<00:06:15.700> clock

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.270 

test<00:06:19.270> about<00:06:19.540> is<00:06:19.780> that<00:06:19.930> oh<00:06:20.140> that's<00:06:20.860> the<00:06:20.980> actual

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
test about is that oh that's the actual

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.770 
test about is that oh that's the actual
I<00:06:21.400> get<00:06:21.580> it<00:06:21.700> so<00:06:21.850> the<00:06:22.030> instead<00:06:22.330> of<00:06:22.420> just<00:06:22.510> having<00:06:22.690> a

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
I get it so the instead of just having a

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.590 
I get it so the instead of just having a
single<00:06:22.840> I<00:06:23.200> will<00:06:23.380> show<00:06:23.530> the<00:06:23.710> actual<00:06:24.070> like

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
single I will show the actual like

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.520 
single I will show the actual like
reading<00:06:27.300> date<00:06:28.300> and<00:06:28.570> provide<00:06:28.840> a<00:06:28.870> notification

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530 
reading date and provide a notification

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.640 
reading date and provide a notification
colors<00:06:30.520> tweaks<00:06:31.060> extras

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.930 

accelerometer<00:06:36.650> rotation<00:06:37.280> so<00:06:37.490> you<00:06:37.520> can<00:06:37.730> say

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
accelerometer rotation so you can say

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.250 
accelerometer rotation so you can say
which<00:06:38.210> which<00:06:38.690> angles<00:06:39.110> you<00:06:39.200> want<00:06:39.440> it<00:06:39.560> to<00:06:39.710> work

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.260 
which which angles you want it to work

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.590 
which which angles you want it to work
doing<00:06:42.260> there<00:06:42.470> nope

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 
doing there nope

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.740 
doing there nope
I'm<00:06:44.600> going<00:06:45.290> to<00:06:45.350> turn<00:06:45.470> up<00:06:46.600> interesting

oh this one quick boots otherwise I do a

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.530 
oh this one quick boots otherwise I do a
bit<00:06:55.100> of<00:06:55.130> editing<00:06:55.250> yet<00:06:55.639> quickly<00:06:56.270> it's<00:06:56.389> worth

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:56.540 
bit of editing yet quickly it's worth

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.800 
bit of editing yet quickly it's worth
just<00:06:56.570> the<00:06:56.930> actual<00:06:58.240> launch<00:06:59.240> are<00:06:59.510> basically

00:06:59.800 --> 00:06:59.810 
just the actual launch are basically

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.460 
just the actual launch are basically
rebooted<00:07:00.410> there<00:07:00.590> rather<00:07:00.800> than<00:07:00.919> our<00:07:01.190> phone<00:07:02.470> but

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.470 
rebooted there rather than our phone but

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.460 
rebooted there rather than our phone but
still<00:07:04.330> shows<00:07:05.330> perhaps<00:07:05.780> it's<00:07:05.990> not<00:07:06.139> the<00:07:06.200> most

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:06.470
