light<00:01:03.310> gun<00:01:03.579> instead<00:01:04.089> you<00:01:04.330> use<00:01:04.560> your<00:01:05.560> Atari

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
light gun instead you use your Atari

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.980 
with the awkward design of the 7800
controller<00:01:12.340> can<00:01:12.580> probably<00:01:12.850> feel<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.420> pain

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
controller can probably feel the pain

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.249 
controller can probably feel the pain
playing<00:01:14.950> this<00:01:15.160> just<00:01:15.520> watching<00:01:15.910> the<00:01:16.000> video<00:01:16.270> it

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
playing this just watching the video it

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.520 
playing this just watching the video it
hurts<00:01:18.009> so<00:01:18.430> I'd<00:01:18.850> recommend<00:01:19.380> something<00:01:20.380> like

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
hurts so I'd recommend something like

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.280 
hurts so I'd recommend something like
the<00:01:20.800> Atari<00:01:21.070> 7800<00:01:21.700> gamepad<00:01:22.479> or<00:01:22.660> a<00:01:22.720> Genesis

the Atari 7800 gamepad or a Genesis

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.469 
the Atari 7800 gamepad or a Genesis
controller<00:01:23.530> instead<00:01:24.280> move<00:01:25.060> your<00:01:25.240> cursor

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
controller instead move your cursor

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.149 
controller instead move your cursor
around<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.020> screen<00:01:26.080> and<00:01:26.350> shoot<00:01:26.680> enemies

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
around the screen and shoot enemies

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.270 
around the screen and shoot enemies
before<00:01:27.400> they<00:01:27.729> swipe<00:01:28.120> your<00:01:28.540> eggs<00:01:28.870> and<00:01:29.470> if<00:01:29.680> you

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
before they swipe your eggs and if you

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.160 
before they swipe your eggs and if you
shoot<00:01:30.610> them<00:01:30.790> while<00:01:31.000> they're<00:01:31.150> carrying<00:01:31.659> an<00:01:31.840> egg

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
shoot them while they're carrying an egg

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.770 
shoot them while they're carrying an egg
off<00:01:32.380> screen<00:01:33.070> like<00:01:33.310> defender<00:01:34.060> you<00:01:34.210> can<00:01:34.390> pick<00:01:34.600> up

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
off screen like defender you can pick up

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.609 
off screen like defender you can pick up
the<00:01:34.930> egg<00:01:35.110> and<00:01:35.290> place<00:01:35.470> it<00:01:35.680> back<00:01:35.860> in<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.159> nest

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
the egg and place it back in the nest

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.630 
the egg and place it back in the nest
that's<00:01:38.619> probably<00:01:39.010> why<00:01:39.190> you<00:01:39.250> don't<00:01:39.490> use<00:01:39.610> a

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
that's probably why you don't use a

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.480 
that's probably why you don't use a
light<00:01:39.850> gun<00:01:40.030> for<00:01:40.240> this<00:01:40.299> game<00:01:40.540> but<00:01:40.720> it<00:01:41.140> it's<00:01:41.950> it's

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
light gun for this game but it it's it's

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.789 
light gun for this game but it it's it's
just<00:01:42.670> tough<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.720> controls<00:01:44.140> are<00:01:44.290> touchy<00:01:44.500> and

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
just tough the controls are touchy and

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:53.660 
just tough the controls are touchy and
the<00:01:45.340> enemies<00:01:45.670> are<00:01:45.880> fast

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.179 

you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.420> fit<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> maximum<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.409> five<00:01:55.710> eggs<00:01:55.979> in

you can fit a maximum of five eggs in
one<00:01:56.369> nest<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.180> rewind<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.810> video<00:01:57.990> to

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
one nest and you can rewind the video to

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.719 
one nest and you can rewind the video to
the<00:01:58.439> beginning<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:58.950> watch<00:01:59.100> where<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.400> screwed

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
the beginning to watch where I screwed

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.190 
the beginning to watch where I screwed
that<00:01:59.850> up<00:01:59.909> once<00:02:02.119> one<00:02:03.119> strategy<00:02:03.720> is<00:02:03.869> just<00:02:04.049> a

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
that up once one strategy is just a

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.960 
that up once one strategy is just a
hover<00:02:04.439> over<00:02:04.799> one<00:02:04.920> or<00:02:04.979> two<00:02:05.220> nests<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.759> try<00:02:05.909> to

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
hover over one or two nests and try to

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.150 
hover over one or two nests and try to
keep<00:02:06.180> them<00:02:06.420> safe<00:02:06.720> but<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.649> end<00:02:07.799> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
keep them safe but in the end the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.490 
keep them safe but in the end the
creatures<00:02:08.610> always<00:02:08.970> win<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:09.929> like<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
creatures always win I like that the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.559 
creatures always win I like that the
game<00:02:10.709> progresses<00:02:11.220> through<00:02:11.700> levels<00:02:12.060> like<00:02:12.360> a

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
game progresses through levels like a

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.680 
game progresses through levels like a
forest<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:14.100> sewers<00:02:14.900> underwater<00:02:17.660> Castlevania

eggs anyway I question the realism of
cracked<00:02:35.160> seems<00:02:36.090> like<00:02:36.269> somebody<00:02:36.690> just<00:02:36.750> made

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
cracked seems like somebody just made

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.970 
cracked seems like somebody just made
this<00:02:37.440> game<00:02:37.709> up<00:02:38.360> obviously<00:02:39.380> you<00:02:40.380> scored<00:02:40.709> for
