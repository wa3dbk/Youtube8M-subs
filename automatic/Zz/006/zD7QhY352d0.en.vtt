00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.190
 hello today we have a request for an examination 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.109
 she sent me this photo for 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.300
 facebook on the pages that you managed 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.309
 I have made handmade soft designs 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.620
 you want to know how the patterns are made 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.720
 for this good vest because we 're going to 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.360
 fix in several references one is going to be 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.039
 the shoulder the shoulder falls in half is 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.580
 the armholes we realize that they come to 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.200
 half of the shoulder 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.200
 the neckline comes under the chest 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.279
 the beak does not fall height 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.500
 hip height at the hip height 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.660
 and here goes a little bit lower 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.539
 Given this and this is 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.000
 a capful of adornment because I think 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.760
 this model of vest from behind goes 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.100
 straight then we have to have in 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.839
 that go behind as the rest 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.940
 At least we are going to do it 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.890
 well then the case is that here 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.110
 we have to keep in mind this is a 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.699
 adornment for the photos we do not 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.199
 it seems to be a pocket 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.570
 well considering this we are going 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.879
 to move on to the pattern that we have to 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.470
 do the basic dress pattern to the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.560
 hip height you also find it 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.500
 in my channel the basic dress pattern 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.630
 in my channel soft hand designs and what 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.670
 we do up to hip height 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.189
 well here we have our patterns 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.380
 basic as you are seeing here is and 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:23.049
 My transformation is already done 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.210
 I'm going to explain explaining how it is here 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.369
 we have the hip high pattern 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.600
 reaches the hip height and stops 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.850
 do the little piquito we have taken from 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.670
 reference to the clip because of the photo 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.799
 it is seen that the little piquito of the vest arrives 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.810
 up there so high hip and 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.479
 we have measured 8 centimeters and made of 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.630
 make here 12 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.509
 and a straight line up there and so has not 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.390
 come out the piquito here we have to have 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.390
 in account that we have the high of 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.819
 chest in this measure is the height of 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.250
 chest so it does not reach the nipple 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.830
 and how the neckline goes under our 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.909
 chest I have marked 8 centimeters under 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.189
 but you can measure yourself and look from 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.310
 the islands to your under your chest 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.380
 what measures you and well I in my case are 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.510
 8 centimeters and you if they are more or less 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.560
 It does not matter much either because 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.680
 it's going to look good, you can give it 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.129
 perfectly 8 centimeters 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.290
 here we come to the shoulder and we have marked 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.810
 half of our shoulder I made a 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.719
 marquita and there I have taken them to the 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.719
 sisa that looks look there 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.340
 I marked it until the armhole 4 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.680
 centimeters and the post a brand like that 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.540
 that I have made here the line of our 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.310
 necklines are rounded that at 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.860
 principle as you see our photos and here 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.660
 as a little rest good with this 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.370
 I have faced the two patterns and here I have 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.700
 marked the part of the neck and the part 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.340
 armhole that have joined there like 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.170
 the other pattern so with this and you 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.440
 I will say that we have nothing left 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.560
 that mark the views the views are worth 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.990
 the same fabric of the vest and the lining 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.090
 will cut from there in sight 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.820
 front bearing in mind that active 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.380
 this as if it were a jacket so 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.380
 look at the front view as it goes 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.170
 if you look closely I've put it straight to 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.630
 an inch and a half and here a small 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.930
 curve to then bring me the straight up 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.780
 down 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.510
 Well, the views are cut in the 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.460
 same fabric of the vest and the rest will go 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.650
 fort because the vest we have to 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.360
 do it lined the pocket goes to two 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.550
 centimeters of the waist 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.510
 I have marked a straight line because it is 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.400
 more than we have to do it 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.460
 also on the web and spend our 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.110
 Sanchez or our loose threads for a 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.970
 When sewing the father by the 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.130
 Pocket will serve as a reference 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.990
 good the capita measures about ten 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.209
 centimeters two centimeters down 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.310
 and the center four or ten 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.890
 centimeters to five we mark one 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.300
 straight line four centimeters and join 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.970
 our two parts 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.340
 we will make four pieces of the caps 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.130
 lazcoz we will do together in the reverse we give 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.760
 Stitch around a millimeter 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:13.140
 the seam of the well ironed edge and 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.060
 dry will be good here because you know this 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.489
 at the time of taking it to the employer it will be 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.880
 very simple first you make the piece 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.160
 whole and then it will be cutting the views 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.590
 once you have trimmed the views 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.780
 you have to mark them as I see that 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.650
 I have marked them I have put my list 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.690
 front sisa front is for you to 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.460
 the time to cut it all the pattern yo 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.120
 I do not see much cluelessness when pieces 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:42.240
 of pattern so marked already I have described 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.910
 in our pattern we will do that this 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.790
 we will also cut this piece of cloth 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.560
 also whom will we cut two and 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.440
 state tried this whole piece 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.360
 we also cut two and also where 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.460
 our part of the lining with when 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.000
 we have the clues cut what we 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:03.120
 it is what we leave, we do it in good fort 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.890
 the back already I have commented here 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.990
 8 centimeters from the hip height 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.870
 we climb we make a straight line and 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.540
 exactly the same views of a 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.129
 inch and a half then we will join it 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.319
 to the lining 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:19.169
 and the lining is the part that we have left 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:21.479
 is also checked back view was 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.569
 good neck view as this goes on 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:27.599
 a piece so here we will put the 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:31.319
 double fabric and here we put the double cloth 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:33.300
 and we cut the piece of the vest is going to 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:34.769
 be more elegant than if we put with 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.379
 tourists than 3 

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:40.229
 well, considering this well 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:43.139
 we're going to take it to the web and it's very 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:45.119
 simple as I specified that what 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:48.269
 I wanted to know in the patterns well 

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:49.429
 So far the patterns are explained 

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:52.379
 if there are doubts 

00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:54.449
 as always questions that nothing happens 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:56.669
 As I always tell you, we do it 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:58.919
 together without any problems every time 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.169
 I asked and I answered without any 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.119
 problem and I do not ask myself the questions 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.889
 to ask me all the questions that 

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:07.559
 you need that for me there is no 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:10.949
 On the contrary, I am very happy about the 

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:13.270
 know what you want to learn well 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:16.300
 here it is 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:19.300
 the pattern and now for those who want 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.800
 continue and do not know how to sew it and 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.050
 need more directions or more 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.330
 indications to cut them I'm going to 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.520
 put in some reference pictures like that 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.680
 good I hope you enjoy many 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:34.470
 kisses to all who want to stay 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.470
 to see me indications as we continue
