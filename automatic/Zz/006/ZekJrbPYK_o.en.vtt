this<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:06.870> going<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.290> allow<00:00:07.560> us

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.740 

so<00:00:22.369> that'll<00:00:22.730> be<00:00:22.820> a<00:00:22.850> very<00:00:22.880> simple<00:00:23.360> adjustment

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
so that'll be a very simple adjustment

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.420 
so that'll be a very simple adjustment
you<00:00:23.840> see<00:00:23.990> what's<00:00:24.140> what<00:00:24.619> we're<00:00:24.740> doing<00:00:25.010> now<00:00:25.130> and

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
you see what's what we're doing now and

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.830 
you see what's what we're doing now and
we'll<00:00:25.730> get<00:00:25.880> to<00:00:25.970> that<00:00:26.000> just<00:00:26.360> in<00:00:26.450> a<00:00:26.510> second<00:00:26.810> I

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
we'll get to that just in a second I

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.780 
we'll get to that just in a second I
wanted<00:00:27.080> to<00:00:27.140> show<00:00:27.320> you<00:00:27.380> something<00:00:27.830> here<00:00:28.010> which

pulled out on the watch ordinarily what
would<00:01:01.610> happen<00:01:02.030> is<00:01:02.239> that<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:03.010> everything<00:01:04.010> will

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
would happen is that the everything will

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.000 
would happen is that the everything will
move<00:01:04.430> in<00:01:04.699> okay<00:01:05.239> here's<00:01:05.479> your<00:01:05.540> ear<00:01:05.960> with<00:01:06.860> that

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
while the movement is out of the case so

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.890 
while the movement is out of the case so
that<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.800> watch<00:02:58.069> can<00:02:58.430> run<00:02:58.790> independent<00:02:59.750> of

the clutch and the winding mechanism now
I've<00:03:08.330> got<00:03:08.510> a<00:03:08.540> head
