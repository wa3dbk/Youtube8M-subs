relatively stable platform at mid-range

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.500 
relatively stable platform at mid-range

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
that has a predictable upwards recoil

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.509 
that has a predictable upwards recoil
pattern<00:00:25.140> even<00:00:25.590> completely<00:00:25.890> holding<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.400> the

let's<00:00:28.710> look<00:00:28.859> at<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.070> an<00:00:29.130> assault<00:00:29.340> rifle<00:00:29.460> from

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
let's look at it an assault rifle from

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.089 
let's look at it an assault rifle from
battlefield<00:00:30.330> hardline<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.410> m16a3

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
battlefield hardline this is the m16a3

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.880 
battlefield hardline this is the m16a3
yes<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.210> m16a3<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:34.110> back<00:00:34.320> but<00:00:34.770> it's

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
yes the m16a3 is back but it's

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.530 
yes the m16a3 is back but it's
definitely<00:00:35.040> not<00:00:35.250> your<00:00:35.489> same<00:00:35.670> old<00:00:35.850> m16<00:00:36.390> as

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
definitely not your same old m16 as

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.790 
definitely not your same old m16 as
you'll<00:00:36.660> see<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> hipfire<00:00:37.410> spread<00:00:37.440> is

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
you'll see that the hipfire spread is

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.799 
you'll see that the hipfire spread is
pretty<00:00:38.160> steep<00:00:38.430> already<00:00:38.879> now<00:00:39.239> when<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.450> am<00:00:39.629> down

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
pretty steep already now when I am down

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.360 
pretty steep already now when I am down
sights<00:00:40.110> at<00:00:40.290> close<00:00:40.469> range<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.890> spray<00:00:41.129> takes

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
sights at close range the spray takes

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.430 
sights at close range the spray takes
the<00:00:41.520> weapon<00:00:41.610> upwards<00:00:42.180> pretty<00:00:42.450> quickly<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.050> far

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the weapon upwards pretty quickly so far

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.959 
the weapon upwards pretty quickly so far
the<00:00:43.559> difference<00:00:43.860> isn't<00:00:44.040> quite<00:00:44.340> as<00:00:44.460> noticeable

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
the difference isn't quite as noticeable

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.729 
the difference isn't quite as noticeable
as<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> longer<00:00:45.750> ranges<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.469> let's<00:00:46.649> look

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
as it is a longer ranges so let's look

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.549 
as it is a longer ranges so let's look
at<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.920> m416<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.820> slightly<00:00:48.030> longer<00:00:48.360> range

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
at the m416 it is slightly longer range

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.600 
at the m416 it is slightly longer range
uncontrolled<00:00:49.559> weapon<00:00:49.920> slides<00:00:50.160> upwards

games<00:01:28.110> with<00:01:28.320> these<00:01:28.500> tests<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.340> let's<00:01:29.549> look<00:01:29.700> at

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
games with these tests so let's look at

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.160 
games with these tests so let's look at
one<00:01:30.060> other<00:01:30.210> weapon<00:01:30.600> from<00:01:30.720> battlefield

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
it was in battlefield 4 but you'll

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.920 
it was in battlefield 4 but you'll
definitely<00:02:12.120> take<00:02:12.300> notice<00:02:12.569> when<00:02:12.810> you're

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
definitely take notice when you're

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.460 
definitely take notice when you're
trying<00:02:13.170> to

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
trying to

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.200

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
to get away from visual recoil there's

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.040 
to get away from visual recoil there's
one<00:02:20.610> last<00:02:20.880> new<00:02:21.120> thing<00:02:21.390> for<00:02:21.570> recoil<00:02:21.870> in

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
one last new thing for recoil in

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.690 
one last new thing for recoil in
battlefield<00:02:22.500> hardline<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.430> when<00:02:23.610> you

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
battlefield hardline that is when you

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.760 
battlefield hardline that is when you
get<00:02:23.820> hit<00:02:24.090> your<00:02:24.270> soldier<00:02:24.720> visibly<00:02:25.140> reacts<00:02:25.560> to

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
get hit your soldier visibly reacts to

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.860 
get hit your soldier visibly reacts to
the<00:02:25.890> shot<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:26.670> more<00:02:27.180> than<00:02:27.330> anything<00:02:27.540> is

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
the shot this more than anything is

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.630 
the shot this more than anything is
going<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.170> play<00:02:28.320> havoc<00:02:28.680> on<00:02:28.800> your<00:02:29.010> aim<00:02:29.130> my

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
going to play havoc on your aim my

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.920 
going to play havoc on your aim my
recommendation<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.420> counter<00:02:30.780> this

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
recommendation to counter this

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.720 
recommendation to counter this
particular<00:02:31.470> bit<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.800> visual<00:02:32.130> recoil<00:02:32.310> would<00:02:32.610> be

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
particular bit of visual recoil would be

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.220 
particular bit of visual recoil would be
to<00:02:32.790> shoot<00:02:33.090> first<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.570> ask<00:02:33.660> questions<00:02:33.810> later

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
to shoot first and ask questions later

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.230 
to shoot first and ask questions later
when<00:02:34.590> you're<00:02:34.770> in<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:34.920> head-to-head<00:02:35.250> fight<00:02:35.670> so

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
when you're in a head-to-head fight so

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.940 
when you're in a head-to-head fight so
the<00:02:36.360> difficulty<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:36.990> successfully<00:02:37.590> landing

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
definitely gone significantly upwards

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.710

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
but there are some familiar techniques

that<00:02:42.960> you<00:02:43.080> can<00:02:43.260> use<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.620> get<00:02:43.740> better<00:02:43.950> shots

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
that you can use to get better shots

that you can use to get better shots
first<00:02:44.850> stop<00:02:45.300> moving<00:02:45.630> when<00:02:45.660> you're<00:02:45.900> aiming
