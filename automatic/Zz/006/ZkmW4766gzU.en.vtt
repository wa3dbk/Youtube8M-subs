00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
of about 190 200 euros I would expect

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.130 
of about 190 200 euros I would expect
the<00:02:28.700> price<00:02:28.909> in<00:02:29.120> India<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.480> be<00:02:29.599> closer<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.959> about

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
the price in India to be closer to about

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.530 
the price in India to be closer to about
twelve<00:02:30.439> thousand<00:02:30.769> rupees<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:32.090> this<00:02:32.239> device

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
twelve thousand rupees so this device

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.770 
twelve thousand rupees so this device
clearly<00:02:33.260> marks<00:02:33.739> an<00:02:34.280> entry<00:02:34.640> point<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.629> my

clearly marks an entry point and to my

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.930 
clearly marks an entry point and to my
mind<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.470> is<00:02:36.829> a<00:02:37.430> more<00:02:37.790> value<00:02:38.920> value-added

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
mind it is a more value value-added

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.089 
mind it is a more value value-added

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
low-cost Android device it feels way

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.569 
low-cost Android device it feels way
more<00:02:45.530> premium<00:02:46.220> of<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:47.450> whitest<00:02:47.959> glossy<00:02:48.620> then

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
more premium of the whitest glossy then

this there's no real performance lag so
