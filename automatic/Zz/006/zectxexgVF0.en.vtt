00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.020
 hi guys I hope you are very well in 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.940
 previous videos I shared one of 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.130
 my favorite home remedies for 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.840
 moisturize my hair with mayonnaise 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.180
 if you did not see it here I leave the link 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.790
 to be seen as it is super 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.100
 interesting because mayonnaise has 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.720
 many properties that help 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.300
 moisturize your hair today I'm going to 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.180
 share another one of my homemade tips that 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.400
 is an avocado-based mask and 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.920
 of olive oil but before I want them 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.080
 tell what are the properties that 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.699
 have these two ingredients the 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.220
 avocado has nutritional properties 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.110
 due to its high content of vitamins 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.629
 minerals and water 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.090
 therefore it serves as a moisturizer as well 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:54.000
 as it also has vitamins a b6 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.400
 and he has a high antioxidant power and 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.980
 repairman and olive oil is the 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.380
 solution for those open ends and 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.410
 horrible things that we do for lack of 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.790
 hydration in our hair because 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.010
 well, it is bad, they need 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.229
 cut then the olive oil is going 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.910
 to help a lot with those meetings and 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.760
 which also helps the hydration of 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.010
 hair and has vitamin and as well as 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.660
 it also gives shine and nourishes the hair 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.130
 so if we put these two together 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.080
 ingredients make the mask 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.420
 perfect to have the hair that 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.910
 we always dream super hydrated with 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.710
 very bright and beautiful but as they 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.899
 I commented in the previous video 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.270
 they have to be constant they can do it 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.860
 as a minimum once a week if 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.720
 can do it more times would be 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.000
 perfect because that's how the results 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.800
 they would see faster so get organized and 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.380
 Give your hair time to 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.690
 repair it to give it shine consent 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.280
 a little bit because we are also a little 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.830
 porridge at the time of passing him that if the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.289
 iron the dryer that if you already 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.930
 untangled super strong and we hurt him 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.310
 then give the hair time so 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.680
 well let's see 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.439
 The ingredients to use are a 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.509
 avocado and olive oil I use 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.070
 this little bit of avocado but remember 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.840
 that everything depends on the amount of 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.789
 hair they have if they believe that 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.130
 they need more because they grab a little bit 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.050
 more than avocado and ready the idea is that 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.709
 the mask reach for all your 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.630
 hair I use this brand of oil 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.510
 but that does not matter you can 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.099
 use the one they have in their house and 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.380
 also if you want you can use a 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.290
 plastic container and a brush for 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.420
 apply the mask and now what 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.370
 they have to do is grind the avocado me 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.049
 I put it in this container too but 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.090
 As I tell you, it's not like 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.040
 necessary to do it the same or in the same 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.380
 containers that I do where you 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.000
 and it is perfect as you see the point is 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.030
 that are going to grind the avocado until 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.130
 they have a little pasty and then they will 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.769
 add a splash of olive oil 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.360
 as for quantity the truth is only 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.880
 a trickle is not going to make a 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.470
 avocado soup can heat a 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.480
 little bit of olive oil before 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.280
 apply it to the mix I'm not going to 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.920
 warm up because in the end I'm going to give it a 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.880
 little bit of heat with the dryer and it's 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.740
 as well as 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.240
 we have our mask for 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.160
 apply it we should have the hair 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.530
 wet preferably and we're going to 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.140
 apply also means to reach 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.910
 the tips I will mark a line in 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.980
 half dividing my hair in two 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.340
 equal parts and remember that they should 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.750
 untangle the super good and now if a 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.300
 Once we are ready we start 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.310
 apply the mixture for this mask 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.200
 I do not use paper pieces 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.150
 aluminum because as it is not so stinky 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.950
 like mayonnaise, I do not care if 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.930
 my hands were seized that's why I 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.850
 I say that the brush was not so necessary 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.260
 nor the recipient because what 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.330
 they can do with their hands without any 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.000
 problem the idea is that you apply it for 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.250
 all the hair and as I tell them to avoid 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.560
 apply in the growth only of means 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.600
 to tips and once you finish 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.070
 apply all the mixture pull my hair 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.790
 backwards as if to make a 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:56.490
 tail stretching all the hair for the 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.460
 final make me a changuito and that 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.590
 little monkey I held it with two tweezers and 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.300
 to finish apply hot air with 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.610
 the dryer leaves the mask in your 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.100
 hair from 20 to 30 minutes but if 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.420
 you hold more obviously is better eye 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.280
 you do not have to be 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.470
 hot air for 30 minutes is 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.270
 only what you hold and once you 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.540
 the minutes have elapsed lava 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.340
 super good I use this shampoo 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.079
 l'orÃ©al which is sulfate-free and is 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.139
 I recommend a lot so that my hair does not 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.639
 lose hydration 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.830
 and that's all they have to do 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.900
 so it's not super easy to give 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.090
 a few minutes to your hair to give you more 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.219
 shine to hydrate and have it beautiful 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.259
 I really recommend them very much 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:38.499
 but as I told you before, be 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.400
 constant to see the results 

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:43.009
 I hope you liked this video 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:47.379
 see you in the next one remember 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.379
