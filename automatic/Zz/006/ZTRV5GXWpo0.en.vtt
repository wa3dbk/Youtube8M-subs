diagnose that right now so whenever I

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.060 
diagnose that right now so whenever I
shift<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.190> from<00:00:14.219> park<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.719> reverse<00:00:18.710> or<00:00:19.710> from

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
shift it from park to reverse or from

shift it from park to reverse or from
reverse<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.910> drive<00:00:22.939> you<00:00:23.939> can<00:00:24.090> see<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.600> hear

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
reverse to drive you can see and hear

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.839 
reverse to drive you can see and hear
the<00:00:25.740> engine<00:00:26.130> moving<00:00:26.580> that's<00:00:27.570> neutral<00:00:28.849> reverse

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
the engine moving that's neutral reverse

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.669 
the engine moving that's neutral reverse
that's<00:00:30.240> not<00:00:30.390> bad<00:00:30.570> but<00:00:30.869> for<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.080> reverse<00:00:31.410> to

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
that's not bad but for the reverse to

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.650 
that's not bad but for the reverse to
drive<00:00:33.380> you<00:00:34.380> get<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.680> really<00:00:35.010> bad<00:00:35.660> engine

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
drive you get that really bad engine

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.479 
drive you get that really bad engine
vibration<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.800> because<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.219> engine

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
vibration and that is because the engine

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.150 
vibration and that is because the engine
mounts<00:00:38.700> are<00:00:38.790> bad<00:00:39.530> and<00:00:40.530> over<00:00:40.770> time<00:00:40.950> that's

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
mounts are bad and over time that's

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.770 
mounts are bad and over time that's
gonna<00:00:41.250> wear<00:00:41.489> our<00:00:41.610> engine<00:00:41.940> parts<00:00:42.270> it's<00:00:42.660> gonna

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
gonna wear our engine parts it's gonna

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.090 
gonna wear our engine parts it's gonna
cause<00:00:43.020> damage<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.590> engine<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.040> that's

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
cause damage to the engine and that's

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.220 
cause damage to the engine and that's
just<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.430> bad<00:00:44.610> situation<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.450> obviously<00:00:45.870> you

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
just a bad situation and obviously you

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.720 
just a bad situation and obviously you
saw<00:00:46.379> how<00:00:46.530> much<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.800> engine<00:00:47.129> shook<00:00:47.399> that

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
saw how much that engine shook that

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.799 
saw how much that engine shook that
that's<00:00:48.180> horrible

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
that's horrible

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.209 
that's horrible
so<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.110> already<00:00:49.260> went<00:00:49.620> over<00:00:49.680> one<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
so we already went over one of the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.069 
so we already went over one of the
symptoms<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.879> that's<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.270> engine<00:00:51.600> shaking<00:00:52.020> a

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
symptoms and that's the engine shaking a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.869 
symptoms and that's the engine shaking a
lot<00:00:52.260> or<00:00:52.440> clunking<00:00:52.890> especially<00:00:53.340> when<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.640> in

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879

wanna<00:01:10.680> hit<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.950> snow<00:01:11.159> but<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:12.000> get<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> idea

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
wanna hit the snow but you get the idea

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.780

it's steers to the left when I give a

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.630 
it's steers to the left when I give a
guess<00:01:15.030> look<00:01:15.450> at<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.250> that's<00:01:17.250> because

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
guess look at that and that's because

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.789 
guess look at that and that's because
the<00:01:18.119> engine<00:01:18.810> mount<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.439> transmission

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
right here and then the third is on the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.889 
right here and then the third is on the
driver's<00:01:56.100> side<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:57.030> can<00:01:57.210> see<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.479> right<00:01:57.600> there

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
driver's side you can see it right there

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.840 
driver's side you can see it right there
there's<00:01:58.530> actually<00:01:58.860> two<00:01:59.070> transmission<00:01:59.670> mounts

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
there's actually two transmission mounts

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.219 
there's actually two transmission mounts
on<00:01:59.969> one<00:02:00.119> engine<00:02:00.420> mount<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.840> kind<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.079> use

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
on one engine mount but I kind of use

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.630 
on one engine mount but I kind of use
transmission<00:02:01.799> mount<00:02:01.979> or<00:02:02.189> engine<00:02:02.490> mount

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
transmission mount or engine mount

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.130 
transmission mount or engine mount
interchangeably<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.390> get<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.630> idea

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
interchangeably you get the idea

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.410

so<00:02:04.920> here's<00:02:05.219> my<00:02:05.369> third<00:02:05.610> engine<00:02:06.060> mount<00:02:06.210> this

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
so here's my third engine mount this

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.240 
so here's my third engine mount this
engine<00:02:06.780> mount<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.439> worst<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.039> I'll<00:02:08.099> give

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
engine mount is the worst so I'll give

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.859 
engine mount is the worst so I'll give
you<00:02:08.340> an<00:02:08.399> idea<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.700> what<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> bad<00:02:09.420> engine<00:02:09.599> mount

shock of changing gears and accelerating

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.160 
shock of changing gears and accelerating
so<00:03:08.100> that<00:03:08.370> not<00:03:08.730> all<00:03:08.940> that<00:03:09.120> torque<00:03:09.450> goes<00:03:09.690> right

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
so that not all that torque goes right

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.170 
so that not all that torque goes right
into<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.680> suspension<00:03:11.250> right<00:03:11.580> into<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:11.970> tires

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
vibration from going into the steering

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.720 
vibration from going into the steering
wheel<00:03:15.990> and<00:03:16.200> also<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.740> car<00:03:16.950> itself<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:17.520> it's<00:03:17.640> a
