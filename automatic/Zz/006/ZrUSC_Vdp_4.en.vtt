00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 but without consequences of nico rosberg 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.020
 an excellent and with no disability 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.710
 We see who was at fault Nico low 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.710
 it goes walking 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.500
 quiet fortunately we see it 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.680
 absolutely fine to nico rosberg 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.259
 enough the self defense worked 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.599
 how it had to work but you 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.360
 it was the locked part of the third sector 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.740
 of this circuit of zone 20 before 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.400
 already in this course not also the zone of 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.410
 paint is explained on the long track 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.180
 list that is going to go fortunately 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.570
 walking without problems for the pilot 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.820
 from india 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.610
 the bag the disaster was left like this 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.860
 tire detached thing that always 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:47.200
 it's a risk it's a potential missile 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.200
 physically it seems that there are no costs 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.059
 it's faster and if we've put a 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.770
 brake before 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.590
 schumacher convert making a 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:07.940
 career and so there was an incident 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:11.990
 between the two good for the photo to the 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.530
 amount without problems in the car 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.530
 as well 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.789
 and it flew through the air almost taking off and the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.369
 glass up many of these rocks and 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:26.520
 not very close to a boy similar to 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.340
 who of ramÃ³n alonso of the great test 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.280
 to verify very dangerous is very 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.380
 dangerous the passage of the Mercedes on the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.119
 helmet of narain kartikeyan and hard the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.060
 fortunately hit the barriers of 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.570
 protection and will safeguard and impact 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.890
 of not knowing but that very 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.080
 it seems to me that at the time of faith 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.000
 reference to rosberg I do not know if by 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.300
 oil that had left the car 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.090
 nothing inter about maneuvers extremely 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.930
 complicated extremely dangerous in this 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.930
 grand prize 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:08.179
 the first of the men who is 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:10.910
 running freely after the 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.190
 first round they come walking like 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:19.420
 we can see here both the nico rosberg 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:26.950
 as narain kartikeyan step has said 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.950
 that from the car expressed 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.069
 performance at that time completely 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.200
 in front 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.909
 is going to compensate for one of those possible 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.870
 characteristics yet because of not one 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.870
 explicit way 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.459
 really is a very performance actor 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.220
 strong that is in Spain schaller macro 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.470
 come out of the pits the safety car is of the 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.670
 Lords track is also winning the 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.120
 race of the rai with the second 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.360
 battered third quarter and fifth of 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.580
 your concepts seventh floor 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.360
 kobayashi ninth I got married schumacher in 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.850
 the tenth place but what about some 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.560
 another turn seems to go away because it 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.090
 had really been in bad 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.050
 conditions at the scene of the incident 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.050
 between 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.099
 pitts now 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.230
 I am explaining part of the rods 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.550
 agitated in the incident sector 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.550
 for the entire campus
