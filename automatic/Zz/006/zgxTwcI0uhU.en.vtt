00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
signature one now the one that I use is

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.520 
signature one now the one that I use is
this<00:02:25.709> one<00:02:25.770> here<00:02:26.160> which<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.520> basically<00:02:26.790> a

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
this one here which is basically a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.260 
this one here which is basically a
training<00:02:28.530> gear<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.280> augmented<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.090> for

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
training gear that I augmented it for

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.990 
training gear that I augmented it for
three<00:02:30.510> stars<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.860> gives<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.400> Heat<00:02:32.700> team

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
three stars and that gives a Heat team

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.350 
three stars and that gives a Heat team
heal<00:02:33.330> on<00:02:33.540> signature<00:02:34.310> 115<00:02:35.310> %<00:02:35.819> I<00:02:35.970> don't<00:02:36.120> know<00:02:36.209> why

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
heal on signature 115 % I don't know why

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.059 
heal on signature 115 % I don't know why
it<00:02:36.420> doesn't<00:02:36.690> list<00:02:36.989> it<00:02:37.110> there<00:02:37.319> but<00:02:37.470> this<00:02:37.709> is<00:02:37.920> the

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
it doesn't list it there but this is the

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.960 
it doesn't list it there but this is the
one<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.489> want<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.850> get<00:02:39.120> up<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:40.459> five<00:02:41.459> star

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
one that I want to get up to five star

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.600 
one that I want to get up to five star
because<00:02:42.569> that<00:02:42.900> is<00:02:43.260> gonna<00:02:43.500> be<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.980> bomb<00:02:44.160> card

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
because that is gonna be the bomb card

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.370 
because that is gonna be the bomb card
right<00:02:44.970> there<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.840> don't<00:02:45.900> know<00:02:46.050> why<00:02:46.200> it's

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
right there and I don't know why it's

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.590 
right there and I don't know why it's
not<00:02:46.530> listing<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.489> team<00:02:47.819> heal<00:02:48.060> percentage

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
not listing the the team heal percentage

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.449 
not listing the the team heal percentage
but<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:48.780> think<00:02:48.989> this<00:02:49.080> one's<00:02:49.290> like<00:02:49.440> 30%<00:02:49.890> when

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
but I think this one's like 30% when

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.240 
but I think this one's like 30% when
it's<00:02:50.580> all<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.730> way<00:02:50.819> maxed<00:02:51.390> out<00:02:51.680> anyhow<00:02:52.680> so

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
it's all the way maxed out anyhow so

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.710 
it's all the way maxed out anyhow so
those<00:02:53.459> are<00:02:53.640> one<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.850> those<00:02:53.940> three<00:02:54.209> cards<00:02:54.630> I

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
those are one of those three cards I

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.000 
those are one of those three cards I
think<00:02:54.900> you're<00:02:55.019> gonna<00:02:55.110> want<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.470> have<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.860> play

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
think you're gonna want to have to play

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.520 
think you're gonna want to have to play

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
easiest one to get doesn't cost a lot to

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.940
