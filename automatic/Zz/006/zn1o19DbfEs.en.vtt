00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
there with the low level character

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.400 
there with the low level character
you're<00:03:21.519> gonna<00:03:21.609> die<00:03:21.849> in<00:03:21.910> about<00:03:22.150> two<00:03:22.389> hits<00:03:22.660> don't

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410

believe<00:03:23.650> me<00:03:23.859> try<00:03:24.310> it<00:03:24.430> out<00:03:27.030> visually<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.150> game

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
believe me try it out visually the game

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:29.879 
believe me try it out visually the game
looks<00:03:28.659> just<00:03:28.900> like<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.169> last<00:03:29.319> one<00:03:29.530> there's<00:03:29.769> not

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
looks just like the last one there's not

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.500 
looks just like the last one there's not
much<00:03:30.129> improvement<00:03:30.250> there<00:03:30.790> but<00:03:31.299> if<00:03:31.419> you<00:03:31.480> think

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
much improvement there but if you think

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.180 
much improvement there but if you think
about<00:03:31.720> how<00:03:31.959> much<00:03:32.109> is<00:03:32.260> going<00:03:32.500> on<00:03:32.620> on<00:03:32.769> screen

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
about how much is going on on screen

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.500 
about how much is going on on screen
it's<00:03:33.459> kind<00:03:33.639> of<00:03:33.730> hard<00:03:33.909> to<00:03:33.940> fault<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.299> game

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
it's kind of hard to fault the game

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.839 
it's kind of hard to fault the game
there<00:03:35.199> are<00:03:35.349> still<00:03:35.560> plenty<00:03:35.739> of<00:03:35.859> popups<00:03:36.400> enemies

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
there are still plenty of popups enemies

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.670 
there are still plenty of popups enemies
going<00:03:37.120> through<00:03:37.269> walls<00:03:37.510> but<00:03:38.079> it's<00:03:38.230> not<00:03:38.379> as<00:03:38.530> bad

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
going through walls but it's not as bad

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.240 
going through walls but it's not as bad
as<00:03:38.739> preview<00:03:39.220> instalments<00:03:39.970> but<00:03:40.389> still<00:03:40.690> their

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
as preview instalments but still their

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.589 
as preview instalments but still their
sound<00:03:42.250> is<00:03:42.430> awesome<00:03:42.819> if<00:03:42.909> you<00:03:42.940> like<00:03:43.150> heavy<00:03:43.389> metal
