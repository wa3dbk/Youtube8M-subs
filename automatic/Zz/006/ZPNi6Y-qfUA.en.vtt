00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.670
 congratulations from general manager 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.710

 the 20-year-old midfielder of the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.250
 promises of fc groningen falls in the 90th 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.660
 nero 7 in fort 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.840
 thus his official debut for FC 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.850
 groningen if you got nervous ring ring 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.519
 no not really before the game 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.740
 I wouldn't play players either but 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.539
 when I then think so as I am reasonable 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.309
 relax on the Friday we were 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.200
 Visiting Ben with FC Groningen 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.760
 moussa together with roommate timo 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.960
 letschert he buys a chicken tandoori 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.430
 meal 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.410
 then he spoke about the following words 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.360
 the possible the neighborhood against az 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.570
 I am not assuming that I will arrive on Saturday 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.980
 stuff but hoping is always allowed 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.539
 and that hope comes true though 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.370
 Saturday evening the question is 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.960
 or ben moussa is going to fall 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.699
 six minutes before time the are ready 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.960
 to get in the team with then get 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.120
 I am tired of being told he is 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.289
 track suit pin on 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.989
 i would actually penetrate down for that 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.730
 come that that which was bothered by taste 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.250
 finally said the same title 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.200
 so I had to keep going 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.460
 walk but six minutes later makes up 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.439
 moussa still makes his debut for fc 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.820
 groningen he comes for one for him 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.470
 play strange position 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.880
 in the front right there I am normal 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.060
 spoken midfielder 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.159
 mostly 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.060
 at six or eight he came the now day track 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.650
 in 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.330
 but it was clear that we just have one 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.030
 to cross the line 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.979
 so that only had to be with moessa 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.000
 came in 2008 from Utrecht 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.770
 elinkwijk 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.479
 has been part of the 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.070
 promises from fc groningen 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.840
 last season became basic player in the 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.130
 team of trainer Dick Lukkien 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.050
 and he has this good development 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.190
 season continued with his debut in the 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.350
 first team 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.720
 promised complice is actually for young 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.080
 players but which also after much much 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.220
 players to play therefore adhere to 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.979
 the level of course is not really possible yet 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.190
 say a lot about it but good until now 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.410
 to 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.270
 we often train together so that is 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.770
 an advantage so it feels good 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.840
 actually I was moussa 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.860
 an extra beautiful evening because Saturday 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.780
 debut was celebrated with a 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.590
 hard fought but nice win 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.360
 az 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.940
 Of course important that we come here 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.489
 would win the wall full 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.179
 get the good results and yes that is 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.940
 well done 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.100
 three points az arrested was still in 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.239
 do good to profit too low 3 times 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.769
 won follow me 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.120
 won once or twice and we have 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.549
 then leave points a few times 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.920
 where no taste 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.660
 so nice here is the winter 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.040
 Ben Moussa's cooking skills pay for themselves 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.870
 so soon out 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.920

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.750

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.410
 the national team against Iran 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:39.780
 plays with the food so it is good 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.310
 sometimes wonder what I ate you today 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.850
 started today with the whole team 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.420
 on the way 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.060
 in total and 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.290

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:55.520

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.450
 competition shirt by fc groningen 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.700

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.830

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.610
