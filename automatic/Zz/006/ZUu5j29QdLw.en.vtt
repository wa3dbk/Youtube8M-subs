today<00:00:02.939> I<00:00:03.000> will<00:00:03.330> show<00:00:03.570> you<00:00:03.629> how<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:03.959> make<00:00:04.290> these

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
today I will show you how to make these

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:23.650 
today I will show you how to make these
automatic<00:00:05.609> some<00:00:05.850> lines

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.660 

first<00:00:24.660> thing<00:00:25.020> you<00:00:25.260> have<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.440> do<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:26.040> buy<00:00:26.640> some

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
first thing you have to do is buy some

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.890 
first thing you have to do is buy some
servo<00:00:27.390> motors<00:00:28.580> or<00:00:29.580> at<00:00:29.850> least<00:00:30.090> one<00:00:30.330> servo<00:00:30.720> motor

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
servo motors or at least one servo motor

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.450 
servo motors or at least one servo motor
and<00:00:31.290> I<00:00:33.620> buy<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.790> cheapest<00:00:35.790> servo<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.930> found<00:00:37.830> on

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
and I buy this cheapest servo I found on

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.430 
and I buy this cheapest servo I found on
the<00:00:39.000> internet<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:41.180> it<00:00:42.180> seems<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.780> be<00:00:42.989> enough

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the internet and it seems to be enough

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.680 
the internet and it seems to be enough
it<00:00:43.739> has<00:00:44.100> torque<00:00:45.000> about<00:00:45.600> two<00:00:46.260> kilograms<00:00:46.949> per

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
it has torque about two kilograms per

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:56.510 
it has torque about two kilograms per
centimeter<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.879> maybe<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:52.280> bit<00:00:53.280> more<00:00:55.520> is

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
centimeter and maybe a bit more is

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.990 
centimeter and maybe a bit more is
better<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:58.370> it's<00:00:59.370> still<00:00:59.700> okay<00:01:01.489> next<00:01:02.489> step<00:01:02.730> is

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
better but it's still okay next step is

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.410 
better but it's still okay next step is
to<00:01:03.270> mount<00:01:03.510> servo<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.649> window<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.420> found

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
to mount servo on the window I found

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.350 
to mount servo on the window I found
that<00:01:07.250> these<00:01:09.140> ball<00:01:10.140> chains<00:01:10.680> are<00:01:11.190> very<00:01:12.060> good

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
that these ball chains are very good

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.580 
that these ball chains are very good
because<00:01:14.030> on<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.240> window<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:16.050> have<00:01:16.290> such<00:01:17.300> mount

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
because on the window we have such mount

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.859 
because on the window we have such mount
and<00:01:21.289> when<00:01:22.289> you<00:01:22.470> remove<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.270> there<00:01:24.270> are<00:01:24.420> screws

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
and when you remove it there are screws

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.230 
and when you remove it there are screws
and<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.570> unscrew<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.780> screws<00:01:28.290> and

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
and you can unscrew the screws and

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.960 
and you can unscrew the screws and
replace<00:01:30.590> this<00:01:31.640> thing<00:01:32.640> with<00:01:33.380> anything<00:01:34.380> else

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
replace this thing with anything else

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.109 
replace this thing with anything else
like<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.360> some<00:01:36.689> several<00:01:37.200> holder<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.830> my<00:01:37.860> case

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.870 

next<00:01:42.119> step<00:01:42.510> is<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.140> take<00:01:43.770> some<00:01:44.130> plastic<00:01:44.369> box

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
next step is to take some plastic box

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.920 
next step is to take some plastic box
and<00:01:45.150> mount<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.110> servo<00:01:46.380> into<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.010> and<00:01:47.930> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
and mount the servo into it and the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
and mount the servo into it and the
other<00:01:49.140> part<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.860> box<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.380> mount

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
other part of the box you have to mount

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.179 
other part of the box you have to mount
instead<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.540> chain<00:01:55.020> holder<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
instead of the chain holder to the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:04.749 
instead of the chain holder to the
window<00:01:56.750> then<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.890> simply<00:01:59.299> close<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.600> box<00:02:00.869> and

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.509 

you<00:02:05.759> take<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.329> chain<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:09.860> connect<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.130> to<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
you take the chain and connect it to the

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:17.479 
you take the chain and connect it to the
servo<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:14.570> I've<00:02:15.570> used<00:02:15.870> just<00:02:16.620> little<00:02:17.310> pieces

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
servo and I've used just little pieces

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.780 
servo and I've used just little pieces
of<00:02:17.910> wire<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:20.450> wire<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.720> together<00:02:22.610> with<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
of wire to wire it together with the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.880 
of wire to wire it together with the
servo<00:02:25.070> you<00:02:26.070> should<00:02:26.310> also

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.809 

screw<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:31.020> screw<00:02:31.380> into<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.920> servo<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.640> make

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
screw the screw into the servo to make

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.410 
screw the screw into the servo to make
this<00:02:33.050> shaft<00:02:34.050> hold<00:02:35.090> tight

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
this shaft hold tight

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.030 
this shaft hold tight
but<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:38.340> seems<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.850> work<00:02:38.880> without<00:02:39.270> it<00:02:39.680> in<00:02:40.680> test

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
but it seems to work without it in test

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.500 
but it seems to work without it in test
for<00:02:41.430> testing<00:02:41.580> purposes<00:02:43.790> just<00:02:44.790> make<00:02:45.000> sure<00:02:45.209> that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
for testing purposes just make sure that

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.830 
for testing purposes just make sure that
the<00:02:45.720> chain<00:02:46.020> has<00:02:46.500> proper<00:02:47.040> tension<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:47.790> it's<00:02:48.450> in

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
the chain has proper tension and it's in

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.260 
the chain has proper tension and it's in
position<00:02:49.020> which<00:02:50.010> makes<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.670> possible<00:02:51.360> to

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
position which makes it possible to

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.330 
position which makes it possible to
adduce<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.690> son<00:02:54.900> blind<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.130> way<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.340> wish

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
adduce the son blind in the way you wish

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.130 
adduce the son blind in the way you wish
once<00:02:59.340> you<00:02:59.550> have<00:02:59.730> everything<00:03:00.950> made<00:03:01.950> together

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
once you have everything made together

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.949 
once you have everything made together
all<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.410> need<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.280> take<00:03:06.030> some<00:03:06.300> electronics

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
all you need is to take some electronics

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.800 
all you need is to take some electronics
i<00:03:07.340> arduino<00:03:08.340> but<00:03:08.550> you<00:03:08.760> can<00:03:09.000> basically<00:03:09.300> use

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
i arduino but you can basically use

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
to control your son lines I am using

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.300 
to control your son lines I am using
some<00:03:23.340> sweet<00:03:24.030> example<00:03:24.810> from<00:03:26.570> Arduino<00:03:27.570> library

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
some sweet example from Arduino library

but you can program the Arduino or

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.300 
but you can program the Arduino or
animaker<00:03:33.780> controller<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.769> make<00:03:37.310> practically

and<00:03:38.549> I<00:03:38.640> think<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:39.030> want<00:03:39.269> for<00:03:40.260> example<00:03:40.290> I<00:03:41.100> plan

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
and I think you want for example I plan

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.150 
and I think you want for example I plan
to<00:03:42.140> control<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.290> servo<00:03:43.880> by<00:03:44.880> comparing<00:03:46.160> light

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
to control the servo by comparing light

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.319 
to control the servo by comparing light
inside<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.510> outside<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:49.880> when<00:03:50.880> there<00:03:51.120> will

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
inside and outside and when there will

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.560 
inside and outside and when there will
be<00:03:51.360> much<00:03:51.720> light<00:03:52.019> outside<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:53.130> Sun<00:03:53.940> blinds<00:03:54.329> are

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
be much light outside the Sun blinds are

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.160 
be much light outside the Sun blinds are
open<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.370> once<00:03:56.370> there<00:03:57.030> will<00:03:57.239> be<00:03:57.269> more<00:03:57.690> light

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
open and once there will be more light
