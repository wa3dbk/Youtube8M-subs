of house yes yeah that's that's too big
yeah<00:03:35.170> I<00:03:35.200> think<00:03:35.500> that<00:03:35.590> would<00:03:35.709> be<00:03:35.739> today<00:03:36.099> yeah<00:03:36.400> um

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
yeah I think that would be today yeah um

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.080 
yeah I think that would be today yeah um
I<00:03:37.690> don't<00:03:38.200> know<00:03:38.349> because<00:03:39.010> I<00:03:39.040> think<00:03:39.340> that<00:03:39.609> Apple

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
I don't know because I think that Apple

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.580 
I don't know because I think that Apple
you<00:03:40.180> should<00:03:40.359> have<00:03:40.510> been<00:03:40.690> used<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:41.019> something

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
you should have been used to something

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.920 
you should have been used to something
the<00:03:41.709> size<00:03:41.920> before<00:03:42.430> so<00:03:43.239> I<00:03:43.269> think<00:03:43.629> that<00:03:43.780> would<00:03:43.900> be

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
the size before so I think that would be

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.289 
the size before so I think that would be
an<00:03:44.200> a<00:03:44.410> deterrent<00:03:44.890> but<00:03:45.099> I'm<00:03:45.579> always<00:03:45.879> been<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.120> big

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
an a deterrent but I'm always been a big

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.940 
an a deterrent but I'm always been a big
fan<00:03:46.329> of<00:03:46.569> big<00:03:46.690> phones<00:03:46.930> as<00:03:47.260> you<00:03:47.530> can<00:03:47.680> tell<00:03:47.859> from

fan of big phones as you can tell from

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.280 
fan of big phones as you can tell from
my<00:03:48.040> note<00:03:48.310> so<00:03:48.640> I<00:03:48.910> would<00:03:49.480> not<00:03:49.660> be<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.870> good<00:03:50.049> thing<00:03:50.260> I

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
my note so I would not be a good thing I

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.080 
my note so I would not be a good thing I
would<00:03:50.709> I<00:03:50.890> would<00:03:51.069> like<00:03:51.220> this<00:03:51.459> yeah<00:03:51.790> I<00:03:51.819> think

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
would I would like this yeah I think

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.410 
would I would like this yeah I think
it's<00:03:52.450> perfect<00:03:52.629> size<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.500> bigger<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.920> better

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
it's perfect size the bigger the better

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.390 
it's perfect size the bigger the better
so<00:03:55.420> if<00:03:55.810> I<00:03:55.959> had<00:03:56.200> a<00:03:56.230> choice<00:03:56.530> between<00:03:56.829> the<00:03:57.040> two<00:03:57.069> I

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
so if I had a choice between the two I

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.750 
so if I had a choice between the two I
would<00:03:57.609> choose<00:03:57.819> the<00:03:58.359> iPhone<00:03:58.720> for<00:03:59.290> sure<00:03:59.519> I<00:04:00.519> want
