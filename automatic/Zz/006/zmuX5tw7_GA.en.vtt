00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.080
 hello what about friends cor tour 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:08.570
 Welcome to this video, we are not going to 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.429
 learn to play the scale of re in the 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.379
 accordion of sun as all the scales 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.480
 here on youtube we are only going to see the 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.970
 single scale and all the others 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.160
 scales from the third to the sixth 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.050
 chords and their investments are going to 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.170
 find on the icos accordionist page 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.970
 dotcom so no more for the moment 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.790
 start we start with the explanation of 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.770
 the scale of simple networks the scale 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.320
 of re obviously have to start and 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.630
 finish with the network note in all 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.700
 notes that the scale of is re mi fa 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.620
 sustained sun the yes do sharp and 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.570
 we come to re again if you get to 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.630
 analyze you will realize that the scale 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.970
 de re is very similar to the sun scale 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.940
 they only differ in a sharp that 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.649
 is the sharp one then only 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.870
 there is a note that is different between 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.630
 these two scales and the other difference 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.640
 is that each one starts in the name of 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.829
 its scale if one starts in sun is the 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.570
 scale of the sun and the other starts in king and 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.770
 well knowing this part 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.109
 theoretical scale 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.479
 if we proceed to play it in the chords 

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:14.810
 more let's start on the note of rei 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:18.140
 obviously 23 the curse 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.369
 we passed in front of me with 22 fa 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.369
 sustained of 24 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:35.390
 we go down to 14 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.190
 so a key here is that everything 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.960
 that we play in the first row will be 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.740
 touched with finger four the ring finger 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.740
 let's go up 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.970
 the opposite yes 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.970
 and now we are going to go up here until 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.300
 2 held with finger 2 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.090
 out and we end up down in the 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:05.340
 network note with 24 we are going to make a 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.340
 recap from above king has me 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.340
 sustained 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.970
 and yes 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.720
 sustained and we finished 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.720
 back 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.960
 yes 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.480
 the 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.490
 here we have this with finger 4 again 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.490
 sun has sustained 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:40.599
 I completed the scale here King 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.299
 in simple they learn from the names of 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.250
 each one and we will continue to continue 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.319
