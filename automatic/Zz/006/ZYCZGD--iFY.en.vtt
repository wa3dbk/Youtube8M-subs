the intake valves man what a difference

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.060 
the intake valves man what a difference
made<00:00:18.230> this<00:00:19.230> car<00:00:19.609> drives<00:00:23.269> tremendously<00:00:24.269> better

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
made this car drives tremendously better

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.910 
made this car drives tremendously better
much<00:00:26.070> more<00:00:26.279> responsive<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.119> engine<00:00:27.920> runs

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
much more responsive the engine runs

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.299 
much more responsive the engine runs
smoother<00:00:30.199> and<00:00:32.360> what<00:00:33.360> I'm<00:00:33.480> doing<00:00:33.750> now<00:00:34.160> since<00:00:35.160> I

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
smoother and what I'm doing now since I

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.190 
smoother and what I'm doing now since I
cleaned<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.180> intake<00:00:36.450> valves<00:00:36.840> already<00:00:39.200> I'm

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
cleaned the intake valves already I'm

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.900 
cleaned the intake valves already I'm
using<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.739> stuff<00:00:40.980> some<00:00:41.250> some<00:00:41.610> people<00:00:41.700> are

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
using this stuff some some people are

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.139 
using this stuff some some people are
skeptical<00:00:42.829> but<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.190> already<00:00:44.940> poured<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:46.110> third

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
skeptical but I already poured a third

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.020 
skeptical but I already poured a third
third<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.110> engine<00:00:49.559> itself<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.340> third

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
third of it in the engine itself a third

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.930 
third of it in the engine itself a third
in<00:00:52.760> in<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.750> tank<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:56.640> now<00:00:57.059> I'm<00:00:57.390> just

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
in in the in the tank so now I'm just

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.170 
in in the in the tank so now I'm just
going<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.149> connect<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.760> suction<00:01:02.760> right

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
going to connect it to the suction right

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.250 
going to connect it to the suction right
here<00:01:03.780> into<00:01:04.559> this

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.280 

so<00:01:09.800> these<00:01:10.670> three<00:01:11.090> they<00:01:11.300> connect<00:01:11.660> together<00:01:12.020> but

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
so these three they connect together but

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.920 
so these three they connect together but
I<00:01:12.320> just<00:01:12.440> disconnected<00:01:13.250> this<00:01:13.400> one<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:14.450> those

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
I just disconnected this one and those

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.970 
I just disconnected this one and those
into<00:01:15.320> intake<00:01:15.680> manifold<00:01:16.660> it<00:01:17.660> has<00:01:17.810> a<00:01:17.840> suction

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.130 

so<00:01:22.980> it's<00:01:23.100> uh<00:01:23.220> pretty<00:01:23.490> good<00:01:23.690> what<00:01:24.690> I'm<00:01:24.780> gonna<00:01:24.900> do

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
so it's uh pretty good what I'm gonna do

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.100 
so it's uh pretty good what I'm gonna do
I'm<00:01:25.320> gonna<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:25.890> put<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.730> up<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.030> put<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.780> end

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
I'm gonna just put it up it put this end

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.180 
I'm gonna just put it up it put this end
in<00:01:28.260> the<00:01:28.650> bottle<00:01:29.010> in<00:01:29.130> live<00:01:29.340> sub<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:31.560> seafoam<00:01:32.010> in

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
in the bottle in live sub the seafoam in

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.160 
in the bottle in live sub the seafoam in
I<00:01:33.920> did<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:34.950> first<00:01:35.220> run

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
I did the first run

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.030 
I did the first run
I<00:01:37.220> added<00:01:38.220> some<00:01:38.400> seafoam<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.530> you<00:01:40.530> know<00:01:40.650> not

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
I added some seafoam and you know not

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.130 
I added some seafoam and you know not
too<00:01:41.250> much<00:01:41.400> white<00:01:41.790> smoke<00:01:42.119> came<00:01:42.420> out<00:01:42.570> compared

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
too much white smoke came out compared

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.270 
too much white smoke came out compared
to<00:01:43.200> other<00:01:43.710> people<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.310> see<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:46.280> YouTube

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
to other people I see on the on YouTube

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.400 
to other people I see on the on YouTube
and<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:49.440> reason<00:01:49.800> why<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.400> because<00:01:50.510> I<00:01:51.510> cleaned

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
and the reason why is because I cleaned

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.800 
and the reason why is because I cleaned
out<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.280> carbon<00:01:53.700> buildup<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:55.160> I<00:01:56.160> had<00:01:56.340> a

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
out the the carbon buildup and I had a

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.639 
out the the carbon buildup and I had a
very<00:01:57.810> good<00:01:58.050> amount<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.740> carbon<00:01:59.130> buildup

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
very good amount of carbon buildup

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.630 
very good amount of carbon buildup
significant<00:02:01.649> amount<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:04.190> trying<00:02:05.190> to<00:02:05.340> open<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
significant amount so trying to open the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:25.830 
significant amount so trying to open the
can<00:02:05.850> here

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.809 

and<00:02:26.230> actually<00:02:26.590> not<00:02:27.090> too<00:02:28.090> much<00:02:28.270> smoke<00:02:28.540> came<00:02:28.750> out

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
and actually not too much smoke came out

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:44.960 
and actually not too much smoke came out
so<00:02:30.819> I'm<00:02:30.910> adding<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.209> little<00:02:31.300> bit<00:02:31.450> more

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.290 

because<00:02:45.630> even<00:02:45.990> though<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:47.000> sandblasted<00:02:48.000> it's

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
because even though you sandblasted it's

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.540 
because even though you sandblasted it's
not<00:02:48.570> going<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.900> be<00:02:49.050> like<00:02:49.890> hundred<00:02:50.250> percent

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
not going to be like hundred percent

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.210 
not going to be like hundred percent
perfect<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.230> since<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.350> got<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.710> most<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:53.100> it

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
perfect so since I got the most of it

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.680 
perfect so since I got the most of it
like<00:02:54.560> 98<00:02:55.560> percent<00:02:55.590> out<00:02:56.420> there's<00:02:57.420> still<00:02:57.540> a

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
like 98 percent out there's still a

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.410 
like 98 percent out there's still a
little<00:02:57.990> bit<00:02:58.170> left<00:02:58.670> in<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.820> crevices

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
little bit left in the crevices

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.060 
little bit left in the crevices
somewhere<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.170> this<00:03:01.350> is<00:03:01.500> this<00:03:01.740> is<00:03:01.800> going<00:03:01.980> to

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
somewhere so this is this is going to

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.640 
somewhere so this is this is going to
help<00:03:02.190> loosen<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.300> stuff<00:03:03.510> up<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:04.290> fling<00:03:04.620> it

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
help loosen the stuff up and fling it

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:24.270 
help loosen the stuff up and fling it
out

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280
