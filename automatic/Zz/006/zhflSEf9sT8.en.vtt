00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
system sometimes it can take a toll on

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.389 
system sometimes it can take a toll on
it<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.750> good<00:00:39.930> question<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.410> know<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.800> you

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
it and a good question you know is you

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.680 
it and a good question you know is you
know<00:00:41.489> should<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.790> let<00:00:41.879> your<00:00:42.030> things<00:00:42.239> warm<00:00:42.540> up

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
know should you let your things warm up

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.420 
know should you let your things warm up
should<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:42.960> take<00:00:43.230> them<00:00:43.410> out<00:00:43.530> should<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.070> take

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
should you take them out should you take

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.470 
should you take them out should you take
your<00:00:44.579> subs<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.030> stuff<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.450> out

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
your subs and stuff like that out

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.600 
your subs and stuff like that out
because<00:00:46.289> they<00:00:46.440> do<00:00:46.500> become<00:00:46.770> brittle<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
because they do become brittle in the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.520 
because they do become brittle in the
cold<00:00:47.879> cold<00:00:48.059> temperatures<00:00:48.539> especially<00:00:49.020> with

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
cold cold temperatures especially with

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.650 
cold cold temperatures especially with
multi<00:00:50.070> layer<00:00:50.370> spider<00:00:51.090> setups

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
multi layer spider setups

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.330 
multi layer spider setups
those<00:00:52.170> subwoofers<00:00:52.739> has<00:00:52.860> become<00:00:53.129> very

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
those subwoofers has become very

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.040 
those subwoofers has become very
stiffened<00:00:53.969> by<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.120> cold<00:00:54.390> temperature<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
stiffened by the cold temperature and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.810 
stiffened by the cold temperature and
when<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.559> try<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.770> flex<00:00:56.190> them<00:00:56.370> up<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.640> down

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
when you try to flex them up and down

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.110 
when you try to flex them up and down
it's<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:57.870> very<00:00:57.960> resistant<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.250> won't<00:00:59.940> do

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
it's it's very resistant and it won't do

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.720 
it's it's very resistant and it won't do
it<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.420> what<00:01:01.199> time<00:01:01.469> with<00:01:01.739> my<00:01:01.859> Hawaiians<00:01:02.489> I

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
it and what time with my Hawaiians I

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.609 
it and what time with my Hawaiians I
went<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.390> go<00:01:03.480> turn<00:01:03.719> my<00:01:03.899> system<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
went to go turn my system on and

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.590 
went to go turn my system on and
literally<00:01:05.400> even<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> rubber<00:01:06.030> surround<00:01:06.299> as

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
literally even the rubber surround as

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.510 
literally even the rubber surround as
well<00:01:06.810> as<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> spiders<00:01:07.350> where<00:01:07.950> stiff<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.490> a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
well as the spiders where stiff is a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.370 
well as the spiders where stiff is a
rock<00:01:08.820> literally<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> rock<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.720> could<00:01:09.900> hit<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.110> in

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
rock literally a rock I could hit it in

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.469 
rock literally a rock I could hit it in
and<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.100> would<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.400> would<00:01:11.460> hurt<00:01:11.729> my<00:01:11.880> knuckle<00:01:12.299> it

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
and it would it would hurt my knuckle it

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.539 
and it would it would hurt my knuckle it
was<00:01:12.600> ridiculous<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.290> especially<00:01:14.159> with<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
was ridiculous so especially with the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.880 
was ridiculous so especially with the
higher<00:01:14.790> SPL<00:01:15.390> subwoofers<00:01:16.229> they're<00:01:16.619> gonna<00:01:16.710> be

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
higher SPL subwoofers they're gonna be

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.039 
higher SPL subwoofers they're gonna be
even<00:01:17.070> thicker<00:01:17.549> spiders<00:01:18.030> they're<00:01:18.450> not<00:01:18.869> gonna

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
even thicker spiders they're not gonna

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.080 
even thicker spiders they're not gonna
move<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.470> cold<00:01:19.680> weather<00:01:19.860> let<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.880> warm

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
move in cold weather let that warm

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.060 
move in cold weather let that warm
up<00:01:21.270> you're<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.570> seriously<00:01:21.869> 15<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.770> 20

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
up you're like seriously 15 to 20

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.520 
up you're like seriously 15 to 20
minutes<00:01:23.369> before<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:24.060> start<00:01:24.110> even<00:01:25.110> considering

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
minutes before we start even considering

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.289 
minutes before we start even considering
bumping<00:01:25.950> them<00:01:26.040> go<00:01:26.220> check<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.610> out<00:01:26.700> go<00:01:27.000> feel

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
bumping them go check it out go feel

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.450 
bumping them go check it out go feel
around<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:27.990> your<00:01:28.140> your<00:01:28.799> subwoofers<00:01:29.250> and

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
around in your your subwoofers and

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.999 
around in your your subwoofers and
whatnot<00:01:29.820> see<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.210> everything's<00:01:31.009> amendable

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
whatnot see if everything's amendable

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.719 
whatnot see if everything's amendable
again<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.970> not<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.360> good<00:01:33.630> idea<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.259> be<00:01:34.729> just

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
again it's not a good idea to be just

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.530 
again it's not a good idea to be just
like<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.150> right<00:01:36.299> now

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
like it is right now

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.319 
like it is right now
negative<00:01:37.380> freaking<00:01:37.799> 100<00:01:38.640> degrees<00:01:38.939> now<00:01:39.150> it's

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
negative freaking 100 degrees now it's

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.510 
negative freaking 100 degrees now it's
