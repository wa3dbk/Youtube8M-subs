 36 ounces of cold steel. 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 24 frames per mode. 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Range 1000 meters. 

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:15.000
 He has the power to tear a man apart. 

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:18.000
 And he never misses his goal. 

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:21.000
 Your first action movie, how do you feel today? 

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.000
 This all belongs to it, I just want to enjoy it. 

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:32.000
 I love this house. 

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:35.000
 Bo Laramie thought he was living his dream. 

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.000
 Want to play football today, buddy? 

00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:42.000
 But when your name is in the stars, the cameras ... 

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.000
 Can you sign it for me? Clearly. 

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.000
 They never stop clicking. 

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:48.000
 Is it legal? Can they do this? 

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:51.000
 Everyone wants it. Small peak. 

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:56.000
 Please, I beg you, do not take pictures of my son. 

00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:00.000
 Buy them, you don't have to pay half more than when you change your clothes by the pool. 

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:02.000
 Bo! 

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:06.500
 This never ends. 

00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:09.000
 I don't know what I would do if someone ever hurt my family. 

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.000
 Remember my words, Detective. 

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:15.000
 Oh, you're gonna pay. 

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.000
 Smile, Big Bo. 

00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:20.000

 Laramiem was ordered to take anger management training. 

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:26.000
 For the moment you will be here to help you give your problems. 

00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:29.000
 My problems already have faces, don't you understand? 

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:34.000
 I will destroy your life, and I can't wait to see it. 

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:40.000
 I see nothing. 

00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:45.000
 Police, we're falling.

 FROM MEL GIBSON'S PRODUCER 

00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:52.000
 The four paparazzi almost killed my wife. They suck my blood. 

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:55.000
 Every photo tells a story 

00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:59.000
 And one good shot deserves another. 

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:05.000
 I found a dead paparazzi who was involved in your accident. 

00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:07.000
 That's so horrible. 

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.000
 PAPARAZZI 

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:21.000
