00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.400
 today a contest becomes more 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.950
 in more professionals and what is 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.980
 very important is the preparation of 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.610
 the animal already at home also on 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.110
 the site 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:41.949
 everything has to be the most 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.510
 perfectionist and ultimately it's the 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.340
 presentation on the ring and then 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.830
 today we realize that presented 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.129
 an animal starts to be a craft he 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.589
 are people who are who have more 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.320
 or less a gift to put the animals 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.530
 in value and then as much enjoy it and 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.869
 then give these people a chance 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.640
 to present the animal to put the 

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:05.799
 better value 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.810
 ladies and gentlemen hello we 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.140
 give 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.180
 general ghazi price posten the loss this 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.230
 sleep day that follows the 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.420
 champion 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.150
 super duke 7 who were coming from the north of the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.560
 France the next comeback is the 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.540
 first in saint-etienne de france 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.410
 we have two million five hundred thousand 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.000
 cows in France to produce milk 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.770
 when you drink milk you go 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.690
 license or risk is milk that 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.190
 comes from the pro sen race that was 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.190
 produced in a match that is worth this theme 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.530
 good children he was very present 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.320
 today it's true that it's something 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.540
 important thing I mean we hope 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.850
 that in the future we must still follow 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.920
 what are we going to build all our 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.180
 career and then it stays something 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.180
 very important for sure 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.990
 Yes 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.430
 and 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.470
 actually a contest ends 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:21.180
 so it ends with results 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.460
 quite correct for all of 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.830
 our team it is true that there was 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.960
 a very big pressure these last 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.949
 days especially last 24 hours 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.330
 because there everything is finalized and after 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.569
 a contest it's true that the pressure 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.180
 she goes down and that's the moment 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:41.210
 friendly and then we will meet 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.530
 all regions and then it's 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.880
 really the party we will meet and 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.860
 then 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:51.389
 it is imperative that a competition 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.389
 ends in these conditions
