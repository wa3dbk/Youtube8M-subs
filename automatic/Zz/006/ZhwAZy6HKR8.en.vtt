00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.160
 good stories here is the story 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.920
 I hope you enjoy it because everyone 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.410
 they attack me that I have done them only 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.210
 I am looking for a friend someone to fight 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.769
 shoulder to shoulder someone who does not see me 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.439
 as a threat 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.910
 someone who sees me in a different way 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.859
 everything started when I found a 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.780
 expedition of humans in the waterfalls 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.120
 meteor my home since I was a 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.070
 little wagon when I saw them I thought that 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.440
 one of them would be the one who will catch me 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.300
 in those balls he would be my friend but 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.430
 when I approached them they got scared 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.410
 fleeing one of them stumbled over the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.320
 rocks falling towards his death 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.780
 bleeding without any control finally 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.850
 drowned by the cataract one of 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.920
 they observed the petrified scene and I 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.020
 he shouted that he was a monster that would pay 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.210
 for it but I never did anything in 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.789
 actually he took out his swan perth 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.559
 ordering him to use blizzard this 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.309
 hurt because I have no resistance 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.009
 to the ice 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.750
 with tears in his eyes and still not knowing 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.450
 why they attacked me what I had done 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.579
 I decided to leave I flew far away 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.189
 trying to erase the blood and its 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:19.140
 words from my memory while flying 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.659
 people ran from me hid 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.549
 some threw their pokÃ©mons to the 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.979
 battle but I did not want to fight alone 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.720
 I wanted a friend I finally found a 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.700
 desert where you can forget what 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.439
 had happened I assumed that there 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.320
 they would leave quiet but it was everything 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.090
 otherwise it was something late I was 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.860
 dusk when it was unleashed 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.020
 sandstorm stronger than 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.420
 usual I was going to seek refuge 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.220
 some cave when I suddenly noticed that 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.929
 there was a child trapped in the sand 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.289
 for a rapids that did not let him escape 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:52.200
 I was furious when I saw the trapiche 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.299
 he cowardly fled I was resisting 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.580
 very well the sand but that child is 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.979
 tearing the skin slowly staining 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.929
 the desert with its blood I could not 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.819
 hold that so I took it with one of 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.310
 my legs and I took him to a nearby cave 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.990
 once it was safe I set out to 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.079
 sleep when I noticed that the storm 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.190
 disappeared after a while without knowing 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.770
 why 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.420
 I looked through the cave to see if it was 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.550
 in the morning but I found the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.040
 surprise that there were several lights in the 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.200
 desert after looking a while I 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.780
 I realized they were humans apparently 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.880
 they were looking for the child I did not know I could 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.310
 do if you hand them over or wait for 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.320
 they will look for me after thinking me 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.330
 I decided to go and give the boy what 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.640
 I took in my jaws and landed in 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.680
 in front of the group of humans these 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.900
 see me with the boy pulled out their pokemon 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.640
 ordering them to take the child away but I 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.650
 I was willing to hand it over 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.170
 I understood why everything had to be like that 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.510
 without realizing an agile lion I 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.460
 had robbed was when they decided 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.920
 attack me but I did not know why 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.530
 I never made the save my 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.720
 intentions were bad I was 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.490
 tired of so many blows I decided 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.770
 leave so I flew to the cave 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.930
 but those humans kept following me 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.060
 When I finally arrived, I started thinking about 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.130
 what to do if they wanted to attack me 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.560
 new when suddenly I heard a voice 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.140
 resound throughout the cave saying there 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.270
 is that they did not escape they threw their 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.890
 pokemon against me I did not know if I should 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.500
 attack them when 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.720
 of the heavens and the paradise with its 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.610
 breath ending with the threat of 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.560
 the pokemon but it was not enough for him 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.840
 this so he also murdered the 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.850
 humans when finally all the killing 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.459
 he finished he told me why you do not attack them 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.980
 Why did you let them do that to you? 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.200
 while breaking each of his bones 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.810
 with his claws I could not answer him 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.000
 when he yelled at me why are you so weak 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.670
 I told him I only want a friend 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.290
 I do not want to be a killer like you want 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.180
 someone who loves me I do not want that 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.360
 think that I am a threat I do not want 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.700
 be it he answered me how weak you are not 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.880
 you deserve to live show me what you deserve 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.920
 live attacked me unexpectedly I was 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.440
 weak I did not know what to do when 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.750
 soon the anger controlled me I felt that 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.750
 something went up my throat felt a 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.950
 sense of indescribable hatred 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.650
 then when anger seized 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.780
 completely from my attack I did not know 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.640
 I could not stop the 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.519
 cold ended up weakened I was 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.510
 really confusing when I came back to see me 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.000
 what he had done 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.950
 I could not help but burst into tears me 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.260
 He was becoming what today 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.170
 I did not want to be a monster myself 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.510
 I wanted a friend then the cold told me 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.270
 that is you have to defend yourself without 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.460
 import anything with your last breath I 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.410
 he said go you have to pay those humans for 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.960
 what you have done meets my last 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.090
 will I left the cave without knowing 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.040
 what to do when I remembered that time 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.230
 they called him a monster but he had not done 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.540
 nothing and when those humans attacked me 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.450
 they were just looking to kill me in another boot 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.490
 of anger I flew like this to his town when lowering the 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.040
 humans trembled with fear some 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.380
 They looked for their poke balls after a 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.510
 while one could react and take his 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.160
 pokemon but then let the anger get 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.960
 will take over once more from me 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.780
 ending all of them mercilessly 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.150
 Now you can call it a monster 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.550
 now they have to fear me now 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.740
 I'm not looking for a friend anymore, I'm just looking to kill 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.950
 I seek to quench this thirst for power the people 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.870
 It looked like ruins, nobody was alive 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.170
 but my thirst for revenge did not end and 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.850
 I decided to attack the next city I went down 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.100
 bordering the desert and I arrived at the 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.810
 city ââcrush the first house 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.490
 spitting fire the second the 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.550
 we destroy cliffs 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.139
 it will be crushed with all my might 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.240
 then I observed that the child that had 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.919
 saved he was paralyzed with fear at 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.470
 just like his mother and he shouted at me not for 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.930
 please you are good, do not do it but do not 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.819
 I did not care, that's when I went to a 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.919
 large building appeared numerous 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:49.009
 humans with their pokÃ©mons willing to 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.569
 stop me but they had nothing to do 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:54.240
 when I thought there was no one left 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:56.099
 alive appeared another human had hair 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.169
 red up and flying over a 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:00.300
 dragon knight I tried to burn it and 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:03.090
 swallow it but that pokemon was very 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.759
 strong the human told him use kite 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.370
 Draco several meteors fell on me 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.349
 I thought I was going to die but when I gave it 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.810
 all for lost the human stopped and I 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:14.729
 he threw one of those balls when he 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.919
 approached me I understood that I should not 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:19.199
 do none of that hate that invaded me 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.509
 but now this human would be my 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:24.270
 fellow never disappoint him and there 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:26.630
 we would fight to improve now I am 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.630
 happy
