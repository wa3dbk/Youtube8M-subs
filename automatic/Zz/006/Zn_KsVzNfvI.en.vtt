 you are bound to try to survive 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.219
 there are only two rules to play in pacific and 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.300
 try to survive trying to imitate 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.300
 but does not come out very well no matter 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.359
 and even all gorgeous here vegeta 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.790
 777 in a minecraft clinic and I'm 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.160
 against a gameplay hello hello everyone

 server we have put peaceful post 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.760

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.930

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.400

 We know why they are monsters has 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.629
 been everything as a nightclub is super 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.620
 illogical in addition to bad encirclement and is that not 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.140
 does not hit them or anything 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.070
 just to be scary 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.900
 We take the opportunity to say that if you see 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.300
 we give the odd jerk that is that 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.560
 I do not know what's wrong with the main server 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.520
 creating is going perfect indeed if you 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.440
 you fix to me it gives me 60 fps and well I do not know 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.780
 what exactly happens but let me do what 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.870
 I know is a curse that is the day that 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.240
 vegeta and townsend is already feared that he was going to 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.130
 have a kind of delay 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.760
 tip and authentic pasta you are watching or 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.140
 be this has never been seen so at 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.240
 capo thank you very much for putting fear in 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.080
 the body 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.080
 and something curious 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.060
 but I myself do not know why I do not 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.060
 I see it, nothing happens 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:56.750
 but good to see what is this welcome 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.750
 welcome for me 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.630
 perfect 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.450
 the lighting makes me nervous 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.739
 It is also how it is 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:15.410
 in going to before you leave you like it before 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.410
 de irte looks good you like music 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.860
 with an accent 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.930
 here we have a book for you and I eat 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.930
 head 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.040
 or a book that starts with Japan 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.260
 welcome to the death trap of al 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.210
 capone has been so punished by the 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.030
 grasita and now you are bound to try 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.740
 to survive there are only two rules to play 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.360
 in peaceful and try to survive 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.840
 I tried to imitate but it does not come out very 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.840
 it does not matter 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.350
 the head this is a head of my 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.510
 own character 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.940
 the basic skin is how you like me 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.940
 mask is the same as changing the face 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.680
 It's like you but with a head 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.420
 superimposed more scary than before 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.670
 it seems like it gets a little bit bigger 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.090
 it's worth after being silly 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.530
 and then we go there not for the birds 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.620
 which also happens over mortal trap if 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.800
 it would have been called fun games 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.590
 in this video 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.990
 around here it's not the blink that guy does not 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:34.980
 it's our thing but it's happened 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.980
 because look at the boxes 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.210
 is the brightness 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:54.400
 around here you can go to left eyes 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:58.360
 eyes now guys there's nothing 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:02.070
 we also the strangers also to 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.070
 to capone at what handsome moment 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:14.100
 the gentleman you do not have to put 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.100
 idea 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.670
 Where are you 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.300
 let's see this 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:48.940
 we are following this that is is a 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:51.430
 labyrinth I imagine but that is a lot 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.070
 Much much is worth talking about from the 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:05:01.200
 A cricket's armpit you're getting 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:05:04.680
 it now mine 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.680
 yes, yes 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:17.020
 something is more or less good to follow me as 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.849
 if it were xavi beacons and protected is that 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.319
 Chamomile what was in my camera 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:24.740
 is that you're going to freak out more scared if you do not 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:28.729
 I am following 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.439
 my mother is like giving sticks because you do 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.209
 this map like this against the 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:35.860
 courage of a torch 

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:35.860
 a torch is clear 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:47.800
 this is the month in the beginning a 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:54.520
 moment and I will try to search 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:57.900
 I do not see the beginning we thought that 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.900
 We were going to finish this quick map 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:02.460
 the light 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:25.599
 it is more for god of oppression than oppression 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.180
 I'm looking and they tried to memorize 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:32.099
 as we see the legendary hunter's worth 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.099
 perfect what can be the outputs
