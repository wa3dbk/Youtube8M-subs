00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
 as regards lately 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:08.790
 discussed problems 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:11.370
 need union eu and so on me 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.590
 it seems we are too politicized it 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.900
 problem secondly we drove ourselves 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.480
 it is not clear where it is always necessary to proceed and 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.580
 in vain what Ukraine signs 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.600
 association agreement with European 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.840
 union 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.470
 it is almost a fait accompli to the 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.820
 he should be approached that way if 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.250
 believe statements from brussels and and kiev 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.340
 so we also need to approach this 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.620
 so that Ukraine as a sovereign 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.350
 independent state chose such 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.510
 way and decided to learn this agreement 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.940
 frankly, in this step 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.510
 direction of cooperation with the European 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.699
 I don't see any problems with the union 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:06.950
 the other is important so that the agreement itself and 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.580
 the subsequent ones did not close for Ukraine 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.950
 cooperation with a single economic 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.560
 space is our customs union 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.479
 here that is very important here again 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.979
 formula too if the customs union will 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.740
 be satisfied 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.900
 Ukrainian offers will satisfy 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.100
 of course we will go to the meeting 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.950
 if they are flawed and will 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.650
 skewed side of the European Union but of course not 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.780
 Russians to forced Belarus on it 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.290
 They will not go, but if they go, then on the basis 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.490
 what is the trade-off I am saying that 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.250
 we want it or we don't want it 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.590
 want don't want we already have to live 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.140
 in certain realities and of course 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.530
 to build on this our best 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.080
 politics as both Ukraine did not lead itself 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.450
 even if she is in nato 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:05.120
 foot we still have to look for 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.479
 relations with Ukraine we are doomed simply 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.490
 night of for many, many reasons 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.770
 Of course, I always said that 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.740
 we would very much like Ukraine to be 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.160
 in a single economic space with 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.490
 us 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.880
 future Eurasian Union on 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.940
 equal footing so that it was and 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.150
 there were uniform rules that are recognized 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.990
 by all states we are no longer that 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.020
 wanted and you know i think we will find 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.780
 some formula for us to be together 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.180
 we are by no means choosing 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.980
 Of course the best options for direction 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.470
 cooperation it is clear that the west 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:50.590
 technologically I understand that it is possible and 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.540
 Ukraine promises these technologies 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.640
 advanced so whether it can be but at the 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:02.360
 same time i am gut and heart and soul with 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.730
 Ukraine, we do not consider Ukraine Republic 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.220
 absolutely not believe and we would like 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.100
 Ukraine was not just next 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.540
 with us in all integration and 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.459
 other formations but the rights of Ukraine 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.400
 choose which direction to go 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.220
 our right is based on ethical standards and 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.340
 diplomacy to reckon with the right of Ukraine 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.709
 here and you understand that this is sovereign 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.050
 independent state therefore 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:34.190
 we have to go soon 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.050
 a very big way to find normal 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.190
 cooperation with Ukraine we are 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.700
 understand perfectly 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.250
 I say we are members there already on the site 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.070
 we are representatives 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.520
 Slavic brotherly nations and us 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.560
 really bound by age-old friendship 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:54.070
 neighbors do not fade Oleg gentlemen reason 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.760
 so our task is to learn to live by 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.700
 Neighborhood and a month so it seems to me 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.490
 this is the basis of our cooperation many 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.730
 they say it's more emotional 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.480
 than pragmatism but not too gone into 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.760
 Pragmatism does not there the last time 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.940
 that there is there there is here hee hi vaut 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.859
 some warriors conflicts and then we must not 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.760
 forget the human 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:24.990
 and not just about the goods money to us 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:30.610
 there is a rather difficult way to go 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:34.000
 we took the drive but these 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.870
 obligations they are our foremost 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.150
 liabilities 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:44.460
 we need them we will perform for 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.680
 ourselves and not for someone and so we 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.610
 we proceed from 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.009
 it's very important to have everything about freedom 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:57.560
 meekness of the European Union and no less 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:59.800
 it is important to have a normal for violation of 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.300
 free trade to participate 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.340
 integration processes to participate in 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:10.009
 common economic space 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:16.069
 40 percent of the turnover is because 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:18.139
 so can be landed somewhere around 65 we 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:21.020
 do not oppose one another 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.599
 on the contrary we want to find a harmonious 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.090
 combination 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.740
 let's say those opportunities that 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:31.509
 are provided for channel development as 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.509
 in the west the canvas
