00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.010
 how about friends of autocosmos.com my 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.260
 name is rubÃ©n today I like it 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.809
 say hello and today we are 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:19.029
 testing the fifth and most recent 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:22.130
 member of the x family of bmw w the x4 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.840
 it's been 15 years since the first 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.739
 model of this family came out of the 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.570
 factory in the USA a family that does not 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:34.850
 has stopped growing we have the pioneer 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:39.649
 the x5 but later arrived x 3 x 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.989
 6 x 1 and now more recently the x 4 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.149
 just like how it happened with the 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.269
 launch of x 6 that took the 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.899
 architecture of the x 5 this x 4 do what 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.570
 own 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.080
 taking the architecture of the smallest 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.040
 x 3 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.700
 obviously being a member of the 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.470
 x family of bmw w equips a system of 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.440
 four-wheel drive called 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.960
 xdrive and finally one of the details 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.060
 important to know is one 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.390
 of every three models that they see from bmw to 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.950
 global level belongs to the family x se 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.590
 have sold more than three million 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.870
 units of this type of cars and it 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.600
 coined for the first time in these the 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.630
 denomination is heavy that means 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.540
 sports activity vehicle because he sees 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.130
 mw one wanted to be mixed with the 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.380
 denominations you be that you have a 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.270
 connotation more than 4x4 these cars 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.160
 they were always designed to offer 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.979
 very good driving skills 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.020
 dynamics in city on highway e 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.539
 even on track 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.759
 but what do you think we're going to handle it 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:47.659
 let's know all the equipment that 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:50.479
 offers us the bm w x4 2015 well 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:55.240
 friends of autocosmos.com we are after the 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.990
 steering wheel of the new bmw w x4 2015 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.069
 obviously the first thing I'm going to 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.899
 address is the mechanical issue carries the 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.539
 famous 6 cylinders in line of three 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:09.470
 liters twinpower turbo as you like 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:14.840
 call bmw w its two engines 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.150
 Biturbo turbochargers 3 liters 295 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.310
 lb.-ft. torque 305 hp 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.220
 force coupled a transmission 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.870
 8-speed automatic with mode 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.690
 manual 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.610
 and as I mentioned earlier 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.739
 the all-wheel drive system extract 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.400
 that allows us not only to transfer the 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.470
 torque 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.319
 between the front and rear axle but 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.940
 also in my case the wheels 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:43.120
 back and forth 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:46.909
 this so that to have this ability 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.420
 of having turning torque that is when 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:53.000
 let's take a curve we're going 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.250
 to say to the right and then the 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.840
 wheel that remains on the outside of the 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.269
 curve in this case the left wheel 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.420
 does not get more power to help us 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:08.480
 take the curve better 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.160
 It is one of the most important drive trains 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.599
 capable one of the best six 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.490
 cylinders of the market we have not 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.080
 tired of saying this 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.450
 It also has a lot of 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.280
 functionalities and technologies for 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.890
 improve performance and consumption 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.580
 we have start and stop braking system 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.420
 regenerative we also have these modes 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.850
 driving sport sport plus comfort 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.720
 which is the way by defaul diego pro in 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.900
 the eco pro mode that is the one that helps us 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.650
 to take better care of the performance 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.650
 of fuel 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.650
 we have an indicator here in the 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.959
 board that helps us know how much 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.110
 fuel we are saving is true 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.970
 that in our 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.340
 small spaces of coexistence in 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.769
 these days that we have lived with the x4 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.780
 to throwing a lot of desire taking care of 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:06.050
 consumption watching that it does not rise of the 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.360
 2000 laps we have not achieved more than 8.5 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.489
 kilometers per liter the brand is not for 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.470
 there's 12 of us has given us more 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.349
 of eight but we think that with these 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.989
 capacities 10 to 100 in 5.5 seconds is 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.419
 a more than decorous figure we have 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.570
 also in terms of security a whole 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.620
 technological arsenal to guarantee the 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.979
 integrity of the occupants 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.470
 obviously the already 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.630
 compulsory issues like abs esp 6 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.669
 air bags all that is present 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:40.330
 but we also have a system that 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:42.280
 warns about lane change 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.689
 the collision warning that can be 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.389
 active which means that it can be 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:49.150
 activates that when the driver does not 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.009
 reacts with the right speed the 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.439
 vehicle interprets that there may be a 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:56.240
 threat of impact is even capable of 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:59.180
 intervene and stop 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.940
 by itself the vehicle is enough to say that 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.919
 the materials used the 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.470
 the soundproofing of the cabin 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.789
 response to the atmosphere that produces 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.009
 this vehicle when driving it is 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.479
 simply perfect on the one hand the 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.680
 convenience equipment too 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.410
 we found some issues 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.440
 interesting as the screen is of 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:21.319
 8.8-inch high resolution 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.910
 obviously bluetooth two air conditioner 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:27.650
 areas with exits for the back row 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.659
 we obviously have the eye drive that 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.810
 has this touch function that allows us 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:36.409
 in the cap on the top of the 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.030
 and drive write the letters and we 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.740
 recognizes the writing evidently 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.639
 it also has voice commands in case 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:46.220
 we are more inclined to speak to our 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.919
 vehicle the audio system is 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.889
 signed by harman kardon has 16 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.530
 speakers and 600 watts in order on the side 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.330
 of the equipment this x4 than the one 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.449
 we are driving is the top of the range with 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:03.020
 sport package offers virtually everything 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:06.919
 in fact with a price of 899 thousand 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:10.350
 pesos has a difference of just 10 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:13.260
 thousand pesos with the basic x5 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.880
 which good also puts us in a 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.440
 predicament we want more space 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.450
 we want a vehicle with a presence 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.240
 little bit stronger or we want this that 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.890
 it is a little more personal it has good 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.490
 space for a family of four 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.440
 people 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.880
 the drawers of 500 filters that is 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.580
 quite more 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.570
 it's enough for the luggage of all 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.450
 the family 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:37.060
 if we have this situation that in the 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.160
 back of the body goes very 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.440
 lying in coupe shape and then 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.850
 obviously, if the passengers 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.360
 backs are very high good they will 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:49.720
 suffer a little too this situation 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.150
 penalizes us a little for issues 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.610
 of visibility for everything else the x4 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.410
 is a very competent vehicle is a 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.760
 nice vehicle to see is a 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:01.820
 matter of 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:04.160
 always of tastes keep visiting 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:07.820
 autocosmos.com I remember my name is 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.830
 robben hole and you can find more 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:14.360
 Details of the characteristics and 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:17.630
 equipment of this 2015 x4 visiting 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:20.020
 the leagues related to the video many 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.020
 Thank you
