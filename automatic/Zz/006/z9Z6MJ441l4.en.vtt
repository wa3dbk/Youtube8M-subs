dumbbells<00:00:22.529> because<00:00:22.920> we've<00:00:23.340> got<00:00:23.460> really

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.700 

it's<00:00:35.520> usually<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.300> tail<00:00:36.600> pulley<00:00:36.870> if<00:00:37.530> you

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
it's usually on a tail pulley if you

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.530 
it's usually on a tail pulley if you
have<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.860> wing<00:00:38.130> pulley<00:00:38.460> like<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.970> you<00:00:39.420> get

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
have a wing pulley like that you get

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.030 
have a wing pulley like that you get
such<00:00:39.980> vibration<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.480> in<00:00:42.480> your<00:00:42.629> feed<00:00:42.900> zone<00:00:43.040> you

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
such vibration and in your feed zone you

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.549 
such vibration and in your feed zone you
try<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.430> have<00:00:44.640> skirt<00:00:45.600> board<00:00:45.809> rubber<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.350> there

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
try to have skirt board rubber in there

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.760 
try to have skirt board rubber in there
and<00:00:46.970> with<00:00:47.970> that<00:00:48.120> vibration<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.899> eats<00:00:49.379> out<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
and with that vibration it eats out the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.369 
and with that vibration it eats out the
skirt<00:00:50.010> board<00:00:50.190> rubber<00:00:50.460> at<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> p10<00:00:51.199> well<00:00:52.199> then

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
skirt board rubber at the p10 well then

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.740 
skirt board rubber at the p10 well then
you<00:00:52.470> get<00:00:52.589> spillage<00:00:53.070> coming<00:00:53.430> up<00:00:53.629> with<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
you get spillage coming up with the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.310 
you get spillage coming up with the
Chevron<00:00:55.309> it's<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.550> smooth<00:00:56.970> the<00:00:57.629> canoe<00:00:57.870> liners

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
seam to the sheds of material it doesn't

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.249 
seam to the sheds of material it doesn't
do<00:01:08.670> any<00:01:08.820> damage<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.420> Foley<00:01:09.690> and<00:01:09.899> get<00:01:10.050> rid

do any damage to the Foley and get rid

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.710 
do any damage to the Foley and get rid
of<00:01:10.289> it<00:01:10.410> extend<00:01:11.009> until<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.300> design<00:01:12.690> of

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
of it extend until I like the design of

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.370 
of it extend until I like the design of
it<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:14.190> added<00:01:14.490> feature<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:15.149> noise<00:01:15.960> reduction

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
it the added feature is noise reduction

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.010 
it the added feature is noise reduction
we<00:01:17.369> try<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.640> keep<00:01:17.850> our<00:01:18.030> noise<00:01:18.270> levels<00:01:18.780> down

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
we try to keep our noise levels down

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.100 
we try to keep our noise levels down
wherever<00:01:19.289> we<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.820> with<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.240> having<00:01:21.539> contact

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
wherever we can with it having contact

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.830 
wherever we can with it having contact
with<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.649> belt<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.100> all<00:01:23.280> times<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.149> not<00:01:24.630> have

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
with the belt at all times and not have

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.529 
with the belt at all times and not have
the<00:01:24.960> thumping<00:01:25.410> noise<00:01:25.789> it<00:01:26.789> just<00:01:27.000> levels<00:01:27.360> out

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
the thumping noise it just levels out

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.590 
the thumping noise it just levels out
it's<00:01:27.840> quieter

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
it's quieter

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.520 
it's quieter
we<00:01:30.600> installed<00:01:32.240> seven<00:01:33.240> or<00:01:33.360> eight<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:34.050> winter

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
we installed seven or eight this winter

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.279 
we installed seven or eight this winter
you<00:01:34.830> know<00:01:34.890> itself<00:01:35.789> cleans<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.509> belt<00:01:36.720> off<00:01:36.990> real

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
you know itself cleans the belt off real

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.289 
you know itself cleans the belt off real
nice<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:38.009> not<00:01:38.250> sitting<00:01:38.640> there<00:01:38.759> rolling<00:01:39.180> that

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
nice it's not sitting there rolling that

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.870 
nice it's not sitting there rolling that
rock<00:01:39.570> yet<00:01:39.869> like<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> typical<00:01:40.890> heel<00:01:41.610> pulley

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
rock yet like a typical heel pulley

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.330 
rock yet like a typical heel pulley
would<00:01:42.060> do<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.110> nice<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.470> see<00:01:43.650> that<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:44.280> we

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
would do so it's nice to see that if we

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.429 
would do so it's nice to see that if we
do<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> little<00:01:45.090> leakage<00:01:45.360> it's<00:01:46.140> spitting

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
do have a little leakage it's spitting

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.240 
do have a little leakage it's spitting
it<00:01:46.619> out<00:01:46.710> right<00:01:46.979> away

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
it out right away

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.030 
it out right away
we're<00:01:47.970> able<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.360> pull<00:01:49.079> our<00:01:49.110> resources<00:01:49.320> in

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
we're able to pull our resources in

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.030 
we're able to pull our resources in
other<00:01:50.220> areas<00:01:51.170> anyway<00:01:52.170> anywhere<00:01:52.530> we<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:52.829> make

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
other areas anyway anywhere we can make

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.800 
other areas anyway anywhere we can make
an<00:01:53.159> improvement<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.790> new<00:01:53.970> technology

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
an improvement with the new technology

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.159 
an improvement with the new technology
what<00:01:55.590> we<00:01:55.619> want<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.009> do
