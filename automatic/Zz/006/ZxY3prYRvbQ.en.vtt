00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.600
 Hi, I'm Marcos Cossoy. Professor of motorcycle mechanics and electronics at the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.560
 Technological Institute of Automotive Training. 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:32.950
 In today's video we will see how to remove and place the front and rear wheels of 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.950
 a motorcycle 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.750
 As a first step we will start to take out the front wheel axle 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.210
 we loose the nut 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.590
 we removed the same 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.080
 we remove the nut 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.110
 we proceed to remove the shaft 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.610
 once we take out the shaft 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.129
 we take the wheel 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.420
 and we carefully remove the speedometer re-sending so as not to damage the casing 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.250
 in this way we have the wheel out 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.270
 we have to be careful not to lose the separators of it 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.190
 now let's proceed to assemble the wheel 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.250
 first we place the separator 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:30.950
 then we will place the wheel in position and we will proceed to place the forwarding 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:38.640
 taking care that the two grooves fit with the two lugs of the rim 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.000
 we look for the correct position 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.159
 we put it 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.250
 we corroborate that it is free 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.810
 and now we have to place the disc between the two brake pads 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.929
 let's place the wheel 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.490
 with the caution that the disc is between the two pills 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.159
 and with the precaution that the return is in 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.720
 position 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.880
 we place the shaft 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:20.030
 and proceed to place the nut 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.190
 we screw the nut 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.080
 and with the help of the torque wrench we will proceed to give the torque indicated to it 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:38.700
 the indicated torque according to the workshop manual of this nut is 30 newton meter 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.210
 after having finished with the front wheel we will move to the rear wheel 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.060
 let's proceed to loosen 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.610
 the shaft, first loosen the nut 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.510
 let's remove the same 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.900
 we loose the rear brake 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.600
 Once loosened the same we will proceed to remove the shaft 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.230
 when we remove the shaft we have to have 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.950
 Great care to respect 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.670
 the position of the shaft separators 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.280
 we run the axis 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.280
 we remove 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.590
 a separator 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.010
 we finished taking the shaft 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.260
 and we remove the other stretch chain 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.110
 we lower the wheel with the full shoe holder 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:42.700
 and we will proceed to run the same 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.850
 once the shoe holder has run 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.790
 we remove the separator from the side of the crown 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.790
 we remove 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.950
 the crown portal 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.200
 and in this way 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.450
 the wheel was released 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:04.750
 we take the wheel to its position 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:13.310
 we place the crown holder in the position 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.430
 and we fit the lugs 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.370
 on the rim 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.759
 we place 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:31.729
 the brake plate 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.710
 once the brake plate is placed 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:41.250
 let's proceed to place the separator on the side the crown 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.880
 and the chain stretches 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.130
 we arrange the axis 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.570
 in your position 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:56.100
 we raise the wheel, we place the shaft 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.590
 let's place 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.470
 the other supplement 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.260
 we run the axis to position 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.250
 and we place 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.880
 the other tense chain 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.750
 we finished placing the shaft 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.850
 we put the nut 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.740
 we bring the same 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.960
 we corroborate 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.080
 the tension of the chain that has to be 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.400
 between 20 and 30 millimeters 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.180
 of free play in its most tense part 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.070
 we corroborate the alignment 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.150
 of the wheel 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.420
 with reference marks 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.290
 and once we have the correct alignment we are going to proceed 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.340
 to press the same 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.960
 according to the workshop manual 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.040
 the indicated torque 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.480
 for this wheel is 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:08.800
 80 newton metro 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.510
 we torque to 80 newton meter having the brake pressed back 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.200
 now we will proceed 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.620
 to regulate the rear brake 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.620
 and this form we will finish the operation 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.180
 with a hand 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.680
 we keep the cam 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.520
 making contact 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.840
 with the other let's proceed to 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.430
 screw the regulator 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.800
 Once regulated, we have completed the operation 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.710
 This was another ITCA TV video, I hope it has been useful, see you at the 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:45.710
 next 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:51.710
 ITCA, forming your future.
