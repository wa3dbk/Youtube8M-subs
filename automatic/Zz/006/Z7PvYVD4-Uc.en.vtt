00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
and a bar put it right here let me stick

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.360 
and a bar put it right here let me stick
it<00:00:51.629> about<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.440> much<00:00:52.969> so<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.030> looks<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:54.360> this

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
it about that much so it looks like this

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.569 
it about that much so it looks like this
now<00:00:56.370> take<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:57.239> little<00:00:57.420> piece<00:01:00.199> put<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.230> right<00:01:01.620> on

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
now take a little piece put it right on

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.350 
now take a little piece put it right on
the<00:01:02.820> end<00:01:04.369> so<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.850> little<00:01:05.970> sticking

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the end so it's just a little sticking

other end
let<00:01:13.500> push<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.950> all<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.000> way<00:01:15.540> down<00:01:18.350> to<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.500> side

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
let push it all the way down to the side

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.120 
let push it all the way down to the side
so<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.850> looks<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:22.520> now

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
through there and now you're going to

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.210 
through there and now you're going to
need<00:02:57.470> two<00:02:58.470> kinds<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.280> rubber<00:02:59.640> bands<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.920> first

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
need two kinds of rubber bands the first

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.380 
need two kinds of rubber bands the first
one<00:03:02.900> we're<00:03:03.900> going<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.290> need<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.680> thick<00:03:05.390> stretchy
