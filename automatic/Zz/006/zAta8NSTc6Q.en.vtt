00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.150 
good way to freeze their offense just
kind<00:03:25.080> of<00:03:25.110> stopping<00:03:25.380> so<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:25.709> can<00:03:25.800> open<00:03:25.920> up<00:03:26.100> your

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
kind of stopping so you can open up your

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.180 
kind of stopping so you can open up your
offense<00:03:26.760> so<00:03:27.390> again<00:03:27.660> I'll<00:03:27.750> jab<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.350> step<00:03:28.620> in<00:03:28.830> so

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
offense so again I'll jab the step in so

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:44.670 
offense so again I'll jab the step in so
then<00:03:29.400> do<00:03:29.580> a<00:03:29.610> left<00:03:29.790> body<00:03:30.060> looks

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680
