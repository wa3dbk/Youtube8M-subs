00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.770
 hello how about friends welcome to 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.000
 our black channel we are with 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.000
 our cook joyce 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.610
 today we are going to prepare a 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.930
 Japanese drink that is since the years 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.930
 1900 and it's called call peace 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.200
 to prepare this drink basically 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:01.820
 we need simple things we need 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:05.390
 water we need ice and we need a 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.140
 blender as they see pretty pretty 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:12.310
 simple to prepare 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:16.900
 to prepare the piss only 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:20.250
 you need the blender so we're going to 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.920
 walk in it 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.549
 approximately 800 milliliters of 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.860
 lime pee if you want to prepare it for 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.110
 many people if nothing else is for two 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.880
 or three with a small cup of 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:41.020
 enough then we put the ice 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:47.009
 about three or four pieces nothing more now 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.009
 let's pass what is a cup of lime pee 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.860
 and we passed what is a cup of water 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.030
 now we look good 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.030
 that is well covered and when liquefying 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:34.370
 and that's all already been listed 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:38.090
 our lime drink peace you can 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.880
 accompany with more ice and if it has 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.790
 liked cold or for these hot days 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.210
 that is coming then prepare it with 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.700
 ice 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:52.490
 or you can simply accompany her with 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.490
 some other drink or some other juice 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.880
 to flavor the call peace drink 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.620
 It is only necessary to apply the 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.180
 flavor you're looking for example 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.450
 we are using such a place of 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.680
 coconut that is coconut flavor cream and 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:26.189
 you just have to do it a little 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.500
 to our Galician drink prepared if 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:31.379
 remember nothing else we liquefy it 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.829
 little bit and you just have to make a 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:37.459
 trickle you do not need much to give 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.459
 all the flavor 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.819
 and liquefy it again 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.760
 and there you have a drink of calp and flavor 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.040
 coconut 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.930
 You can do this with orange juice 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:09.030
 with cranberry juice with mango juice or 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.430
 even with wine you can mix it with 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.980
 sake and tastes very very tasty 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.519
 Now imagine a mixed peace call 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.320
 with coconut flavor and a little 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.639
 take out 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.509
 and there you have a super drink 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.509
 refreshing 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:34.430
