don't put the loom band too high up on

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.250 
don't put the loom band too high up on
as<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.340> can<00:02:21.490> see<00:02:21.670> it's<00:02:22.300> going<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.600> explode

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
as you can see it's going to explode

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.160 
as you can see it's going to explode
and<00:02:23.770> also<00:02:23.920> I<00:02:24.130> first<00:02:24.610> mentioned<00:02:25.140> you're<00:02:26.140> going

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
and also I first mentioned you're going

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.040 
and also I first mentioned you're going
to<00:02:26.410> put<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:29.310> bullets<00:02:30.310> in<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.240> formation

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
to put the the bullets in that formation

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.200 
to put the the bullets in that formation
so<00:02:32.530> I<00:02:32.560> actually<00:02:32.770> go<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.790> you're<00:02:33.970> going<00:02:34.120> to

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
so I actually go and you're going to

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:44.940 
so I actually go and you're going to
just<00:02:34.510> grab<00:02:34.930> boom<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.530> stick<00:02:35.920> up<00:02:36.790> fire<00:02:43.950> what

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
just grab boom and stick up fire what

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.780 
just grab boom and stick up fire what
then<00:02:45.760> you're<00:02:45.880> going<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.120> take<00:02:46.360> this<00:02:46.750> one<00:02:47.080> and

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
then you're going to take this one and

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.910 
then you're going to take this one and
it's<00:02:48.790> going<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.060> take<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.570> most<00:02:49.750> Kilda<00:02:50.350> band

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
it's going to take the most Kilda band

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.400 
it's going to take the most Kilda band
and<00:02:51.400> you're<00:02:52.090> going<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.330> put<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:53.160> around<00:02:54.239> this

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
and you're going to put that around this

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.640 
and you're going to put that around this
here<00:02:56.410> so<00:02:57.340> that's<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.880> safety<00:02:58.180> pin<00:02:58.570> well<00:02:59.230> not

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
here so that's the safety pin well not

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.300 
here so that's the safety pin well not
pin<00:03:00.040> white<00:03:00.280> band<00:03:00.670> and<00:03:01.150> this<00:03:01.989> works<00:03:02.350> really

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
hearing hardware um are you going to

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.520 
hearing hardware um are you going to
want<00:03:42.519> to<00:03:42.610> do<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.360> grenade<00:03:43.690> let's<00:03:44.260> pull

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
off and it should sever out just a

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.330 
off and it should sever out just a
little<00:03:47.739> bit<00:03:48.130> like<00:03:48.850> that<00:03:48.880> and<00:03:49.480> once<00:03:50.230> again<00:03:50.410> make

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
little bit like that and once again make

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.670 
little bit like that and once again make
sure<00:03:51.370> that<00:03:51.489> flat<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.120> you<00:03:52.420> have<00:03:52.540> these<00:03:52.810> buns

sure that flat and you have these buns
up<00:03:53.950> here<00:03:54.160> and<00:03:54.580> like<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:55.750> I'm<00:03:56.500> going<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:56.920> do

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
up here and like that I'm going to do

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.680 
up here and like that I'm going to do
and<00:03:58.440> as<00:03:59.440> you<00:03:59.530> can<00:03:59.620> see<00:03:59.680> else<00:04:00.459> plays<00:04:00.970> out<00:04:01.209> and

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
and as you can see else plays out and

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:02.520 
and as you can see else plays out and
how<00:04:01.750> do<00:04:01.989> you<00:04:02.140> throw

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
how do you throw

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:22.080 
how do you throw
it's<00:04:02.770> going<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.160> explode<00:04:03.750> more<00:04:04.750> really<00:04:21.090> yeah

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
it's going to explode more really yeah

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.860 
it's going to explode more really yeah
so<00:04:22.840> now<00:04:23.290> I<00:04:23.320> think<00:04:23.680> I'll<00:04:24.100> get<00:04:24.550> on<00:04:24.730> to<00:04:24.870> showing

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
so now I think I'll get on to showing

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.970 
so now I think I'll get on to showing
how<00:04:26.140> it<00:04:26.260> works

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
how it works

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.660 
how it works
be<00:04:27.610> right<00:04:27.820> back<00:04:28.620> so<00:04:29.620> here<00:04:29.920> is<00:04:30.100> the<00:04:30.460> nerf

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
be right back so here is the nerf

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.780 
be right back so here is the nerf
grenade<00:04:31.450> so<00:04:32.440> as<00:04:32.740> you<00:04:32.830> can<00:04:32.950> see<00:04:33.010> it's<00:04:33.400> through

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
grenade so as you can see it's through

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.120 
grenade so as you can see it's through
no<00:04:34.030> belts<00:04:34.570> it's<00:04:34.930> with<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.500> seven<00:04:35.800> bullets

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
no belts it's with the seven bullets

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.930 
no belts it's with the seven bullets
under<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.960> safety<00:04:37.960> pin<00:04:38.800> down<00:04:38.980> here<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:39.490> the

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
under the safety pin down here and the

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.870 
under the safety pin down here and the
rubber<00:04:40.240> band<00:04:40.330> up<00:04:40.600> here<00:04:40.810> so<00:04:41.380> quite<00:04:42.100> simply<00:04:42.340> all

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
rubber band up here so quite simply all

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.770 
rubber band up here so quite simply all
you<00:04:42.940> do<00:04:43.210> is<00:04:43.390> when<00:04:44.169> you<00:04:44.200> pull<00:04:44.530> this<00:04:44.919> off<00:04:45.780> this

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
you do is when you pull this off this

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.630 
you do is when you pull this off this
rubber<00:04:47.050> band<00:04:47.380> up<00:04:47.530> here<00:04:47.710> is<00:04:47.860> squeezing<00:04:48.610> down

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
rubber band up here is squeezing down

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.659 
rubber band up here is squeezing down
more<00:04:49.240> and<00:04:49.510> it's<00:04:49.690> less<00:04:49.990> leveled<00:04:50.500> out<00:04:50.710> so<00:04:51.400> that's

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
more and it's less leveled out so that's

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.820 
more and it's less leveled out so that's
going<00:04:51.850> to<00:04:51.940> feather<00:04:52.240> like<00:04:52.540> this<00:04:52.900> but<00:04:53.710> what

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
going to feather like this but what

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.400 
going to feather like this but what
happens<00:04:54.280> when<00:04:54.580> you<00:04:54.730> throw<00:04:55.030> this<00:04:55.330> like<00:04:56.230> I'll

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
happens when you throw this like I'll

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
should put a rubber band on your knee

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.610 
should put a rubber band on your knee
and<00:05:08.169> then<00:05:08.320> you<00:05:08.410> often<00:05:08.740> if<00:05:08.830> you<00:05:08.979> like<00:05:09.160> it<00:05:10.620> the

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
and then you often if you like it the

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.850 
and then you often if you like it the
bun<00:05:11.830> just<00:05:12.160> runs<00:05:12.460> off<00:05:12.820> or<00:05:13.570> what<00:05:14.410> happens<00:05:14.680> here

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
bun just runs off or what happens here

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.090 
bun just runs off or what happens here
is<00:05:15.100> you<00:05:15.400> push<00:05:16.270> it<00:05:16.419> down<00:05:16.450> they<00:05:17.320> fit<00:05:17.680> they<00:05:17.919> would

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
is you push it down they fit they would

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.280 
is you push it down they fit they would
one<00:05:18.370> gets<00:05:18.550> so<00:05:18.729> close<00:05:18.940> to<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.300> edge<00:05:19.390> like<00:05:19.930> pulls

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
one gets so close to the edge like pulls

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.680 
one gets so close to the edge like pulls
together<00:05:20.500> really<00:05:20.979> quickly<00:05:21.370> making<00:05:22.360> all<00:05:22.660> of

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
together really quickly making all of

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.219 
together really quickly making all of
these<00:05:23.430> don't<00:05:24.430> go<00:05:24.820> out<00:05:25.000> diagonally<00:05:25.780> in<00:05:25.990> the

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
these don't go out diagonally in the

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.159 
these don't go out diagonally in the
same<00:05:26.500> direction<00:05:26.740> so<00:05:27.700> it's<00:05:27.880> really<00:05:28.510> really

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
same direction so it's really really

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.700 
same direction so it's really really
basic<00:05:29.380> design<00:05:30.010> and<00:05:30.430> that's<00:05:31.440> Trimble's<00:05:32.440> all

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
basic design and that's Trimble's all

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.130 
basic design and that's Trimble's all
those<00:05:32.950> to<00:05:33.190> it<00:05:33.310> now<00:05:33.910> I<00:05:33.940> am<00:05:34.210> about<00:05:34.570> to<00:05:34.900> worms

now I use this and I'll use my

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.909 
now I use this and I'll use my
triangular<00:05:42.190> go<00:05:42.580> ahead<00:05:42.880> it's<00:05:43.090> all<00:05:43.210> the<00:05:44.110> little

triangular go ahead it's all the little
bigger<00:05:45.250> but<00:05:45.540> yeah<00:05:46.540> let's<00:05:46.810> get<00:05:47.500> to<00:05:48.010> it

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
bigger but yeah let's get to it

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.830 
bigger but yeah let's get to it
and<00:05:49.419> we<00:05:49.780> are<00:05:50.080> done<00:05:50.740> here<00:05:50.770> is<00:05:51.460> the<00:05:51.840> triangular

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
and we are done here is the triangular

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.740 
and we are done here is the triangular
grenade<00:05:53.500> it<00:05:53.890> that<00:05:54.490> is<00:05:54.640> twelve<00:05:55.060> boys<00:05:55.270> right

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
grenade it that is twelve boys right

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.530 
grenade it that is twelve boys right
there<00:05:55.780> and<00:05:56.320> you<00:05:56.800> got<00:05:56.979> left<00:05:57.250> paid<00:05:57.550> well<00:05:58.060> bandit

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
there and you got left paid well bandit

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.030 
there and you got left paid well bandit
you<00:05:58.660> don't<00:05:58.840> really<00:05:59.140> change<00:05:59.380> the<00:05:59.590> size<00:05:59.770> though

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
you don't really change the size though

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.330 
you don't really change the size though
it's<00:06:00.220> just<00:06:00.310> quite<00:06:01.120> a<00:06:01.419> lot<00:06:01.900> more<00:06:02.140> strain<00:06:02.979> it<00:06:03.310> so

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
it's just quite a lot more strain it so

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.950 
it's just quite a lot more strain it so
I<00:06:03.520> guess<00:06:03.790> I<00:06:04.979> guess<00:06:05.979> the<00:06:06.010> only<00:06:06.729> thing<00:06:07.390> y'all<00:06:07.720> do

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
I guess I guess the only thing y'all do

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.560 
I guess I guess the only thing y'all do
is<00:06:08.110> I'm<00:06:08.410> making<00:06:08.560> the<00:06:09.250> boys<00:06:09.520> Godfather<00:06:09.880> which<00:06:10.450> I

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
is I'm making the boys Godfather which I

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.630 
is I'm making the boys Godfather which I
guess<00:06:10.720> is<00:06:10.900> quite<00:06:11.740> good<00:06:11.979> assuring<00:06:12.400> to<00:06:12.520> get

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
guess is quite good assuring to get

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.020 
guess is quite good assuring to get
distance<00:06:13.150> on<00:06:13.360> them<00:06:13.570> but<00:06:14.280> yeah

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
distance on them but yeah

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.270 
distance on them but yeah

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.880 
that's the triangular one I'll just do
the<00:06:18.490> same<00:06:18.670> system<00:06:19.180> everything<00:06:19.810> said<00:06:20.110> there's

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
the same system everything said there's

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.970 
the same system everything said there's
six<00:06:21.190> these<00:06:21.820> down<00:06:22.090> here<00:06:22.120> are<00:06:22.510> the<00:06:23.350> six<00:06:23.560> bullet

00:06:57.679 --> 00:06:57.689 
so here we are we are outside so that's

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:01.700 
so here we are we are outside so that's
a<00:06:58.219> pull<00:06:59.219> the<00:06:59.369> plug<00:06:59.550> on<00:06:59.669> NASA<00:07:00.080> so<00:07:01.080> throw<00:07:01.559> the

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
a pull the plug on NASA so throw the

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.889 
a pull the plug on NASA so throw the
safety<00:07:02.009> pin<00:07:02.129> out<00:07:02.249> of<00:07:02.490> there<00:07:02.909> get<00:07:03.679> close<00:07:04.679> up<00:07:04.860> and

safety pin out of there get close up and

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:08.350 
safety pin out of there get close up and
let's<00:07:06.899> try<00:07:07.169> it

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360
