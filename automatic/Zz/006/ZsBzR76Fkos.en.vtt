00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.690
 primarily either theology 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.570
 that is all means that there is a 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.690
 less amount of tear in the eye already 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.120
 be for less quantity or lower quality 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.020
 in both cases the tear does not meet its 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.510
 function that is to keep hydrated all 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.030
 the ocular surface and protect it by 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.840
 both from external agents and even from 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.840
 same blink 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:39.289
 The causes of dry eyes are very 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.230
 most of the dry eye is 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:44.390
 produces simply by age and are 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.519
 most common women 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.530
 associated with the hormonal changes that 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.409
 we suffer and especially in age of 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.229
 menopause then there are many other causes 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.000
 of dry eye both diseases as 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:59.479
 they can be immunological or romat or 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.289
 logical the most common as processes 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:07.239
 secondary to trauma surgeries and 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.239
 other series of ocular pathology 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:14.159
 The treatments for dry eye are 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.770
 very varied and they will depend on 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.649
 the causes that we're generating 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.409
 pathology of the dry eye but common to 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.259
 all types of dry eye is going to be the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.689
 use of artificial tears that today 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.909
 in day there is a lot of variety with different 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.259
 components that we can choose according to 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.670
 type of dry eye that we are 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.979
 facing up 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.929
 if that alone is not enough, there will be 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.720
 employ another series of treatments like 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:42.720
 for example drugs that increase the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.330
 tear secretion and even 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.920
 devices that what they do is retain 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.890
 our own 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.929
 tear in the eye plugging the way 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.289
 tear or another series of 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.569
 more advanced procedures or a little 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.759
 more invasive such as blepharoplasty 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.829
 that help us rebuild the 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.479
 eyelid structure and keep the eye 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.479
 well much more hydrated
