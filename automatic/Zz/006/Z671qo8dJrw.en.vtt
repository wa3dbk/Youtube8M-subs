00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.690
 hello to all and all his friends 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.190
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.380
 new out of mac in the mission the 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.360
 depths of a far cry 3 so this is a 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.650
 main mission required for 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.140
 continue the game 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.480
 following the game so after killing 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.160
 komodo dragon and have come to this 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.430
 precise location 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.750
 you'll do a simple jam on seven 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.260
 on seven wooden boards glued against 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.110
 the wall high and a low price you 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.600
 go through the wall right and ben 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.520
 you came out of the map 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.670
 so that's one of the first 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:58.180
 automates of far cry 3 which is well 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.850
 nice so there is little to visit 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.310
 we're going to say in quotation marks but 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.620
 good it's still interesting realized 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.140
 so this mission to enlighten you a 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.360
 little is it is towards the fifth 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.150
 mission as I said to their severe 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.820
 the fifth main mission 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.420
 so that's when you go into 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.520
 in an island actually kill good damage 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.790
 we'll say it's pretty normal 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.670
 in far cry 3 but that's for when 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.070
 you enter the timing here so I 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.110
 can not enlighten you anymore because 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.920
 good there is a lot of mission of a 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.720
 father cry 3 and in addition we can not 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.600
 redo missions I think so good 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.300
 it's pretty annoying 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.040
 and if you miss the jump there on the 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.110
 wooden board you are obliged to 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:53.740
 start the whole mission again because 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.380
 because the check point and in fact we 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.869
 just right down there actually 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.850
 before after jumping 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.200
 so you can not go back in 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.340
 back and over mourn for the 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.320
 so I hope this video you in 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.090

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.350
