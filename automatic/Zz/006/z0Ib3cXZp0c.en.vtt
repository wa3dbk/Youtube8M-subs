lot<00:02:10.700> of<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.910> same<00:02:11.090> DNA<00:02:11.360> which<00:02:12.230> makes<00:02:12.500> it<00:02:12.650> a

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
lot of the same DNA which makes it a

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.009 
lot of the same DNA which makes it a
really<00:02:13.190> tough<00:02:13.400> call<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.849> decide<00:02:14.150> which<00:02:14.450> one<00:02:14.870> to

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
really tough call to decide which one to

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.100 
really tough call to decide which one to
get<00:02:15.940> after<00:02:16.940> having<00:02:17.090> thrown<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.420> leg<00:02:17.660> over<00:02:17.810> this

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
get after having thrown a leg over this

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.089 
get after having thrown a leg over this
it<00:02:18.290> feels<00:02:18.500> like<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.830> drz<00:02:19.340> 400<00:02:19.640> was<00:02:21.099> slightly

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
it feels like the drz 400 was slightly

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.530 
it feels like the drz 400 was slightly
lower<00:02:22.790> than<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.660> 650<00:02:24.760> again<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.940> light<00:02:26.209> bike

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
lower than the 650 again a light bike

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.900 
lower than the 650 again a light bike
which<00:02:27.019> makes<00:02:27.319> it<00:02:27.440> very<00:02:27.530> flickable<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.489> easy

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
which makes it very flickable and easy

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.120 
which makes it very flickable and easy
to<00:02:29.690> hold<00:02:30.230> upright<00:02:30.590> when<00:02:30.890> you're<00:02:31.010> at<00:02:31.100> a

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
to hold upright when you're at a

to hold upright when you're at a
stoplight<00:02:31.489> particularly<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:33.019> even<00:02:33.410> if

stoplight particularly and even if

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.940 
stoplight particularly and even if
you're<00:02:34.989> slightly<00:02:35.989> shorter<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.650> can't

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
you're slightly shorter and you can't

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.970 
you're slightly shorter and you can't
plant<00:02:37.459> both<00:02:37.640> of<00:02:37.819> your<00:02:37.940> feet<00:02:38.120> on<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:38.330> ground

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.270 

it's<00:03:19.260> so<00:03:19.500> light

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.540

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.480 
oh they resolve the so that cable I hate
where<00:03:30.020> the<00:03:30.110> cable<00:03:30.530> goes<00:03:30.650> across<00:03:30.950> this<00:03:31.220> video

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
where the cable goes across this video

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.370 
where the cable goes across this video
camera<00:03:31.700> yeah<00:03:32.740> the<00:03:33.740> kind<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:35.050> that's<00:03:36.050> a<00:03:36.170> break

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
camera yeah the kind of that's a break

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.020 
camera yeah the kind of that's a break
it<00:03:36.950> looks<00:03:37.160> like<00:03:37.220> it<00:03:37.340> goes<00:03:37.490> to<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:37.670> bra<00:03:37.850> that's

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
it looks like it goes to the bra that's

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.520 
it looks like it goes to the bra that's
the<00:03:38.180> exact<00:03:38.570> seller<00:03:38.810> or<00:03:38.960> brake<00:03:39.170> master

cylinder

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.320 

why<00:03:43.190> could<00:03:43.400> they<00:03:43.519> turn<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:43.819> down<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.120> have<00:03:44.209> it

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
why could they turn it down and have it

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.580 
why could they turn it down and have it
cross<00:03:44.540> over<00:03:44.569> here<00:03:44.989> that<00:03:45.110> doesn't<00:03:45.290> make<00:03:45.440> any

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
cross over here that doesn't make any

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.440 
cross over here that doesn't make any
sense<00:03:45.709> why<00:03:46.129> we<00:03:46.340> have<00:03:46.879> this<00:03:47.000> anyone<00:03:47.330> has

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
sense why we have this anyone has

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:58.290 
sense why we have this anyone has
laughing<00:03:47.900> in<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:48.140> wind

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.720 

let<00:03:58.540> us<00:03:58.630> ring<00:03:58.870> shout<00:03:59.140> out<00:03:59.380> got<00:04:00.340> it<00:04:00.490> underneath

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
let us ring shout out got it underneath

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.840 
let us ring shout out got it underneath
some<00:04:01.120> of<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.240> stuff<00:04:01.420> then<00:04:01.630> bend<00:04:02.020> it<00:04:02.170> down<00:04:02.200> I

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
some of the stuff then bend it down I

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:32.500 
some of the stuff then bend it down I
think<00:04:03.850> I<00:04:03.910> would<00:04:04.060> go<00:04:04.180> for<00:04:04.210> one<00:04:04.510> of<00:04:04.630> these

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.850 

one<00:04:33.510> of<00:04:33.600> the<00:04:33.690> things<00:04:33.840> that<00:04:33.960> really<00:04:34.200> concerns

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
one of the things that really concerns

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.160 
one of the things that really concerns
me<00:04:35.040> about<00:04:35.280> this<00:04:35.820> bike<00:04:36.090> was<00:04:36.390> whether<00:04:36.810> or<00:04:37.020> not

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
me about this bike was whether or not

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.930 
me about this bike was whether or not
the<00:04:37.350> top<00:04:37.590> speed<00:04:37.890> would<00:04:38.010> be<00:04:38.160> sufficient<00:04:40.940> which

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
the top speed would be sufficient which

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.720 
the top speed would be sufficient which
would<00:04:42.270> probably<00:04:43.070> incline<00:04:44.070> somebody<00:04:44.430> to<00:04:44.580> go

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
would probably incline somebody to go

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.600 
would probably incline somebody to go
more<00:04:45.270> towards<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:45.780> 650<00:04:46.440> however<00:04:46.830> I've<00:04:47.220> talked

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
more towards the 650 however I've talked

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.890 
more towards the 650 however I've talked
to<00:04:47.730> plenty<00:04:47.910> of<00:04:48.060> guys<00:04:48.240> and<00:04:48.450> they<00:04:48.510> said<00:04:48.780> this

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
to plenty of guys and they said this

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.930 
to plenty of guys and they said this

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.730 
something the only downside I would say
to<00:05:09.000> this<00:05:09.150> bike<00:05:09.390> is<00:05:09.420> that<00:05:09.750> it<00:05:09.840> has<00:05:09.990> a<00:05:10.020> two<00:05:10.350> and<00:05:10.650> a

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
to this bike is that it has a two and a

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.130 
to this bike is that it has a two and a
half<00:05:10.920> gallon<00:05:11.340> gas<00:05:11.700> tanker<00:05:12.240> I<00:05:12.420> think<00:05:12.930> it's<00:05:13.050> like

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
half gallon gas tanker I think it's like

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.360 
half gallon gas tanker I think it's like
around<00:05:13.410> 2.6<00:05:14.190> gallons<00:05:14.670> but<00:05:15.860> then<00:05:16.860> again<00:05:17.010> I

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
around 2.6 gallons but then again I

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.920 
around 2.6 gallons but then again I
guess<00:05:17.460> you're<00:05:17.760> getting<00:05:17.820> around<00:05:18.120> 60<00:05:18.540> miles<00:05:18.750> to

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
guess you're getting around 60 miles to

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.250 
guess you're getting around 60 miles to
the<00:05:19.050> gallon<00:05:19.220> so<00:05:20.220> what<00:05:20.340> do<00:05:20.400> you<00:05:20.490> want<00:05:20.700> I'll<00:05:21.480> take

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
the gallon so what do you want I'll take

00:05:22.260 --> 00:06:27.730 
the gallon so what do you want I'll take
one<00:05:22.530> DRC<00:05:23.070> to<00:05:23.340> go<00:05:23.490> please

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.800
