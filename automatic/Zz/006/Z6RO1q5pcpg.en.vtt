just<00:03:15.360> black<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.600> white<00:03:15.810> because<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:16.200> think

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
just black and white because I think

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.830 
just black and white because I think
it's<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.530> little<00:03:16.680> classier<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.420> you<00:03:18.420> know<00:03:18.570> it's

schism<00:03:37.980> of<00:03:38.070> light<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.400> have<00:03:38.580> said<00:03:38.820> this<00:03:38.940> in<00:03:39.090> the

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
schism of light I have said this in the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.850 
schism of light I have said this in the
time-lapse<00:03:39.540> video<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.230> in<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.680> gameplay

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
time-lapse video and in the gameplay

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.490 
time-lapse video and in the gameplay
video<00:03:41.340> this<00:03:42.060> is<00:03:42.120> very<00:03:42.540> heavily<00:03:43.050> inspired<00:03:43.230> by

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
video this is very heavily inspired by

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.470 
video this is very heavily inspired by
that<00:03:43.739> map<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.310> layout<00:03:44.700> is<00:03:44.910> somewhat<00:03:45.330> similar

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
that map the layout is somewhat similar

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.449 
that map the layout is somewhat similar
though<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.410> center<00:03:46.709> chamber<00:03:46.890> room<00:03:47.160> is<00:03:47.250> quite

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
though the center chamber room is quite

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.949 
though the center chamber room is quite
different<00:03:47.850> but<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.630> was<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.810> main

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
different but that was the main

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.750 
different but that was the main
inspiration<00:03:49.440> for<00:03:49.560> this<00:03:49.680> map<00:03:49.830> though<00:03:50.070> now<00:03:50.610> it

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
inspiration for this map though now it

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.280 
inspiration for this map though now it
is<00:03:50.820> a<00:03:50.880> Space<00:03:51.209> Station<00:03:51.600> rather<00:03:51.780> than<00:03:51.989> a<00:03:52.050> cave

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
is a Space Station rather than a cave

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.410 
is a Space Station rather than a cave
and<00:03:52.590> we've<00:03:53.280> got<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.400> table<00:03:53.820> here<00:03:54.060> with<00:03:54.239> more

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
and we've got a table here with more

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.000 
and we've got a table here with more
dominion<00:03:54.780> pieces<00:03:55.080> this<00:03:55.200> map<00:03:55.380> utilized<00:03:55.830> it's

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
dominion pieces this map utilized it's

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.220 
dominion pieces this map utilized it's
quite<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.160> bit<00:03:56.340> of<00:03:56.430> Dominion<00:03:56.790> pieces<00:03:57.150> just<00:03:58.110> to

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
quite a bit of Dominion pieces just to

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.229 
quite a bit of Dominion pieces just to
kind<00:03:59.010> of<00:03:59.040> add<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.190> that<00:03:59.370> Space<00:03:59.640> Station<00:04:00.030> feel

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
kind of add to that Space Station feel

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.570 
kind of add to that Space Station feel
and<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.930> white<00:04:01.230> impact<00:04:01.890> pieces<00:04:02.250> really<00:04:02.400> add

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
and the white impact pieces really add

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.580 
and the white impact pieces really add
to<00:04:02.730> this<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.690> centerpiece<00:04:04.110> of<00:04:04.140> this<00:04:04.320> room

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
to this and the centerpiece of this room

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.550 
to this and the centerpiece of this room
is<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:05.100> hologram<00:04:05.610> and<00:04:06.019> this<00:04:07.019> is<00:04:07.200> kind<00:04:07.380> of<00:04:07.500> a

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
is the hologram and this is kind of a

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.440 
is the hologram and this is kind of a
replacement<00:04:07.830> for<00:04:08.220> what<00:04:08.280> on<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.970> original<00:04:09.330> map

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
replacement for what on the original map

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.660 
replacement for what on the original map
was<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.750> big<00:04:10.260> rock<00:04:10.590> kind<00:04:11.100> of<00:04:11.220> there<00:04:11.370> but<00:04:11.550> instead

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
was a big rock kind of there but instead

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.580 
was a big rock kind of there but instead
I<00:04:11.790> used<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.090> hologram<00:04:12.510> because<00:04:13.019> again<00:04:13.200> want<00:04:13.530> to

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
I used a hologram because again want to

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.770 
I used a hologram because again want to
feed<00:04:13.739> into<00:04:13.920> that<00:04:14.010> theme<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:15.000> floor<00:04:15.300> is<00:04:15.600> kind

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
feed into that theme the floor is kind

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.390 
feed into that theme the floor is kind
of<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:15.989> glass<00:04:16.229> cover<00:04:16.530> here<00:04:16.830> with<00:04:16.919> lots<00:04:17.100> of<00:04:17.190> wires

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
of a glass cover here with lots of wires

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.950 
of a glass cover here with lots of wires
going<00:04:17.729> through<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:17.970> wanted<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:18.390> feel<00:04:18.630> like<00:04:18.660> this

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:18.960 
going through I wanted to feel like this

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.289 
going through I wanted to feel like this
thing<00:04:19.169> was<00:04:19.520> jury-rigged<00:04:20.520> and<00:04:20.789> all<00:04:20.880> hooked<00:04:21.150> up

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
thing was jury-rigged and all hooked up

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:21.890 
thing was jury-rigged and all hooked up
and<00:04:21.630> kind

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
and kind

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.010 
and kind
you<00:04:22.560> know<00:04:22.680> barely<00:04:23.280> being<00:04:23.460> maintained<00:04:24.030> this

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
you know barely being maintained this

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.240 
you know barely being maintained this
was<00:04:25.169> actually<00:04:25.440> pretty<00:04:25.560> difficult<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:26.100> do

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
was actually pretty difficult to do

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.680 
was actually pretty difficult to do
because<00:04:26.550> that<00:04:26.580> glass<00:04:26.940> cover<00:04:27.180> just<00:04:27.419> did<00:04:27.570> not

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
because that glass cover just did not

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.240 
because that glass cover just did not
want<00:04:27.870> to<00:04:27.900> cooperate<00:04:28.050> it<00:04:28.470> took<00:04:28.620> quite<00:04:28.800> a<00:04:28.919> bit<00:04:29.130> of

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
want to cooperate it took quite a bit of

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.920 
want to cooperate it took quite a bit of
time<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.580> get<00:04:29.699> this<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:29.970> line<00:04:30.150> up<00:04:30.300> properly<00:04:30.690> and

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
time to get this to line up properly and

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.810 
time to get this to line up properly and
even<00:04:31.590> then<00:04:31.740> there's<00:04:31.949> still<00:04:32.130> some<00:04:32.340> graphical

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
even then there's still some graphical

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.430 
even then there's still some graphical
issues<00:04:33.180> especially<00:04:33.479> over<00:04:33.960> here<00:04:34.110> I<00:04:34.139> had<00:04:34.350> to

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
issues especially over here I had to

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.740 
issues especially over here I had to
hide<00:04:34.650> it<00:04:34.800> with<00:04:35.009> some<00:04:35.820> extra<00:04:36.120> objects<00:04:36.570> and

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
hide it with some extra objects and

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.990 
hide it with some extra objects and
again<00:04:37.740> bringing<00:04:37.949> it<00:04:38.070> back<00:04:38.130> to<00:04:38.190> that<00:04:38.430> hologram

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
again bringing it back to that hologram

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.090 
again bringing it back to that hologram
there<00:04:39.419> is<00:04:39.570> a<00:04:39.600> kind<00:04:39.900> of<00:04:40.080> secondary<00:04:40.530> function<00:04:41.009> of

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
there is a kind of secondary function of

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.590 
there is a kind of secondary function of
the<00:04:41.160> hologram<00:04:41.580> as<00:04:41.729> you<00:04:41.820> can<00:04:41.910> see<00:04:42.060> when<00:04:42.570> a

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
the hologram as you can see when a

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.300 
the hologram as you can see when a
Spartan<00:04:43.020> peers<00:04:43.289> directly<00:04:43.740> into<00:04:43.919> it<00:04:44.039> it<00:04:44.160> kind

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
Spartan peers directly into it it kind

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.800 
Spartan peers directly into it it kind
of<00:04:44.340> dims<00:04:44.580> his<00:04:44.729> view<00:04:44.910> his<00:04:45.090> night<00:04:45.300> vision<00:04:45.330> gets

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
of dims his view his night vision gets

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.779 
of dims his view his night vision gets
screwed<00:04:46.139> up<00:04:46.320> so<00:04:46.830> it<00:04:47.250> makes<00:04:47.460> it<00:04:47.520> a<00:04:47.580> little<00:04:47.639> bit

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
screwed up so it makes it a little bit

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.520 
screwed up so it makes it a little bit
harder<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.120> see<00:04:48.240> so<00:04:48.600> even<00:04:48.840> though<00:04:48.990> back<00:04:49.289> here

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
harder to see so even though back here

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.749 
harder to see so even though back here
in<00:04:49.620> this<00:04:49.680> back<00:04:49.860> corner<00:04:49.889> is<00:04:50.340> one<00:04:50.490> of<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.639> most

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
in this back corner is one of the most

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.939 
in this back corner is one of the most
favorite<00:04:51.090> camping<00:04:51.419> spots<00:04:51.690> when<00:04:52.650> you<00:04:52.740> look

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
favorite camping spots when you look

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.290 
favorite camping spots when you look
down<00:04:53.070> into<00:04:53.280> the<00:04:53.370> center<00:04:53.669> room<00:04:53.850> you<00:04:54.000> get<00:04:54.120> kind

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
down into the center room you get kind

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.000 
down into the center room you get kind
of<00:04:54.389> blinded<00:04:54.810> and<00:04:54.930> your<00:04:55.080> visibility<00:04:55.380> is<00:04:55.710> kind

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
of blinded and your visibility is kind

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.409 
of blinded and your visibility is kind
of<00:04:56.070> ruined<00:04:56.430> so<00:04:56.850> there<00:04:57.000> is<00:04:57.090> a<00:04:57.120> kind<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.330> a

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
of ruined so there is a kind of a

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.480 
of ruined so there is a kind of a
trade-off<00:04:57.690> here<00:04:57.870> and<00:04:58.260> again<00:04:59.039> this<00:04:59.190> is<00:04:59.340> where

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
trade-off here and again this is where

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.070 
trade-off here and again this is where
the<00:04:59.520> floods<00:05:00.120> start<00:05:00.449> this<00:05:00.630> is<00:05:00.780> where<00:05:00.930> they

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
the floods start this is where they

again there's gonna be at least probably

again there's gonna be at least probably
five<00:05:11.550> to<00:05:11.729> six<00:05:11.940> people<00:05:12.060> running<00:05:12.479> up<00:05:12.600> here<00:05:12.840> to

five to six people running up here to

five to six people running up here to
try<00:05:13.199> to<00:05:13.229> hide<00:05:13.500> because<00:05:14.400> this<00:05:14.699> is<00:05:14.789> one<00:05:14.970> of<00:05:15.000> the

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
try to hide because this is one of the

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.240 
try to hide because this is one of the
more<00:05:15.240> defendable<00:05:15.690> locations<00:05:16.260> we<00:05:16.979> do<00:05:17.070> have<00:05:17.190> a

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
more defendable locations we do have a

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.439 
more defendable locations we do have a
side<00:05:17.550> vent<00:05:17.789> that<00:05:18.000> goes<00:05:18.090> up<00:05:18.210> here<00:05:18.240> it's<00:05:18.419> a

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
side vent that goes up here it's a

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:19.969 
side vent that goes up here it's a
little<00:05:18.510> more<00:05:18.630> narrow<00:05:18.840> and<00:05:19.199> I<00:05:19.530> think<00:05:19.740> see<00:05:19.830> it's

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
little more narrow and I think see it's

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.890 
little more narrow and I think see it's
blocked<00:05:20.220> up<00:05:20.400> by<00:05:20.430> a<00:05:20.550> pallet<00:05:21.000> so<00:05:21.479> once<00:05:21.780> that's

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
blocked up by a pallet so once that's

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.600 
blocked up by a pallet so once that's
broken<00:05:22.380> the<00:05:22.530> flood<00:05:22.740> can<00:05:22.889> jump<00:05:23.099> right<00:05:23.250> up<00:05:23.430> here

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
broken the flood can jump right up here

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.830 
broken the flood can jump right up here
so<00:05:23.759> if<00:05:23.820> you<00:05:23.880> have<00:05:24.000> a<00:05:24.030> guy<00:05:24.180> posted<00:05:24.599> right<00:05:24.660> here

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
so if you have a guy posted right here

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.439 
so if you have a guy posted right here
trying<00:05:25.110> to<00:05:25.169> shoot<00:05:25.650> down<00:05:25.800> on<00:05:25.949> flood<00:05:26.190> he'll<00:05:26.729> jump

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 
trying to shoot down on flood he'll jump

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.129 
trying to shoot down on flood he'll jump
right<00:05:27.660> up<00:05:27.720> and<00:05:28.050> get<00:05:28.830> killed<00:05:29.150> and<00:05:30.150> that<00:05:30.599> that<00:05:30.900> is

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
right up and get killed and that that is

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.110 
right up and get killed and that that is
not<00:05:31.440> probably<00:05:31.830> the<00:05:32.070> best<00:05:32.130> idea<00:05:32.610> though<00:05:32.789> flood

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
not probably the best idea though flood

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.339 
not probably the best idea though flood
could<00:05:33.270> probably<00:05:33.660> hop<00:05:33.840> up<00:05:33.990> here<00:05:34.169> especially

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
could probably hop up here especially

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.439 
could probably hop up here especially
with<00:05:34.680> some<00:05:34.830> help<00:05:35.070> from<00:05:35.130> his<00:05:35.370> buddies<00:05:35.669> or<00:05:35.849> using

with some help from his buddies or using

some of the objects within the
environment<00:05:37.740> and<00:05:38.190> I<00:05:39.120> don't<00:05:39.330> think<00:05:39.449> I

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
environment and I don't think I

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.850 
environment and I don't think I
mentioned<00:05:39.570> this<00:05:39.870> already<00:05:39.990> but<00:05:40.320> this<00:05:40.409> map<00:05:40.620> is

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
mentioned this already but this map is

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.860 
mentioned this already but this map is
geared<00:05:41.159> towards<00:05:41.460> smaller<00:05:41.760> lobbies<00:05:42.270> a<00:05:42.300> lot<00:05:42.720> of

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
geared towards smaller lobbies a lot of

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.500 
geared towards smaller lobbies a lot of
people<00:05:43.280> want<00:05:44.280> a<00:05:44.370> little<00:05:44.610> bit<00:05:44.789> smaller<00:05:45.060> Maps

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
people want a little bit smaller Maps

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.960 
people want a little bit smaller Maps
um<00:05:45.690> not<00:05:46.650> always<00:05:47.010> can<00:05:47.159> a<00:05:47.220> person<00:05:47.550> get<00:05:47.699> together

releasing that much more on the smaller

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.339 
releasing that much more on the smaller
side<00:05:56.520> kind<00:05:56.760> of<00:05:56.789> like<00:05:56.849> via<00:05:57.150> del<00:05:57.599> Muerto<00:05:57.990> that<00:05:58.320> I

one I think well what was the name I
gave<00:06:30.210> for<00:06:30.510> the<00:06:30.570> ship<00:06:30.779> it's<00:06:30.960> in<00:06:31.050> the<00:06:31.139> trailer<00:06:31.529> I

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
gave for the ship it's in the trailer I

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.790 
gave for the ship it's in the trailer I
called<00:06:32.099> it<00:06:32.250> the<00:06:32.340> UNSC<00:06:32.760> edge<00:06:33.029> of<00:06:33.210> the<00:06:33.330> abyss<00:06:33.599> and

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
called it the UNSC edge of the abyss and

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.950 
called it the UNSC edge of the abyss and
it's<00:06:34.919> been<00:06:35.069> overtaken<00:06:35.460> by<00:06:35.639> flood<00:06:36.000> and<00:06:36.270> here's

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
it's been overtaken by flood and here's

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.390 
it's been overtaken by flood and here's
another<00:06:37.199> kind<00:06:37.409> of<00:06:37.560> area<00:06:37.770> people<00:06:37.949> really<00:06:38.280> like

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
another kind of area people really like

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.260 
another kind of area people really like
to<00:06:38.430> hold<00:06:38.610> out<00:06:38.729> this<00:06:38.879> one's<00:06:39.000> a<00:06:39.030> little<00:06:39.090> bit

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
to hold out this one's a little bit

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.240 
to hold out this one's a little bit
tougher<00:06:39.569> because<00:06:39.720> the<00:06:39.870> doorways<00:06:40.740> are<00:06:40.919> larger

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
tougher because the doorways are larger

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.469 
tougher because the doorways are larger
but<00:06:41.580> at<00:06:41.699> the<00:06:41.789> same<00:06:41.909> time<00:06:42.090> it<00:06:42.270> gives<00:06:42.389> you<00:06:42.449> a

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 
but at the same time it gives you a

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:43.879 
but at the same time it gives you a
little<00:06:42.599> more<00:06:42.720> wiggle<00:06:42.960> room<00:06:43.110> and<00:06:43.500> place<00:06:43.680> to

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:43.889 
little more wiggle room and place to

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:46.159 
little more wiggle room and place to
move<00:06:44.069> and<00:06:44.520> try<00:06:44.699> to<00:06:44.729> dodge<00:06:45.000> them<00:06:45.240> so<00:06:45.720> we'll<00:06:46.110> have

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:46.169 
move and try to dodge them so we'll have

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:47.689 
move and try to dodge them so we'll have
some<00:06:46.349> humans<00:06:46.620> covering<00:06:46.919> that<00:06:47.039> hallway<00:06:47.310> or

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:47.699 
some humans covering that hallway or

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.550 
some humans covering that hallway or
that<00:06:47.909> hallway<00:06:48.180> or<00:06:48.690> jump<00:06:49.169> it<00:06:49.229> up<00:06:49.289> on<00:06:49.440> these

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
that hallway or jump it up on these

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.990 
that hallway or jump it up on these
pipes<00:06:49.740> and<00:06:49.949> just<00:06:50.129> trying<00:06:50.370> to<00:06:50.460> survive<00:06:50.759> now

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
pipes and just trying to survive now

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.460 
pipes and just trying to survive now
originally<00:06:51.210> the<00:06:51.539> back<00:06:51.720> wall<00:06:51.990> here<00:06:52.020> was<00:06:52.349> all

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
originally the back wall here was all

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.589 
originally the back wall here was all
glass<00:06:52.770> and<00:06:53.129> big<00:06:53.460> spinny<00:06:53.759> generator<00:06:54.270> things

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:54.599 
glass and big spinny generator things

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:57.110 
glass and big spinny generator things
that<00:06:55.470> ended<00:06:55.740> up<00:06:55.889> being<00:06:56.099> a<00:06:56.190> problem<00:06:56.400> visually

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
that ended up being a problem visually

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.580 
that ended up being a problem visually
and<00:06:57.270> it<00:06:57.389> just<00:06:57.539> kind<00:06:57.720> of<00:06:57.780> broke<00:06:57.930> the<00:06:58.139> map<00:06:58.319> so<00:06:58.560> I

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
and it just kind of broke the map so I

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.619 
and it just kind of broke the map so I
had<00:06:58.770> to<00:06:58.919> switch<00:06:59.460> that<00:06:59.639> back<00:06:59.759> out<00:06:59.909> and<00:07:00.419> now

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:00.629 
had to switch that back out and now

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:02.719 
had to switch that back out and now
we've<00:07:00.780> come<00:07:00.960> full<00:07:01.199> circle<00:07:01.400> this<00:07:02.400> is<00:07:02.550> pretty

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:02.729 
we've come full circle this is pretty

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:03.950 
we've come full circle this is pretty
much<00:07:02.849> the<00:07:03.000> entire<00:07:03.210> map<00:07:03.389> this<00:07:03.539> map<00:07:03.690> is<00:07:03.930> on

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 
much the entire map this map is on

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.570 
much the entire map this map is on
smaller<00:07:04.440> side<00:07:04.680> so<00:07:04.860> the<00:07:04.949> walkthrough<00:07:05.310> doesn't

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
smaller side so the walkthrough doesn't

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.430 
smaller side so the walkthrough doesn't
need<00:07:05.759> to<00:07:05.849> be<00:07:05.940> that<00:07:05.970> intensive<00:07:06.659> kind<00:07:07.319> of

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 
need to be that intensive kind of

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.170 
need to be that intensive kind of
showing<00:07:07.590> you<00:07:07.680> guys<00:07:07.740> the<00:07:07.919> whole<00:07:08.069> thing<00:07:08.280> there's

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
showing you guys the whole thing there's

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.110 
showing you guys the whole thing there's
only<00:07:09.479> a<00:07:09.659> few<00:07:10.259> main<00:07:11.069> pathways<00:07:11.699> a<00:07:11.729> few<00:07:12.000> main

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 
only a few main pathways a few main

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.240 
only a few main pathways a few main
hallways<00:07:12.539> and<00:07:12.750> some<00:07:12.900> back<00:07:13.050> areas<00:07:13.500> like<00:07:14.009> I<00:07:14.099> said

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.250 
hallways and some back areas like I said

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.920 
hallways and some back areas like I said
this<00:07:14.370> map<00:07:14.520> is<00:07:14.699> on<00:07:14.849> the<00:07:14.969> smaller<00:07:15.210> side<00:07:15.509> so<00:07:15.750> for

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
this map is on the smaller side so for

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:16.969 
this map is on the smaller side so for
those<00:07:16.020> of<00:07:16.110> you<00:07:16.199> that<00:07:16.289> have<00:07:16.500> a<00:07:16.530> tough<00:07:16.860> time

getting<00:07:17.190> lobbies<00:07:17.610> together<00:07:17.879> this<00:07:18.330> should<00:07:18.449> be

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 
getting lobbies together this should be

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:20.540 
getting lobbies together this should be
a<00:07:18.569> lot<00:07:18.719> more<00:07:18.750> fun<00:07:19.020> for<00:07:19.289> you<00:07:19.409> I<00:07:19.800> would<00:07:20.400> not

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:20.550 
a lot more fun for you I would not

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:21.950 
a lot more fun for you I would not
recommend<00:07:20.729> regular<00:07:21.090> flood<00:07:21.479> mode<00:07:21.690> I<00:07:21.750> would

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 
recommend regular flood mode I would

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.540 
recommend regular flood mode I would
definitely<00:07:22.379> recommend<00:07:22.440> downloading<00:07:22.830> alpha

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:23.550 
definitely recommend downloading alpha
