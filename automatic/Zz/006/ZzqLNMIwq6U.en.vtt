00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the garage and I cut to pieces and then

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.889 
the garage and I cut to pieces and then
of<00:00:59.160> course<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.609> had<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.789> test<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.660> put<00:01:00.690> it

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
of course I had to test it so I put it

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.360 
of course I had to test it so I put it
in<00:01:00.930> there<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.350> looked<00:01:01.649> how<00:01:01.800> tight<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.160> was<00:01:02.219> gonna

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
in there I looked how tight it was gonna

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.789 
in there I looked how tight it was gonna
be<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.850> decided<00:01:03.239> oh<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.650> be

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
be and I decided oh this is going to be

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.980 
be and I decided oh this is going to be
good<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:06.000> decided<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.479> put<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.900> them

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
good I then decided to put one of them

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.510 
good I then decided to put one of them
in<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.170> back<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.979> might<00:01:08.130> be<00:01:08.220> thinking

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
in the back and you might be thinking

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.429 
in the back and you might be thinking
why<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.090> zoomed<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.869> don't<00:01:10.260> see

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
why is it so zoomed in so you don't see

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.240 
why is it so zoomed in so you don't see
my<00:01:10.590> butt<00:01:10.920> crack

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
my butt crack

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.070 
my butt crack
after<00:01:11.760> attaching<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.240> mount<00:01:12.510> plate<00:01:12.750> which<00:01:12.960> is

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
after attaching the mount plate which is

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.990 
after attaching the mount plate which is
literally<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.500> four<00:01:13.950> screws<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.700> super

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
literally just four screws it's super

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.240 
literally just four screws it's super
easy<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.390> decided<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.960> put<00:01:16.200> my<00:01:16.350> monitor<00:01:16.830> up<00:01:16.979> just

easy I decided to put my monitor up just
to<00:01:17.369> see<00:01:17.580> how<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.150> would<00:01:18.360> look<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.049> gotta<00:01:19.229> say

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
to see how it would look and I gotta say

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.050 
to see how it would look and I gotta say
that<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.650> first<00:01:19.890> impressions<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:20.790> not<00:01:20.909> that

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
that the first impressions it's not that

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.670 
that the first impressions it's not that
bad<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.509> don't<00:01:21.750> know<00:01:21.840> if<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.020> mentioned<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.439> but

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
bad I don't know if I mentioned this but

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.320 
bad I don't know if I mentioned this but
you<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:22.860> also<00:01:22.979> adjust<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.460> height<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.119> so

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
you can also adjust the height of it so

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.030 
you can also adjust the height of it so
you<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.570> move<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.840> up<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.140> down<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.890> can

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
you can move it up and down and you can

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.429 
you can move it up and down and you can
also<00:01:26.220> adjust<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.939> angle<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.900> tilt<00:01:28.200> of

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
also adjust the angle and the tilt of

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.469 
also adjust the angle and the tilt of
the<00:01:28.560> screen<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.189> very<00:01:29.520> easy<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.939> get<00:01:30.299> it

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
the screen so it's very easy to get it

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.030 
the screen so it's very easy to get it
to<00:01:30.659> where<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:30.960> comfortable<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.860> I

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
to where it's comfortable for you I

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.770 
to where it's comfortable for you I
wanted<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.549> have<00:01:32.670> my<00:01:32.790> mother<00:01:32.939> side<00:01:33.329> by<00:01:33.479> side

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
wanted to have my mother side by side

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.270 
wanted to have my mother side by side
but<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.049> didn't<00:01:34.350> know<00:01:34.409> how<00:01:34.560> far<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.799> should<00:01:34.890> put

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
but I didn't know how far I should put

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.160 
but I didn't know how far I should put
these<00:01:35.400> screen<00:01:35.820> arms<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.570> took<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.960> tape

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
these screen arms so I took a tape

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.230 
these screen arms so I took a tape
measure<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.829> evolved<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.430> mathematical

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
measure and I evolved the mathematical

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.330 
measure and I evolved the mathematical
from<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.049> middle<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.590> mounting<00:01:41.040> plate<00:01:41.310> to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
from the middle of the mounting plate to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.249 
from the middle of the mounting plate to
the<00:01:41.520> side<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.850> my<00:01:41.970> monitor<00:01:42.360> was<00:01:42.509> 12<00:01:42.810> inches<00:01:43.200> so

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
the side of my monitor was 12 inches so

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.950 
the side of my monitor was 12 inches so
I<00:01:43.409> decided<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.890> put<00:01:44.159> these<00:01:44.399> screen<00:01:44.820> arms<00:01:45.240> 24

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
I decided to put these screen arms 24

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.630 
I decided to put these screen arms 24
inches<00:01:46.229> apart<00:01:46.560> from<00:01:46.710> each<00:01:46.860> other<00:01:46.950> then<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.579> took

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
inches apart from each other then I took

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.270 
inches apart from each other then I took
the<00:01:47.909> bag<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.299> screws<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.590> mounting<00:01:50.070> plate

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
the bag of screws and the mounting plate

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.679 
the bag of screws and the mounting plate
I<00:01:50.399> attached<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.939> plate<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.329> screws

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
I attached a plate in the screws

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.330 
I attached a plate in the screws
literally<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.380> four<00:01:52.619> screws<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.189> it's

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
literally just four screws so it's

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.249 
literally just four screws so it's
really<00:01:53.670> easy<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:54.060> then<00:01:54.299> tightened<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.960> screen

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
really easy I then tightened the screen

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.569 
really easy I then tightened the screen
arm<00:01:55.439> as<00:01:55.590> hard<00:01:55.920> as<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.130> could

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
arm as hard as I could

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.999 
arm as hard as I could
I<00:01:56.610> removed<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> monitors<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.780> end<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.530> attached

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
I removed the monitors to end I attached

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.370 
I removed the monitors to end I attached
a<00:01:59.189> monitor<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.729> screen<00:02:00.149> arm<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.719> then<00:02:01.110> was

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
a monitor to the screen arm and then was

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.929 
a monitor to the screen arm and then was
just<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.740> little<00:02:01.890> bit<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.189> adjusting<00:02:02.700> and

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
just a little bit of adjusting and

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.060 
just a little bit of adjusting and
figuring<00:02:03.450> out

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
figuring out

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.649 
figuring out
I'm<00:02:04.280> gonna<00:02:04.430> put<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.790> in<00:02:04.820> how<00:02:05.060> I'm<00:02:05.150> gonna<00:02:05.300> put<00:02:05.540> it

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
I'm gonna put it in how I'm gonna put it

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.960 
I'm gonna put it in how I'm gonna put it
so<00:02:05.810> this<00:02:05.930> is<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.140> first<00:02:06.440> test<00:02:06.860> and<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.580> reason

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
so this is the first test and the reason

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.760 
so this is the first test and the reason
why<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.149> monitors<00:02:08.660> are<00:02:08.929> tilting<00:02:09.350> so<00:02:09.530> easily

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
why the monitors are tilting so easily

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.560 
why the monitors are tilting so easily
it's<00:02:10.160> because<00:02:10.399> I<00:02:10.520> didn't<00:02:10.820> tighten<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.210> screws

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
it's because I didn't tighten the screws

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.300 
it's because I didn't tighten the screws
I'm<00:02:11.840> just<00:02:12.020> trying<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.290> get<00:02:12.410> a<00:02:12.440> feel<00:02:12.740> for<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:13.130> and

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
I'm just trying to get a feel for it and

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.530 
I'm just trying to get a feel for it and
trying<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.550> figure<00:02:13.730> out<00:02:13.940> what<00:02:14.150> angle<00:02:14.330> would

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
trying to figure out what angle would

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.180 
trying to figure out what angle would
work<00:02:14.870> for<00:02:15.080> me<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.620> first<00:02:15.800> thing<00:02:15.920> that<00:02:15.980> I<00:02:16.130> did

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
work for me the first thing that I did

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.670 
work for me the first thing that I did
is<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.760> lower<00:02:16.970> both<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.840> screen<00:02:18.200> arms<00:02:18.560> like

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
is to lower both of the screen arms like

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.020 
is to lower both of the screen arms like
I<00:02:18.709> said<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.010> can<00:02:19.130> adjust<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.550> height<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.880> it

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
I said you can adjust the height of it

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.030 
I said you can adjust the height of it
so<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:20.630> decided<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.320> I<00:02:21.440> want<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.650> lower<00:02:21.800> my

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
so I decided that I want to lower my

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.920 
so I decided that I want to lower my
then<00:02:22.400> put<00:02:22.610> them<00:02:22.700> side-by-side<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.510> adjusted

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
then put them side-by-side and adjusted

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.570 
then put them side-by-side and adjusted
the<00:02:24.050> tilt<00:02:24.320> on<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.620> monitors<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.010> be<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.370> same

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
the tilt on the monitors to be the same

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.280 
the tilt on the monitors to be the same
on<00:02:25.760> both<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:26.330> was<00:02:26.390> actually<00:02:26.750> pretty<00:02:26.930> good<00:02:27.020> it

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
on both it was actually pretty good it

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.570 
on both it was actually pretty good it
was<00:02:27.380> very<00:02:27.620> close<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:27.860> what<00:02:28.100> I<00:02:28.130> had<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.459> before

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
was very close to what I had it before

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.880 
was very close to what I had it before
with<00:02:29.240> just<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.630> monitor<00:02:29.990> stand<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.620> main

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
with just the monitor stand the main

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.530 
with just the monitor stand the main
reason<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.280> got<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.550> monitor<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:32.030> are<00:02:32.209> me<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:32.510> I

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
reason I got the monitor is are me so I

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.900 
reason I got the monitor is are me so I
can<00:02:32.750> push<00:02:32.990> my<00:02:33.170> monitors<00:02:33.680> back<00:02:34.070> and<00:02:34.520> have<00:02:34.730> my

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
can push my monitors back and have my

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.729 
can push my monitors back and have my
keyboard<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.510> mouse<00:02:35.600> on<00:02:35.900> top<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.410> my<00:02:36.500> desk

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
keyboard and mouse on top of my desk

desk and the monitors are suspended the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.949 
desk and the monitors are suspended the
reason<00:02:52.670> why<00:02:52.760> I<00:02:52.790> had<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.150> get<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.420> monitor<00:02:53.630> arm

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
is because I didn't have enough room and

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.660 
is because I didn't have enough room and
