00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.160
 people today so I'll give you one 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.230
 there is not much to the picture format 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:16.080
 yes, portrait format and then that 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:18.960
 landscape format yes what image format take 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.359
 I'm looking for something across or upright 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.250
 it depends a bit on what 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.990
 you want to photograph is sometimes 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.490
 it even the motive before 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.320
 sometimes you can also be free 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.570
 and moving and beyond the borders 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.130
 go 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.270
 I'll tell you something today 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.460
 difference or what the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.710
 application areas for the landscape format 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.200
 and for portraiture it is 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.180
 Landscape is very popular for it 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.850
 comes the human perception 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.500
 keep close our eyes line too 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.460
 so next to each other and not necessarily 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.039
 one above the other 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.289
 so I 'll do it too and also 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.649
 TV and movies are indeed in the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.079
 therefore, it is ours 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.969
 We are very familiar and we will take it 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.559
 even so was and is different formats 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.809
 Therefore , a certain security for 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.210
 Eye for the whole picture effect 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.700
 even horizontal lines or 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.770
 Horizons will be just fine 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.170
 supported in English is called im 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.979
 landscape landscape there are also 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.869
 already the photographer style so 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.000
 a bit before then just for 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.430
 Scenery or even animals in 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.780
 free nature often becomes that 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.330
 landscape format used 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.950
 yes and there we know the landscape format too 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.040
 occurs through film and tv and we 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.140
 so well know it in our perception 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.659
 ray to landscape always synonymous 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.930
 bit of rest and stability and 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.700
 acts very harmoniously on us then 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.329
 is there still the portrait format that 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.280
 portrait format is not just for you 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.560
 What in English portrait hot but 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.100
 also offers for what 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.369
 portrait photography 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.259
 because man is he does not direct left 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.340
 built as somehow across and you come 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.810
 you just get the better one 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.520
 bildausschnitt out but also in the 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.439
 For example, photography can be found in the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.320
 portrait your photos 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.380
 because of tall buildings for example for 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.420
 streets the 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.030
 go far back the long streets 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.520
 you can do that well with simple that 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.020
 hochformat order is therefore in favor because in 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.750
 to bring some tension into the picture 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.240
 Creating a dynamic is less 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.730
 Quiet landscape we have this 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.410
 familiarity the calm and stability into 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.390
 bild bei hochformat it is 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.580
 exactly the contrary, it is always such a 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.080
 bit to tip in just as drifting 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.700
 photography when the falling lines 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.560
 still to come take a lot of pictures 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.660
 High format offers it is on offers it 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.350
 a battery grip itself 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.660
 to purchase 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.820
 because of the design is the camera he 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.280
 designed for landscape and the 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.370
 Battery grip comes down there 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.410
 one stop the possibility the camera 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.720
 1990 degree angle to turn and then 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.730
 really focused and with calmer 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.710
 Hand the right one or the right one 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.960
 to choose a picture section so one 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.080
 worthwhile purchase for people who 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.160
 more in portrait and landscape format 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.720
 You will be able to take pictures later 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.180
 the use of the picture yet 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.530
 I'm sure I 'd rather be in cross-country 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.570
 or portrait format 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.100
 So you just photographed both you 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.260
 then always looks for the picture 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.000
 makes out with the respective motive 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.980
 once a portrait in landscape format 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.070
 of it and can then still at the computer 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.390
 decide where what works just better 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.790
 clearly one can also a landscape format for 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.200
 vertical format cut on the computer with the 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.550
 software with the 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.010
 image editing program or in the 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.690
 make portrait format landscape 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.390
 But you always have a lot 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.270
 has abducted and loss and lost to 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.280
 a few megapixels, so one is 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.480
 not sure once in the morning 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.880
 portrait format a landscape format 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.220
 take pictures and can stop later 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.610
 Simply decide because relaxed 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.890
 it yes which picture the better 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.870
 picture effect has just take it 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.820
 the time and photographed for a day 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.130
 only in portrait format and the other day 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.140
 only in landscape format no matter what motive 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.490
 even if it's a classic now 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.410
 Portrait format is what makes you 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.300
 Landscape out or the other way 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.860
 you can see and learn as well 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.140
 much more the formats and the 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.730
