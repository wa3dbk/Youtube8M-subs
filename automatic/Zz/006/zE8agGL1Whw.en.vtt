00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.930 

everyone<00:00:11.160> today<00:00:11.429> I'm<00:00:11.490> gonna<00:00:11.580> show<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:11.820> how

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
everyone today I'm gonna show you how

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.079 
everyone today I'm gonna show you how
you<00:00:12.000> can<00:00:12.150> enable<00:00:12.540> high<00:00:12.960> DPI<00:00:13.889> display<00:00:14.519> modes<00:00:14.790> in

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
you can enable high DPI display modes in

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.810 
you can enable high DPI display modes in
Mac<00:00:15.690> OS<00:00:15.929> 10<00:00:15.960> live<00:00:16.379> now<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.460> something

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
Mac OS 10 live now this is something

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.390 
Mac OS 10 live now this is something
similar<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.240> how<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.170> iPhone<00:00:19.800> uses<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
similar to how the iPhone uses the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.609 
similar to how the iPhone uses the
retina<00:00:20.699> display<00:00:20.960> with<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.140> doubled

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
retina display with the doubled

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.800 
retina display with the doubled
resolution<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:24.090> basically<00:00:24.449> there's<00:00:24.720> this

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
resolution so basically there's this

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.230 
resolution so basically there's this
option<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.830> tweak<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.580> once

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
option that you have to tweak and once

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.929 
option that you have to tweak and once
you<00:00:27.420> do<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.630> you'll<00:00:28.349> be<00:00:28.529> able<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.890> use<00:00:29.189> high

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
you do that you'll be able to use high

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.740 
you do that you'll be able to use high
DPI<00:00:30.480> display<00:00:31.470> modes<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.920> line<00:00:32.360> now<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.510> course

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
DPI display modes in line now of course

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.600 
DPI display modes in line now of course
at<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.020> point<00:00:34.140> since<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:34.860> don't<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.130> Retina

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
at this point since we don't have Retina

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.060 
at this point since we don't have Retina
display<00:00:35.940> Macs<00:00:36.210> everything<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.410> twice<00:00:37.890> as

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
display Macs everything is twice as

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.100 
display Macs everything is twice as
large<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> screen<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:39.899> not<00:00:39.989> exactly

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
large on the screen so it's not exactly

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.590 
large on the screen so it's not exactly
a<00:00:40.530> very<00:00:40.739> practical<00:00:41.010> thing<00:00:41.309> at<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.670> point<00:00:41.879> but

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
a very practical thing at this point but

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.760 
a very practical thing at this point but
it's<00:00:42.750> really<00:00:42.870> something<00:00:43.140> need<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.530> try

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
it's really something need to try

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.830 
it's really something need to try
because<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.850> kind<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.120> neat<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.539> see<00:00:45.570> what

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
because it is kind of neat to see what

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.990 
because it is kind of neat to see what
Apple<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.200> doing<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.219> way<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.550> making

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
Apple is doing in the way of making

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.160 
Apple is doing in the way of making
Retina<00:00:48.360> display<00:00:48.600> Macs

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
Retina display Macs

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.810 
Retina display Macs
so<00:00:49.710> don't<00:00:49.890> expect<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.370> get<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.550> lot<00:00:50.700> of

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
so don't expect to get a lot of

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.180 
so don't expect to get a lot of
functionality<00:00:51.270> out<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.920> this<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.010> more

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
functionality out of this this is more

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.590 
functionality out of this this is more
of<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.489> neat<00:00:53.640> little<00:00:53.760> tweak<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.239> can<00:00:54.390> try

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
of just a neat little tweak you can try

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.660 
of just a neat little tweak you can try
out<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> first<00:00:56.129> thing<00:00:56.250> we're<00:00:56.370> going<00:00:56.550> to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
out so the first thing we're going to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.569 
out so the first thing we're going to
need<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.120> Xcode<00:00:58.050> from<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.680> Mac<00:00:58.890> App<00:00:59.100> Store<00:00:59.129> so

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
need is Xcode from the Mac App Store so

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.250 
need is Xcode from the Mac App Store so
if<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.730> go<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.940> your<00:01:00.120> Apple<00:01:00.510> logo<00:01:00.570> menu<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
if you go to your Apple logo menu and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.340 
if you go to your Apple logo menu and
select<00:01:02.129> App<00:01:02.340> Store<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.850> want<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.870> go<00:01:03.989> over<00:01:04.170> to

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
select App Store you want to go over to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.700 
select App Store you want to go over to
the<00:01:04.530> search<00:01:04.860> field<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.309> type<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.409> Xcode<00:01:07.409> and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
the search field and type in Xcode and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.010 
the search field and type in Xcode and
you<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:08.010> see<00:01:08.189> Xcode<00:01:08.700> right<00:01:08.939> here<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.869> can

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
you can see Xcode right here and I can

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.140 
you can see Xcode right here and I can
select<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.439> now<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.250> free<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> Mac

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
select this now it is free in the Mac

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.630 
select this now it is free in the Mac
App<00:01:12.360> Store<00:01:12.450> but<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.799> biggest<00:01:14.040> problem<00:01:14.250> is

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
App Store but the biggest problem is

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.600 
App Store but the biggest problem is
that<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.290> point<00:01:16.530> six<00:01:16.799> eight<00:01:17.040> gigabytes

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
that it is one point six eight gigabytes

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.880 
that it is one point six eight gigabytes
so<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.689> not<00:01:19.170> something<00:01:19.470> you're<00:01:19.560> going<00:01:19.740> to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
so it's not something you're going to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.490 
so it's not something you're going to
really<00:01:20.070> want<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.759> download<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.509> expect<00:01:22.470> to

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
really want to download and expect to

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.140 
really want to download and expect to
have<00:01:22.710> finished<00:01:23.009> if<00:01:23.280> you're<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> solo

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
have finished if you're on a solo

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.539 
have finished if you're on a solo
wireless<00:01:24.659> network<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:26.220> if<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.400> have<00:01:26.490> a

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
wireless network and if you have a

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.490 
wireless network and if you have a
limited<00:01:26.670> data<00:01:27.030> connection<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:28.259> just

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
limited data connection it's just

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.690 
limited data connection it's just
something<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.770> want<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:28.979> think<00:01:29.189> about<00:01:29.400> before

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
something you want to think about before

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.550 
something you want to think about before
you<00:01:30.060> go<00:01:30.270> through<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.170> trouble<00:01:31.500> of

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
you go through the trouble of

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.649 
you go through the trouble of
downloading<00:01:32.070> Xcode<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.299> once<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.540> download

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
downloading Xcode so once you download

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.109 
downloading Xcode so once you download
Xcode<00:01:34.170> you'll<00:01:34.829> be<00:01:34.920> given<00:01:35.130> an<00:01:35.220> installer<00:01:35.700> and

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
Xcode you'll be given an installer and

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.660 
Xcode you'll be given an installer and
you'll<00:01:36.780> be<00:01:36.840> able<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.079> install<00:01:37.320> Xcode<00:01:37.770> that's<00:01:38.549> a

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
you'll be able to install Xcode that's a

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.490 
you'll be able to install Xcode that's a
process<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.240> I've<00:01:39.360> already<00:01:39.540> done<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:40.350> does

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
process that I've already done it does

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.810 
process that I've already done it does
take<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> little<00:01:40.890> bit<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.100> time<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.579> it's

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
take a little bit of time and it's

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.850 
take a little bit of time and it's
pretty<00:01:41.970> self-explanatory<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:43.049> something<00:01:43.770> I

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
pretty self-explanatory so something I

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.609 
pretty self-explanatory so something I
really<00:01:44.100> need<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.280> cover<00:01:44.579> here<00:01:44.990> so<00:01:45.990> after<00:01:46.229> Xcode

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
really need to cover here so after Xcode

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.620 
really need to cover here so after Xcode
installed<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.340> open<00:01:47.729> up<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.970> new<00:01:48.390> Finder

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
installed you can open up a new Finder

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.200 
installed you can open up a new Finder
window<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.380> from<00:01:49.590> there<00:01:49.799> go<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.009> Macintosh<00:01:50.820> HD

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
window and from there go to Macintosh HD

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
you can see here is in addition to the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.420 
you can see here is in addition to the
normal<00:03:04.359> displays<00:03:04.930> I<00:03:05.260> have<00:03:05.799> a<00:03:05.829> couple

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
normal displays I have a couple

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.119 
normal displays I have a couple
different<00:03:06.519> high<00:03:07.060> DPI<00:03:07.599> modes<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.799> can<00:03:08.950> see

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
different high DPI modes and you can see

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.610 
different high DPI modes and you can see
it's<00:03:09.430> in<00:03:09.549> parentheses<00:03:10.060> right<00:03:10.299> afterwards<00:03:10.810> so

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
it's in parentheses right afterwards so

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.819 
it's in parentheses right afterwards so
let's<00:03:12.010> try<00:03:12.609> something<00:03:13.150> like<00:03:13.480> 1280<00:03:14.260> by<00:03:14.470> 720

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
let's try something like 1280 by 720

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:20.580 
let's try something like 1280 by 720
high<00:03:15.430> DPI<00:03:18.329> so<00:03:19.329> you<00:03:19.419> can<00:03:19.569> see<00:03:19.720> here<00:03:19.900> now<00:03:20.049> this<00:03:20.319> is

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
high DPI so you can see here now this is

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.780 
high DPI so you can see here now this is
the<00:03:20.829> 1280<00:03:21.430> by<00:03:21.609> 720<00:03:21.970> high<00:03:22.690> DPI<00:03:23.260> mode<00:03:23.669> running<00:03:24.669> on

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
the 1280 by 720 high DPI mode running on

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.640 
the 1280 by 720 high DPI mode running on
my<00:03:24.970> iMac<00:03:25.329> here<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:26.260> can<00:03:26.410> see<00:03:26.530> that

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
my iMac here and you can see that

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.059 
my iMac here and you can see that
everything<00:03:27.010> looks<00:03:27.819> a<00:03:28.030> lot<00:03:28.209> clearer<00:03:28.799> it<00:03:29.799> just

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
everything looks a lot clearer it just

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.300 
everything looks a lot clearer it just
overall<00:03:30.700> looks<00:03:30.940> nicer<00:03:31.389> and<00:03:32.160> everything<00:03:33.160> is

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
overall looks nicer and everything is

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.819 
overall looks nicer and everything is
very<00:03:33.760> high<00:03:33.940> resolution<00:03:34.599> so<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:35.590> can<00:03:35.680> imagine

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
very high resolution so you can imagine

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.470 
very high resolution so you can imagine
a<00:03:36.040> Mac<00:03:36.190> with<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.400> double<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.910> resolution<00:03:37.060> of

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
a Mac with a double the resolution of

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.870 
a Mac with a double the resolution of
this<00:03:37.599> everything<00:03:38.230> would<00:03:38.650> display<00:03:39.069> at<00:03:39.370> the

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
this everything would display at the

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.970 
this everything would display at the
normal<00:03:40.180> size<00:03:40.359> as<00:03:40.690> you<00:03:40.870> would<00:03:41.019> see<00:03:41.500> on<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.709> Mac
