00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:10.400
 Yes I will introduce you to this video i 'm a Wildcat 2 Eyes Camera 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:14.690
 It is a stabilizer for videos used in 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:20.360
 It is camera shake by what is the weakest in the sound single-lens reflex video 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:22.220
 Quite when or taken while walking Again those are with the camera shake correction function to the lens 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.510
 Shakes loose 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:33.290
 I have been thinking that I want a stabilizer to avoid it 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:35.239
 In this year's cp + video, there is something that introduces this and it's very released 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:40.970
 I was looking forward 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:44.920
 It was released, but it was a popular product that sold out soon if there were few products. 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:48.480
 Finally I got it too 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.510
 Oh this content instruction manual 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.190
 It has also entered after sticker 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.840
 And here it will be the body in such a feeling 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:03.060
 I'm getting a waist pouch with this feeling I'm glad I got it now 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.900
 And in this magazine 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.400
 I have entered 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:12.670
 Heavy it as with a fine first impression 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.290
 It's heavy , isn't it on this ? 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.220
 Inside the rod is wii or something 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.770
 It seems to be carbon 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:27.540
 By the way this West porch is fine 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.550
 There are many places to put in, it is practical 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.729
 The side also has a sponsored pocket inside 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:39.159
 Now let's take a look here Wildcat 2 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:44.770
 When using it first , release the capital stopper and spread the weight 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:49.149
 And 9 What probably Kyushu I want to try to welcome or the length of the rod 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:53.109
 It would be fine if you put the camera on top and use it like this 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:55.460
 The hand part with this is pretty smooth 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:59.619
 Move slowly 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.619
 Feelings will move smoothly as good here 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:08.110
 And here it is this lever 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:10.000
 The angle of the part of the 1st can be changed by twisting 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.060
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.670
 The angle can be changed 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.520
 Where good 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:23.770
 It feels like you're going to hold it this way 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.060
 It's a plate now to attach it to the camera It's a plate on the bottom of the camera first 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.370
 Turn on 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:35.260
 And this is here 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:37.170
 It is feeling of rain com It fits in properly and stops with this and 6 It is this fat that will stop 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:42.900
 On the other side 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:45.569
 And Tari even in this before and after each other there is one part and here also lever is in this 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.720
 Adjust the position of the left or right 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:56.569
 According to the balance of the camera It just fit to come to a good center of gravity 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:03:00.069
 By the way, here is the table tripod with this effect open 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.380
 Can also be used as a Vienna tripod 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.620
 Tei was 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.190
 You can put it on a table or something like this, and you can do this shooting. 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:12.930
 This is quite useful, but it can also be used as a stabilizer. 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:16.090
 The weight part of the library that can be used as a number of mini tripods 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.120
 The weight part has become 3 stages 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.599
 It comes off each other like this 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:28.180
 And in this kind of feeling that this and the times also differentiate 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:29.110
 Well pretty It is I feel it 's to adjust the above it is in accordance with the depending on the weight of the camera this 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.450
 Ne 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:36.080
 Fine with only a reduced one-way head only was gills for example, one actual weight of the middle of the cat 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.010
 I'll be there 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:44.000
 It is such feeling that actually attached the camera 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:47.290
 After all , it is quite heavy with the camera 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:54.060
 Arm will continue to purpuric and have a long period of time 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:54.060
 So here is the picture I actually took, so please take a look there 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.190
 Hmm 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:44.610
 How was it? 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:49.740
 After all I thought that I needed a lot of practice in the beginning 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:51.719
 This is different from the normal shaking of the camera, but it looks like it really flies 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.950
 It becomes such a video 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:57.660
 It is only with practice, and especially according to 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.380
 4 Ranker Rekon' 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:05.430
 When the shutter speed is slow, it becomes very difficult to see the play chart 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.440
 I think that I wonder very nice to say so as to take smoothly such Fu Nde Chau 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.740
 Was 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:14.240
 When you take to do but it is the camera I strap annoying 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:18.640
 The stabilizer for the video had tried to buy time by say 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.640
 Yes was the Wildcat 2 footage
