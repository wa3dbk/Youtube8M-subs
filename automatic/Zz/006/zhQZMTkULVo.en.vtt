the throttle on the 186 I have had to

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.710 
the throttle on the 186 I have had to
look<00:02:21.280> over<00:02:21.520> a<00:02:21.580> couple<00:02:21.730> times<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.210> find<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.630> I

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
look over a couple times to find it I

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.330 
look over a couple times to find it I
would<00:02:22.870> like<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.500> be<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.680> little<00:02:23.890> bit<00:02:24.100> lower

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340
