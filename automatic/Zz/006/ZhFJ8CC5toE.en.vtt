00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.150
 then this now before showing them 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.700
 how can we make this grill 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.189
 and to make the grill what we're going to 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.140
 use will be to stone brick 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.660
 this or this one too if you want to use 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.220
 iron block does not matter that and then 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.320
 I will also use the block 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.699
 underworld and we're also going to grab the 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.699
 is the flint error 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.600
 and the last will be what is is 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.250
 here is the chapel 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:45.730
 although what we are going to do we are going to 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:48.050
 put 1 2 3 4 and then 1 2 and 1 2 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.040
 and we are going to 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.040
 close like this 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.270
 ok now and let's put here we are going to 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.470
 dig as you want says two blocks 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.780
 down 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.680
 and then I will place what is the 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.680
 Underworld block 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.480
 and I'm going to learn it 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.910
 now the trapdoors to go here 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.910
 and others here 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.490
 well, although that's not why I'm missing a 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.220
 down 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.010
 there will be four in total and 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.930
 we close like that will be so that when 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.350
 you put your food leave that 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.350
 I show 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.740
 Once upon a time they can also open 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.189
 here to make you are a little 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.189
 easier 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.080
 and we do not close them 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.900
 who is being touched the chicken that 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.640
 I keep falling 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.630
 oh my god I can not love 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.630
 although the song 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.850
 there is 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.359
 ok so your chickens are made and so if 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.609
 they fall down there does not matter 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.749
 because there is a trapdoor that protects 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:25.879
 not so that it does not fall is also 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:25.879
 number down and are the roasted chickens
