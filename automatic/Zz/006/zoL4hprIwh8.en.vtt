00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.390
 I do not know anyone think it is not interesting 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.430
 although you can write in the comments 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.430
 interesting to you was the archetype of antutu and 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.880
 all this will not show how it works 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.150
 it works quite smoothly principle 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.830

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:12.610
 android 4 1 1 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.860
 This is a Chinese copy of the phone which 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.800
 Sold in Russia I do not remember it 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.500
 name meaning you can order here 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.750
 for 70 dollars a phone which is in Russia 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.650
 stand order can say even in two 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.780
 times the principle of years at the end 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.650
 the video will be examples of games principle 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.130

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.390

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.299
 requirements ok here trigger 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.430
 2 there are some problems principle 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.910
 stayed for all i need 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.620
 twitter client browser 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.330
 as here near the tank list the world and 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.610
 it looks like this will also be able to 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.450
 the end of the video see basically here 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.150
 so and even 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.500
 podlagivaet when shooting 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.250
 4 as well as for these 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:09.680
 four do not know then the home search button 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:12.600
 since the days of android 2 3 this is not necessary 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.260
 The status bar looks like a notification here . 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.730
 that is, it looks like this 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.350
 principle, too, not bad heaps just on 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.350
 through the custom firmware fund 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.080
 what else to wear about this battery case 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.360
 keeps the order of one day it shows 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.920
 who as I think for android is very 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:37.860
 not bad even now you probably will 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.990
 examples of games and further already an example of a photo 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.300
 video my opinion of the phone now I tell you 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.300
 I will say and liked for this money 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.720
 and glory is all good 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.270
 good creations rst and games by the way fifty 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.290
 matrix viewing angle unfortunately not 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:59.040
 ideally everywhere at such angles in theta 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:02.300
 at such angles , everyone is good enough 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.520
 local dead angle day at this here such 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.190
 I will not say the same good phone 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.700
 I think I should take it as much as possible 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.820
 the main well, it will be nice as 2 2 SIM cards 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.140
 and all that well, then there will be an example video 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:21.290
 here is an example of the game and an example video 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.820
 subscribe to the channel all bye 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.090
 here so here goes to the server not 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.570
 lag nothing can be easy 10 and 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.570
 even need 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.060
 with sound also no problem by the way 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.910
 as for the speaker the speaker is enough 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:45.330
 titel forgot the project as in the review 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.690
 there is a speaker here is not a bad microphone 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.110
 also very much passed one let's 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.730
 look at real racing 3 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.560
 here so here goes real racing 3 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:59.810
 Pinsk and does not slow down at minimum 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:05.340
 There are no graphics on mirrors 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:08.090
 Well, in principle, you can play 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:12.120
 minor problems with sound optimization 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.670
 demand regret well let's go now 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.580
 look at the second d-trigger 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:20.100
 but for the trigger unfortunately not so 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:24.030

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.470
 cleaned he abruptly goes back 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:38.880
 here again it was a play sorry 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:41.160

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:06.259
 Fox is not like this 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:10.800
 March type sledges 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:15.300
