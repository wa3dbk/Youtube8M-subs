00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:04.120
 for that reason and although I say to you coÃ­n 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.370
 the face of a skull 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.370
 well let's start healing the wounds 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.819
 an adhesive pencil 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:16.489
 we are going to apply a coffee shade of the perle ceiling in uruguay where the palette 

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:19.429
 of question 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:21.909
 the mobile eyelid 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:25.329
 as far as I know without the sinking of the same luxury in the bottom 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.630
 with the same shadow they make 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.630
 let's go marking 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.100
 the area where we have it deep and the Celts 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.470
 a sketch of an ultra k the law 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.780
 that's the area where the teeth are going 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.760
 We are reigning the areas where I love you deep 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.000
 with a black shadow but emphasizes the depth 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.030
 let's apply to him what we did in coffee 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.580
 and so we are going well marking all the area 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.900
 how are we going to make a skull with our mouths open 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.680
 when filling with shadow on the lower lip 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.659
 let's draw the teeth with brown shadow first 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.750
 making parallel lines 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.480
 which are perpendicular to the central axis where it is in the mouth 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.060
 since we have all the teeth in cacÃ©m 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.060
 we are going to remark with black shadow 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.100
 once this is done 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.600
 with white paint leave it wen let's go to poland every one of the teeth 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.150
 with a small brush 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:30.419
 moto2 with the shadow cocem let's draw the hole where the 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.419
 nose 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.759
 since we have it in castellÃ³n 

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:41.759
 we dig deeper with the black 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:52.349
 we are going to use white paint is that they have couple louis 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.119
 and we will apply it in the whole area where we do not draw 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.709
 and as we had already applied the adhesive tape 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.089
 In the eyebrow 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:06.579
 forgive the piece of zibo is going to be well covered with white paint 

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:20.809
 we apply well in all drawing free areas 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:29.349
 lob 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.119
 in the areas where it needs to be more detailed we are going to use another one is 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:36.949
 the brush white the thin brush 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:39.949
 but reach all the difficult areas 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:47.099
 I'm going to use a black track to highlight the part 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.479
 of the lower bird 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:58.069
 and with a liquid black eyeliner 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.069
 let's make a break our crane 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.209
 we make the drawing of the area that we want to go rotate 

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:17.219
 and then we can fill it with either the peking nest 

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:21.059
 when the best in gel or with a black shadow 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:41.779
 and so they remain 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:44.520
 our skull face 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.229
 and that's it
