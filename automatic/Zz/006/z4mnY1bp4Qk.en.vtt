00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.020
 I am 12 today I would like to show mine 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.400
 rocket kits that took from one 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.269
 crank 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.560
 Generally when he was a little collected 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:21.210
 vega and it was in ninety-fourth by 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:23.910
 2006 and now I took a set 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.800
 in fact, more precisely, well, yes, I them 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.619
 restored I took the parts for them a 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.529
 then restored such a set did 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.309
 true hands to him this robot from the series 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:39.079
 spa miss I changed it drove him a Komi gun 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:44.219
 the figure sits there in general such a robot 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:46.980
 further took such a melting foot so 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.809
 there are a lot of details that also took 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:59.420
 make coitus uptime 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:01:02.760
 and this is supposedly, I'm really condemning it therefore 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.680
 interesting further here is such a detail to take 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.350
 I by the way do not know why I need it 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.890
 I know that it was not from a set and 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.100
 of 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.560
 used to be such as mini typesetters with 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.200
 six mini figures there was just 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.119
 here is this dude acts and he is like this 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.710
 pressed him so done 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.150
 I do not know what it is therefore who knows 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.189
 write in the comments because 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.740
 I really don't understand the meaning of this 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.869
 Circuits just here such here well 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.540
 rarities are cool i mean i don't know what 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:36.090
 They gave such a detail here it is from aqua 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:40.110
 Raiders or aquazona such astronaut 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.409
 By the way, there is also a parity there 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.420
 Actually for many years I donâ€™t know 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.860
 I know of such a set it on the mountain 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.930
 such a detail and such 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.829
 this is from aqua zones or aqua raids i'm not 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.899
 remember in inconsistency to and wrote in general 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.579
 apt 2 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.340
 This different Circuits this already I 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.650
 spilling out to recreate 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:10.830
 I don't know such a gun 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:13.620
 and trails, but in general, all sorts of cool 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:19.830
 transparent details further this is what 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.930
 i restored 2006 around angels 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.460
 something there i don't remember what's the name of it 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.030
 set on in general then this dude is 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.870
 bad 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.480
 his name is paul or he lived on and i even 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.970
 I know how his name turned out that is Lego 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.510
 turned the words lego turned general 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.330
 i.e. is i 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.270
 that is, as Jill and Lego League this morning 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.820
 in general turned upside down 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.209
 lek's words got a jill or angle 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.770
 Generally he has such a set 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.990
 goes further this robot I have it already 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.100
 showed find all sets will be 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.700
 detailed reviews 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.590
 I think, but after a while or 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.360
 will i don't know well in general they are exactly 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.610
 there will be such a dude with a gun here 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.240
 this set is a sonic sting from the left 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.240
 insectary 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.120
 Yes, in general, with a cool sound 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.210
 Dice here anywhere there a little thing 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.030
 It looks like this I do not have, unfortunately 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.790
 original minifigure so sat down 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.330
 such and such a wizard and close and 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.150
 the gun itself is a cool set 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.790
 Further such a robot is a small Olya of Paradise 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.390
 the robot is small here he has controllers 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:42.480
 everyone in general also did this here 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.180
 I made it myself from those parts 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.730
 rare who stayed well think 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.280
 turned out not bad enough for him if 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.550
 you will want will review don't go no 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.620
 It will review and how everything just as 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.620
 it opens here you can get it all 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.080
 little man on such a small spaceship 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.670
 here is also open android and this 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.060
 removed it may become small 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.830
 starship but very strange this this 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.150
 made of bikes but specifically to 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.860
 I could not turn it like this 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.770
 I also have sets and ziful 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.530
 I love this series here for example one with 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:21.900
 Android for example 2 we have not collected 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.750
 me aliens original ideaphone 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.790
 there is only android also from the system 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.580
 space set 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:34.350
 and of course the official service as 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:38.670
 without them, these sets are 94 years of the spa series 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:43.020
 weight with the original dude just there 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:46.830
 His face is very different here sing down 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:49.170
 with unoriginal hands but they are cool 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.060
 so I decided to put them anyway 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.340
 I will not resell or give it away 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.200
 that's why someone likes me for me 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.000
 here are friends with a magnet by the way 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.050
 him on the shoulder is not the one that magnet 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.220
 also retro i love the color level yes yes 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.860
 so we go ahead already collected everything in general 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.830
 you think who follow those my channel 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:14.550
 know open here here too 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:18.720
 there are us rare figures I took 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:24.890

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:29.250
 the dragons on I took for this witch 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:31.790
 dress such a few words for better knight 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.050
 he has such a cool face 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.930
 king but in general a lot of different 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:40.350
 of the parts I took another Indian took in 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.490
 In general, this took the original already 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.850

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:55.280
