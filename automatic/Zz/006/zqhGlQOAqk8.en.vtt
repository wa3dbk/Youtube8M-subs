00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
how the difference I can see because of

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:21.699 
how the difference I can see because of
the<00:04:20.539> lighting<00:04:20.720> but<00:04:21.320> do<00:04:21.410> you<00:04:21.470> see<00:04:21.590> the

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
the lighting but do you see the

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.710 
the lighting but do you see the
difference<00:04:22.190> how<00:04:22.310> short<00:04:22.760> this<00:04:22.880> is<00:04:22.940> this<00:04:23.539> you

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
difference how short this is this you

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.779 
difference how short this is this you
can<00:04:23.750> leave<00:04:24.050> a<00:04:24.110> little<00:04:24.500> bit<00:04:24.620> shorter<00:04:25.070> or<00:04:25.610> leave

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
can leave a little bit shorter or leave

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:26.830 
can leave a little bit shorter or leave
it<00:04:25.880> that<00:04:25.910> length<00:04:26.210> I'm<00:04:26.360> gonna<00:04:26.479> give<00:04:26.630> this<00:04:26.720> up

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
it that length I'm gonna give this up

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.810 
it that length I'm gonna give this up
just<00:04:27.110> because<00:04:27.229> so<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:27.860> can<00:04:28.039> pin<00:04:28.190> it<00:04:28.220> down<00:04:28.340> and

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
just because so I can pin it down and

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:36.619 
just because so I can pin it down and
style<00:04:29.270> it<00:04:29.479> later

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:36.629 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:39.089 

once<00:04:37.629> you<00:04:37.780> cut<00:04:38.020> the<00:04:38.050> lace<00:04:38.379> off<00:04:38.650> like<00:04:38.830> I<00:04:38.919> said

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
once you cut the lace off like I said

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.909 
once you cut the lace off like I said
you<00:04:39.220> could<00:04:39.370> leave<00:04:39.550> a<00:04:39.939> small<00:04:40.870> amount<00:04:40.919> around

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
you could leave a small amount around

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.740 
you could leave a small amount around
the<00:04:42.069> edges<00:04:42.430> out<00:04:42.550> some<00:04:43.090> people<00:04:43.330> do<00:04:43.509> some<00:04:43.720> people

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
the edges out some people do some people

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.600 
the edges out some people do some people
don't<00:04:43.990> I<00:04:44.379> would<00:04:44.949> leave<00:04:45.099> them<00:04:45.250> just<00:04:45.310> so<00:04:45.580> that

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
don't I would leave them just so that

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.790 
don't I would leave them just so that
way<00:04:45.819> you<00:04:45.939> can<00:04:46.090> pin<00:04:46.330> your<00:04:46.569> wig<00:04:47.229> down<00:04:47.439> to<00:04:47.680> your

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
way you can pin your wig down to your

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.999 
way you can pin your wig down to your
head<00:04:48.069> or<00:04:48.370> you<00:04:48.580> can<00:04:48.849> glue<00:04:49.180> down<00:04:49.389> the<00:04:49.449> edges<00:04:50.009> it

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
head or you can glue down the edges it

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.439 
head or you can glue down the edges it
just<00:04:51.310> depends<00:04:51.580> on<00:04:51.669> what<00:04:52.000> you<00:04:52.180> feel

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
just depends on what you feel

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.809 
just depends on what you feel
comfortable<00:04:52.750> with<00:04:53.250> keeping<00:04:54.250> out<00:04:54.370> plus<00:04:54.639> like

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:54.819 
comfortable with keeping out plus like

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:56.580 
comfortable with keeping out plus like
for<00:04:54.939> example<00:04:55.030> this<00:04:55.419> wig<00:04:55.629> you<00:04:55.930> would<00:04:56.169> obviously

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
for example this wig you would obviously

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.290 
for example this wig you would obviously
most<00:04:57.189> of<00:04:57.310> it<00:04:57.400> like<00:04:57.580> if<00:04:57.729> you<00:04:57.819> have<00:04:58.000> your<00:04:58.180> hair

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
most of it like if you have your hair

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.700 
most of it like if you have your hair
down<00:04:58.449> like<00:04:58.509> this<00:04:58.780> then<00:04:59.259> you're<00:04:59.439> finally

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
down like this then you're finally

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.230 
down like this then you're finally
keeping<00:05:00.159> a<00:05:00.280> little<00:05:00.490> bit<00:05:00.580> of<00:05:00.699> the<00:05:00.789> lace<00:05:01.000> on

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
keeping a little bit of the lace on

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.390 
keeping a little bit of the lace on
because<00:05:02.050> your<00:05:02.409> natural<00:05:02.830> hair<00:05:02.979> or<00:05:03.159> the<00:05:03.280> hair

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
because your natural hair or the hair

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.399 
because your natural hair or the hair
that's<00:05:03.520> falling<00:05:03.939> out<00:05:04.120> or<00:05:04.659> just<00:05:04.960> cover<00:05:05.139> it<00:05:05.289> up

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
that's falling out or just cover it up

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:06.689 
that's falling out or just cover it up
now<00:05:05.650> you're<00:05:05.860> someone<00:05:06.099> who's<00:05:06.189> gonna<00:05:06.340> wear<00:05:06.520> your

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:06.699
