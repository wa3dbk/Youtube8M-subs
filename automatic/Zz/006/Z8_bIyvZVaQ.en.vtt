average tax cut of four million dollars

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
country to pay for it I don't think our

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.860 
country to pay for it I don't think our
top<00:02:38.430> economic<00:02:39.209> priorities<00:02:39.660> should<00:02:39.810> be

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
top economic priorities should be

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.110 
top economic priorities should be
helping<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.530> tiny<00:02:40.860> number<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.430> Americans<00:02:41.940> who

helping a tiny number of Americans who
are<00:02:42.150> already<00:02:42.300> doing<00:02:42.600> extraordinarily<00:02:43.290> well

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320

and asking everybody else to foot the
bill<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:47.209> think<00:02:48.209> our<00:02:48.630> top<00:02:48.840> priority<00:02:49.320> should<00:02:49.380> be
