00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 so let's continue the young cationic 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.510
 Rings all these fuzi how and how much they 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.469
 being pushed because the children are inside 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.830
 high potassium castration 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.420
 electrolytic forces potassium on the contrary 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.220
 delivers it to stay inside because 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.250
 what to charge negative and whether charging 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.500
 positive and so a balance between 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.349
 electrostatic forces and forces 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.740
 diffusion leads to the fact that potassium 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.430
 inside the cage more than you build the same 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.640
 the most true let's look at 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:42.180
 to sodium zenith to chlorine 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:45.140
 perfusion forces push it in 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.010
 cage ceiling this inside cage a 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.010
 electrostatic forces leave it 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.280
 from outside to inside and minus chlorine minus and 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.030
 accordingly, the balance between 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.190
 electrostatic forces forces 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.609
 diffusion leaves leads to what 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.680
 polish wheel pore is outside 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:06.540
 more interesting is the situation with on 3 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.460
 let's see diffusion forces pushing 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.330
 on 3 inside the cage, too, on the guard 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.630
 sodium more 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.850
 and what about a number or countries 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.509
 electrostatic eat they also 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.720
 pushed on 2 inside because here on 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.229
 3 charge of millet inside him and those and others 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.540
 Siny make up for 3 move like 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.119
 seeks inside the cell accordingly 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.479
 It ceases to issue a permeable membrane for 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.490
 on 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.340
 maybe looking at the fact that he is strong 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.310
 pushed here he is closed the road to 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.990
 membrane permeable not very easy to wash 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.310
 fire impenetrable for nato 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.250
 sodium ions penetrate inside then 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.130
 the next question is this is true why 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.140
 same table on sodium does not come in 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.439
 equilibrium why is there a lot however 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.070
 there are few if you constantly have two same 10 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:02.100
 and 7 and pull 3 inwards like this is a prize in 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.909
 this helps sodium potassium pump 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.269
 who constantly squeezes out sodium 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.000
 already enticing to either inward ie 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.099
 forces sucked on 3 inward 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.650
 he has to take off inside but 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.569
 membrane action gravy and of course it is not 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.160
 pump and pump as we present 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.819
 least closest function is 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.519
 pump 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.680
 which you ran into either sodium 3 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.420
 out 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.530
 pushes the rink and bend let's 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.319
 approximately we will draw the pump these consist of 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:45.980
 proteins from proteins so here there is such 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:48.690
 here is the pump here again the membrane 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.870
 War learned quite drunk 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.629
 molecules so what happens for every three 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.590
 sodium molecules that are pushed out 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:03.690
 through the pump three molecules per squad 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:07.170
 two molecules go in 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.720
 These are the pumps and not them or them. 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.989
 the work leads to the fact that sodium is out 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:18.959
 cells taste outside the cell more than 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:21.569
 bent as i said on the throne too 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.669
 easy to pass through the membrane so 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.709
 kaleva sodium pump effectively 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:27.750
 copes with the problem that is, if so 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.090
 it happened that all of a sudden on 3 would fly 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.700
 on the inside of the cage then the pump without work is not 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.269
 managed and does not require much 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.989
 energy and their power is so much 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.530
 not enough to turn off 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:43.109
 all above but the membrane is not easy not the same 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:47.130
 penetrate for at 3 so the pump and 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:49.370
 They do an excellent job with the scanner Caribs 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.389
 sodium pump consumes a lot of energy 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.660
 it's not such an easy job 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:56.250
 to transport kaolin 3 there I'm talking about 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.340
 about 40 percent metabolic 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.900
 resources on and role 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.819
 what is interesting most of our cells 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.720
 organism including not only neurons 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:09.670
 arm muscle cells and 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.849
 contains such pumps to revana by three 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.349
 pump during my work though i 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.700
 I repeat there is a transfer 3 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.329
 positive sodium ions 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:23.620
 from inside the cell and two positive 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:26.199
 potassium ions from outside the cell this work 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.900
 accompanied by their accumulation in the wound 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.910
 electric potential difference at 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.699
 this splits atf 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:37.090
 which supplies mitochondria come on 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:39.160
 hole for the operation of these pumps now we 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.889
 with you we will finish in the next lesson we 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.289
 splat new talk about potential 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:47.220
 telnosti just good to meet in 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.220
 next time bye
