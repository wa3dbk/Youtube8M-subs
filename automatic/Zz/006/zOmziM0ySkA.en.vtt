00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.540
 because of this, Monday was again full of horses and ponies every year 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.410
 horse market as always sufficient audience but it was mostly watching 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.410
 don't buy 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.369
 this room 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.890
 but I have only just arrived 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.890
 He takes his own goalkeeper and then 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.620
 that's the people 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.900
 and then we see 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.450
 in Amsterdam 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.710
 and so a moped rider with groin complaints 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.450
 due to the speed a bit too early for van den haag, consumers thought 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.880
 still have reasons 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.100
 yes this year were earlier 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.260
 tomorrow it will mostly be allowed in again 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
 his words were thereby getting 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.680
 except the name 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.680
 it will be over there 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.730
 and that will always touch 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.400
 the hall of the country 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.400
 Wednesday 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.280
 just disgusting 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.800
 so there are still along with on board 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.850
 well not really yet 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.810
 because all d 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.810
 you may well be possible 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.890
 3 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.310
 On the lead to win a world he led the club 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.560
 the research now shows that that's right 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.079
 charge with losing weight 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.089
 how did that happen 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:17.869
 with that money 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:20.759
 that made it clear 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.759
 it may not be broken 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.809
 with a little bit painfully clear 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.629
 I think so 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.629
 there is too little confidence to have abused 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:35.419
 last year 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:37.469
 treated in October 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.639
 everything went well 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.149
 normal 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:42.429
 the eu countries have that 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:44.569
 I don't mean by e-mail 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.199
 she will learn that we believe that his company does not go out yes because people 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:51.059
 who get sick 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:52.669
 And then that requires further investigation
