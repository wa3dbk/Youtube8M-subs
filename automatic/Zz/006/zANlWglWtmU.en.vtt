 I get more and more women paying per school 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.190
 quite a crisis 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.170

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.020
 often in beautiful 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.660
 so you can just open a world to me as normal crosses in christ 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.650
 it's just you that they are not that special it is such 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.890
 fat blankets moment 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.520
 how many points we share with everyone and I do that right away 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.120
 a bit of videos 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.290
 as you may not have cut the most in tank 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.680
 the greens 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.680
 I'm getting a bit far today 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.920
 much more money 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.020
 feisty 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.630
 look how fast i go 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.040
 you can keep 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.040
 I will usher in 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.330
 the cfo 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.430
 a mistake 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.430
 then I don't find it 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.140
 all my side is just one of the students 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.360
 the system only offers 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.980
 the foundation 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.930
 I really feel like it 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.410
 she studied taking reconcile with a broken one and shows a scholarship 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.950
 Vienna 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.250
 Vienna 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.260
 co 2 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
 in that period 

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.299
 click here this osn 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.609
 take the pit euro profit just do not say 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.369
 hence good 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:22.869
 if you don't like it later the booty end up didn't seem right 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:25.859
 in japan 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:26.840
 tanja 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.480
 then you can go crazy then I think of a check their value 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.159
 because I mean I have such a beautiful baby and that 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.339
 yes so little nauseous if you do not like it because I mean 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:40.740
 come on 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.239
 Justin Bieber 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.239
 is my baby but so sweetheart nine on you 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.919
 Secretly you really hate it is too fragile to make a nod 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.059
 little study 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:52.900
 because they voted earlier 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.939
 and when it is beautiful 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:57.259
 that was 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:59.539
 very simple 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:02.659
 she is now there is a by-product in that more 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:03.630
 sir 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.189
 Imagine it is not if you call nice 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.189
 but then also literally the bite dog 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.909
 probably there are still girls usually but I don't go around 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.170
 I never like the non-mainstream jazz brewery 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.689
 whatever 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:21.660
 ger 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.809
 taken into account 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.999
 i never go but you shouldn't be too big for the justin bieber or something 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.469
 and most girls do because everyone's annual event is a bigger one 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.899
 and the man blamed greece 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.899
 46 go out there 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.979
 a little bit 9 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:44.049
 59 minutes 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.049
 it looks a bit like it 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.019
 I'm just counting 

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:58.679
 adds geert joints 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:01.749
 funny not to the eo last time 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:07.239
 be ready on one side 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.699
 I know this man 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:11.639
 played once 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.899
 so i know where to go that m 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:16.979
 that indicates that is then again 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.799
 just that little extra that you get 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.330
 you kind of know me in turn 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.379
 you know where to jump and don't know where to go that is 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:27.340
 namely 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.229
 this is great for inspiration 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.919
 and you often contract union 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.600
 how nice that I immediately put jumbo because I have experienced everything that I there 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:37.710
 dam 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.229
 at the last minute 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:40.860
 jumping 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.219
 or just say at the last minute that I jump there 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:45.699
 and that around my knee 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.300
 exactly the same place as you just did 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.029
 anp fucking tiemens 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:55.819
 look like now i have no penalty here as my child percent he drove 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.289
 respect a second chance and the man getting on axes was no longer exactly on 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.309
 dying in the same place 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:04.469
 so rightly so 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:08.479
 be a pancake promotion and not if it's about pancake promotion 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.300
 seriously if you come to someone like someone at your door would come with pancakes 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.350
 for example from jan reker band of the pancake foods 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.370
 the 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.559
 we ask 10 cents per package 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:24.430
 for the parents of the cookies and 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.349
 pancake either 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:29.580
 n'kufo we walked 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.400
 a rich fantasy 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.509
 most British people want to retrieve 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:35.130
 in the light of 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.379
 because I have been called professionalism 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:41.460
 but create a rich fantasy with his camera 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.139
 as long as rich of just getting it 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:45.710
 probably a person 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.710
 then you are rubbing my eyes 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.589
 aluminum housing 

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:55.740

 to jump with a good one and if he doesn't participate 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.229
 I have 54 in five minutes 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.349
 I can save 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:24.819

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:39.379

 two turtles 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.319
 coincidence 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:51.909

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.000
 in the past i have just exposed this twice to celebrate london and i also appear 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.880
