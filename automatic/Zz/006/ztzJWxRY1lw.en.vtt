00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
some of them are very very old and I

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.950 
some of them are very very old and I
think<00:00:37.620> these<00:00:37.860> are<00:00:38.219> even<00:00:38.670> they're<00:00:39.480> not<00:00:39.629> super

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
think these are even they're not super

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.900 
think these are even they're not super
old<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:40.170> they're<00:00:40.410> from<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.710> 80s<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.309> they're

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
old but they're from the 80s and they're

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.430 
old but they're from the 80s and they're
made<00:00:42.090> from<00:00:42.239> recycled<00:00:42.360> glass<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> colors

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
made from recycled glass and the colors

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.709 
made from recycled glass and the colors
are<00:00:43.649> really<00:00:44.040> really<00:00:44.489> great<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.850> these<00:00:45.030> so

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
are really really great in these so

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.440 
are really really great in these so
basically<00:00:46.079> I'm<00:00:46.289> going<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:47.309> know<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.640> lay

basically I'm going to you know just lay

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.810 
basically I'm going to you know just lay
out<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.809> pattern<00:00:48.989> you'd<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.700> do

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
do something that's sort of more mixed

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
which I kind of like better and then you

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.789 
which I kind of like better and then you
know<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:02.940> choose<00:01:03.180> your<00:01:03.470> fiber<00:01:04.470> color

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
know you just choose your fiber color

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.190 
know you just choose your fiber color
accordingly<00:01:05.659> so<00:01:06.659> now<00:01:06.780> I'm<00:01:06.869> going<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.020> show<00:01:07.140> you

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
accordingly so now I'm going to show you

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.340 
accordingly so now I'm going to show you
how<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.409> make<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.490> end<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.540> like<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.200> just

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
how to make the end so I like to just

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.950 
how to make the end so I like to just
make<00:01:10.530> these<00:01:10.680> easy<00:01:11.010> sort<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.580> button<00:01:12.000> type

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
make these easy sort of button type

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.850 
make these easy sort of button type
closures<00:01:14.869> because<00:01:15.869> they<00:01:16.020> use<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.439> beat<00:01:16.590> same

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
closures because they use the beat same

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.460 
closures because they use the beat same
bead<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:17.490> not<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:18.390> not<00:01:18.689> like<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.080> super

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
bead and it's not it's not like a super

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.740 
bead and it's not it's not like a super
contrast<00:01:20.130> between<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:21.450> know<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
contrast between the you know the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.149 
contrast between the you know the
bracelet<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.259> where<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.560> starts<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:22.979> where

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
bracelet and where it starts and where

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.190 
bracelet and where it starts and where
it<00:01:23.189> ends<00:01:23.420> so<00:01:24.420> basically<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.869> just<00:01:24.900> make<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
it ends so basically you just make a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.030 
it ends so basically you just make a
loop<00:01:25.530> like<00:01:27.290> this

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.100 

and<00:01:32.930> then<00:01:33.930> you're<00:01:34.080> going<00:01:34.230> to<00:01:34.290> string<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:36.110> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
and then you're going to string on the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.130 
and then you're going to string on the
beads<00:01:37.350> which<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.860> did<00:01:38.190> and<00:01:38.490> then<00:01:38.720> again<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.900> can

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
beads which I did and then again you can

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.390 
beads which I did and then again you can
use<00:01:40.500> um<00:01:41.570> different<00:01:43.040> you<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.190> place<00:01:44.370> your

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
use um different you can place your

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.070 
use um different you can place your
knots<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.820> different<00:01:45.060> places<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.930> do

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
knots in different places so you can do

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.780 
knots in different places so you can do
you<00:01:46.320> know<00:01:46.410> very<00:01:46.670> evenly<00:01:47.690> place<00:01:48.690> knots<00:01:49.790> after

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
you know very evenly place knots after

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.350 
you know very evenly place knots after
each<00:01:51.660> bead<00:01:52.050> or<00:01:52.440> you<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:52.950> do<00:01:53.130> every<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.880> do<00:01:54.330> a

wraps<00:02:13.610> layered<00:02:14.610> together<00:02:19.970> because<00:02:20.970> these<00:02:21.150> are

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
wraps layered together because these are

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.110 
wraps layered together because these are
all<00:02:22.280> not<00:02:23.280> calibrated<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.150> whole<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:26.120> because

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
all not calibrated the whole so because

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.760 
all not calibrated the whole so because
the<00:02:27.240> holes<00:02:27.450> are<00:02:27.600> not<00:02:27.630> all<00:02:27.840> calibrated<00:02:28.260> and

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
the holes are not all calibrated and

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.550 
the holes are not all calibrated and
sometimes<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.340> won't<00:02:29.459> be<00:02:29.610> able<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.760> get<00:02:29.940> the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
sometimes you won't be able to get the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.990 
sometimes you won't be able to get the
string<00:02:31.560> through<00:02:31.800> you<00:02:31.950> can<00:02:32.130> just<00:02:32.160> trim<00:02:32.640> the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
string through you can just trim the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.770 
string through you can just trim the
ends<00:02:34.790> by<00:02:35.790> cutting<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:37.260> cord<00:02:37.620> at<00:02:37.830> an<00:02:37.950> angle<00:02:38.780> so

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
ends by cutting the cord at an angle so

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.470 
ends by cutting the cord at an angle so
gives<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> little<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:41.160> little<00:02:41.640> sharper<00:02:42.270> end

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
gives you a little a little sharper end

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.960 
gives you a little a little sharper end
and<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.500> can<00:02:43.709> just<00:02:43.980> stick<00:02:44.430> thee<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:46.700> then<00:02:47.700> use

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
and you can just stick thee and then use

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.390 
and you can just stick thee and then use
your<00:02:48.000> tweezers<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:49.440> just<00:02:49.650> sort<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.040> push<00:02:50.220> the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
your tweezers to just sort of push the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.520 
your tweezers to just sort of push the
cord<00:02:50.670> through

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.410 

you<00:02:56.190> don't<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.490> force<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.910> because<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.180> lot<00:02:57.390> of

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
you don't to force it because a lot of

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.300 
you don't to force it because a lot of
times<00:02:57.660> these<00:02:57.870> are<00:02:57.930> glass<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.650> bill<00:03:01.310> they

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
times these are glass and bill they

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.780 
times these are glass and bill they
won't<00:03:02.490> break<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:02.790> they'll<00:03:03.120> chip<00:03:04.730> so<00:03:05.730> you

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
won't break that they'll chip so you

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.360 
won't break that they'll chip so you
just<00:03:05.940> have<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.180> allow<00:03:06.390> enough<00:03:06.920> coal<00:03:07.920> when<00:03:08.250> you

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
just have to allow enough coal when you

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.460 
just have to allow enough coal when you
cut<00:03:08.700> one<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.360> not<00:03:09.540> in<00:03:09.720> color<00:03:10.040> so<00:03:11.040> basically

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
cut one of the not in color so basically

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.960 
cut one of the not in color so basically
I'm<00:03:13.470> going<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.709> do<00:03:13.830> like<00:03:16.160> an<00:03:17.160> odd<00:03:17.459> number<00:03:17.489> of

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
I'm going to do like an odd number of

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:33.650 
I'm going to do like an odd number of
these<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:18.870> it's<00:03:19.050> one<00:03:19.410> in<00:03:19.590> three<00:03:32.269> and<00:03:33.269> I<00:03:33.450> just

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
these so it's one in three and I just

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.920 
these so it's one in three and I just
move<00:03:33.810> my<00:03:33.840> knot<00:03:34.470> tighter<00:03:35.239> closer<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.690> bead

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
move my knot tighter closer to the bead

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:45.800 
move my knot tighter closer to the bead
before<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.920> type<00:03:44.209> sometimes<00:03:45.209> it's<00:03:45.390> nice<00:03:45.510> to

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
before I type sometimes it's nice to

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.990 
before I type sometimes it's nice to
have<00:03:45.930> like<00:03:46.080> a<00:03:46.140> mix<00:03:46.500> of<00:03:46.709> beads<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.640> could<00:03:47.790> get

to leave a little space so that the knot

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.059 
to leave a little space so that the knot
can<00:04:34.300> move<00:04:34.509> because<00:04:35.349> I'm<00:04:35.470> going<00:04:35.590> to<00:04:35.680> make<00:04:35.830> this

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:36.069 
can move because I'm going to make this

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:40.290 
can move because I'm going to make this
the<00:04:36.280> closure<00:04:37.000> bead<00:04:38.759> so<00:04:39.759> this<00:04:39.940> you<00:04:40.120> know<00:04:40.180> you

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
the closure bead so this you know you

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.830 
the closure bead so this you know you
can<00:04:40.539> choose<00:04:40.720> like<00:04:40.960> a<00:04:40.990> contrast<00:04:41.590> bead<00:04:41.860> or<00:04:42.130> um<00:04:42.550> or

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.999 

something<00:04:46.840> that<00:04:46.990> matches<00:04:47.199> just<00:04:47.410> depends<00:04:47.860> if

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
something that matches just depends if

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.379 
something that matches just depends if
you<00:04:48.130> want<00:04:48.310> something<00:04:48.580> that<00:04:48.729> all<00:04:48.940> blends

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
you want something that all blends

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.740 
you want something that all blends
together<00:04:50.039> or<00:04:51.039> not<00:04:51.310> but<00:04:51.669> basically<00:04:52.300> it<00:04:52.569> would

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
together or not but basically it would
