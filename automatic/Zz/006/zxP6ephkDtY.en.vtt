00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.549
 daniel from tablet here on the ila 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:09.560
 2012 and I'm standing in the field and 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:13.220
 that is the lgb 700 of the optimus l 7 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.930
 ever more closely, we've got one here 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.240
 here you can see 2 inch display with one 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.150
 resolution of 800 x 480 pixels it is a 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.890
 nice display to read well 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.010
 it works very well 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.560
 the plot is tired on android ice cream 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.660
 so sandwich a relative for one 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.700
 version 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.680
 let's look only times we have exactly 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.650
 here is a webcam couple of sensors 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.750
 spokesman one homebutton and two 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.820
 Android button to the left side 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.610
 if the new regulation down the 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.120
 micro-usb connection and right there no 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.519
 connections 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.630
 now we have one and a half millimeters 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.060
 headphone jack 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.520
 small have a 5 megapixel behind 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.010
 expensive medium 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.030
 I think behind that 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.140
 plugged 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.120
 and a red card 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.920
 that gets the plastic and is one 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.810
 perhaps feels pretty good 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.250
 good workmanship that's a bit 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.440
 wait more critically 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.370
 that's what the design on his likes 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.650
 is beaten today 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.090
 like I said Android 1.1 in a bad mood 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.920
 was 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.960
 it has 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:25.409
 processor 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.409
 not quite so is for it 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.710
 Houses 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.030
 you have no mistake that is natural 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.490
 becomes 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.620
 we're probably going to be music teachers 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.490
 display 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.490
 ok no files 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.870
 always on the phone 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.040
 let over yours 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.180
 you see and then pretty fast 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.510
 to see through everything is fluid 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.640
 the device 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.090
 works well you see if states 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.560
 quite fast 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.670
 what will it cost to believe this is one 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.670
 relatively cheap device 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.120
 yes probably about 200 euros 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:10.200
 Do not cost more, I guess 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:12.619
 all that the optimus 7 from 2012 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.619
 tablet
