the<00:00:53.170> cloth<00:00:53.469> but<00:00:54.250> still<00:00:54.519> anchors<00:00:54.910> it<00:00:55.090> quite

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
the cloth but still anchors it quite

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.380 
the cloth but still anchors it quite
firmly<00:00:55.750> because<00:00:56.199> it<00:00:56.350> has<00:00:56.500> a<00:00:56.710> larger<00:00:57.160> hole<00:00:57.370> so<00:00:58.359> I

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
firmly because it has a larger hole so I

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.470 
firmly because it has a larger hole so I
would<00:00:58.750> choose<00:00:59.050> this<00:00:59.649> type<00:00:59.890> of<00:00:59.920> button<00:01:00.280> to<00:01:01.239> sew

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
on to the polyester pants which would

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.780 
on to the polyester pants which would
allow<00:01:05.290> me<00:01:05.320> to<00:01:05.619> extend<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.250> flap<00:01:06.520> over
