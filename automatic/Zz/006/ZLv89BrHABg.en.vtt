00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.189
 jo people I sign up here today 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.560
 a special edition of the top five 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.239
 better place back and the first jet 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.099
 Here is very dignified from the tank 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.829
 get caught and there comes the already 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.409
 second jet and of course zack away 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.620
 really brilliant clip and the place 

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:42.510
 five and with that one really should 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.430
 have given us a good impression 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.979
 that's pretty blatant today 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.260
 eclipse and all clips today is from 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:51.360
 a single player and that of 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.010
 christa chris and after the next 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.199
 action here you will understand too 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.210
 why I dedicate this issue to the quiz 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.699
 because this shot hits the black 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:07.259
 You can not just say sea 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:08.759
 Crass and of course the edges are allowed 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.130
 suk she is not missing looks through 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.470
 the whole thing he caught you super the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.240
 jet and that's it toni I have something like that 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.369
 never seen it unbelievable 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.740
 he just caught the fuck 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.900
 heli here too unbelievable 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.890
 Honestly, that's no longer true 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.049
 normal and in this clip it works 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.479
 no case for any threatening kids 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.759
 although that looks pretty cool too 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.399
 before story I have the top ten 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.219
 place seen by jacks and space 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.020
 one there were 1,464 end pretty much 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.850
 I have to say blatantly and I have the same 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.889
 chris wrote the same evening 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.409
 Send me something like that and 

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:48.359
 Unleashed five minutes later sent 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.039
 he is chris with this clip i think 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:52.530
 really the only person i follow 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.209
 so what can ask and me like that 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.670
 what does it look like 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:59.219
 it's beautiful and I have to say 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.319
 my fullest respect for that is what 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.119
 incredible and of course, of course 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.389
 he comes here back to the job 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.020
 we continue with place one and what 

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:09.020
 it can be 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.000
 and what could be better now? 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.170
 I'll show it to you and honestly chris 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.270
 I have to do this now in the 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.520
 public say you are not anymore 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.400
 normally incredibly well done he throws 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.920
 her the c4 high caught the helicopter 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.020
 and honestly, no one does that 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.970
 The only thing left to do is the Christian 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.560
 honestly it's done incredibly well 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.569
 and so what I do not know who something like that 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.310
 ever saw and that was it 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.500
 again today with the episode of top 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.269
 five battle place I have to say that was 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.489
 so far the best episode we ever had 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.680
 Of course , they had a huge one 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.660
 thank you to the chris for these clips 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.580
 I also have much more of him 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.000
 the plate so we are still a lot 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.069

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.870
 Of course you can also clip again 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.280

 Of course, everything else to note what 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.959
 So far you have sent 1 so there 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.340
 I did not need to worry about that 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.260
 there will be some things going on 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.150
 already on the plate and have 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.370
 of course the chris is looking over 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.660
 make monte jazz with his clips and 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.250
 I have to say it's really worth it 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.569
 that it really made a recommendation 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.489
 deepest hearts 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.230
 that is, the link looks past him 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.299
 is in the description he is now 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.250
 relatively new in video editing 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.810
 but area is constantly improving 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.609
 and looks really not meanwhile 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.049
 Bad from he takes in any case 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.450
 also feedback on and that is really 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.579
 a very good feature of a youtube 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.590
 So look over it is worth it 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.060
 really as I said the left in the 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.769
 description I also like to tell two 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.630
