that it's IP x 65 water-resistant it's

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.930 
that it's IP x 65 water-resistant it's
also<00:00:46.289> very<00:00:46.620> rugged<00:00:46.920> which<00:00:47.520> means<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.789> can

with<00:00:49.620> summer<00:00:49.860> coming<00:00:50.250> up<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.789> can<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.149> by

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
with summer coming up you can have it by

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.240 
with summer coming up you can have it by
the<00:00:51.329> pool<00:00:51.600> or<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:51.989> shower<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.829> it'll<00:00:53.219> work

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
the pool or in the shower and it'll work

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.020

just fine

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.560 
just fine
so<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.690> has<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.140> couple<00:00:55.890> controls<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.270> front
