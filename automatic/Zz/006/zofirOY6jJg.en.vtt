00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.390 
down just because uh lots of people have
broken<00:01:49.930> this<00:01:50.170> gun<00:01:50.590> down<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.800> lot<00:01:51.070> so<00:01:53.220> that's<00:01:54.220> the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
broken this gun down a lot so that's the

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.560 
broken this gun down a lot so that's the
cattle<00:01:54.880> step<00:01:55.950> can't<00:01:56.950> believe<00:01:57.310> I<00:01:57.550> like<00:01:58.420> this

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
cattle step can't believe I like this

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.680 
cattle step can't believe I like this
one<00:01:58.630> I<00:01:58.810> think<00:01:59.080> it's<00:01:59.170> gonna<00:01:59.260> be<00:01:59.410> pretty<00:01:59.530> cool

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
one I think it's gonna be pretty cool

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.620 
one I think it's gonna be pretty cool
it's<00:02:01.690> very<00:02:01.990> low<00:02:02.230> recoil

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.730 

yeah<00:02:05.619> very<00:02:06.250> fast

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.940 

yeah<00:02:11.810> what<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.900> expect<00:02:13.230> with<00:02:13.319> this<00:02:13.470> gun<00:02:13.680> it's<00:02:13.890> a

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
yeah what to expect with this gun it's a

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.790 
yeah what to expect with this gun it's a
12<00:02:14.190> round<00:02:14.400> magazine<00:02:14.970> as<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.750> fast<00:02:16.140> Muller<00:02:16.500> fresh

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
12 round magazine as a fast Muller fresh

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.650 
12 round magazine as a fast Muller fresh
draw<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.459> in<00:02:17.700> time<00:02:17.970> just<00:02:18.240> like<00:02:18.360> any<00:02:18.540> other

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
draw and in time just like any other

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.559 
draw and in time just like any other
pistol<00:02:19.170> um<00:02:19.490> it's<00:02:20.490> probably<00:02:20.790> gonna<00:02:20.940> do<00:02:21.150> medium

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
pistol um it's probably gonna do medium

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.070 
pistol um it's probably gonna do medium
to<00:02:21.750> low<00:02:21.900> damage<00:02:22.140> just<00:02:22.650> like<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.890> 57<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:24.080> it's

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
to low damage just like the 57 and it's

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.990 
to low damage just like the 57 and it's
gonna<00:02:25.200> have<00:02:25.410> very<00:02:25.620> low<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.100> no<00:02:26.250> recoil<00:02:26.670> just

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
the barrel of the gun which allows it to

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.020
