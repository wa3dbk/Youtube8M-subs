00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
review of the gosei great megazord and

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.480 
review of the gosei great megazord and
the<00:00:10.710> Gosei<00:00:11.070> grand<00:00:11.340> Megazord<00:00:11.550> figures<00:00:12.860> of<00:00:13.860> the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
the Gosei grand Megazord figures of the

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.709 
the Gosei grand Megazord figures of the
reason<00:00:14.730> they're<00:00:14.849> called<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.150> which<00:00:15.450> seems

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
reason they're called that which seems

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:16.939 
reason they're called that which seems
where<00:00:15.900> there's<00:00:16.080> an<00:00:16.170> explanation<00:00:16.350> for<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.859> is

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
where there's an explanation for it is

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.070 
where there's an explanation for it is
because<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.820> basically<00:00:18.060> used<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.810> be<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
because this basically used to be the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.929 
because this basically used to be the
retrofire<00:00:19.590> line<00:00:19.890> but<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.220> guess<00:00:20.460> they<00:00:20.609> retcon

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
retrofire line but I guess they retcon

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.000 
retrofire line but I guess they retcon
that<00:00:21.150> title<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:22.170> these<00:00:22.350> are<00:00:22.410> just<00:00:22.769> by<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
that title and so these are just by the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.070 
that title and so these are just by the
regular<00:00:23.369> names<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.300> much<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.810> on<00:00:24.900> some

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
regular names so much so that on some

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.689 
regular names so much so that on some
Amazon<00:00:25.470> listing<00:00:25.619> without<00:00:26.039> proper<00:00:26.340> pictures

reason I brought it in is because this

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.360 
reason I brought it in is because this

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
shows a little picture of the figure

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.369 
shows a little picture of the figure
which<00:00:57.149> appears<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.629> be<00:00:57.809> one<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.350> know

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
which appears to be one of the you know

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.900 
which appears to be one of the you know
earlier<00:00:58.859> images<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.609> looks<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.820> little

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
earlier images and it looks a little

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.360 
earlier images and it looks a little
more<00:01:00.149> stylized<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.350> body<00:01:01.559> primarily<00:01:02.129> looks

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
more stylized the body primarily looks

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.860 
more stylized the body primarily looks
the<00:01:02.489> same<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:02.879> if<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.719> little

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the same but if you can see the little

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.870 
the same but if you can see the little
like<00:01:04.470> wings<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:04.979> his<00:01:05.129> helmet<00:01:05.489> are<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> little

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
like wings on his helmet are a little

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.789 
like wings on his helmet are a little
longer<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.810> that's<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.170> only<00:01:07.260> reason<00:01:07.619> I

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
longer so that's the only reason I

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.340 
longer so that's the only reason I
brought<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.640> show<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.810> then<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.200> does

the figure first first going off the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.740 
the figure first first going off the
details<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> head<00:01:38.939> sculpt<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.570> say

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
details so the head sculpt I have to say

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.060 
details so the head sculpt I have to say
is<00:01:39.869> pretty<00:01:40.110> nice-looking<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.680> think<00:01:40.860> they<00:01:40.920> did

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
is pretty nice-looking I think they did

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.670 
is pretty nice-looking I think they did
a<00:01:41.100> really<00:01:41.250> good<00:01:41.460> job<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.090> um<00:01:42.780> it's<00:01:43.110> less

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
a really good job on it um it's less

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.469 
a really good job on it um it's less
retrofire<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.399> guess<00:01:44.880> that's<00:01:45.060> probably<00:01:45.210> why

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
retrofire I guess that's probably why

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.840 
retrofire I guess that's probably why
they<00:01:45.720> are<00:01:45.840> doing<00:01:46.020> away<00:01:46.920> with<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.159> name<00:01:47.340> cuz<00:01:47.640> I

they are doing away with the name cuz I
guess<00:01:48.030> they're<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.180> gonna<00:01:48.360> make<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> more

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
guess they're just gonna make a more

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.440 
guess they're just gonna make a more
accurate<00:01:48.840> I'm<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.920> assuming<00:01:50.240> for<00:01:51.240> all<00:01:51.329> we

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450

know<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.720> next<00:01:51.840> batch<00:01:52.229> could<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.619> completely

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
know the next batch could be completely

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.980 
know the next batch could be completely
stylized<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.270> they<00:01:54.479> did<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.659> really<00:01:54.780> good<00:01:54.930> job

which is primarily blue and silver he

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.030 
which is primarily blue and silver he
does<00:02:25.620> have<00:02:25.800> eyes<00:02:26.010> here<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.520> as<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.300> this<00:02:27.420> one

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
does have eyes here and as is this one

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.740 
does have eyes here and as is this one
and<00:02:29.040> then<00:02:29.130> it's<00:02:29.250> legs<00:02:29.520> are<00:02:29.940> pretty<00:02:30.180> bland<00:02:30.570> I

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
and then it's legs are pretty bland I

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.190 
and then it's legs are pretty bland I
have<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.020> say<00:02:31.230> pretty<00:02:31.950> much<00:02:32.040> all<00:02:32.370> solid<00:02:32.790> colors

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
have to say pretty much all solid colors

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.710 
have to say pretty much all solid colors
which<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.320> guess<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.650> fine<00:02:34.950> but<00:02:35.300> their<00:02:36.300> faces

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
which I guess is fine but their faces

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.290 
which I guess is fine but their faces
here<00:02:37.280> aren't<00:02:38.280> really<00:02:38.459> painted<00:02:38.910> which<00:02:39.090> isn't

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
here aren't really painted which isn't

here aren't really painted which isn't
that<00:02:39.660> huge<00:02:40.050> of<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.350> deal<00:02:40.380> for<00:02:41.220> like<00:02:41.340> Bandai<00:02:41.640> of

that huge of a deal for like Bandai of

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.010 
that huge of a deal for like Bandai of
America<00:02:42.120> toys<00:02:42.300> but<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.540> feel<00:02:42.720> like<00:02:42.780> they<00:02:42.900> could

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
America toys but I feel like they could

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.840 
America toys but I feel like they could
have<00:02:43.050> at<00:02:43.200> least<00:02:43.230> included<00:02:43.709> eyes<00:02:43.890> or<00:02:44.520> something

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
have at least included eyes or something

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.490 
have at least included eyes or something
to<00:02:45.090> make<00:02:45.180> them<00:02:45.300> seem<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.540> little<00:02:45.750> less<00:02:46.050> cheap

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
to make them seem a little less cheap

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.199 
to make them seem a little less cheap
like<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:47.070> looks<00:02:47.310> all<00:02:47.489> fine<00:02:47.730> until<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.090> get

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
like it looks all fine until you get

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.090 
like it looks all fine until you get
down<00:02:48.300> here<00:02:48.360> where<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.750> looks<00:02:48.780> cheaper<00:02:49.290> under

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
down here where it looks cheaper under

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.430 
down here where it looks cheaper under
the<00:02:50.250> bag<00:02:50.430> there's<00:02:50.670> not<00:02:50.850> much<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.180> tell

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
the bag there's not much to tell

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.320 
the bag there's not much to tell
obviously<00:02:52.440> as<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.430> saw<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.060> does<00:02:54.180> come

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
obviously as you saw that it does come

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.870 
obviously as you saw that it does come
with<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.510> sword<00:02:54.810> here<00:02:55.110> which<00:02:55.739> at<00:02:56.550> least<00:02:56.700> is

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
with a sword here which at least is

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.070 
with a sword here which at least is
painted<00:02:57.180> which<00:02:57.300> is<00:02:57.390> because<00:02:57.570> it's<00:02:57.690> part<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:57.959> it

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
painted which is because it's part of it

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.060 
painted which is because it's part of it
I'm<00:02:58.200> hoping<00:02:58.860> so<00:03:00.050> but<00:03:01.050> it's<00:03:01.170> primarily<00:03:01.380> red<00:03:01.830> and

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
I'm hoping so but it's primarily red and

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.290 
I'm hoping so but it's primarily red and
then<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.220> get<00:03:02.340> like<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.580> black<00:03:02.760> here<00:03:03.030> but<00:03:03.180> so

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
then you get like the black here but so

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.330 
then you get like the black here but so
it<00:03:03.390> looks<00:03:03.540> just<00:03:03.690> fine<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.620> bit<00:03:04.830> stylized

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
it looks just fine it is a bit stylized

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.800 
it looks just fine it is a bit stylized
because<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:06.030> know<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.300> other<00:03:06.420> one<00:03:06.540> seems<00:03:06.720> a

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
because you know the other one seems a

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.940 
because you know the other one seems a
little<00:03:06.900> bit<00:03:07.080> bigger<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.320> this<00:03:07.500> just<00:03:07.709> seems<00:03:07.860> a

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
little bit bigger so this just seems a

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.640 
little bit bigger so this just seems a
little<00:03:08.040> stylized<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.730> me<00:03:09.530> articulation<00:03:10.530> wise

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
little stylized to me articulation wise

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.400 
little stylized to me articulation wise

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
you do get a nice 360 joint here and you

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.650 
you do get a nice 360 joint here and you
do<00:03:13.560> get<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.739> single<00:03:14.040> elbow<00:03:14.400> joint<00:03:14.640> here<00:03:14.940> as<00:03:15.090> well

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
on the wheels I could see them easily

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.930 
on the wheels I could see them easily
haven't<00:05:22.860> left<00:05:22.979> out<00:05:23.159> like<00:05:23.310> these<00:05:23.520> red<00:05:23.699> rims

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.850 
haven't left out like these red rims
here<00:05:24.180> so<00:05:24.419> that<00:05:24.630> that<00:05:25.199> looked<00:05:25.379> a<00:05:25.440> little<00:05:25.560> blank

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
here so that that looked a little blank

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.110 
here so that that looked a little blank
er<00:05:26.039> but<00:05:26.250> they've<00:05:26.430> got<00:05:26.639> all<00:05:26.759> the<00:05:26.849> details

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120

er but they've got all the details
pretty<00:05:27.419> solid<00:05:27.690> on<00:05:27.780> these<00:05:27.990> I<00:05:28.259> think<00:05:28.469> it<00:05:28.680> looks

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
pretty solid on these I think it looks

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.740 
pretty solid on these I think it looks
pretty<00:05:29.069> nice<00:05:29.250> chest<00:05:30.000> paint<00:05:30.240> looks<00:05:30.419> good

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
it's kind of got a shine to it there's

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.209 
it's kind of got a shine to it there's
not<00:05:33.180> really<00:05:33.330> a<00:05:33.449> whole<00:05:33.630> lot<00:05:33.690> to<00:05:33.900> his<00:05:34.710> paint<00:05:34.979> but

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:35.219 
not really a whole lot to his paint but

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:37.040 
not really a whole lot to his paint but
they<00:05:35.370> did<00:05:35.550> a<00:05:35.580> good<00:05:35.729> job<00:05:35.789> on<00:05:36.150> detailing<00:05:36.900> it<00:05:36.960> up

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050

I'm his legs down here they look a
little<00:05:39.960> less<00:05:40.740> plain<00:05:41.069> than<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.779> ghost<00:05:42.779> leg

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
little less plain than the ghost leg

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.659 
little less plain than the ghost leg
grates<00:05:43.289> legs<00:05:43.770> just<00:05:44.069> because<00:05:44.310> of<00:05:44.430> like<00:05:44.550> the

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
grates legs just because of like the

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.010 
grates legs just because of like the
general<00:05:44.940> designs<00:05:45.270> here<00:05:45.539> but<00:05:45.690> then<00:05:45.810> you<00:05:45.840> get

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
general designs here but then you get

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.140 
general designs here but then you get
down<00:05:46.169> to<00:05:46.289> the<00:05:46.380> faces<00:05:46.770> and<00:05:46.949> they're<00:05:47.699> yet<00:05:47.880> again

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
down to the faces and they're yet again

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.490 
down to the faces and they're yet again
to<00:05:48.300> have<00:05:48.389> like<00:05:48.599> eyes<00:05:48.810> or<00:05:48.990> something<00:05:49.169> I<00:05:49.349> feel

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
to have like eyes or something I feel

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.719 
to have like eyes or something I feel
like<00:05:49.620> they<00:05:49.740> could<00:05:49.919> just<00:05:49.949> add<00:05:50.250> a<00:05:50.279> smidge<00:05:50.699> more

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
like they could just add a smidge more

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.719 
like they could just add a smidge more
detail<00:05:51.360> to<00:05:51.569> these<00:05:51.719> to<00:05:52.529> make<00:05:53.250> them<00:05:53.430> seem<00:05:53.639> a

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
detail to these to make them seem a

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.370 
detail to these to make them seem a
little<00:05:53.969> bit<00:05:54.090> better<00:05:54.240> but<00:05:54.930> overall<00:05:55.169> he's<00:05:55.349> a

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
little bit better but overall he's a

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.769 
little bit better but overall he's a
solid<00:05:55.620> looking<00:05:55.949> figure<00:05:56.159> here's<00:05:56.490> the<00:05:56.610> back<00:05:56.849> and

00:05:57.769 --> 00:05:57.779 
solid looking figure here's the back and

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:59.510 
solid looking figure here's the back and
you<00:05:58.229> know<00:05:58.380> the<00:05:58.710> reason<00:05:59.009> I<00:05:59.099> think<00:05:59.159> they<00:05:59.340> could

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
you know the reason I think they could

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.249 
you know the reason I think they could
add<00:05:59.669> pain<00:05:59.940> is<00:06:00.120> because<00:06:00.419> usually<00:06:00.870> all<00:06:01.020> of<00:06:01.110> their

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
add pain is because usually all of their

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:02.899 
add pain is because usually all of their
bent<00:06:01.469> end<00:06:01.650> figures<00:06:01.979> are<00:06:02.159> really<00:06:02.310> well<00:06:02.580> painted

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
bent end figures are really well painted

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:04.850 
bent end figures are really well painted
so<00:06:03.449> I'm<00:06:03.509> not<00:06:03.690> sure<00:06:03.870> why<00:06:04.050> they<00:06:04.319> always<00:06:04.500> like

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
so I'm not sure why they always like

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.149 
so I'm not sure why they always like
skimp<00:06:05.430> on<00:06:05.639> various<00:06:06.509> PR<00:06:06.870> paints<00:06:07.259> but<00:06:07.889> whatever

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:08.159 
skimp on various PR paints but whatever
