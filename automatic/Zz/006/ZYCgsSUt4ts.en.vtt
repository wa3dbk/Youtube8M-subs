I<00:02:33.470> think<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:34.560> is<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.710> most<00:02:34.890> important<00:02:35.280> part

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
I think this is the most important part

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.860 
I think this is the most important part
don't<00:02:36.000> give<00:02:36.150> up<00:02:37.310> like<00:02:38.310> in<00:02:38.490> my<00:02:38.610> case<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:39.120> screamed

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
don't give up like in my case I screamed

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.550 
don't give up like in my case I screamed
six<00:02:40.440> months<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:41.070> averaged<00:02:41.910> thirty<00:02:42.150> viewers<00:02:42.560> so

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
six months I averaged thirty viewers so

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.180 
six months I averaged thirty viewers so
that's<00:02:44.040> not<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.280> lot<00:02:44.490> but<00:02:45.210> I<00:02:45.620> kept<00:02:46.620> streaming

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
that's not a lot but I kept streaming

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.630 
that's not a lot but I kept streaming
and<00:02:50.750> if<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:51.990> stopped<00:02:52.350> from<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.190> six<00:02:53.430> month

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
and if I stopped from that six month

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.350 
and if I stopped from that six month
period<00:02:53.820> I<00:02:54.150> wouldn't<00:02:54.630> be<00:02:54.720> where<00:02:54.870> I'm<00:02:54.990> at<00:02:55.050> today
