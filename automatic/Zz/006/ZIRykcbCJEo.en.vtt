00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
it's validated by blood tests when it

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.330 
it's validated by blood tests when it
comes<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.539> hypo<00:00:28.050> sometimes<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.130> blood

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
comes to the hypo sometimes the blood

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.429 
comes to the hypo sometimes the blood
tests<00:00:29.670> tell<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> truth<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.779> sometimes<00:00:31.230> they

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
tests tell the truth and sometimes they

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.160 
tests tell the truth and sometimes they
lie<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.540> sometimes<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:33.719> just<00:00:33.809> helpful

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170
