you can see what I'm doing anyway I'll

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.760 
you can see what I'm doing anyway I'll
try<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.880> add<00:00:17.970> some<00:00:18.240> tabs<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.170> annotations

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
try and add some tabs in the annotations

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.000 
try and add some tabs in the annotations
again<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.699> can<00:00:20.789> see<00:00:21.350> okay<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.470> starts<00:00:22.830> off

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
again so you can see okay it starts off

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.320 
again so you can see okay it starts off
with<00:00:23.460> El<00:00:24.119> Jefe<00:00:24.330> just<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.220> e<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.119> third

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
with El Jefe just on the e on the third

with El Jefe just on the e on the third
fret<00:00:32.840> pretty<00:00:33.840> simple<00:00:34.260> run<00:00:34.969> I'll<00:00:35.969> just<00:00:36.149> play

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
fret pretty simple run I'll just play

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.720 
fret pretty simple run I'll just play
through<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> next<00:00:36.870> bit<00:00:37.079> kind<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.590> at<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.280> medium

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
through the next bit kind of at a medium

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.970 
through the next bit kind of at a medium
pace<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.660> then<00:00:40.110> I'll<00:00:40.230> sort<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.530> play<00:00:40.800> through

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
pace and then I'll sort of play through

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.979 
pace and then I'll sort of play through
it<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> little<00:00:41.219> bit<00:00:41.340> slower<00:00:41.809> I'll<00:00:42.809> probably

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
it a little bit slower I'll probably

00:00:42.989 --> 00:01:07.680 
it a little bit slower I'll probably
screw<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.469> up<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.829> sorry<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.520> advance

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.320 

that's<00:01:08.690> pretty<00:01:08.930> much<00:01:09.110> it<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.880> second<00:01:11.270> time

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
that's pretty much it the second time

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.790 
that's pretty much it the second time
they<00:01:11.720> play<00:01:11.960> through<00:01:12.259> it<00:01:12.409> you<00:01:12.530> can<00:01:12.680> play

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
they play through it you can play

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.590 
they play through it you can play
through<00:01:13.009> it<00:01:13.070> exactly<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.640> same<00:01:13.880> except

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
through it exactly the same except

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.530 
through it exactly the same except
instead<00:01:14.780> of<00:01:15.140> ending<00:01:15.440> on<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:15.680> G<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.909> on<00:01:17.450> the

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
instead of ending on the G and on the

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.320 
instead of ending on the G and on the
power<00:01:17.750> cord<00:01:18.080> here<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:22.310> I'll<00:01:22.520> also<00:01:22.700> show<00:01:22.880> you<00:01:23.210> a

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
power cord here and I'll also show you a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.249 
power cord here and I'll also show you a
fancy<00:01:24.430> Melvin<00:01:25.430> little<00:01:25.700> bit<00:01:26.450> as<00:01:26.630> well<00:01:26.930> that<00:01:27.170> you

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
fancy Melvin little bit as well that you

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.740 
fancy Melvin little bit as well that you
can<00:01:27.410> play<00:01:28.030> so<00:01:29.030> just<00:01:29.210> to<00:01:29.270> go<00:01:29.360> through<00:01:29.600> that<00:01:29.690> a

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
can play so just to go through that a

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:58.850 
can play so just to go through that a
little<00:01:29.960> bit<00:01:30.080> slower

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.200 

then<00:01:59.860> you<00:01:59.979> can<00:02:00.100> also<00:02:00.250> apply<00:02:00.520> a<00:02:00.610> Melvin<00:02:01.030> bit<00:02:01.180> I

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
then you can also apply a Melvin bit I

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.999 
then you can also apply a Melvin bit I
kind<00:02:01.479> of<00:02:01.509> screwed<00:02:01.720> up<00:02:01.840> a<00:02:01.899> bit<00:02:02.140> but<00:02:02.320> he<00:02:02.439> goes<00:02:02.619> you

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
kind of screwed up a bit but he goes you

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:14.369 
kind of screwed up a bit but he goes you
can<00:02:03.130> also<00:02:03.280> then<00:02:03.610> go

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.710 

one<00:02:15.379> two<00:02:15.829> and<00:02:16.310> then<00:02:16.909> it<00:02:17.030> goes<00:02:17.180> into<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.569> actual

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
one two and then it goes into the actual

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.559 
one two and then it goes into the actual
song<00:02:19.569> okay<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.750> actual<00:02:21.049> verse<00:02:21.439> itself<00:02:22.569> is

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
song okay the actual verse itself is

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.640 
song okay the actual verse itself is
kind<00:02:24.439> of<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:25.579> sped-up<00:02:26.299> version<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:27.230> what<00:02:27.439> we've

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
kind of a sped-up version of what we've

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.920 
kind of a sped-up version of what we've
just<00:02:27.680> played<00:02:28.099> I<00:02:28.310> guess<00:02:28.629> I'll<00:02:29.629> just<00:02:29.750> play

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
just played I guess I'll just play

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.869 
just played I guess I'll just play
through<00:02:30.109> it<00:02:30.230> sort<00:02:30.590> of<00:02:30.620> quickly<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.129> then<00:02:31.700> you

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
through it sort of quickly and then you

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.099 
through it sort of quickly and then you
can<00:02:32.030> hopefully<00:02:32.420> pick<00:02:32.599> it<00:02:32.689> up<00:02:32.840> I'll<00:02:32.959> play

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
can hopefully pick it up I'll play

00:02:33.109 --> 00:03:01.560 
can hopefully pick it up I'll play
through<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.319> little<00:02:33.530> bit<00:02:33.650> slower<00:02:33.890> as<00:02:34.099> well<00:02:34.250> so

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:16.190 

and<00:03:02.570> then<00:03:02.660> it<00:03:02.780> goes<00:03:02.930> into<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.410> course

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.130 

and<00:03:17.200> then<00:03:17.830> it<00:03:17.950> goes<00:03:18.130> back<00:03:18.430> into<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.970> start<00:03:19.900> or

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
and then it goes back into the start or

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.400 
and then it goes back into the start or
the<00:03:20.170> intro<00:03:20.560> login<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:25.600> they<00:03:25.900> can<00:03:26.050> play<00:03:26.230> the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
the intro login and they can play the

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.740 
the intro login and they can play the
same<00:03:26.620> formation<00:03:27.120> if<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.270> want<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.510> throw<00:03:28.570> in

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
same formation if you want to throw in

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.360 
same formation if you want to throw in
the<00:03:28.840> Melvin<00:03:29.200> bit<00:03:29.350> twice<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.860> can<00:03:29.980> do<00:03:30.100> that<00:03:30.220> if

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
the Melvin bit twice you can do that if

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.020 
the Melvin bit twice you can do that if
you<00:03:30.460> like<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.840> then<00:03:32.020> it<00:03:32.140> just<00:03:32.290> ends<00:03:32.890> I<00:03:33.160> think

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
you like and then it just ends I think

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.970 
you like and then it just ends I think
we're<00:03:34.150> laugh<00:03:34.390> of<00:03:34.690> half<00:03:35.140> of<00:03:35.320> the<00:03:35.470> intro<00:03:35.830> or

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
we're laugh of half of the intro or

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.070 
we're laugh of half of the intro or
something<00:03:36.310> like<00:03:36.400> that<00:03:36.460> so<00:03:36.910> go<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:37.630> have<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.810> jam

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
something like that so go and have a jam

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.480 
something like that so go and have a jam

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
and I'm sure you'll be able to work it

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.660 
and I'm sure you'll be able to work it

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
that helps some people probably not who

00:03:50.140 --> 00:05:13.180 
that helps some people probably not who
