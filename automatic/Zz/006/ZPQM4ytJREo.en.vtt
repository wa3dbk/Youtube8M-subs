00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 how are you preparing for the new season 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.379
 Alexei Forest whom training she goes 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.970
 systematically mass also grew quite well 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.450
 what to expect from the debut performance 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.560
 alexander fedorov take it 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.300
 ungrateful to do or 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.310
 these predictions and which of the young 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.660
 considers bodybuilders to be the coolest 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.880
 Alexander Vishnevsky 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.070
 he certainly can get around there and Kochetkov 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.110
 yeah well maybe yes and borisova 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.330
 and who knows maybe the shark is all that and not 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:35.070
 only in the new news feed channel 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:36.690
 iron rating let's start our release 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.030
 perhaps the most sensational story 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.350
 last time return to 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.870
 competitive bodybuilding 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.670
 Alexander Fedorov during his 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.800
 recent interview with alexander told 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.230
 we have experienced the feeling of 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.030
 return to the gym I will not say 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.610
 so now I already looked like the first 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.740
 month two to nothing 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.230
 because it immediately started two meals 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.410
 training this time is very short therefore 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.390
 all the time 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.910
 now deliberately goes to him 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.129
 process also alexander told us about 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.220
 volume which sports supplements use 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.490
 its preparation protein isolate is 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.960
 its time combined protein when 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.260
 the mass set itself to be a combination 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.180
 creative carbohydrates 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.930
 reductive on complex acids 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.390
 acids they are something that contribute 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.460
 unity that picks them up happens in 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.190
 dependence of how I feel like him 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.840
 it suits me therefore my choice and 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.840
 black what is today 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.320
 but still the main question which 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.390
 worries all bodybuilding fans what 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.000
 the form will be able to put Alexander on 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.370
 his first start honestly his not 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.360
 saw her 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:49.660
 you can guess something and say 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.920
 heat will give to the tournament I think that he 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.380
 now very motivated so 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.480
 realizes that if he is people again 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.370
 but this is not confirmed from h everyone is waiting 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.400
 I think every day and my Rus when 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.310
 already lucky with such a pr and on his 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.290
 I'll go to watch the tournament only 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.369
 ungrateful to make these predictions because 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.050
 that this imposes all the good predictions 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.150
 imposes 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.060
 responsibility on the athlete he 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.550
 It starts going through there that's supposedly all all 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.960
 already believe that he will win there everything 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.140
 and 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.970
 you know 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.160
 street will burn responsibly 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.500
 whether or not Fedorov can carry out 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.070
 time will tell as well as 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.620
 will be able to 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.090
 or not become real stars 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.270
 bodybuilding heroes release iron 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.820
 rating new blood this rating caused 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.710
 violent controversy their disagreement with 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.030
 the choice of heroes was not too lazy to make 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.980
 even the magazine hercules 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.410
 so we decided to return to this topic 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.680
 and find out about the participants of this 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.880
 rating have alexander vishnevskogo 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.580
 cover up stays in first place 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.420
 probably I would put it on 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.209
 even be Borisov 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.160
 because he built a firm nor legs and 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.380
 immediately became the third from the first time but 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.080
 it is there that the form on armonia is very very 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.080
 adequately think that he is worthy 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.720
 second place after kulaev third place 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.580
 probably yes Kochetkov probably would 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.010
 the third but abakar and great hard 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.130
 evaluate not you just great potential 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.340
 I see that a huge but never seen 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.440
 in shape while he was in very good 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.900
 form in an hour Krasnodar in the spring and 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.250
 very proportional athlete can be 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.370
 even at the moment it outweighs 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.170
 Great, that is, as long as raw is 4 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.300
 the place is great for 5 though 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.430
 but then again, if of course great 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.460
 its potential will develop that he of course 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.810
 can get around there and kochetkov yes but 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.060
 it is possible to give Borisov 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.890
 and who knows maybe kulaev but in fact 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.170
 business is not as important as being distributed 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.940
 places the main thing is that another one has appeared 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.800
 reason to talk about young athletes 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.320
 many of which are still very few 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.360
 known to bodybuilding fans in contrast 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.420
 from our next hero Alexei Forest 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.310
 who despite the fact that iron 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.860
 rating often happens in diamond 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.110
 Alexey could surprise us once again 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.680
 First, unlike many Russian 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.690
 athletes 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.850
 he does not hide his form at all 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.250
 although a little bit left before the first start 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.370
 less than a month no no just say 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.910
 so not very comfortable 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.669
 I do not know in large quantities I do not consider it 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.910
 actually like some kind of taboo in the second 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.160
 Woods became and even more especially his 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.110
 legs to night great added legs for 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.449
 last six months of muscle mass they 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.290
 now even dominates him 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.830
 riding the body but when he doesn't swing 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.680
 cold condition 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.919
 Well, the task now is to bring 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.930
 maximum state of differentiation to 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.479
 perfect let's say that among 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:51.229
 professionals that will fight 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:54.229
 in march legs would they be bearing him 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.479
 this year was very calm swing I 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.889
 didn't stop after i love this thing well 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.620
 the body itself responded 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.270
 quite positive here is a divorce and 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.729
 let's say even with good enough 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.060
 13 kilograms of quality and I think us and not 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.200
 I will 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.360
 she is plus or minus 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.070
 approximate weighs recall that in 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.820
 last year on nordic pro 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.890
 alexey was ranked fourth as will 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.270
 this year it's hard to say from one 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.430
 the side can see that Alexey is great 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.990
 added another and the composition of the Finnish 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:28.660
 the tournament greatly intensified all thoughts 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:31.150
 some kind of iron you there all this like 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.730
 would they be thrown back but the main thing 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.070
 put the best form of the general as well 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.910
 would be the task for this year if possible 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:42.480
 qualify for the Olympics for 2015 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.980
 year in the museum try there you get 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.870
 Alexei himself about this is not particularly 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.730
 soared we generally noticed that 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.860
 this season his workouts are held in 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.110
 more relaxed atmosphere than a year 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.190
 ago we asked Alexey in 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.220
 what's the secret here 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.889
 but let's say it's experience and age 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.749
 On the whole, I guess 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:05.639
 he began to look at some things 

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:08.340
 I had a lot of grams this year 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:11.039
 the light is not the only sport available 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.050
 privacy and business remains for us 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:15.210
 wish alexey lesukov and alexander 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.330
 good luck on their difficult journey to 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:22.409

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:24.719
 of our viewers in particular their denis 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:27.029

 coped with a barbell of 100 kilograms and 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:52.550

 By the way, not given the office delivered to us 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.270
 a box of cuts so now us on 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.550
 the editorial board will have to do 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.070
 hard choice and determine the prize 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.410
