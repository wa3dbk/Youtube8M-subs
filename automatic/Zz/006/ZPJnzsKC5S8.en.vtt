00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.209 

first<00:01:36.170> you'll<00:01:36.590> want<00:01:36.740> to<00:01:36.829> take<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:37.009> before

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
first you'll want to take a before

first you'll want to take a before
picture

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.220 

then<00:01:47.270> what<00:01:47.480> you'll<00:01:47.630> do<00:01:47.750> is<00:01:47.900> you'll<00:01:48.050> measure

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
then what you'll do is you'll measure

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.110 
then what you'll do is you'll measure
and<00:01:48.590> make<00:01:48.890> marks<00:01:49.160> where<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.610> measuring<00:01:49.970> tape

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
and make marks where the measuring tape

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.910 
and make marks where the measuring tape
is<00:01:50.330> so<00:01:50.780> that<00:01:50.930> you<00:01:51.050> have<00:01:51.230> those<00:01:51.440> same<00:01:51.650> reference

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
is so that you have those same reference

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.010 
is so that you have those same reference
points<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.640> work<00:01:52.760> from<00:01:53.060> once<00:01:53.480> you<00:01:53.600> remove<00:01:53.870> the

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
points to work from once you remove the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:05.149 
points to work from once you remove the
applicator

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.609 

next<00:02:06.000> you'll<00:02:06.659> want<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.899> take<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.079> slack<00:02:07.439> out

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
next you'll want to take the slack out

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.290 
next you'll want to take the slack out
of<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.799> tape<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.580> way<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.880> get<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.119> more

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
of the tape so that way you get a more

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.600 
of the tape so that way you get a more
accurate<00:02:09.450> measurement<00:02:10.190> you'll<00:02:11.190> do<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.459> in

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
accurate measurement you'll do this in

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.280 
accurate measurement you'll do this in
three<00:02:11.790> different<00:02:12.090> areas<00:02:12.209> about<00:02:12.780> three<00:02:13.050> inches
