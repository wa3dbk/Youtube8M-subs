00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.220
 Welcome to a youtube 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.779
 channel air for a video wanted to place 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.849
 I'll give you a model helicopter in front of you 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.809
 the micro class it is 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:17.960
 relatively new to the blade nano ctx 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:21.199
 model is 2.4 ghz taxation here 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.279
 and I showed so-called unboxing 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.900
 just take a break out of the box 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.150
 that we in America like to take it 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.590
 There are also many videos in English 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.779
 English-speaking room but I wanted 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.099
 simply make even a professional German Sun 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:43.379
 and he is 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:46.350
 let's go rotates cpx krems collectively 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.899
 kitsch micro is the name of it 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.910
 29 degrees promises me some 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.910
 I'm not a professional to open 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:03.449
 First of all, there is one 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.590
 operating instructions in german under 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.200
 other and a bag with spare parts 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.220
 once the main engine leaves one 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.790
 screwdriver dome climb for the 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.700
 Rotor head-controlled and a small one 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.750
 part of you can not yet assign 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.930
 well, hopefully we do not need us 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.930
 immediately 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:36.120
 then once the carton content stopped 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.660
 looks quite clear selection more 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:45.570
 we do not even need it then 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:49.380
 the plan the world of eve sorry for one 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.970
 single 3.7 volt lithium battery has got 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.410
 I already saw a battery box 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.210
 Round it off so it's good too 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:02.009
 can charge model for breeze 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.170
 four batteries come clique cells 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.360
 that's about eight 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.050
 piece by piece for remote control 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.000
 and four pieces charger the traditional one 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:24.330
 you need an external power supply 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:27.450
 for power supply stands for as 100 5 ampere 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:33.510
 did not want to go in for five 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:35.160
 core second skiflug battery we 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:41.489
 are also quite manageable six times 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:44.459
 there are two pieces of a 3.7 volts 150 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.049
 billions of hours should be enough 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.830
 flight time I do not know we have to 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:57.330
 fly then there is the remote control 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:59.700
 a 2 4 ghz spectrum dx too right 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.440
 clearly kept simple 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.710
 tuned on the line and should be up 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:13.720
 think work well 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:18.840
 I yes then placed the this time 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:21.490
 lever itself that's the good piece 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.440
 i just keep worrying we keep on 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:31.900
 best so that you can see exactly 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:35.910
 background the papers so nico ihle 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:39.250
 stop the name is program 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.680
 but the first birds fly so well 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.720
 Of course it is also shown but you 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.860
 should the unboxing first enough 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.860
 the first flight wants to 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:32.140
 the battery is more likely to be airplane 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:34.060
 know maybe four minutes so own 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.110
 Stable because not a bit very here 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.730
 cheap in the air I already wanted 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:42.150
 the reaction was set to low 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.150
 be careful
