to<00:02:27.709> be<00:02:27.769> floated<00:02:28.250> up<00:02:28.370> on<00:02:28.549> air<00:02:28.819> yep<00:02:29.420> all<00:02:29.629> my<00:02:29.810> tires

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
to be floated up on air yep all my tires

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.920 
to be floated up on air yep all my tires
are<00:02:30.410> bare<00:02:30.560> isn't<00:02:30.859> in<00:02:30.980> them<00:02:31.099> I<00:02:31.599> think<00:02:32.599> we're

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
are bare isn't in them I think we're

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.460 
are bare isn't in them I think we're
clear<00:02:33.260> let's<00:02:33.980> go<00:02:34.129> ahead<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:35.109> yeah

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
clear let's go ahead and yeah

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.789 
clear let's go ahead and yeah
alright<00:02:37.400> that's<00:02:37.640> getting<00:02:37.910> this<00:02:38.030> thing

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.890 

squeezed<00:02:42.829> I<00:02:45.760> did<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.790> very<00:02:46.970> similar<00:02:47.239> video<00:02:47.630> last

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
squeezed I did a very similar video last

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.970 
squeezed I did a very similar video last
year<00:02:49.359> putting<00:02:50.359> it<00:02:50.540> in<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:51.139> so<00:02:51.590> we<00:02:51.739> got<00:02:51.889> our

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
year putting it in and so we got our

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.879 
year putting it in and so we got our
dash<00:02:52.160> here<00:02:52.459> speedometer<00:02:53.120> tachometer<00:02:53.959> fuel

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:54.889

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.849 
dash here speedometer tachometer fuel
gauge<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.310> should<00:02:55.489> be<00:02:55.609> full<00:02:55.989> my<00:02:56.989> temperature

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
gauge it should be full my temperature

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.430

gauge<00:02:57.950> needs<00:02:58.519> to<00:02:58.669> be<00:02:58.760> fixed<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.540> swings<00:03:00.019> up<00:03:00.230> and

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
gauge needs to be fixed it swings up and

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.960 
gauge needs to be fixed it swings up and
get<00:03:00.530> stuck<00:03:00.799> up<00:03:00.950> there<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.579> that'll<00:03:01.940> be

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
get stuck up there and that'll be

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.110 
get stuck up there and that'll be
another<00:03:02.239> video<00:03:02.450> shortly<00:03:02.780> but<00:03:03.109> let's<00:03:03.260> throw

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
another video shortly but let's throw

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.539 
another video shortly but let's throw
clean<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.269> ignition<00:03:06.160> over<00:03:07.160> here<00:03:07.310> we've<00:03:07.430> got

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
clean the ignition over here we've got

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.390 
clean the ignition over here we've got
our<00:03:07.609> voltage<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.269> our<00:03:08.359> oil<00:03:08.569> pressure<00:03:09.280> so<00:03:10.280> we

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
our voltage and our oil pressure so we

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.059 
our voltage and our oil pressure so we
should<00:03:10.579> have<00:03:10.700> some<00:03:10.760> voltage<00:03:12.609> yeah<00:03:13.630> well<00:03:15.069> I'll

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
should have some voltage yeah well I'll

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:27.640 
should have some voltage yeah well I'll
give<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.340> shot<00:03:16.519> anyway<00:03:16.639> here<00:03:17.419> we<00:03:17.510> go

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.410 

or<00:03:28.129> voltage<00:03:28.519> is<00:03:28.670> up<00:03:28.819> what's<00:03:29.060> up<00:03:29.180> belt

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
or voltage is up what's up belt

let's back her up these cars don't have
power<00:04:40.569> steering<00:04:40.720> so<00:04:41.199> if<00:04:41.289> they're<00:04:41.440> rolling

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
power steering so if they're rolling

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:50.540 
power steering so if they're rolling
they<00:04:41.889> turn<00:04:42.099> a<00:04:42.130> lot<00:04:42.340> faster

I<00:04:52.470> think<00:04:52.650> I<00:04:52.770> might<00:04:52.919> wash<00:04:53.099> it<00:04:53.280> I<00:04:53.370> got<00:04:53.520> my<00:04:53.610> Sun

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
I think I might wash it I got my Sun

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.200 
I think I might wash it I got my Sun

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
trunk put it in park look back that's

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.670 
trunk put it in park look back that's
the<00:05:01.919> air<00:05:02.039> intake<00:05:02.400> for<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:02.610> engine<00:05:03.380> in<00:05:04.380> blob

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
the air intake for the engine in blob

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.960 
the air intake for the engine in blob
since<00:05:05.009> I<00:05:05.069> took<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.340> battle<00:05:05.669> off<00:05:05.789> of<00:05:05.970> it

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.490 

that's<00:05:11.570> not<00:05:11.930> full<00:05:12.230> gas<00:05:12.440> for<00:05:12.770> sure

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
that's not full gas for sure

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.660 
that's not full gas for sure
and<00:05:14.590> they're<00:05:14.740> probably<00:05:14.980> gonna<00:05:15.190> be<00:05:15.340> pumping

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
and they're probably gonna be pumping

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:22.480 
and they're probably gonna be pumping
some<00:05:15.850> moisture<00:05:16.240> out<00:05:16.360> of<00:05:16.390> everything
