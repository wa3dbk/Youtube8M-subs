00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.460
 yes 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.500
 for youtube I'm pits that welcome to 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.820
 the review of here 12 if they are new by 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.469
 here remember that these videos are not 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.030
 to demonstrate skills but so that 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.949
 see how the hands of a 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.480
 I fucked in the middle as I am, if so 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.710
 here you can comment with some weapon that 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.779
 they would like well receiving a future 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.820
 next although we have some dates 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.800
 reserved by that heart and some 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.410
 others that are already recorded or the 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.630
 word of the day that is vodka let's start 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.699
 with the review of here 12 the aptm 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.650
 arcalÃ­s niqab fortune set is a weapon 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.930
 manufactured by smash in the country of russia 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.510
 and that has a more or less start 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.059
 close early since 2012 regarding 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.219
 the ammunition uses 5.45 for 39 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.020
 millimeters and it has something particular in 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.000
 comparison to what the game will be and in 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.710
 the real life that in automatic mode of 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.719
 a range shooting 600 shots 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.399
 per minute but if it is in mode 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.410
 burst those three shots come out with a 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.850
 Cadence of 1000 shots per minute 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.100
 technology very similar to what would be the 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.050
 to in 94 passing them to what would be 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.969
 low phil 4 this weapon is predetermined 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.769
 for the assault class is to say no 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.989
 they need to do something to unlock the 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.700
 it just comes from the beginning and 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.260
 It has an average damage of 25 points 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.640
 damage of the first 8 meters is 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.790
 say a death of four shots at 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.770
 chest or six 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.500
 to the distance with 18 points of damage 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.090
 after 55 meters the charger 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.100
 equally common is 30 bullets in the 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.650
 more charger are in the bedroom with a 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.180
 relatively fast recharge of 2.05 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.520
 seconds when they still have some bullet 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.740
 in the bedroom or 3 seconds when 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.270
 the bullets have completely finished the 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.060
 Cadence of shots is similar to what 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.070
 will be real life with 650 shots per 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.900
 minute in automatic mode although if 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.540
 you choose the burst mode of 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.729
 three shots have a cadence of 750 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.020
 shots per minute this in the beta was 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.180
 thousand shots per minute but 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.860
 definitely an excellent weapon with 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.140
 much precision and so on then it was 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.660
 down to 900 until you reach the point of 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.310
 which is 750 rounds per minute in 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.050
 burst the bullet speed is 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.880
 relatively good 600 meters above 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.950
 second will not have much problem for 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.300
 give to moving targets and the 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.670
 shooting mode as we had already 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.590
 mentioned is automatic burst of three 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.390
 shots and semiautomatic that simply 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.940
 are going to be oscillating between what would be 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.229
 automatic and burst more than anything one of 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.900
 the things that make this weapon very 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.430
 usable and ideal to be the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.130
 first rifle to unlockable jump 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.860
 But 4 is that it has a setback 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.330
 up or kick 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.800
 3.15 is on the left and point one towards 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.390
 right that that if you do not know in what 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.610
 numbers how much it means is 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.739
 relatively little more than anything kicks 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.420
 up and slightly towards the 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.160
 left almost is not going to notice the 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.630
 difference from the side to the side also something 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.340
 good is that his first multiplier 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.840
 shot is to say that both kicks more 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.660
 strong the first bullet that comes out 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.130
 it's only 2.1 times more very 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.989
 below the average of all rifles 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.459
 of jumping and they have realized almost all 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.319
 these statistics of a pattern 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.510
 controllable of a rate of shots 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.250
 slow and other means is a weapon 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.750
 precise and that certainly does have a 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.370
 average precision that yes of the 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.440
 reptiles is tall with point 2 from the 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.870
 look and 3 from the hip what's going to 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.970
 make it very good to long good 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.190
 at least medium and long distances 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.959
 now let's talk more objectively already 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.269
 we saw all the statistics we can already 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.950
 form a technical criterion of what 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.290
 it would be the weapon but rather how it 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.600
 handle some advice and others first 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.340
 that nothing is a weapon designed for socks 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.530
 long distances since in combat 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.540
 close many times they will be overcome 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.980
 by practically any other weapon of 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.989
 any other class like a rifle 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.340
 sniper bolt that if any 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.960
 Once they asked me what weapons 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.060
 it is convenient to use the burst mode 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.980
 this could be one of them however 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.660
 I feel like you have control over long 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.520
 distances with automatic mode is a lot 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.650
 better although in half distances it is 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.750
 perfect for burst mode since 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.240
 shoot faster and even if they are in 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.830
 close combat to you should like this 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.630
 absolutely to change to mode 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.390
 burst because at least that way they will be able to 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.950
 little more bullets per second so what 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.480
 It is best to use it in burst mode in 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.590
 close combat and as they go 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.090
 moving away or leaving 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.950
 exponentially to what the mode be 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.420
 automatic some attachments that 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.580
 could recommend is the point mine 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.170
 holographic red and yes Zionist in a 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.510
 little more distance can add 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.220
 a magnifier in case it does not 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.350
 need more distance can add 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.480
 a laser sight that never goes too 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.970
 thick handle that will allow them to put 12 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.770
 up maybe three more shots and lengthen their 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.320
 bursts at long distances so that we 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.940
 see so much the penalty of imprecision and 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.890
 in the canyon do not modify it 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.840
 definitely the pipe started not me 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.520
 it was very useful and I did not feel the 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.020
 need to use a muzzle brake or 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.060
 some compensator to modify that 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.710
 shooting pattern since usually the 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.480
 they will lose more precision which is more 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.760
 valuable with this weapon that is to long 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.200
 distances that really what would win 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.750
 with controlling it a bit 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.790
 who is not necessary the protests weapon 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.470
 is that it is very stable is an easy weapon 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.940
 to learn and best of all 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.220
 find at the beginning of the game so 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.990
 that will have a pretty useful weapon in 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.120
 how much to cons the cadences are not 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.310
 very outstanding and the other is that it is 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.470
 inconsistent medium there you see what you think 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.660
 that will be able to serve a task and how 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.760
 that suddenly looks bad on you is something 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.410
 subjective but above all it goes sense in the 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.510
 cadence of shots since they are going to be 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.010
 overcome many times finally this 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.890
 weapon raise a rating of four 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.900
 slices of pizza over four plus three 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.240
 that four plus four than three I'm 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.060
 undecided in that sense because many 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.890
 weapons that are worthy of saying good or 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.200
 excellent assault rifles really 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.420
 are far above this one but this 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.790
 is very ideal very easy to use and a 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.460
 pretty useful alternative that if 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.530
 get away a little from the close combat I 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.700
 I know what I tell them but the best for 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.200
 evaluate a weapon is that you the 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.850
 try there is not much to lose 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.770
 it really is the first one they have and 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.030
 Many have tried it and I hope that they 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.920
 I liked the review and especially that 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.180
 has been informative if it was like this 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.010
