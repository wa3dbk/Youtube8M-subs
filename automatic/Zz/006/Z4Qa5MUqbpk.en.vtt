00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
later but I just want to use some basic

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.080 
later but I just want to use some basic
formations<00:00:07.799> that<00:00:07.859> you<00:00:08.040> might<00:00:08.280> see<00:00:08.580> or<00:00:08.970> you

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
formations that you might see or you

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.480 
formations that you might see or you
might<00:00:09.240> want<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.900> run<00:00:10.139> when<00:00:10.950> you<00:00:10.980> start<00:00:11.370> your

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
might want to run when you start your

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.980 
might want to run when you start your
program<00:00:12.170> first<00:00:13.170> probe<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.650> first<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.099> an<00:00:14.219> i

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
program first probe the first is an i

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.620 
program first probe the first is an i
would<00:00:15.990> be<00:00:16.139> an<00:00:16.199> i<00:00:16.410> formation<00:00:17.359> and<00:00:18.359> we're<00:00:18.480> going

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
would be an i formation and we're going

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.060 
would be an i formation and we're going
to<00:00:18.660> say<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.990> pro<00:00:19.470> right<00:00:20.750> pro<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:22.199> where<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
to say I pro right pro is where the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.890 
to say I pro right pro is where the
tight<00:00:23.310> end<00:00:23.580> which<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.420> why<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:25.580> the<00:00:26.580> Z<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.300> a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
tight end which is why and the Z is a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.900 
tight end which is why and the Z is a
flanker<00:00:28.939> okay<00:00:29.939> what<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.539> call<00:00:30.750> them<00:00:30.929> for<00:00:31.910> okay

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
flanker okay what we call them for okay

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.950 
flanker okay what we call them for okay
and<00:00:33.210> then<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.989> ipro<00:00:34.850> means<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.329> guy<00:00:36.570> is

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
and then the ipro means that this guy is

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.760 
and then the ipro means that this guy is
split<00:00:37.320> up<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.730> ax<00:00:39.000> ok<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.620> we

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
split up and this is the ax ok so we

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.310 
split up and this is the ax ok so we
have<00:00:40.890> an<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.219> information<00:00:42.829> which<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:44.040> have<00:00:45.320> 32

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
have an I information which we have 32

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.549 
have an I information which we have 32
which<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.430> pull<00:00:48.090> back<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:49.050> half<00:00:49.260> back

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559
