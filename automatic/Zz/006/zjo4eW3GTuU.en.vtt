be able to take this anywhere and I know
Gary<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:44.820> used<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.969> use<00:00:45.239> these<00:00:45.360> devices

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
Gary and I we used to use these devices

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.959 
Gary and I we used to use these devices
as<00:00:45.840> cycling<00:00:46.230> gps's<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.700> know<00:00:47.789> you'd

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
as cycling gps's so you know you'd

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.760 
as cycling gps's so you know you'd
always<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.450> be<00:00:48.870> inconvenienced<00:00:49.530> by

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
always have to be inconvenienced by

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.170 
always have to be inconvenienced by
putting<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> plastic<00:00:50.550> bag<00:00:50.700> putting<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
putting in the plastic bag putting the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.910 
putting in the plastic bag putting the
your<00:00:51.449> pocket<00:00:51.870> stopping<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.469> stop<00:00:52.680> sign

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
your pocket stopping to the stop sign

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.799 
your pocket stopping to the stop sign
taking<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.309> out<00:00:53.460> all<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.390> then<00:00:54.480> still

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
taking it out all this and then still

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.389 
taking it out all this and then still
condensations<00:00:55.440> gets<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.129> there<00:00:56.250> had

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
condensations gets in there so there had

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.680 
condensations gets in there so there had
to<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.640> better<00:00:56.789> solution<00:00:56.969> Gary<00:00:57.539> was

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
to be a better solution Gary was

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.869 
to be a better solution Gary was
determined<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.559> find<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.890> solution<00:00:59.070> so

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
determined to find that solution so

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.000 
determined to find that solution so
really<00:01:00.270> when<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:00.660> designed<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.199> spend<00:01:01.859> two

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
really when we designed this spend two

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.979 
really when we designed this spend two
years<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.730> two<00:01:03.090> millions<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.480> dollars<00:01:03.750> on

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
years and two millions of dollars on

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.890 
years and two millions of dollars on
this<00:01:04.470> iphone<00:01:04.799> for<00:01:05.100> design<00:01:05.400> itself<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> lot

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
this iphone for design itself so a lot

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.600 
this iphone for design itself so a lot
of<00:01:06.930> time<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> lot<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.590> investment<00:01:08.100> into<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.460> and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
of time a lot of investment into it and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.000 
of time a lot of investment into it and
he<00:01:08.909> wanted<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> do<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.450> right<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.590> know<00:01:10.740> I

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
he wanted to do it right so you know I

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.859 
he wanted to do it right so you know I
had<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.700> ultimate<00:01:11.939> protection<00:01:12.510> and

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
had to have ultimate protection and

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.810 
had to have ultimate protection and
there<00:01:13.320> cannot<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.799> trade-offs<00:01:14.280> between<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
there cannot be trade-offs between the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.490 
there cannot be trade-offs between the
convenience<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.570> fun<00:01:15.750> functionality

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
convenience and the fun functionality

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.600 
convenience and the fun functionality
that's<00:01:16.650> why<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.830> have<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.100> sleek<00:01:17.340> slim

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
that's why you have this sleek slim

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.969 
that's why you have this sleek slim
