00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
amount of work do you think that using

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.930 
amount of work do you think that using
an<00:00:45.899> lmg<00:00:46.289> with<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> bipod<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.309> one<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.760> these

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
an lmg with a bipod in one of these

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.139 
an lmg with a bipod in one of these
locations<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.750> just<00:00:49.110> as<00:00:49.320> bad<00:00:49.500> as<00:00:49.739> boosting<00:00:50.370> so

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
locations is just as bad as boosting so

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.430 
locations is just as bad as boosting so
now<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.270> definitely<00:00:51.449> don't<00:00:51.840> think<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.350> as

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
now I definitely don't think this is as

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.020 
now I definitely don't think this is as
bad<00:00:52.469> as<00:00:52.620> boosting<00:00:53.100> boosting<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.640> from<00:00:53.820> call<00:00:54.000> of

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
bad as boosting boosting is from call of

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.330 
bad as boosting boosting is from call of
duty<00:00:54.360> when<00:00:54.960> two<00:00:55.230> players<00:00:55.500> would<00:00:55.710> sit<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
duty when two players would sit in a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.160 
duty when two players would sit in a
free-for-all<00:00:56.910> match<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.420> one<00:00:57.809> would<00:00:58.020> just

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
free-for-all match and one would just

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.630 
free-for-all match and one would just
kill<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> other<00:00:58.649> constantly<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.430> try<00:00:59.579> to

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
kill the other constantly and try to

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.459 
kill the other constantly and try to
boost<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> nuke<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.660> get<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> lot<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.199> points

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
boost to a nuke and get a lot of points

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.740 
boost to a nuke and get a lot of points
that<00:01:01.500> way<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.699> nothing<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.510> this

it's just like I said it's just bad map

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.910 
it's just like I said it's just bad map
design<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.810> don't<00:01:30.869> blame<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
design so I know I don't blame the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.940 
design so I know I don't blame the
person<00:01:32.070> for<00:01:32.310> sitting<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.329> our<00:01:33.840> camping<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.770> the

it's<00:01:40.020> part<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.409> game<00:01:40.530> they<00:01:40.829> are<00:01:40.860> playing

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
it's part of the game they are playing

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.800 
it's part of the game they are playing
the<00:01:41.369> jet<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.850> objective<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.659> never

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the jet of the objective and I can never

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.020 
the jet of the objective and I can never
I<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.619> never<00:01:43.770> blame<00:01:44.430> someone<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:44.759> playing

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
I can never blame someone for playing

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.429 
I can never blame someone for playing
the<00:01:45.119> objective<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.689> getting<00:01:45.840> kills<00:01:46.079> for<00:01:46.350> it

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
the objective and getting kills for it

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.170 
the objective and getting kills for it
yeah<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.159> doesn't<00:01:47.310> require<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.700> lot<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.880> skill

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
yeah it doesn't require a lot of skill

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.359 
yeah it doesn't require a lot of skill
and<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:49.020> doesn't<00:01:49.470> require<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.740> lot<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:49.950> effort

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
and it doesn't require a lot of effort

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.999 
and it doesn't require a lot of effort
but<00:01:51.060> like<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.659> said<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.200> matt<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.770> just

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
but like I said it's just matt it's just

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.980 
but like I said it's just matt it's just
bad<00:01:53.220> map<00:01:53.490> design<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.090> they<00:01:54.329> are<00:01:54.600> taking

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
bad map design and they are taking

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.319 
bad map design and they are taking
advantage<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.850> nowhere<00:01:57.299> as

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
advantage of it so this is nowhere as

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.880 
advantage of it so this is nowhere as
bad<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:57.810> boosting<00:01:58.170> their<00:01:58.500> playing<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
bad as boosting their playing the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.039 
bad as boosting their playing the
objective<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.520> it's<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.909> on<00:02:00.360> dice<00:02:00.689> really

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049

it's<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.320> really<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.070> game<00:02:02.219> developer

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
it's just really on the game developer

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.219 
it's just really on the game developer

the<00:02:11.749> map<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.920> next<00:02:13.129> question<00:02:13.459> comes<00:02:13.489> in<00:02:13.909> from

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:13.939 
the map the next question comes in from

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:15.580 
the map the next question comes in from
someone<00:02:14.359> i'm<00:02:14.450> going<00:02:14.569> to<00:02:14.629> call<00:02:14.749> mr.<00:02:15.109> tactical

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
someone i'm going to call mr. tactical

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.199 
someone i'm going to call mr. tactical
and<00:02:15.769> he<00:02:15.920> asked<00:02:16.340> do<00:02:16.579> you<00:02:16.639> think<00:02:16.969> that<00:02:17.090> the

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
and he asked do you think that the

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.989 
and he asked do you think that the
sniper<00:02:17.450> rifles<00:02:17.930> should<00:02:18.560> have<00:02:18.889> a<00:02:19.189> delay<00:02:19.670> for

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:19.999 
sniper rifles should have a delay for

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:22.569 
sniper rifles should have a delay for
the<00:02:20.090> snow<00:02:20.299> this<00:02:20.749> the<00:02:21.200> scope<00:02:21.469> Claire<00:02:21.829> it<00:02:22.430> would

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
the snow this the scope Claire it would

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.399 
the snow this the scope Claire it would
be<00:02:22.670> nice<00:02:22.879> if<00:02:22.909> it<00:02:23.180> did<00:02:23.389> so<00:02:23.599> campers<00:02:24.019> would<00:02:24.260> be

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
be nice if it did so campers would be

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:25.929 
be nice if it did so campers would be
stopped<00:02:24.799> and<00:02:25.040> more<00:02:25.310> aggressive<00:02:25.400> people

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
stopped and more aggressive people

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:27.789 
stopped and more aggressive people
wouldn't<00:02:26.359> get<00:02:26.480> punished<00:02:26.900> uh<00:02:27.139> yeah<00:02:27.650> I

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
wouldn't get punished uh yeah I

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.110 
wouldn't get punished uh yeah I
completely<00:02:28.159> agree<00:02:28.310> with<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:28.639> statement<00:02:28.700> I'm

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
completely agree with the statement I'm

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.879 
completely agree with the statement I'm
not<00:02:29.269> really<00:02:29.450> sure<00:02:29.569> what<00:02:30.079> dice<00:02:30.260> was<00:02:30.530> thinking

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:30.889 
not really sure what dice was thinking

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:32.740 
not really sure what dice was thinking
when<00:02:31.189> they<00:02:31.310> implemented<00:02:31.670> implemented<00:02:32.540> the

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
when they implemented implemented the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.080 
when they implemented implemented the
glare<00:02:33.109> system<00:02:33.560> into<00:02:33.799> battlefield<00:02:34.250> 3<00:02:34.519> I<00:02:34.670> know

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
glare system into battlefield 3 I know

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.659 
glare system into battlefield 3 I know
they<00:02:35.510> wanted<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.109> make<00:02:36.469> it<00:02:36.650> so<00:02:36.859> that<00:02:37.189> when

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:37.669 
they wanted to make it so that when

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:40.089 
they wanted to make it so that when
snipers<00:02:38.540> were<00:02:38.749> camping<00:02:39.109> in<00:02:39.169> the<00:02:39.230> location<00:02:39.530> far

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
snipers were camping in the location far

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.949 
snipers were camping in the location far
from<00:02:40.129> the<00:02:40.370> distance<00:02:40.730> people<00:02:41.359> people<00:02:41.540> people

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
from the distance people people people

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.129 
from the distance people people people
who<00:02:42.349> could<00:02:42.560> identify<00:02:43.180> where<00:02:44.180> they<00:02:44.599> were<00:02:44.659> and

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:45.139 
who could identify where they were and

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:46.539 
who could identify where they were and
where<00:02:45.379> they're<00:02:45.530> getting<00:02:45.650> sniped<00:02:45.950> from<00:02:46.310> and

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
where they're getting sniped from and

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.209 
where they're getting sniped from and
they<00:02:46.760> could<00:02:46.909> take<00:02:47.030> out<00:02:47.239> those<00:02:47.419> snipers<00:02:48.069> but<00:02:49.069> I

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:49.219 
they could take out those snipers but I

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:50.559 
they could take out those snipers but I
think<00:02:49.280> they<00:02:49.519> kind<00:02:49.669> of<00:02:49.760> went<00:02:49.879> too<00:02:50.090> far<00:02:50.329> I<00:02:50.389> think

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
think they kind of went too far I think

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.929 
think they kind of went too far I think
in<00:02:51.049> that<00:02:51.409> regard<00:02:51.769> I<00:02:51.919> think<00:02:51.949> the<00:02:52.370> glare<00:02:52.609> system

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
in that regard I think the glare system

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.879 
in that regard I think the glare system
works<00:02:53.090> great<00:02:53.449> because<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:54.139> does<00:02:54.379> allow<00:02:54.590> people

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:54.889 
works great because it does allow people

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.409 
works great because it does allow people
to<00:02:55.010> identify<00:02:55.099> those<00:02:55.609> camping<00:02:56.030> snipers<00:02:56.389> and

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:56.419 
to identify those camping snipers and

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.869 
to identify those camping snipers and
and<00:02:56.870> take<00:02:57.049> them<00:02:57.230> out<00:02:57.349> but<00:02:57.980> right<00:02:58.189> now<00:02:58.250> even<00:02:58.790> if

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
and take them out but right now even if

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.369 
and take them out but right now even if
you're<00:02:59.060> not<00:02:59.359> looking<00:02:59.689> down<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.959> scope<00:03:00.230> and

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
you're not looking down the scope and

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.990 
you're not looking down the scope and
you're<00:03:00.709> moving<00:03:00.889> around<00:03:01.129> the<00:03:01.340> map<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.730> trying

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
you're moving around the map and trying

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.809

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
of disappointing I've kind of worked

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.030 
of disappointing I've kind of worked
around<00:03:35.599> this<00:03:35.780> I've<00:03:35.989> gotten<00:03:36.319> really<00:03:36.560> good<00:03:36.650> with

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
around this I've gotten really good with

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.729 
around this I've gotten really good with
the<00:03:37.069> bolt<00:03:37.310> action<00:03:37.609> rifles<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.120> even<00:03:39.019> even<00:03:39.650> if

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
the bolt action rifles and even even if

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:40.899 
the bolt action rifles and even even if
they<00:03:39.829> know<00:03:39.979> where<00:03:40.099> I'm<00:03:40.250> at<00:03:40.400> I<00:03:40.579> can<00:03:40.759> still

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909 
they know where I'm at I can still

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:42.789 
they know where I'm at I can still
probably<00:03:41.090> take<00:03:41.299> them<00:03:41.449> out<00:03:41.599> that's<00:03:42.409> really

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
probably take them out that's really

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.920 
probably take them out that's really
vain<00:03:43.009> at<00:03:43.159> me<00:03:43.280> but<00:03:43.579> I<00:03:43.790> you<00:03:44.389> know<00:03:44.419> I<00:03:44.509> feel<00:03:44.780> like<00:03:44.870> I

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
vain at me but I you know I feel like I

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.360 
vain at me but I you know I feel like I
pretty<00:03:45.169> I<00:03:45.259> feel<00:03:45.319> pretty<00:03:45.769> comfortable<00:03:46.009> with

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
pretty I feel pretty comfortable with

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.550 
pretty I feel pretty comfortable with
you<00:03:46.609> bolt<00:03:46.790> action<00:03:47.090> rifles<00:03:47.419> now<00:03:47.569> but<00:03:48.169> I<00:03:48.199> don't

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
you bolt action rifles now but I don't

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.039 
you bolt action rifles now but I don't
think<00:03:48.919> that<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.909> glare<00:03:50.209> should<00:03:50.540> constantly

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
think that the glare should constantly

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.770 
think that the glare should constantly
be<00:03:51.169> on<00:03:51.620> this<00:03:52.189> on<00:03:52.729> the<00:03:52.909> rifles<00:03:53.239> I<00:03:53.329> do<00:03:53.419> think

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
be on this on the rifles I do think

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.179 
be on this on the rifles I do think
there<00:03:53.900> should<00:03:54.019> be<00:03:54.049> that<00:03:54.259> maybe<00:03:54.439> a<00:03:54.530> 10<00:03:54.799> second

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:55.189 
there should be that maybe a 10 second

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.280 
there should be that maybe a 10 second
delay<00:03:55.219> so<00:03:55.969> if<00:03:56.090> you're<00:03:56.209> if<00:03:56.479> you're<00:03:56.599> stopped<00:03:57.139> in

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
delay so if you're if you're stopped in

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.469 
delay so if you're if you're stopped in
a<00:03:57.349> location<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:57.949> you<00:03:58.040> are<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.639> if<00:03:59.209> you<00:03:59.299> stay

00:03:59.469 --> 00:03:59.479 
a location and you are and if you stay

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.449 
a location and you are and if you stay
stationary<00:03:59.689> for<00:04:00.079> 10<00:04:00.290> seconds<00:04:00.680> after<00:04:01.310> 10

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
stationary for 10 seconds after 10

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.580 
stationary for 10 seconds after 10
seconds<00:04:01.819> maybe<00:04:02.090> declare<00:04:02.509> starts<00:04:03.049> to<00:04:03.169> activate

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
seconds maybe declare starts to activate

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.830 
seconds maybe declare starts to activate
and<00:04:03.799> people<00:04:04.099> can<00:04:04.280> see<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:04.939> glare<00:04:05.180> I<00:04:05.359> don't

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
and people can see the glare I don't

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.689 
and people can see the glare I don't
think<00:04:05.959> if<00:04:06.379> you're<00:04:06.530> running<00:04:06.680> around<00:04:06.889> you<00:04:07.370> stop

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:07.699 
think if you're running around you stop

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.209 
think if you're running around you stop
for<00:04:07.879> a<00:04:07.939> second<00:04:08.359> and<00:04:08.650> scope<00:04:09.650> out<00:04:09.799> an<00:04:09.919> area<00:04:10.069> i

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:10.219 
for a second and scope out an area i

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:12.099 
for a second and scope out an area i
don't<00:04:10.459> think<00:04:10.729> the<00:04:11.120> glare<00:04:11.449> should<00:04:11.750> you<00:04:11.989> know

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
don't think the glare should you know

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:13.569 
don't think the glare should you know
apply<00:04:12.799> to<00:04:12.859> you<00:04:13.039> and<00:04:13.129> that<00:04:13.219> look<00:04:13.370> in<00:04:13.489> that

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
apply to you and that look in that

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.309 
apply to you and that look in that
situation<00:04:13.909> because<00:04:14.539> you've<00:04:14.840> been<00:04:14.870> moving

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
situation because you've been moving

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.189 
situation because you've been moving
around<00:04:15.409> you've<00:04:15.769> been<00:04:16.039> avoiding<00:04:17.000> what<00:04:17.810> dice

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
around you've been avoiding what dice

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.439 
around you've been avoiding what dice
was<00:04:19.130> trying<00:04:19.430> to<00:04:19.519> avoid<00:04:19.639> for<00:04:20.060> snipers<00:04:20.419> and

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
was trying to avoid for snipers and

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:21.310 
was trying to avoid for snipers and
that's<00:04:20.810> just<00:04:20.930> how

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
that's just how

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.560 
that's just how
camp<00:04:21.620> in<00:04:21.740> a<00:04:21.830> location<00:04:22.100> and<00:04:22.430> take<00:04:23.240> people<00:04:23.360> out

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
camp in a location and take people out

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.450 
camp in a location and take people out
with<00:04:23.780> anyone<00:04:24.170> knowing<00:04:24.380> where<00:04:24.650> they<00:04:24.740> are<00:04:24.770> so

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
with anyone knowing where they are so

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.760 
with anyone knowing where they are so
yeah<00:04:26.060> I<00:04:26.240> do<00:04:26.360> think<00:04:26.810> that<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:27.080> glare<00:04:27.290> system

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
yeah I do think that the glare system

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.290 
yeah I do think that the glare system
needs<00:04:28.010> to<00:04:28.130> be<00:04:28.250> changed<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:28.910> I<00:04:28.970> think<00:04:29.180> it<00:04:29.270> just

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
needs to be changed and I think it just

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.180 
needs to be changed and I think it just
needs<00:04:29.630> to<00:04:29.780> have<00:04:29.900> like<00:04:30.080> a<00:04:30.110> 10<00:04:30.380> second<00:04:30.740> delay<00:04:30.770> or

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
needs to have like a 10 second delay or

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.970 
needs to have like a 10 second delay or
even<00:04:31.670> a<00:04:31.730> 15<00:04:32.150> second<00:04:32.480> delay<00:04:32.750> where<00:04:33.470> if<00:04:33.830> you're

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
even a 15 second delay where if you're

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.940 
even a 15 second delay where if you're
stationary<00:04:34.520> for<00:04:35.090> 15<00:04:35.540> seconds<00:04:35.900> then<00:04:36.290> you<00:04:36.740> get

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
stationary for 15 seconds then you get

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.920 
stationary for 15 seconds then you get
the<00:04:37.100> glare<00:04:37.310> on<00:04:37.340> your<00:04:37.640> weapon<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.120> people<00:04:38.780> will

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
the glare on your weapon and people will

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.660 
the glare on your weapon and people will
be<00:04:39.020> notified<00:04:39.260> of<00:04:39.620> where<00:04:40.160> you're<00:04:40.370> pretty<00:04:40.550> much

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
be notified of where you're pretty much

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.730 
be notified of where you're pretty much
at<00:04:40.850> so<00:04:41.120> I<00:04:41.420> don't<00:04:41.990> think<00:04:42.200> they<00:04:42.290> should<00:04:42.320> penalize

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
at so I don't think they should penalize

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.160 
at so I don't think they should penalize
players<00:04:43.190> that<00:04:43.430> move<00:04:43.550> around<00:04:43.670> a<00:04:43.910> lot<00:04:44.170> because

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
players that move around a lot because

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.570 
players that move around a lot because
that's<00:04:45.380> basically<00:04:45.440> what<00:04:45.980> the<00:04:46.070> glare<00:04:46.220> system

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
that's basically what the glare system

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.700 
that's basically what the glare system
does<00:04:46.790> for<00:04:47.030> those<00:04:47.120> types<00:04:47.390> of<00:04:47.510> players<00:04:47.720> I<00:04:47.990> do

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
does for those types of players I do

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.020 
does for those types of players I do
think<00:04:49.040> they<00:04:49.130> should<00:04:49.280> penalize<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:49.700> campers

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
think they should penalize the campers

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.250 
think they should penalize the campers
and<00:04:50.210> I<00:04:50.390> think<00:04:50.570> that<00:04:50.690> would<00:04:50.780> just<00:04:50.810> be<00:04:50.930> a<00:04:51.020> great

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
and I think that would just be a great

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.620 
and I think that would just be a great
way<00:04:51.440> to<00:04:51.500> go<00:04:51.770> about<00:04:51.860> it<00:04:52.010> um<00:04:52.850> but<00:04:53.180> yeah<00:04:53.270> guys<00:04:53.420> this
