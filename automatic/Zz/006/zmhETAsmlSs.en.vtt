 in the trust they put in me I never smoked 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:48.670

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:55.509
 the pava avaÃ­ arrived world 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:57.270
 when I went for a walk one day 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.639
 and heard a blender noise 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.259
 in the rearview mirror 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:05.279
 in youth the lateral-left palaia in the rear wheel gets more and more 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:05.969

 I lie down to sleep 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.029
 What good is the word of a teenager? 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:39.879
 in a wheel and adults 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.970

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:45.379
 in that story 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.429
 I expected to hear a word of disappointment from him 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:50.569

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:11.239
 It was a unique moment It was something that I never forgot 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.779
 What remained only us, my father.
