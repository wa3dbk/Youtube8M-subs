important elements out of the way and

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.280 
important elements out of the way and
get<00:02:51.520> a<00:02:51.580> good<00:02:51.850> grasp<00:02:52.240> on<00:02:52.540> where<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:52.810> want<00:02:53.110> them<00:02:53.260> to

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
get a good grasp on where I want them to

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.710 
get a good grasp on where I want them to
go<00:02:53.530> in<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.770> future<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.970> sanctuary<00:02:55.480> hub

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
go in the future the sanctuary hub

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.140 
go in the future the sanctuary hub
however<00:02:56.110> is<00:02:56.500> still<00:02:56.860> going<00:02:57.100> very<00:02:57.459> strongly<00:02:57.850> and

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
however is still going very strongly and

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.060 
however is still going very strongly and
I<00:02:58.450> hope<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.690> make<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.110> primary<00:02:59.260> focus<00:02:59.980> of

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
I hope to make it the primary focus of
