I<00:01:31.829> think<00:01:32.040> was<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> little<00:01:32.400> weak<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.939> could

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
I think was a little weak that could

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.300 
I think was a little weak that could
have<00:01:33.210> done<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> lot<00:01:33.540> better<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:34.020> those

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
have done a lot better with those

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.499 
have done a lot better with those
especially<00:01:35.310> being<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.610> LeBron<00:01:35.939> model<00:01:36.360> and

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
especially being a LeBron model and

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.810 
especially being a LeBron model and
achates<00:01:36.990> I'm<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.799> not<00:01:37.950> feeling<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.310> kt6

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.039 
model I haven't caught the KD since the
floors<00:01:40.829> I'm<00:01:41.729> not<00:01:42.060> feeling<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.450> newer<00:01:42.630> models

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049

that<00:01:43.170> they're<00:01:43.290> releasing<00:01:43.759> the<00:01:44.759> kv-4<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.360> my

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
that they're releasing the kv-4 in my

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.350 
that they're releasing the kv-4 in my
opinion<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.259> best<00:01:46.500> model<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.939> Kobe's

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
opinion is the best model but the Kobe's
