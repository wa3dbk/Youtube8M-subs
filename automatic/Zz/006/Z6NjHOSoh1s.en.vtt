00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
functions but not ever stopping to think

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.910 
functions but not ever stopping to think
about<00:00:55.329> fundamentally<00:00:56.590> where<00:00:57.590> are<00:00:57.890> our

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
about fundamentally where are our
