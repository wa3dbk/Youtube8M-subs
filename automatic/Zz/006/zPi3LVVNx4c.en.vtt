from an s3 this doesn't seem like it's
too<00:02:11.360> bad<00:02:11.540> so<00:02:11.870> that's<00:02:12.020> good<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.560> hear

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
too bad so that's good to hear

that<00:02:21.070> I<00:02:22.070> mean<00:02:22.370> I'm<00:02:22.550> an<00:02:22.700> iPhone<00:02:22.900> person<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.260> this

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
that I mean I'm an iPhone person so this

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.040 
that I mean I'm an iPhone person so this
definitely<00:02:25.250> feels<00:02:25.610> big<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.120> me<00:02:26.270> because<00:02:26.930> I

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
definitely feels big to me because I

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.520 
definitely feels big to me because I
usually<00:02:27.500> throw<00:02:28.100> my<00:02:28.340> phone<00:02:28.550> in<00:02:29.120> my<00:02:29.690> pocket<00:02:31.510> I

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
usually throw my phone in my pocket I

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.810 
usually throw my phone in my pocket I
don't<00:02:33.530> think<00:02:33.650> I'm<00:02:33.739> here<00:02:33.950> pain<00:02:34.190> compared<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.700> my

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
don't think I'm here pain compared to my

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:43.360 
don't think I'm here pain compared to my
having<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:36.680> HTC<00:02:37.250> One<00:02:37.580> S<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:42.230> think<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.220> is<00:02:43.340> I

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
having the HTC One S I think it is I

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.100 
having the HTC One S I think it is I
think<00:02:43.700> it<00:02:43.880> is<00:02:44.000> definitely<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.480> little<00:02:44.660> too<00:02:44.870> big

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
think it is definitely a little too big

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.530 
think it is definitely a little too big
for<00:02:45.140> me<00:02:45.530> but<00:02:46.040> this<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.310> what<00:02:46.430> I'm<00:02:46.550> used<00:02:46.820> to<00:02:46.970> so

for me but this is what I'm used to so
alright<00:02:48.440> there's<00:02:49.130> quite<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.340> difference<00:02:49.430> it's

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
alright there's quite a difference it's

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.400 
alright there's quite a difference it's
a<00:02:49.850> quite<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.060> difference<00:02:50.420> there<00:02:50.690> I<00:02:50.959> don't<00:02:51.290> know

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
this this this feels better this is just

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.789 
this this this feels better this is just
I<00:03:01.760> would<00:03:02.660> definitely<00:03:03.050> if<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:03.320> had<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.470> pick<00:03:03.650> one

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
I would definitely if I had to pick one

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.470 
I would definitely if I had to pick one
I<00:03:03.830> would<00:03:04.010> pick<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.250> iPhone<00:03:07.060> it's<00:03:08.060> pretty<00:03:08.239> bad

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
I would pick the iPhone it's pretty bad

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:22.509 
I would pick the iPhone it's pretty bad
it's<00:03:09.049> okay<00:03:09.320> to<00:03:09.380> be<00:03:09.530> honest<00:03:20.709> yeah<00:03:21.739> we<00:03:22.250> can<00:03:22.370> put

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
it's okay to be honest yeah we can put

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.370 
it's okay to be honest yeah we can put
them<00:03:22.579> in<00:03:22.730> pocket<00:03:23.090> but<00:03:23.239> it<00:03:23.690> was<00:03:23.810> like<00:03:23.959> a<00:03:24.140> badge

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
them in pocket but it was like a badge

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.080 
them in pocket but it was like a badge
or<00:03:24.560> something<00:03:24.680> that's<00:03:25.010> fine<00:03:25.220> I<00:03:25.549> think<00:03:25.970> they

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
or something that's fine I think they

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.270 
or something that's fine I think they
should<00:03:26.299> make<00:03:26.329> it<00:03:26.630> smaller<00:03:26.950> couldn't<00:03:27.950> they<00:03:28.040> cut

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
should make it smaller couldn't they cut

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.199 
should make it smaller couldn't they cut
off<00:03:28.430> like<00:03:28.700> an<00:03:28.850> inch<00:03:29.829> so<00:03:30.829> what<00:03:31.640> do<00:03:31.730> you<00:03:31.820> think

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
off like an inch so what do you think

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.020 
off like an inch so what do you think
about<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:33.410> holding<00:03:33.980> it<00:03:34.070> to<00:03:34.160> your<00:03:34.280> face<00:03:34.489> using

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
about the holding it to your face using

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.580 
about the holding it to your face using
it<00:03:35.150> as<00:03:35.239> a<00:03:35.269> phone<00:03:35.570> of<00:03:35.750> course<00:03:35.780> do<00:03:36.350> you<00:03:36.380> think

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
it as a phone of course do you think

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.220
