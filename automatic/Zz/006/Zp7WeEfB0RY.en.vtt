by<00:03:05.540> 15<00:03:06.050> seconds<00:03:06.440> I<00:03:06.680> do<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.790> workout<00:03:08.330> first<00:03:08.569> time

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
by 15 seconds I do a workout first time

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.690 
by 15 seconds I do a workout first time
we<00:03:08.990> at<00:03:09.290> that<00:03:09.560> point<00:03:09.970> dancing<00:03:10.970> efforts<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.660> I<00:03:11.870> I

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
we at that point dancing efforts and I I

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.980 
we at that point dancing efforts and I I
think<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.819> whole<00:03:14.030> idea<00:03:14.090> what<00:03:14.600> this<00:03:14.690> is<00:03:14.870> you

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
think the whole idea what this is you

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.090 
think the whole idea what this is you
probably<00:03:15.170> don't<00:03:15.410> want<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:15.560> move<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:15.890> boss

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
probably don't want to move the boss

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.840 
probably don't want to move the boss
around<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:17.090> circle<00:03:18.220> or<00:03:19.220> something<00:03:19.670> like<00:03:19.760> that

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
around the circle or something like that

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.000 
around the circle or something like that
so<00:03:20.209> you're<00:03:20.360> not<00:03:20.510> underneath<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.560> infernals

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
so you're not underneath the infernals

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.590 
so you're not underneath the infernals
but<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:22.850> you<00:03:22.910> can<00:03:23.030> have<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.239> whole<00:03:23.360> group

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
but so you can have the whole group

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.540 
but so you can have the whole group
together<00:03:23.810> for<00:03:24.230> that<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:24.920> then<00:03:25.130> had<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.430> whole

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
together for that and then had the whole

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.260 
together for that and then had the whole
group<00:03:25.819> move<00:03:26.660> away<00:03:26.780> from<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:28.180> what's<00:03:29.180> it

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
group move away from the what's it

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.930 
group move away from the what's it
called<00:03:29.890> whatever<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.010> circle<00:03:31.640> you<00:03:31.730> think<00:03:31.880> he

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
called whatever the circle you think he

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.780 
called whatever the circle you think he
was<00:03:32.120> also<00:03:32.540> good
