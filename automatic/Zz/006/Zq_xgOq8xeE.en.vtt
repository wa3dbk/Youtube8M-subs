00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everybody says hello my name is bruno 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.259
 Use vitor I'll demonstrate my pedal 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.290
 by not showing the pedals that 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.679
 I'm using this test. 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.179
 I'm going to use my tagima guitar and 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.710
 Let's start by presenting the reading. 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.580
 Here for you guys, then the first one. 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.250
 pedal is the one of the op good drops to receive 95 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.210
 in the time sequence made two later the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.720
 club drive 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.949
 after the classic 808 26 corps because 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.289
 many trembling 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.930
 the kuhn rental and finally the buffer 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.360
 scam all those pedals are from the sheet 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.390
 a company from which I am indoors then 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.890
 galera is the following which is a pedal 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.800
 which uses more to make some 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:51.500
 details some effects on music 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:53.039
 so I make some kind of 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.890
 stuff like that 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.660
 or at the chord tip for example 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.370
 I play a chord and I make a 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.430
 joker, which one do not I use? 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.080
 mauÃ¡ for the group for this function 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.670
 groove I'd rather use the did be that 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.310
 it gives a similar effect to it a 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.799
 filter too and it looks great 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:29.689
 for you to make bases with enough blood 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:32.220
 A type is a very interesting effect, right? 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:35.220
 although in the sequence I have the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.060
 classic 800 that use it as my 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.060
 main drive 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.060
 I only use the youtube drive to give 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.060
 a bust of gain 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.590
 The sun is very interesting. 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.210
 if I need some more 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.640
 day care, I want to give a 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.740
 my clean sound to make some bases 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.590
 some things I use the Tupi drive 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.590
 alone type ii 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.520
 It's really cool, it 's the bodies and the 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.470
 trembling 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:03:02.420
 I use the corpus along with a delay as 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:03:07.660
 things more involved, especially the 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.660
 I also use the same thing right. 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:20.720
 it's just that I like to use training 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.460
 also on the chordal tips then 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.990
 example I'm making a base of 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.990
 dialogue with bodies of law 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:52.470
 I like to put the tribute was a 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:56.310
 detail is I also like to use the 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.990
 training to finalize music is more 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.490
 For example, I have a 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.540
 music on a rope a stick and rope with 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:07.470
 thus distorting the clover to finish 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:19.739
 111 can I make a fez is also a 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:22.380
 very cool effect for solos I usually 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.230
 use the 800 knows together with a 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.230
 drive along with alog Ã© qo and there I 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.610
 I use the buffer hoax host only as a 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.650
 volume pedal 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.830
 it will increase the volume to make a 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.830
 sound 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.150
 So that's it folks, this is the base these are. 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.979
 basically the same timbres and the form 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.409
 I'm using this pedal 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.240
 board is a pretty pedal board 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.939
 eclectic of the own plays pretty thing 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.430
 because it has plenty of appeal but 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:58.169
 has all the pedals so is the combination 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.249
 with the with the combinations we give to people 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:04.039
 do much 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:04.039
 Beauty, I hope you liked it, thanks.
