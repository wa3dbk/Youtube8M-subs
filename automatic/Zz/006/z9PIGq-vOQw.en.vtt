round is kind of a wash but i think that
solid<00:06:11.660> in<00:06:11.810> that<00:06:12.680> range<00:06:12.980> there<00:06:13.280> where<00:06:13.460> he<00:06:13.490> is

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
solid in that range there where he is

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.070 
solid in that range there where he is
he's<00:06:14.000> looking<00:06:14.270> for<00:06:14.420> the<00:06:14.450> whiff<00:06:14.630> punishing<00:06:15.020> the

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080
