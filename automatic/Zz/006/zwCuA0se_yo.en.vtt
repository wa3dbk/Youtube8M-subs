00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
this right here is the aperture ring and

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.410 
this right here is the aperture ring and
right<00:02:37.620> now<00:02:37.769> it's<00:02:38.310> set<00:02:38.579> on<00:02:38.609> manual<00:02:39.239> aperture

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
a little bit and then on the front here

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.649 
a little bit and then on the front here
