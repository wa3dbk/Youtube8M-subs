00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello to all today I find 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.680
 for a new video hairstyle I you 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.560
 show how to make a hairstyle 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.639
 simple but really cute with 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.840
 an ipad 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:18.920
 I take my oath of blow drying 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:23.220
 Absolute I put and hazelnuts 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.529
 I just apply it on my long 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:31.289
 hours in order to properly hydrate them for 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:33.710
 have pretty well made nor feed 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.850
 rows to tame the little frizz 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.510
 in that I take the cup teaser 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.510
 to unravel 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:48.059
 so I always start with mines 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.820
 and the lengths so we make the var 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.800
 upwards saavedra well disentangle the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.800
 knots without breaking your hair 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.860
 you make the rule you want 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.140
 to have me i'm going to keep 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:14.500
 this one you take your red band and 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:18.030
 you just drop it like this 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.030
 go down a little behind the skull 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.280
 now thank you for having a ben raid that makes 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.270
 who does not ask for it 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.360
 gives a little hot effect 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:36.040
 additional 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:38.200
 there you hold a little your hair for 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.880
 reduce a little head of the bump 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.500
 always makes a base like I do not care 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.790
 to the stars here you keep a wick 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.260
 who stays long in your face you there 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.850
 you released it in the first place as 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:56.260
 that you keep it you put it 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:58.330
 side that I come from that one that she has 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:04.300
 you take a little bit more 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:06.910
 thick that you come down 30 role 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.990
 tran then there for it to be simple 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:13.840
 you open it and band with your thumb 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.300
 you pass your fingers to retrieve the 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.430
 wick and avoid any draft 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.170
 wick that would not have passed for example 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:27.160
 and you start again you take the maj 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:32.520
 according to the same processes you open city 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.520
 it's the wick between the sudden skull 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.850
 and you continue until the 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.320
 facts you like actually you can 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.530
 put all the masses you can in 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.190
 put one of these really like 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.110
 as you feel 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.350
 I'm going to stop there I do not put three 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.530
 in fact it makes you feel the same 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.530
 side 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:10.120
 if you want a little more volume on 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:12.610
 the sides shot you because you have 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.980
 folded that can clear a little for 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:23.820
 that it makes a small effect crown on 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:27.610
 the side there you just braided the wick 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.540
 so a simple braid that you have 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:38.200
 left in front of you divide them into three 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:43.080
 and we are braid here from the people to 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.080
 the outside of your face 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.730
 once after that it's over 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:55.099
 apply it against your against your 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.470
 tran and you come here stuck under the 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.900
 raid ben the same way as sometimes 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.909
 from before wanted to do another lap 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.890
 to properly secure the mat once you 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.560
 have therefore adapted adapted volumes the 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.299
 braids based on these are two of your 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.790
 preferences of your face also 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.349
 you just simply set there 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:23.449
 I took the skrei bamboo traffics 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:26.900
 car style to have more support 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:29.000
 avoid slipping with the s-bahn thing 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.880
 at the simple fure love a little bit 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.539
 bohemian with the hand and really does 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.669
 very fast 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.669
 and the effect is really very very cute 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.320
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.830
 tell you very soon for a neighbor 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.830
 as soon as possible
