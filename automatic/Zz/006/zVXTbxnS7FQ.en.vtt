consumer kena for the average consumer
can<00:04:26.500> afford<00:04:26.889> but<00:04:27.159> there<00:04:28.090> will<00:04:28.300> be<00:04:28.539> some

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
can afford but there will be some

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.020 
can afford but there will be some
variety<00:04:29.440> most<00:04:29.680> likely<00:04:30.130> including<00:04:30.610> a<00:04:30.699> sedan

to be an SUV expect the new models to

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.439 
to be an SUV expect the new models to

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
been there okay yeah that's my that's my

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.830 
been there okay yeah that's my that's my
car<00:05:22.710> no<00:05:22.949> one's<00:05:23.160> in<00:05:23.340> there<00:05:23.550> mmm<00:05:24.360> that<00:05:24.750> was

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
car no one's in there mmm that was

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.680 
car no one's in there mmm that was
probably<00:05:25.139> a<00:05:25.290> mistake<00:05:25.729> so<00:05:26.729> remember<00:05:27.449> that

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
probably a mistake so remember that

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.210 
probably a mistake so remember that
because<00:05:27.840> it<00:05:28.050> comes<00:05:28.199> into<00:05:28.380> play<00:05:28.590> in<00:05:28.650> just<00:05:29.130> a

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
because it comes into play in just a

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.950 
because it comes into play in just a
moment<00:05:29.550> he<00:05:30.090> was<00:05:30.180> telling<00:05:30.479> the<00:05:30.510> cop<00:05:30.720> that<00:05:30.870> he

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
moment he was telling the cop that he

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.840 
moment he was telling the cop that he
was<00:05:31.080> poisoned<00:05:31.350> which<00:05:32.250> is<00:05:32.340> probably<00:05:32.490> true<00:05:32.820> i

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
was poisoned which is probably true i

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.520 
was poisoned which is probably true i
mean<00:05:32.970> think<00:05:33.690> about<00:05:33.780> it<00:05:33.960> because<00:05:34.290> the<00:05:34.380> dude

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
mean think about it because the dude

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.900 
mean think about it because the dude
looks<00:05:34.740> like<00:05:34.889> he's<00:05:35.100> whacked<00:05:35.370> out<00:05:35.520> on<00:05:35.580> some

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
looks like he's whacked out on some

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.960 
looks like he's whacked out on some
drugs<00:05:36.240> so<00:05:36.930> yeah<00:05:37.199> poison<00:05:38.130> and<00:05:38.310> he's<00:05:38.669> naked

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
drugs so yeah poison and he's naked

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.700 
drugs so yeah poison and he's naked
roaming<00:05:39.330> around<00:05:39.540> the<00:05:39.780> streets<00:05:40.080> at<00:05:40.229> night<00:05:40.410> I

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
roaming around the streets at night I

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.740 
roaming around the streets at night I
mean<00:05:41.490> if<00:05:41.610> I<00:05:41.669> was<00:05:41.790> the<00:05:41.880> cop<00:05:42.060> I'd<00:05:42.240> probably<00:05:42.510> keep

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
mean if I was the cop I'd probably keep

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.440 
mean if I was the cop I'd probably keep
my<00:05:42.870> distance<00:05:43.020> too<00:05:43.550> that's<00:05:44.550> probably<00:05:44.760> I<00:05:44.820> didn't

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
my distance too that's probably I didn't

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.080 
my distance too that's probably I didn't
approach<00:05:45.690> him<00:05:45.930> he<00:05:46.229> was<00:05:46.320> over<00:05:46.470> in<00:05:46.530> his<00:05:46.590> car<00:05:47.090> the

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
approach him he was over in his car the

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.450 
approach him he was over in his car the
guy<00:05:48.210> then<00:05:48.240> figured<00:05:48.810> the<00:05:48.960> best<00:05:49.139> idea<00:05:49.680> was<00:05:50.130> to<00:05:50.340> do

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
guy then figured the best idea was to do

00:05:50.460 --> 00:06:00.710 
guy then figured the best idea was to do
this<00:05:57.530> jump<00:05:58.530> in<00:05:58.830> and<00:05:59.220> steal<00:05:59.639> the<00:05:59.940> cop<00:06:00.150> car<00:06:00.389> while

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
this jump in and steal the cop car while

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.540 
this jump in and steal the cop car while
you're<00:06:00.870> naked<00:06:01.080> and<00:06:01.560> hopped<00:06:01.830> up<00:06:02.010> on<00:06:02.250> drugs

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
you're naked and hopped up on drugs

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.120 
you're naked and hopped up on drugs
probably<00:06:03.389> not<00:06:03.450> the<00:06:03.570> best<00:06:03.630> idea<00:06:03.840> okay<00:06:04.320> I<00:06:04.530> mean

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
probably not the best idea okay I mean

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.310
