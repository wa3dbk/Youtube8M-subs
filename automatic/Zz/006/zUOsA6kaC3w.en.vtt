00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.410
 now will 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.490
 What else can I do? 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:33.390
 I plant something in here and maybe 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:35.100
 even here my hat knows what to do 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.660
 you because there you know I must in my 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.129
 Garden urgently a few beautiful 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.760
 useful and fast-growing shrubs 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.379
 plants 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.120
 I want my garden in front of this 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.620
 protect the wind if only I knew where 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.559
 I should plant the plants because of the wind 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.180
 blows from all sides as simple as 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.860
 The problem can not solve times 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.329
 a row will certainly not be superior 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.469
 enough you need animal stories 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.809
 young and here 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.280
 that's it we plant around yours 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.410
 house several hedges like a labyrinth 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.790
 best you have then no wind march 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.620
 It looks and looks so beautiful 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.289
 third, think of the recreational value 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.289
 This is what holistic planning is called 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.750
 one of her and here yes that is 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.190
 a very good job here and here 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.780
 perfectly awarded we have to go where 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.180
 He will also plant something in the plant 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.430
 then a brilliant dead end why 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.040
 do we need an akasaba berry? 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.810
 a labyrinth is just fun if it is 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.430
 quite a lot of dead ends are otherwise can 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.650
 you do not sell yourself but 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.630
 Parents if I am now fully on her 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.159
 no longer knows where to know how is 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.020
 I will find it at home 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.740
 you have a plan here and that 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.740
 had the group 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.270
 When Barry and I had the idea one 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.399
 We only wanted to plant hedge so 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.020
 just as possible was first 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.090
 this planting only as protection against 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.740
 not planned but then it came to me 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.600
 ingenious idea this would have like one 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.789
 to plant maze so that we can then 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.520
 spring all together our fun and 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.020
 can find relaxation in it 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.119
 what's fun with a labyrinth ? 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.250
 l we are on the way and you 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.140
 you will experience it yourself as you are sure 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.939
 already noticed the labyrinth 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.979
 a lot of different ways though 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.200
 only one of these routes leads directly into 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.180
 the middle of this garden starts here 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.590
 the fun because right now we are in 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.519
 a little competition against each other 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.080
 compete 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.239
 the first of the middle of the labyrinth 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.310
 barry other reaches bet whoever there in 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.090
 sleep his house winter and that is 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.090
 then the winner 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:51.830
 a great i am told i am coming 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.850
 do not go out and hold the card 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.790
 not left 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.400
 Pom Pom Pom Pom Pom Pom Pom come from 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.800
 and now here long 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.490
 company pom pom pom pom you have yourselves 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:10.400
 run 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:12.620
 you should hurry better here 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.540
 long then take the path and already 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.370
 I am there we are hungry 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.050
 you should interrupt your game altogether 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.630
 officially so we can eat 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.190
 You really want to shame her 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.780
 this beautiful dhabi wind and its 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.610
 but do not want to discover possibilities 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.020
 against laziness can not do anything 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.760
 So I help you to find the way 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.489
 Will you please follow me? 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.620
 along 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.620
 now do not shake it 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.570
 here we were already would be 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.130
 always everything knows that we are safe 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:19.080
 I'm sure I'll go right 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.820
 this card shows where do you look like 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.980
 windy it is outside the labyrinth 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.880
 but here it is totally 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:29.630
 windless 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.630
 I thirsty jumpy service water 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.480
 half as bad we just have to berrys 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.430
 find a house 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.360
 So he does not have a lot of supplies 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:05:10.130
 you must be so hungry one of 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:05:11.000
 you said something he is without a trace 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.890
 disappeared 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.660
 there is nothing edible anymore and that 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:20.840
 Well is hidden somewhere in the lab 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:23.260
 first time I have you drink 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.260
 to get 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:31.700
 nothing that you are the hero you are 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:37.130
 only one suspicion i had the same 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:39.290
 Yesterday still on those stupid 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.910
 how one of these metric we are 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.990
 lost 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:58.590
 lost is understated 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:58.590
 four times in excess that one him 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.870
 wonderful when the wind started to talk 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.880
 is so tremendously practical i have 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.710
 no idea where our stupid idea 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.960
 anna bÃ¼hren now threatens to come 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.820
 he should never plant one 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.380
 wand tries but we can completely 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.380
 sure again so full on
