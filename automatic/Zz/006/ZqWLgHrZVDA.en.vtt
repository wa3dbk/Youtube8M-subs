00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.840

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.160
 to achieve it let's see the hair is like a 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.279
 plant that we must take care of many 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.260
 people tend to neglect it or 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.750
 put a lot of chemicals 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.850
 that often destroy it many times 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.110
 dehydrate them or eliminate those 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.909
 components that he already has 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.949
