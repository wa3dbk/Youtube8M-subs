bicycle<00:00:59.000> so<00:00:59.960> now<00:01:00.170> what<00:01:00.650> we're<00:01:00.800> going<00:01:00.949> to<00:01:01.070> do

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
bicycle so now what we're going to do

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.880 
bicycle so now what we're going to do
for<00:01:01.460> the<00:01:01.550> remainder<00:01:01.670> of<00:01:02.090> this<00:01:02.300> check<00:01:02.660> is<00:01:02.900> we're

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
for the remainder of this check is we're

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.520 
for the remainder of this check is we're
going<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:04.160> make<00:01:04.400> four<00:01:05.089> single<00:01:06.020> crochets<00:01:06.500> in

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
going to make four single crochets in

going to make four single crochets in
each<00:01:07.430> stitch<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:08.360> that's<00:01:08.840> going<00:01:09.200> to<00:01:09.350> cause

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
each stitch and that's going to cause

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.490 
each stitch and that's going to cause
the<00:01:09.890> worked<00:01:10.100> curl<00:01:10.580> so<00:01:11.360> it<00:01:11.540> just<00:01:11.780> gets<00:01:11.990> started

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
the worked curl so it just gets started

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.590 
the worked curl so it just gets started
doing<00:01:12.770> that<00:01:12.979> so<00:01:13.280> here's<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:13.880> first<00:01:14.090> stitch

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
doing that so here's the first stitch

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.170 
doing that so here's the first stitch
after<00:01:14.869> my<00:01:15.140> last<00:01:15.380> slip<00:01:15.770> stitch<00:01:15.820> I'm<00:01:16.820> going<00:01:16.910> to

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
after my last slip stitch I'm going to

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.160 
after my last slip stitch I'm going to
make<00:01:17.330> four<00:01:17.690> single<00:01:18.440> crochets<00:01:18.950> one<00:01:19.460> two<00:01:21.399> three

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
make four single crochets one two three

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.170 
make four single crochets one two three
four<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:25.070> can<00:01:25.250> see<00:01:25.490> that<00:01:25.640> it<00:01:25.789> has<00:01:25.940> a<00:01:25.970> little

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
four you can see that it has a little

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.420 
four you can see that it has a little
bump<00:01:26.509> and<00:01:26.660> it's<00:01:26.810> going<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.080> start<00:01:27.350> to<00:01:27.530> curl<00:01:27.770> the

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
bump and it's going to start to curl the

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.800 
bump and it's going to start to curl the
next<00:01:28.820> stitch<00:01:29.300> is<00:01:29.330> here<00:01:30.670> and<00:01:31.670> I'm<00:01:32.420> going<00:01:32.780> to

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
next stitch is here and I'm going to

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:40.990 
next stitch is here and I'm going to
make<00:01:33.140> four<00:01:34.630> single<00:01:35.630> crochets<00:01:39.490> go<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:40.789> next

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
make four single crochets go to the next

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.050 
make four single crochets go to the next
stitch<00:01:41.539> make<00:01:42.200> four<00:01:42.590> single<00:01:43.220> crochets

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.170 

go<00:01:49.600> to<00:01:49.660> the<00:01:49.870> next<00:01:50.080> stitch<00:01:50.560> make<00:01:51.190> four<00:01:51.520> single

go to the next stitch make four single
crochets

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.120 

now<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:02.240> can<00:02:02.480> see<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.080> work<00:02:03.260> wants<00:02:04.010> to

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
now you can see that the work wants to

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.880 
now you can see that the work wants to
curl<00:02:04.370> on<00:02:04.610> its<00:02:04.820> own<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:06.380> we're<00:02:06.470> just<00:02:06.530> going<00:02:06.860> to

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
curl on its own so we're just going to

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.800 
curl on its own so we're just going to
continue<00:02:07.340> doing<00:02:07.490> that<00:02:07.610> all<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.149> way<00:02:08.270> up<00:02:08.509> the

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
continue doing that all the way up the

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:21.280 
continue doing that all the way up the
chain<00:02:13.090> one<00:02:14.090> two<00:02:16.660> three<00:02:18.910> four<00:02:19.910> go<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.959> next

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
chain one two three four go to the next

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:30.130 
chain one two three four go to the next
stitch<00:02:22.690> make<00:02:23.690> four<00:02:24.050> single<00:02:24.500> crochets<00:02:29.080> okay<00:02:30.080> so

stitch make four single crochets okay so
I'll<00:02:30.500> continue<00:02:30.890> to<00:02:31.070> do<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:32.000> same<00:02:32.450> process<00:02:32.750> of

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
I'll continue to do that same process of

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.490 
I'll continue to do that same process of

to the end of the chain and what I'm
going<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.660> do<00:03:05.870> now<00:03:06.080> is<00:03:06.440> I'm<00:03:06.769> going<00:03:06.980> to<00:03:07.190> go<00:03:07.340> down

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
going to do now is I'm going to go down

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.640 
going to do now is I'm going to go down
into<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.660> first<00:03:09.040> opening<00:03:10.040> that<00:03:10.310> I<00:03:10.340> see<00:03:11.560> see<00:03:12.560> if

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
into the first opening that I see see if

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.490 
into the first opening that I see see if
I<00:03:12.739> can<00:03:12.950> get<00:03:13.160> that<00:03:13.370> so<00:03:13.580> you<00:03:13.730> can<00:03:13.880> see<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:14.269> just<00:03:14.500> to

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
I can get that so you can see it just to

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.850 
I can get that so you can see it just to
join<00:03:16.130> this<00:03:16.370> top<00:03:16.760> so<00:03:17.209> that<00:03:17.360> it's<00:03:17.540> not<00:03:17.860> sticking

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
join this top so that it's not sticking

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.280 
join this top so that it's not sticking
up<00:03:19.130> straight<00:03:19.880> I'm<00:03:20.510> just<00:03:20.720> going<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:20.959> go<00:03:21.080> down

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
up straight I'm just going to go down

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.979 
up straight I'm just going to go down
into<00:03:21.680> one<00:03:21.950> of<00:03:22.100> these<00:03:22.299> openings<00:03:23.299> and<00:03:23.630> just

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
into one of these openings and just

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.039 
into one of these openings and just
going<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.320> slip<00:03:24.680> stitch<00:03:25.120> to<00:03:26.120> join<00:03:26.150> that<00:03:26.750> and

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
going to slip stitch to join that and

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.910 
going to slip stitch to join that and
you<00:03:27.620> can<00:03:27.799> just<00:03:28.040> rearrange<00:03:28.310> your<00:03:29.709> bicycle<00:03:30.709> so

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
you can just rearrange your bicycle so

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.370 
you can just rearrange your bicycle so
that<00:03:31.070> your<00:03:31.250> folds<00:03:31.700> are<00:03:31.820> all<00:03:32.140> working<00:03:33.140> in<00:03:33.260> the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
that your folds are all working in the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.580 
that your folds are all working in the
right<00:03:33.560> direction<00:03:33.799> and<00:03:34.670> so<00:03:34.870> now<00:03:35.870> we<00:03:35.930> can<00:03:36.049> chain

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
right direction and so now we can chain

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.920 
right direction and so now we can chain
to<00:03:37.010> make<00:03:37.160> a<00:03:37.220> holder<00:03:37.730> we're<00:03:37.940> going<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.269> chain<00:03:38.540> on

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
to make a holder we're going to chain on

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:46.800 
to make a holder we're going to chain on

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
12 14 16 and then we're just going to

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.580 
12 14 16 and then we're just going to
come<00:03:54.280> right<00:03:54.459> back<00:03:54.670> down<00:03:54.970> we're<00:03:55.480> going<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.900> slip

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
come right back down we're going to slip

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.000 
come right back down we're going to slip
stitch<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:58.060> join<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:58.630> right<00:03:59.380> in<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.740> same

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
stitch to join it right in the same

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.130 
stitch to join it right in the same
position<00:04:00.670> that<00:04:00.910> we<00:04:01.660> joined<00:04:02.620> that<00:04:03.310> top<00:04:03.640> loop<00:04:04.140> so

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
position that we joined that top loop so

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.260 
position that we joined that top loop so
we've<00:04:05.560> just<00:04:05.590> made<00:04:06.010> a<00:04:06.040> holder<00:04:06.610> by<00:04:06.940> slip

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
we've just made a holder by slip

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.229 
we've just made a holder by slip
stitching<00:04:07.569> there<00:04:08.020> to<00:04:08.260> join<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:08.860> now<00:04:09.610> we<00:04:10.060> can

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
stitching there to join and now we can

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:17.180 
stitching there to join and now we can
fasten<00:04:10.780> off<00:04:13.050> like<00:04:14.050> that<00:04:14.380> and<00:04:15.450> whenever<00:04:16.450> I<00:04:16.780> end

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
curly ribbon on the top of the icicle

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.080 
curly ribbon on the top of the icicle
and<00:05:30.900> then<00:05:31.620> we<00:05:31.710> can<00:05:31.860> just<00:05:32.040> go<00:05:32.190> ahead<00:05:32.220> and<00:05:32.699> curl

um<00:05:55.669> can<00:05:56.669> always<00:05:56.970> be<00:05:57.210> split<00:05:57.860> usually<00:05:58.860> if<00:05:59.070> you

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
um can always be split usually if you

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.640 
um can always be split usually if you
have<00:05:59.370> the<00:05:59.490> same<00:05:59.729> brand<00:06:00.060> I<00:06:00.300> think<00:06:00.330> most<00:06:01.260> of<00:06:01.470> them

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
have the same brand I think most of them

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:07.310 
have the same brand I think most of them
do<00:06:02.160> this<00:06:02.340> you<00:06:02.580> can<00:06:02.760> split<00:06:03.090> them<00:06:03.300> into<00:06:03.510> two<00:06:06.320> just

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
do this you can split them into two just
