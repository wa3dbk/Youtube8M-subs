 I have never loved a vacation 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.619
 I've always had a lot 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.969
 especially when I go on vacation 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.859
 persistent 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.509
 a little less because now usually go very bad

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.110
 how does your dream vacation look like from you 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.790

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.829
 friends 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.140

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:30.129
 friends say go backpacking 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:33.400

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.280
 do things because are also to prove 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.470
 you been times we went to a 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.959

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.239

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.319

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.359
 want to do it again 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.079
 would you rather swim in the sea or in the 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.719
 swimming pool 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.730

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:58.290
 was so afraid of fishing 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.120
 and after that occur in the sea 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.680
 that would rather be a swimming pool 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.459
 speak a nice word of foreign 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.379
