decision as he could have been slammed
right<00:01:51.380> into<00:01:51.590> that<00:01:52.009> triangle<00:01:52.520> choke<00:01:52.729> it<00:01:53.299> does

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
right into that triangle choke it does

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.779 
right into that triangle choke it does
look<00:01:53.750> deeper<00:01:54.170> if<00:01:54.259> PL<00:01:54.680> can<00:01:54.799> just<00:01:55.039> get<00:01:55.219> that<00:01:55.399> chin

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
look deeper if PL can just get that chin

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.550 
look deeper if PL can just get that chin
behind<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.359> knee<00:01:56.539> he'll<00:01:57.049> be<00:01:57.140> able<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.320> finish

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
behind the knee he'll be able to finish

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.080 
behind the knee he'll be able to finish
that<00:01:57.770> triangle<00:01:58.219> and<00:01:58.310> he<00:01:58.369> swung<00:01:58.640> out<00:01:58.820> to<00:01:58.969> the

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
that triangle and he swung out to the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.630 
that triangle and he swung out to the
side<00:01:59.329> here<00:01:59.659> but<00:02:00.109> Cepeda<00:02:00.469> posturing<00:02:01.130> up<00:02:01.250> really

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
side here but Cepeda posturing up really

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.300 
side here but Cepeda posturing up really
high<00:02:02.350> now<00:02:03.350> it<00:02:03.500> looks<00:02:03.680> like<00:02:03.740> he's<00:02:04.009> trying<00:02:04.189> to

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
high now it looks like he's trying to

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.219 
high now it looks like he's trying to
look<00:02:04.490> for<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.759> leg<00:02:04.969> lock<00:02:05.180> to<00:02:05.390> eating<00:02:05.719> some<00:02:05.899> shots

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229
