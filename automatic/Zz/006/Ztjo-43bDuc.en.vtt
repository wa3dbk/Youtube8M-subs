00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.370
 how 

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.370
 ah 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.270
 very good everyone here again with more 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.860
 bat and phil 4 and today with another review in 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.950
 this time we have a very special one 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.990
 from sr 338 a shooter rifle 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.820
 designated only available for 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.920
 Recognition class over phil 4 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.689
 and which was considered as one of 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.250
 the worst weapons in the game until 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.570
 received some changes in the last 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.369
 update we will be seeing 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.160
 what were those changes for example 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.840
 but as always I'll first start 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.430
 talking about weapon statistics 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.170
 to then move on to talk about everything 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.000
 that was my personal experience with the 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.800
 same and the accessories that I recommend 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.719
 use even though this weapon does not 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.670
 have access to too many already we are going to 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.989
 talk about that too later now 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.420
 yes starting with statistics 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.359
 we have a maximum year of 50 and a damage 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.550
 minimum of 38 is the only rifle shooter 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:57.129
 designated that has a unique damage of 50 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.890
 maximum and also has access to 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.600
 long distance sights which makes it 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.789
 that is only available for 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.590
 recognition class also which 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.050
 begins to fall this year that we have 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.400
 said at 15 meters and ends 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.640
 descend or that is going to be the damage 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.260
 minimum of 38 from 150 meters in 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.120
 ahead or that up to 100 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.760
 meters will be doing around 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.290
 of 40 damage which is very but very 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.570
 high and very, very good for long 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.180
 distances also has a cadence of 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.160
 shot of 150 rounds per minute the 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.190
 which travel at 600 meters per second 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.290
 this this was one of the changes and 30 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.710
 330 meters forgiveness per second if you 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.630
 has a silencer equipped here what 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.580
 we see is that the big problem that has 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.140
 this weapon is that it only has 150 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.690
 rounds per minute of firing rate 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.760
 which is very, very low obviously 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.650
 with a designated rifle shooter is not 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.330
 just as real life is as 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.700
 quick that one can shoot no no 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.700
 they have a defined trigger rate 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.830
 like other firearms but for a 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.229
 Balance theme inside the game is 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.320
 decided that you have waves only 150 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.700
 rounds per minute this year continuing with 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.770
 the statistics we have a speed 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.360
 recharge 23 seconds and still 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.940
 we have even a bullet in the 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.320
 charger or in the bedroom or 26 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.360
 seconds there is not a big difference the 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.700
 true if we have the gun and the chamber 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.560
 completely empty to finish 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.260
 with aesthetics we have a setback 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.030
 vertical of 0.6 to the left of 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.760
 black 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.770
 0.1 and for the right of 0.3 with a 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.739
 multiplier of the first shot of 2 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.750
 as you can see the case of the recoil is 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.340
 more than anything vertical after that 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.510
 many will not notice and especially 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.910
 as it has a wait rate 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.010
 quite low is practically 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.840
 non-existent the recoil but as 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.370
 you can see right now on the screen what 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.410
 that makes the weapon is bouncing a bit to 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.580
 up every time we shoot it but 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.140
 now turning a little something that 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.959
 we had mentioned at the beginning of 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.640
 video is that lcr 338 receives in this 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.440
 September patch changes very 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.090
 important and that in my opinion they are very 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.830
 hand in hand with the category to which 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.600
 belongs if that the first and more 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.880
 important is the issue of dispersion 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.410
 of the bullets as many will already know the 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.450
 problem with this rifle was that it 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.220
 it became extremely inaccurate if 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.920
 we tried to shoot at a speed 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.600
 fairly decent which ruined 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.850
 completely his role as a rifle 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.560
 precision what we want we are 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.030
 medium and long distances have a weapon 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.769
 very, very, very accurate when 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.840
 use an armed like a rifle 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.670
 sniper for example how can 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.560
 see during this video that is no longer a 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.120
 problem and I can take advantage of its great 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.130
 capacity at the time of what they are a 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.230
 more and more medium and long distances 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.080
 for its high damage as for its accuracy 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.430
 in them they can try to use it 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.890
 at short distances but I would 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.540
 I would recommend something that I learned while 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.850
 what I was using it is to look for those 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.430
 rare angles narrow angles in the 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.950
 which is exposed very little of the body of 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.720
 either yours and your rival too but 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.180
 you have the small advantage or the 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.160
 great advantage better said that your weapon 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.500
 is completely accurate and that only 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.750
 they need to hit two shots of the 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.030
 days that have the charger to finish 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.860
 with an objective that is or with enemy 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.960
 which is 15 meters for less or 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.670
 only one bullet if they are lucky 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.980
 of pearl a shot in the head no 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.960
 while the enemy is going to have 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.420
 example that doing such five shots 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.370
 six shots with a weapon with as a 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.500
 for example assault rifle and also 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.690
 of that if it is at a very narrow angle 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.130
 that very covered both your body and 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.200
 your rival's you have a weapon 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.420
 much but much more accurate than that of 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.740
 a friend who is probably going to 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.330
 spend the vast majority of bullets 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.500
 shooting at anything that is 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.540
 what is covering you 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.000
 now in addition to this he is also 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.130
 changed the issue of the speed of 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.300
 bullets happened to be 600 meters by 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.010
 second as we mentioned earlier 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.080
 if you do not have a fitted silencer 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.460
 in which once again it goes very well with the 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.920
 hand what the rifles 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.810
 designated shooter and now like to go 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.610
 closing the video my recommendation for 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.620
 the accessories is the following for 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.730
 start a half distance look 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.910
 that is where they will most want to be 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.070
 using this rifle as a second or 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.660
 first accessory I would not recommend them 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.880
 use nothing in reality but if you 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.590
 encourage to turn off a laser sight when not 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.930
 the need you can add the look 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.060
 laser obviously in the subject the accessory 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.220
 of the canyon I would recommend only the 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.080
 suppressor suppressor in spanish that 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.970
 it is the accessory that the only thing that makes 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.650
 is to make disappear the flash of the 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.270
 gun once we shoot it for 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.530
 keep a little more stealth that is not 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.030
 hit us in the flash when we are 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.220
 firing the rest of the sensors there 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.410
 they will serve us too much 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.419
 auxiliary accessory can choose whether 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.919
 have the beep or or if you do not have the 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.570
 only difference is that if they have the beep 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.820
 or can not use the system 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.740
 coverage to your advantage but at the same time 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.510
 Nor is obviously the beep or not 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.070
 but 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.050
 as always I hope you liked it 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.580
 this video do not forget to follow me on 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.480
 social networks and see you the 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.480
 next chao 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.570
 yes
