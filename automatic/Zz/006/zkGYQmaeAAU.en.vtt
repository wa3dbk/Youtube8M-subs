00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
if wrong this is ross and today i'm

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.410 
if wrong this is ross and today i'm
gonna<00:00:03.540> be<00:00:03.720> explainin<00:00:04.350> house<00:00:04.500> yes<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.980> bricks

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
gonna be explainin house yes the bricks

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.930 
gonna be explainin house yes the bricks
benefit<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.540> planted<00:00:06.870> aquarium<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:08.040> so<00:00:08.880> if

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
benefit the planted aquarium and so if

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.250 
benefit the planted aquarium and so if
you<00:00:09.030> don't<00:00:09.150> know<00:00:09.300> what's<00:00:09.450> just<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.809> break<00:00:09.960> so

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
you don't know what's just a break so

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.589 
you don't know what's just a break so
it's<00:00:10.650> basically<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.370> period<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:12.000> two<00:00:12.330> or<00:00:12.450> three

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
it's basically a period of two or three

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.870 
it's basically a period of two or three
hours<00:00:12.929> throughout<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.440> day<00:00:13.700> eating<00:00:14.700> enough

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
hours throughout the day eating enough

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.599 
hours throughout the day eating enough
all<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.269> aquarium<00:00:15.660> lights<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.460> close<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
all the aquarium lights I close the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.790 
all the aquarium lights I close the
blinds<00:00:17.850> if<00:00:18.090> it's<00:00:18.240> near<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> window<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.170> you

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
blinds if it's near a window and you

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.349 
blinds if it's near a window and you
just<00:00:19.949> leave<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.310> aquarium<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.910> complete

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
just leave the aquarium in complete

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.410 
just leave the aquarium in complete
darkness<00:00:21.689> for<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.020> few<00:00:22.289> hours<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:23.420> that's

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
darkness for a few hours and that's

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.450 
darkness for a few hours and that's
basically<00:00:25.230> just<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.800> give<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.039> plants<00:00:26.369> a

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
basically just to give the plants a

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.150 
basically just to give the plants a
break<00:00:26.699> from<00:00:26.939> photosynthesis<00:00:27.949> because<00:00:28.949> it's

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
break from photosynthesis because it's

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.679 
break from photosynthesis because it's
most<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.519> know<00:00:29.580> plan<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.539> use

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
most of you know plan to use

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.139 
most of you know plan to use
photosynthesis<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.830> make<00:00:32.040> food<00:00:32.969> for

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
photosynthesis to make food for

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.740 
photosynthesis to make food for
themselves<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:34.640> that<00:00:35.640> food<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> form

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
themselves and that food is in the form

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.110 
themselves and that food is in the form
of<00:00:36.840> glucose<00:00:37.410> which<00:00:38.309> then<00:00:38.520> goes<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.000> make

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
of glucose which then goes on to make

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.830 
of glucose which then goes on to make
energy<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.070> that<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> plant<00:00:41.399> needs<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.730> grow

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.049 

so<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.230> order<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.590> carry<00:00:47.039> out<00:00:47.129> photosynthesis

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
so in order to carry out photosynthesis

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.360 
so in order to carry out photosynthesis
plants<00:00:48.510> need<00:00:48.899> carbon<00:00:49.050> dioxide<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:51.329> water

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
plants need carbon dioxide and and water

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.910 
plants need carbon dioxide and and water
they<00:00:53.370> then<00:00:53.579> use<00:00:53.850> late<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:55.020> make<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.620> carbon

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
they then use late to make the carbon

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.220 
they then use late to make the carbon
dioxide<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.610> water<00:00:56.670> into<00:00:57.090> glucose<00:00:58.020> and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
dioxide and water into glucose and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.130 
dioxide and water into glucose and
oxygen<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.760> now<00:00:59.940> they've<00:01:00.120> got<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.600> glucose

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
oxygen so now they've got the glucose

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.959 
oxygen so now they've got the glucose
underneath<00:01:01.680> but<00:01:02.070> then<00:01:02.280> release<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.820> oxygen

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
underneath but then release the oxygen

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.859 
underneath but then release the oxygen
back<00:01:03.629> into<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> water<00:01:04.199> for<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> fish<00:01:04.830> and

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
back into the water for the fish and

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.179 
back into the water for the fish and
plants<00:01:06.869> also<00:01:07.080> need<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.409> carry<00:01:07.710> out<00:01:07.830> something

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
plants also need to carry out something

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.539 
plants also need to carry out something
called<00:01:08.460> respiration<00:01:09.360> which<00:01:10.229> tends<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.040> food

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
called respiration which tends the food

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.719 
called respiration which tends the food
that<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.150> made<00:01:12.360> which<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> glucose<00:01:13.729> into

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
that it's made which is the glucose into

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.649 
that it's made which is the glucose into
energy<00:01:15.049> that<00:01:16.049> needs<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.470> grow<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:17.970> this

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
energy that needs to grow so this

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.780 
energy that needs to grow so this
process<00:01:19.140> respiration<00:01:19.830> can<00:01:20.100> happen<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
process respiration can happen in the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.090 
process respiration can happen in the
light<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.900> can<00:01:22.020> also<00:01:22.140> happen<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> dock

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
light but it can also happen in the dock

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.310 
light but it can also happen in the dock
and<00:01:23.479> that's<00:01:24.479> why<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.689> turn<00:01:24.960> off<00:01:25.140> all<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
and that's why you turn off all the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.499 
and that's why you turn off all the
aquarium<00:01:25.740> lights<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.369> stops<00:01:27.090> full<00:01:27.360> of

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
aquarium lights it stops full of

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.710 
aquarium lights it stops full of
synthesis<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.369> allows<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.610> plants<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.479> carry

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
synthesis and allows the plants to carry

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.649 
synthesis and allows the plants to carry
out<00:01:30.900> respiration<00:01:32.000> so<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.060> carry<00:01:33.509> out

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
out respiration so to carry out

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.140 
out respiration so to carry out
respiration<00:01:34.439> what<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> plank<00:01:35.430> does<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.880> takes

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
respiration what the plank does is takes

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.020 
respiration what the plank does is takes
glucose<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.990> oxygen<00:01:37.400> it's<00:01:38.400> already<00:01:38.640> made<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
glucose and oxygen it's already made the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.880 
glucose and oxygen it's already made the
glucose<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:39.840> already<00:01:40.170> made<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.439> oxygen

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
glucose and it's already made the oxygen

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.760 
glucose and it's already made the oxygen
and<00:01:43.040> it<00:01:44.040> converts<00:01:44.490> those<00:01:44.970> into<00:01:45.570> water<00:01:45.810> pure

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
and it converts those into water pure

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.889 
and it converts those into water pure
energy<00:01:47.040> which<00:01:47.460> they<00:01:47.610> need<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.000> grow<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.399 

carbon<00:01:51.899> dioxide<00:01:51.930> again<00:01:53.030> so<00:01:54.030> when<00:01:54.930> it's<00:01:55.140> dark

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
carbon dioxide again so when it's dark

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.770 
carbon dioxide again so when it's dark
the<00:01:56.070> plants<00:01:56.549> or<00:01:56.759> me<00:01:56.969> again<00:01:57.180> energy<00:01:57.570> for

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
the plants or me again energy for

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.859 
the plants or me again energy for
themselves<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.860> also<00:01:59.130> carbon<00:01:59.880> dioxide<00:02:00.630> which

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
themselves but also carbon dioxide which

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.530 
themselves but also carbon dioxide which
goes<00:02:01.140> back<00:02:01.380> into<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.829> water<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:03.210> plants

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
goes back into the water and the plants

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.170 
goes back into the water and the plants
can<00:02:03.689> use<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:03.960> calm<00:02:04.259> dioxide<00:02:04.890> they<00:02:05.820> carry<00:02:06.060> out

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
can use this calm dioxide they carry out

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.499 
can use this calm dioxide they carry out
for<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.600> symphysis<00:02:06.990> again<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.640> period

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
for the symphysis again so in a period

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.229 
for the symphysis again so in a period
of<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.750> few<00:02:09.780> hours<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:11.090> they're<00:02:12.090> actually

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
of a few hours and they're actually

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.490 
of a few hours and they're actually
producing<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.170> lot

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
producing a lot

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.280 
producing a lot
carbon<00:02:13.800> dioxide<00:02:14.360> but<00:02:15.360> they<00:02:15.480> can<00:02:15.690> use<00:02:16.080> the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
carbon dioxide but they can use the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.680 
carbon dioxide but they can use the
photosynthesize<00:02:17.190> again<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.330> helping

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
photosynthesize again so the helping

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.870 
photosynthesize again so the helping
themselves<00:02:18.900> grow<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:20.430> you're<00:02:20.520> just<00:02:20.640> turning

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
themselves grow so you're just turning

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.690 
themselves grow so you're just turning
your<00:02:21.180> crime<00:02:21.390> rates<00:02:21.630> off<00:02:21.840> for<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.170> few<00:02:22.470> hours

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
your crime rates off for a few hours

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.970 
your crime rates off for a few hours
throughout<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.880> day<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.590> will<00:02:25.590> create<00:02:25.770> the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
throughout the day and will create the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.560 
throughout the day and will create the
improve<00:02:26.430> plant<00:02:26.820> growth<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.270> that's<00:02:27.420> what

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
improve plant growth and that's what

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.750 
improve plant growth and that's what
I've<00:02:27.690> been<00:02:27.810> doing<00:02:28.080> lately<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:29.370> plants

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
I've been doing lately and the plants

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.980 
I've been doing lately and the plants
are<00:02:29.820> just<00:02:30.000> looking<00:02:30.180> brilliant<00:02:30.690> like<00:02:30.840> this

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
are just looking brilliant like this

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.650 
are just looking brilliant like this
rautela<00:02:31.440> here<00:02:31.770> it's<00:02:32.280> getting<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.550> liver<00:02:32.760> pink

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
rautela here it's getting a liver pink

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.440 
rautela here it's getting a liver pink
end<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.650> one<00:02:34.830> over<00:02:35.010> there<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.820> the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
end to it that one over there and the

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.570 
end to it that one over there and the
lid<00:02:36.600> with<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.320> liberal<00:02:37.740> get<00:02:37.890> started<00:02:38.310> grew<00:02:38.459> as

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
lid with the liberal get started grew as

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.630 
lid with the liberal get started grew as
well<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:40.200> tank<00:02:40.770> is<00:02:40.890> looking<00:02:41.190> really<00:02:41.370> nice

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
well so this tank is looking really nice

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.699 
well so this tank is looking really nice
at<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.000> minute<00:02:42.240> and<00:02:42.420> that's<00:02:42.630> just<00:02:42.900> me<00:02:43.080> because

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
at the minute and that's just me because

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.410 
at the minute and that's just me because
I've<00:02:43.860> been<00:02:43.890> there<00:02:45.020> doing<00:02:46.020> CS<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.410> bricks<00:02:47.420> so

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
I've been there doing CS the bricks so

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.170 
I've been there doing CS the bricks so
I'll<00:02:48.600> just<00:02:48.630> go<00:02:49.020> over<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.230> one<00:02:49.350> more<00:02:49.380> time<00:02:49.709> and

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
I'll just go over it one more time and

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.640 
I'll just go over it one more time and
the<00:02:51.180> plants<00:02:51.480> thing<00:02:51.630> for<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.989> synthesis<00:02:52.500> in

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
the plants thing for the synthesis in

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.340 
the plants thing for the synthesis in
the<00:02:52.770> light<00:02:52.980> which<00:02:53.610> produces<00:02:54.150> oxygen<00:02:54.600> not

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
the light which produces oxygen not

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.370 
the light which produces oxygen not
going<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.590> go<00:02:55.680> into<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:56.040> in<00:02:56.190> too<00:02:56.400> much<00:02:56.520> detail

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
going to go into it in too much detail

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.949 
going to go into it in too much detail
then<00:02:58.380> when<00:02:58.650> it's<00:02:58.830> dark<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.850> take<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.510> that

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
then when it's dark the take in that

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.380 
then when it's dark the take in that
oxygen<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:02.130> conveyed<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:02.730> in<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.000> carbon

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
oxygen and conveyed it in the carbon

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.320 
oxygen and conveyed it in the carbon
dioxide<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:05.250> they<00:03:05.340> can<00:03:05.489> carry<00:03:05.820> for<00:03:06.239> the

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
dioxide so they can carry for the

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.660 
dioxide so they can carry for the
synthesis<00:03:06.930> again<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.620> it's<00:03:08.040> brilliant<00:03:08.520> from

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
synthesis again so it's brilliant from

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.220 
synthesis again so it's brilliant from
the<00:03:08.880> grill<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:10.040> then<00:03:11.660> as<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:12.750> can<00:03:12.870> see<00:03:13.050> it's

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
the grill and then as you can see it's

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.280 
the grill and then as you can see it's
great<00:03:13.470> results<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:14.850> don't<00:03:15.120> need<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.750> CO<00:03:16.080> 2

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
great results so you don't need a CO 2

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.880 
great results so you don't need a CO 2
reactor<00:03:16.650> or<00:03:17.100> co2<00:03:17.340> diffusers<00:03:18.209> all<00:03:19.110> you<00:03:19.410> need<00:03:19.650> is

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
reactor or co2 diffusers all you need is

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.890 
reactor or co2 diffusers all you need is
to<00:03:20.340> just<00:03:20.610> turn<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.030> aquarium<00:03:21.330> lights<00:03:21.540> off<00:03:21.720> for

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
to just turn the aquarium lights off for

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.590 
to just turn the aquarium lights off for
a<00:03:21.930> few<00:03:22.080> hours<00:03:22.140> every<00:03:22.650> day<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:23.360> I<00:03:24.360> wouldn't

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
a few hours every day and I wouldn't

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.340 
a few hours every day and I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:25.080> for<00:03:25.350> hard<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.070> grow<00:03:26.250> plants<00:03:26.730> and

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
recommend it for hard to grow plants and

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.680 
recommend it for hard to grow plants and
like<00:03:28.350> dwarf<00:03:28.739> baby<00:03:29.130> chaos<00:03:29.400> both<00:03:29.850> for<00:03:30.150> easy<00:03:30.360> grow

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
like dwarf baby chaos both for easy grow

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.990 
like dwarf baby chaos both for easy grow
plants<00:03:31.049> like<00:03:31.230> Ludwig<00:03:31.650> yeah<00:03:31.799> Rotella<00:03:32.519> java

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
plants like Ludwig yeah Rotella java

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.420 
plants like Ludwig yeah Rotella java
thing<00:03:33.330> it's<00:03:34.080> brilliant<00:03:34.380> fallen<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.070> the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
thing it's brilliant fallen and the

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.710 
thing it's brilliant fallen and the
lobster<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.820> love<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:36.950> I<00:03:37.950> know<00:03:38.630> mostly<00:03:39.630> a

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
lobster you love it and I know mostly a

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.280 
lobster you love it and I know mostly a
go<00:03:39.900> at<00:03:40.019> work<00:03:40.290> or<00:03:40.620> school<00:03:40.739> every<00:03:41.370> day<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:42.290> so

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
go at work or school every day and so

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.470 
go at work or school every day and so
useful<00:03:43.739> thing<00:03:43.920> actually<00:03:44.160> have<00:03:44.519> is<00:03:44.850> just<00:03:45.329> a

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
useful thing actually have is just a

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.470 
useful thing actually have is just a
timer<00:03:45.920> it's<00:03:46.920> just<00:03:47.100> plugs<00:03:47.579> in<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.760> socket<00:03:48.209> right

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
timer it's just plugs in a socket right

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.180 
timer it's just plugs in a socket right
there<00:03:48.720> I've<00:03:48.930> just<00:03:48.989> took<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:49.860> off<00:03:49.950> for<00:03:50.160> the

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
there I've just took it off for the

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.970 
there I've just took it off for the
video<00:03:50.549> but<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.660> can<00:03:51.690> buy<00:03:51.930> these<00:03:51.989> really<00:03:52.680> cheap

and in England you can vitamin as the

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.590 
and in England you can vitamin as the
Wilkinsons<00:03:55.950> in<00:03:56.850> America<00:03:57.239> are<00:03:57.329> probably

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
Wilkinsons in America are probably

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.410 
Wilkinsons in America are probably
walmart<00:03:58.140> places<00:03:58.709> like<00:03:58.860> that<00:03:59.070> but<00:03:59.910> I'm<00:04:00.209> yeah

you can buy them really cheap that only

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.910 
you can buy them really cheap that only
cost<00:04:02.400> us<00:04:02.549> two<00:04:02.760> pounds<00:04:03.299> so<00:04:04.019> let's<00:04:04.410> maybe<00:04:04.620> about

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
cost us two pounds so let's maybe about

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.180 
cost us two pounds so let's maybe about
three<00:04:05.340> dollars<00:04:05.549> something<00:04:06.150> like<00:04:06.269> that<00:04:06.480> and

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
three dollars something like that and

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.900 
three dollars something like that and
basically<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.820> set<00:04:09.209> it<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:10.560> turn<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.730> lights

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
basically and set it to turn the lights

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.310 
basically and set it to turn the lights
on<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.180> off<00:04:12.420> at<00:04:12.720> different<00:04:13.110> periods

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
on and off at different periods

and the wrong till maybe nine or ten at
night<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:30.660> and<00:04:31.430> you<00:04:32.430> can<00:04:32.550> do<00:04:32.669> multiple<00:04:32.940> CS<00:04:33.720> the

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
night so and you can do multiple CS the

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.860 
night so and you can do multiple CS the
brakes<00:04:34.080> row<00:04:34.320> of<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.500> day<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:35.570> one<00:04:36.570> every<00:04:36.840> hour

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
brakes row of the day and one every hour

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.650 
brakes row of the day and one every hour
if<00:04:37.199> you<00:04:37.320> like<00:04:37.500> or<00:04:38.400> you<00:04:38.430> can<00:04:38.520> do<00:04:38.759> one<00:04:39.000> huge<00:04:39.419> one

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
if you like or you can do one huge one

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.680 
if you like or you can do one huge one
but<00:04:40.259> I<00:04:40.590> think<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.550> best<00:04:41.759> method<00:04:42.180> is<00:04:42.210> to<00:04:42.449> do

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
but I think the best method is to do

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.939 
but I think the best method is to do
lots<00:04:42.930> of<00:04:43.139> small<00:04:43.880> periods<00:04:44.880> of<00:04:45.000> darkness<00:04:45.210> maybe

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
lots of small periods of darkness maybe

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.620 
lots of small periods of darkness maybe
one<00:04:46.949> hour<00:04:47.130> of<00:04:47.280> darkness<00:04:47.729> every<00:04:48.300> three<00:04:48.600> hours

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
one hour of darkness every three hours

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.439 
one hour of darkness every three hours
of<00:04:49.050> light<00:04:49.350> that<00:04:49.800> would<00:04:50.130> work<00:04:50.430> really<00:04:50.759> well<00:04:53.449> so

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
of light that would work really well so

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:55.670 
of light that would work really well so
yeah<00:04:54.630> that<00:04:54.840> was<00:04:54.930> just<00:04:55.110> basically<00:04:55.410> an

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
yeah that was just basically an

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.600 
yeah that was just basically an
explanation<00:04:56.220> of<00:04:56.759> house<00:04:57.180> yes<00:04:57.509> the<00:04:57.630> brakes<00:04:57.840> can

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
explanation of house yes the brakes can

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.879 
explanation of house yes the brakes can
help<00:04:59.610> your<00:04:59.849> planet<00:05:00.240> aquarium<00:05:00.660> grow<00:05:01.139> and<00:05:03.889> so

update understand its Dean well I've
just<00:05:09.479> been<00:05:09.630> testing<00:05:10.229> the<00:05:10.320> water<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:10.970> it's<00:05:11.970> 0

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
just been testing the water and it's 0

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
just been testing the water and it's 0
ammonia<00:05:12.810> it's<00:05:13.259> got<00:05:13.560> lower<00:05:13.919> levels<00:05:14.340> of<00:05:14.490> nitrate

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
ammonia it's got lower levels of nitrate

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.050 
ammonia it's got lower levels of nitrate
which<00:05:16.320> should<00:05:16.710> turn<00:05:16.949> in<00:05:17.099> an<00:05:17.250> eight<00:05:17.430> free<00:05:17.759> it<00:05:17.880> in

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
which should turn in an eight free it in

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.480 
which should turn in an eight free it in
the<00:05:18.180> next<00:05:18.419> few<00:05:18.660> days<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:19.289> when<00:05:20.160> it<00:05:20.280> does<00:05:20.460> that

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
the next few days and when it does that

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.550 
the next few days and when it does that
it'll<00:05:20.849> be<00:05:20.940> cycled<00:05:21.479> so<00:05:21.780> it'll<00:05:21.930> be<00:05:21.960> ready<00:05:22.199> to<00:05:22.410> put

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
it'll be cycled so it'll be ready to put

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.189 
it'll be cycled so it'll be ready to put
the<00:05:22.650> fate<00:05:22.860> and<00:05:23.009> fission<00:05:23.900> I'm<00:05:24.900> going<00:05:25.050> to<00:05:25.139> be
