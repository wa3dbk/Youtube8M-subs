00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.470
 and 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.350
 when our computer turns on 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.380
 usually 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:20.200
 but in the monitor they show us some 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.520
 traits you learn but it does not start 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.240
 a video 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.710
 as usual 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.439
 it is sometimes problems usually 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.910
 of the memory 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.910
 it may be that memory is 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.430
 defective by the sockets here where 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.560
 they go to memory 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.680
 they are also 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.160
 dirty or full of dust 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.739
 damaged 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.100
 usually first we have to be 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.960
 citizens 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.640
 in our computer 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.290
 have memories many times sometimes 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.590
 the computer as well as now 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.350
 learns but does not start even if they are not 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.800
 in memory exposed whore now 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.360
 learn 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.470
 first of all we have to discard 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.110
 that 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.110
 memory matters to you already 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.400
 the memory we check the memory 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.600
 in this good 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.560
 we clean the memory it may be that this 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.560
 part of here 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.670
 filthy 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.560
 we clean them 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:44.020
 with a common notebook eraser 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.380
 we clean it up we see that this part of the 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.329
 slot where the sockets go 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:54.259
 the generals 13 the most common problem 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.259
 of dirty dirt we clean them here 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.759
 we put it in place 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.759
 for memory 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.460
 we go again 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.330
 we have the learn again 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.480
 again 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.240
 and the image if the problem has been the 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.020
 image has to come out in it 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.020
 on the monitor 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.690
 and the problem persists we have to have 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.000
 account also 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.440
 that can make memory 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.240
 or worth 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.240
 as it is already damaged 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.800
 we play lock the memory you can here 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.840
 we test the memory in the other socket 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.610
 to also rule out that the socket is 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.700
 the damaged 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.710
 Jesus we replace the memory in case of 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.200
 that memory is replaced by a 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.030
 new 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.519
 as long as the new one we have to 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:25.200
 check that it works is not true 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:27.510
 and they tell us that the memory is new but 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.689
 sometimes it helps us then we have to 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.100
 At least check that the 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:38.590
 memory and once proven that 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:42.670
 we test the memory in both sockets 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.550
 and we see the video image is booted if 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.780
 even if the problem still persists, it does not come out 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.520
 the picture 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.300
 on the monitor 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.490
 then we have to take into account 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:59.450
 that the memory problem is no longer 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:03.290
 problem surely of the sockets 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.920
 they are dirty or defective and not 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.150
 they take the memory in neither of the two 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.000
 it is surely damaged 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.010
 the sockets are damaged and there is 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.789
 they are dirty and dirty they can 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:21.880
 move a skewer or we can with a 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:25.030
 compressor went down 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.880
 not so not so much speed clean the 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.100
 slot where the sockets go the most 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.620
 of the times the problem is this the 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:37.449
 memory is not damaged 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.449
 it is one of the two nova sticks 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.050
 problem solved
