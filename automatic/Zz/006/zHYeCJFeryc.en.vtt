thing into the interface but i usually

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.380 
thing into the interface but i usually
use<00:03:49.799> easy<00:03:50.190> mix<00:03:50.459> for<00:03:50.640> most<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:50.910> kind<00:03:51.090> of<00:03:51.150> stuff

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
to take the most time recording because

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.090 
to take the most time recording because
I<00:04:31.880> do<00:04:32.690> different<00:04:33.080> fills<00:04:33.320> and<00:04:33.710> then<00:04:33.800> or<00:04:33.980> I'll

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100
