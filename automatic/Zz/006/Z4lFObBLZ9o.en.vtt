00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
leaving them off so once you're done the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.109 
leaving them off so once you're done the
land<00:01:38.400> server<00:01:39.079> do<00:01:40.079> not<00:01:40.380> leave<00:01:40.740> them<00:01:40.950> off<00:01:41.130> it's

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
land server do not leave them off it's

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.990 
land server do not leave them off it's
not<00:01:42.270> terrible<00:01:43.020> but<00:01:43.259> just<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.280> it's<00:01:44.549> better

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
not terrible but just like it's better

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.260 
not terrible but just like it's better
