00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.270 
could turn the video quality too low but
armature<00:02:46.220> choice<00:02:46.490> um<00:02:47.020> x<00:02:48.020> cube<00:02:48.290> at<00:02:48.470> medium<00:02:50.020> and

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
armature choice um x cube at medium and

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.600 
armature choice um x cube at medium and
for<00:02:52.280> my<00:02:52.400> video<00:02:52.730> size<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.390> keep<00:02:53.990> it<00:02:54.170> at<00:02:54.260> full

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
for my video size I keep it at full

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.390 
for my video size I keep it at full
instead<00:02:55.610> of<00:02:55.670> half<00:02:56.590> for<00:02:57.590> my<00:02:57.770> video<00:02:58.010> orientation

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
instead of half for my video orientation

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.550 
instead of half for my video orientation
it's<00:02:59.300> auto<00:02:59.660> so<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:00.950> way<00:03:01.160> on<00:03:01.520> like<00:03:02.300> I<00:03:02.690> cancers

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
it's auto so that way on like I cancers

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.770 
it's auto so that way on like I cancers
like<00:03:03.830> I<00:03:04.070> guess<00:03:04.310> change<00:03:04.640> direction<00:03:05.120> of<00:03:05.420> my

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
like I guess change direction of my

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.130 
like I guess change direction of my
video<00:03:06.370> recording<00:03:07.370> so<00:03:07.810> yeah<00:03:08.810> that's<00:03:08.990> pretty

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
video recording so yeah that's pretty

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:16.600 
video recording so yeah that's pretty
cool<00:03:12.550> mmm<00:03:13.550> for<00:03:14.209> my<00:03:14.330> audio<00:03:14.750> codec<00:03:15.440> i<00:03:15.709> use<00:03:16.070> a<00:03:16.220> wall

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
cool mmm for my audio codec i use a wall

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.110 
cool mmm for my audio codec i use a wall
um<00:03:17.239> I<00:03:18.050> I<00:03:19.180> guess<00:03:20.180> it's<00:03:20.420> better<00:03:20.810> than<00:03:20.959> liner<00:03:22.120> PCM

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
um I I guess it's better than liner PCM

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.199 
um I I guess it's better than liner PCM
by<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.480> little<00:03:23.870> bit<00:03:23.989> because<00:03:24.650> um<00:03:25.130> one<00:03:25.850> in<00:03:26.030> my

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
by a little bit because um one in my

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.509 
by a little bit because um one in my
commentary<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:27.230> audio<00:03:27.650> is<00:03:27.970> pretty<00:03:28.970> good<00:03:30.519> so

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.300 
commentary the audio is pretty good so
yeah<00:03:31.750> for<00:03:32.750> my<00:03:32.870> sample<00:03:33.320> rate<00:03:33.470> it's<00:03:33.890> at<00:03:34.160> the

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
yeah for my sample rate it's at the

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.990 
yeah for my sample rate it's at the
highest<00:03:34.780> which<00:03:35.780> is<00:03:35.810> default<00:03:36.410> and<00:03:36.640> most<00:03:37.640> of<00:03:37.820> my
