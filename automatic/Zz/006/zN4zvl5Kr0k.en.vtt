this thing I'm out why is nobody talking
about<00:00:29.699> plastics<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.449> our<00:00:30.539> oceans<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.109> that's

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
about plastics in our oceans and that's

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.280 
about plastics in our oceans and that's
where<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> whole<00:00:32.040> idea<00:00:32.400> of<00:00:32.870> you<00:00:33.870> know<00:00:33.990> sort<00:00:34.200> of

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
where the whole idea of you know sort of

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.710 
where the whole idea of you know sort of
turning<00:00:34.740> waste<00:00:34.980> into<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.790> resource<00:00:36.180> came<00:00:36.480> about

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
turning waste into a resource came about

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.870 
turning waste into a resource came about
and<00:00:36.960> sort<00:00:37.470> of<00:00:37.500> been<00:00:37.950> quite<00:00:38.130> evolution<00:00:38.730> from

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
and sort of been quite evolution from

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.610 
and sort of been quite evolution from
there<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.720> the<00:00:39.840> point<00:00:40.079> where<00:00:40.289> we're<00:00:40.500> now

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
there to the point where we're now

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.680 
there to the point where we're now
constructing<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.399> boat<00:00:41.550> made<00:00:41.910> out<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.120> what's

constructing a boat made out of what's

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.090 
constructing a boat made out of what's
considered<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.170> be<00:00:43.320> waste<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.770> what<00:00:43.860> we<00:00:44.010> would

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
considered to be waste and what we would

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.389 
considered to be waste and what we would
say<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.370> actually<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.030> resource<00:00:46.190> the<00:00:47.190> first

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
say is actually a resource the first

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.650 
say is actually a resource the first
thing<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.579> people<00:00:47.789> have<00:00:48.030> always<00:00:48.180> said<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.539> me

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
thing that people have always said to me

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.090 
thing that people have always said to me
in<00:00:48.780> ostrich<00:00:49.170> why<00:00:49.320> don't<00:00:49.530> we<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:49.739> melt<00:00:49.949> these

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
in ostrich why don't we just melt these

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.639 
in ostrich why don't we just melt these
down<00:00:50.449> and<00:00:51.449> then<00:00:51.600> mold<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> hull<00:00:52.230> out<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
down and then mold the hull out of the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.900 
down and then mold the hull out of the
plastic<00:00:52.920> bottles<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.340> I've<00:00:53.430> always<00:00:53.609> felt

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
plastic bottles but I've always felt

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.700 
plastic bottles but I've always felt
that<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.269> far<00:00:54.420> more<00:00:54.449> impactful<00:00:55.440> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
that it's far more impactful and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.430 
that it's far more impactful and
powerful<00:00:55.769> to<00:00:56.160> actually<00:00:56.430> ever<00:00:56.550> see<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.440> we

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
powerful to actually ever see this we

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.750 
powerful to actually ever see this we
needed<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.859> figure<00:00:59.039> out<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.280> way<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.640> making

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
needed to figure out a way of making

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.410 
needed to figure out a way of making
them<00:01:00.149> strong<00:01:00.539> making<00:01:00.989> them<00:01:01.969> structure<00:01:02.969> and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
them strong making them structure and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.720 
them strong making them structure and
rigid<00:01:03.809> enough<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.230> perform<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.220> function<00:01:05.610> in

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
rigid enough to perform a function in

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.990 
rigid enough to perform a function in
the<00:01:05.820> boat<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.350> realized<00:01:07.350> very<00:01:08.250> early<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.610> that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
the boat and realized very early on that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.970 
the boat and realized very early on that
we<00:01:09.330> needed<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.660> pressurize<00:01:10.050> them<00:01:10.260> casting

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
we needed to pressurize them casting

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.430 
we needed to pressurize them casting
around<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.220> ideas<00:01:11.550> I<00:01:11.790> thought<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.780> putting

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
around for ideas I thought of putting

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.750 
around for ideas I thought of putting
dry<00:01:14.280> ice

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
dry ice

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.360 
dry ice
carbon<00:01:15.570> dioxide<00:01:15.740> compressed<00:01:16.740> carbon<00:01:16.920> dioxide

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
carbon dioxide compressed carbon dioxide

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.410 
carbon dioxide compressed carbon dioxide
gas<00:01:18.270> into<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.050> bottles<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:21.000> had<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.270> then

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
gas into the bottles so we had to then

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.300 
gas into the bottles so we had to then
just<00:01:21.810> refine<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.380> really<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.890> figure<00:01:23.250> out

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
just refine it really and figure out

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.220 
just refine it really and figure out
exactly<00:01:23.580> how<00:01:23.850> much<00:01:24.150> gas<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.480> put<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.050> give

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
exactly how much gas to put in to give

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.590 
exactly how much gas to put in to give
us<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> right<00:01:25.530> pressure

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.709 

the<00:01:29.600> boat<00:01:29.810> is<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.399> catamaran<00:01:31.399> so<00:01:31.700> two<00:01:31.759> hulls<00:01:32.210> so

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
the boat is a catamaran so two hulls so

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.600 
the boat is a catamaran so two hulls so
you<00:01:33.049> have<00:01:33.229> these<00:01:33.350> two<00:01:33.409> star-shaped<00:01:34.340> hulls

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
you have these two star-shaped hulls

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.179 
you have these two star-shaped hulls
with<00:01:35.030> photos<00:01:35.360> packed<00:01:35.680> around<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.829> outside

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
with photos packed around the outside

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.149 
with photos packed around the outside
and<00:01:37.460> then<00:01:37.520> they<00:01:38.060> be<00:01:38.119> joined<00:01:38.479> in<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:39.289> middle<00:01:39.409> by

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
and then they be joined in the middle by

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.830 
and then they be joined in the middle by
two<00:01:40.220> beams<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:41.030> then<00:01:41.179> you<00:01:41.270> have<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:41.450> kind<00:01:41.659> of<00:01:41.750> a

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
two beams and then you have a kind of a

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.480 
two beams and then you have a kind of a
platform<00:01:42.259> in<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.409> middle<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:43.070> this<00:01:43.189> is<00:01:43.369> the

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
platform in the middle so this is the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.440 
platform in the middle so this is the
prototype<00:01:44.649> it's<00:01:45.649> it's<00:01:46.310> great<00:01:46.759> honestly<00:01:47.299> was

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
prototype it's it's great honestly was

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.240 
prototype it's it's great honestly was
completely<00:01:48.110> unrepresentative<00:01:48.740> of<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.069> boat

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
completely unrepresentative of the boat

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.600 
completely unrepresentative of the boat
the<00:01:50.060> only<00:01:50.210> thing<00:01:50.720> vaguely<00:01:51.140> sits<00:01:51.679> you<00:01:52.429> know

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
the only thing vaguely sits you know

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.789 
the only thing vaguely sits you know
really<00:01:52.939> focus<00:01:53.299> on<00:01:53.420> is<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.630> bottles<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.229> this

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
really focus on is the bottles and this

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.039 
really focus on is the bottles and this
was<00:01:54.979> about<00:01:55.189> how<00:01:55.640> it<00:01:55.700> would<00:01:55.819> sail<00:01:56.119> now<00:01:56.869> we've

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
was about how it would sail now we've

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.569 
was about how it would sail now we've
got<00:01:57.170> reasonable<00:01:57.590> speeds<00:01:57.950> out<00:01:58.100> or<00:01:58.280> not<00:01:58.399> like<00:01:58.549> a

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
got reasonable speeds out or not like a

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.960 
got reasonable speeds out or not like a
Hobie<00:01:58.939> Cat<00:01:59.149> but<00:01:59.679> but<00:02:00.679> you<00:02:00.799> know<00:02:00.920> for<00:02:01.909> the

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
Hobie Cat but but you know for the

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.370 
Hobie Cat but but you know for the
weight<00:02:02.119> and<00:02:02.299> for<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.479> sail<00:02:02.689> area<00:02:02.899> it<00:02:03.080> wasn't

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
weight and for the sail area it wasn't

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.469 
weight and for the sail area it wasn't
too<00:02:03.500> bad<00:02:03.709> and<00:02:03.979> my<00:02:04.520> guess<00:02:04.729> is<00:02:04.759> that<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.360> boat

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
too bad and my guess is that the boat

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.120 
too bad and my guess is that the boat
will<00:02:05.599> probably<00:02:05.899> move<00:02:06.649> along<00:02:06.860> quite<00:02:07.099> happily

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
will probably move along quite happily

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.820 
will probably move along quite happily
around<00:02:07.490> eight<00:02:07.759> knots<00:02:08.289> which<00:02:09.289> is<00:02:09.410> plenty<00:02:09.619> for

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
around eight knots which is plenty for

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.440 
around eight knots which is plenty for
what<00:02:09.920> they're<00:02:10.039> trying<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.250> do<00:02:10.399> you<00:02:11.060> know<00:02:11.120> if

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
what they're trying to do you know if

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.570 
what they're trying to do you know if
the<00:02:11.660> if<00:02:11.870> they<00:02:12.290> can<00:02:12.440> take<00:02:12.799> this<00:02:12.950> out<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:13.280> sea<00:02:13.459> and

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
the if they can take this out to sea and

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.650 
the if they can take this out to sea and
do<00:02:14.450> 200<00:02:14.930> miles<00:02:15.080> regularly<00:02:15.790> everyday<00:02:16.790> then

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
do 200 miles regularly everyday then

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.789 
do 200 miles regularly everyday then
that's<00:02:17.840> perfectly<00:02:18.230> adequate

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
that's perfectly adequate

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.270 
that's perfectly adequate
this<00:02:19.250> is<00:02:19.400> SRPT<00:02:19.940> so<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.450> can<00:02:20.750> see<00:02:20.930> it's<00:02:21.079> a

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
this is SRPT so you can see it's a

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.170 
this is SRPT so you can see it's a
fabric<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.459> woven<00:02:23.000> fabric<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.790> idea<00:02:26.030> is

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
fabric a woven fabric and the idea is

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.009 
fabric a woven fabric and the idea is
that<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.799> apply<00:02:27.799> heat<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.160> pressure<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.760> it

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
that you apply heat and pressure to it

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.440 
that you apply heat and pressure to it
so<00:02:30.019> this<00:02:30.170> material<00:02:30.560> here<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:31.010> is<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.280> PT<00:02:32.120> phone

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
so this material here is is a PT phone

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.940 
so this material here is is a PT phone
so<00:02:32.870> again<00:02:33.079> it's<00:02:33.230> made<00:02:33.380> out<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.709> same

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
so again it's made out of the same

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.330 
so again it's made out of the same
material<00:02:34.609> as<00:02:34.640> bottles<00:02:35.090> so<00:02:35.600> what<00:02:35.720> we<00:02:35.840> do<00:02:36.019> is<00:02:36.340> in

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
material as bottles so what we do is in

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.530 
material as bottles so what we do is in
order<00:02:37.519> to<00:02:37.609> make<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.940> panel's<00:02:38.209> that<00:02:38.329> we<00:02:38.390> need

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
order to make the panel's that we need

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.800 
order to make the panel's that we need
for<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.750> boat<00:02:38.959> we<00:02:39.829> apply<00:02:40.160> this<00:02:41.030> fabric<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.780> the

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
for the boat we apply this fabric to the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.840 
for the boat we apply this fabric to the
outside<00:02:43.480> on<00:02:44.480> both<00:02:45.109> sides<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.950> then<00:02:46.519> apply<00:02:46.790> the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
outside on both sides and then apply the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.970 
outside on both sides and then apply the
heat<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:47.180> pressure<00:02:47.359> and<00:02:47.780> then<00:02:48.440> that<00:02:48.620> gives<00:02:48.829> us

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
heat and pressure and then that gives us

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.120 
heat and pressure and then that gives us
out<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.310> rigid<00:02:49.670> panel<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.569> you<00:02:50.600> can<00:02:50.690> see<00:02:51.130> how

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
out a rigid panel so you can see how

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.150 
out a rigid panel so you can see how
bendy<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.150> flexible<00:02:53.840> that<00:02:53.959> is<00:02:54.139> without<00:02:54.500> the

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
bendy and flexible that is without the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.479 
bendy and flexible that is without the
plastic<00:02:55.549> on<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.760> outside<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:58.010> then<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.280> can

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
plastic on the outside and then you can

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.480 
plastic on the outside and then you can
see<00:02:58.670> this<00:02:58.790> is<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.380> finished<00:03:00.380> panel

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
see this is a finished panel

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.750 
see this is a finished panel
which<00:03:02.120> is<00:03:02.330> absolutely<00:03:02.990> stiff<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:03.620> rigid<00:03:03.760> and

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
which is absolutely stiff and rigid and

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.880 
which is absolutely stiff and rigid and
suitable<00:03:05.150> for<00:03:05.300> use<00:03:05.450> in<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:05.690> boat<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:06.170> regular

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
suitable for use in the boat a regular

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.100 
suitable for use in the boat a regular
boat<00:03:07.040> hull<00:03:07.280> is<00:03:07.430> like<00:03:07.610> a<00:03:07.640> giant<00:03:08.120> beam<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:09.020> it

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
boat hull is like a giant beam and it

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.170 
boat hull is like a giant beam and it
doesn't<00:03:09.350> want<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.560> twist<00:03:09.770> because<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.910> twist

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
doesn't want to twist because the twist

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.820 
doesn't want to twist because the twist
it's<00:03:11.360> got<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.630> break<00:03:11.840> every<00:03:12.170> junk<00:03:12.410> it's<00:03:12.650> got<00:03:12.800> a

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
it's got to break every junk it's got a

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.830 
it's got to break every junk it's got a
break<00:03:13.070> every<00:03:13.430> junction<00:03:13.850> between<00:03:14.060> each<00:03:14.450> panel

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
break every junction between each panel

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.470 
break every junction between each panel
now<00:03:15.410> what<00:03:15.860> we've<00:03:16.040> done<00:03:16.070> is<00:03:16.550> we've<00:03:16.880> taken<00:03:17.060> all

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
now what we've done is we've taken all

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.210 
now what we've done is we've taken all
the<00:03:17.510> structure<00:03:18.050> that<00:03:18.320> a<00:03:18.470> regular<00:03:18.830> both<00:03:18.980> has

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
the structure that a regular both has

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.120 
the structure that a regular both has
and<00:03:19.580> then<00:03:19.760> taken<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.180> skin<00:03:20.390> away<00:03:20.650> so<00:03:21.650> we've

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
and then taken the skin away so we've

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.160 
and then taken the skin away so we've
taken<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.670> part<00:03:22.940> of<00:03:23.150> way<00:03:23.360> that<00:03:23.750> actually

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
taken the part of way that actually

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.390 
taken the part of way that actually
makes<00:03:24.380> it<00:03:24.560> stiff<00:03:24.860> so<00:03:25.720> that's<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.990> issue

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
makes it stiff so that's the issue

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.860 
makes it stiff so that's the issue
everything<00:03:28.400> on<00:03:28.700> this<00:03:28.940> boat<00:03:29.180> will<00:03:29.510> be<00:03:29.630> made<00:03:29.840> out

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
everything on this boat will be made out

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.020 
everything on this boat will be made out
of<00:03:30.050> eating<00:03:30.620> in<00:03:30.830> some<00:03:31.250> form<00:03:31.490> or<00:03:31.610> other<00:03:31.670> whether

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
of eating in some form or other whether

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.730 
of eating in some form or other whether
it's<00:03:32.210> in<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.390> form<00:03:32.570> of<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:32.810> bottle<00:03:33.170> whether

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
it's in the form of a bottle whether

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.560 
it's in the form of a bottle whether
it's<00:03:33.920> in<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.100> form<00:03:34.280> of<00:03:34.640> a<00:03:34.820> panel<00:03:35.620> is<00:03:36.620> our<00:03:36.980> PT<00:03:37.570> it

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
it's in the form of a panel is our PT it

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.630 
it's in the form of a panel is our PT it
will<00:03:38.780> all<00:03:38.930> be<00:03:39.080> the<00:03:39.230> same<00:03:39.260> material<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:40.010> what's

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
will all be the same material and what's

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.240 
will all be the same material and what's
nice<00:03:40.790> about<00:03:40.850> that<00:03:41.180> is<00:03:41.570> that<00:03:41.630> we<00:03:42.320> can<00:03:42.350> upcycle

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
nice about that is that we can upcycle

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.930 
nice about that is that we can upcycle
or<00:03:43.640> recycle<00:03:44.210> this<00:03:44.540> whole<00:03:44.810> boat<00:03:45.550> our<00:03:46.550> plan<00:03:46.790> is

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
or recycle this whole boat our plan is

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.780 
or recycle this whole boat our plan is
basically<00:03:47.680> we'll<00:03:48.680> sell<00:03:48.860> down<00:03:49.010> San<00:03:49.310> Diego<00:03:49.640> to

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
basically we'll sell down San Diego to

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
basically we'll sell down San Diego to
Scripps<00:03:50.230> come<00:03:51.230> into<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.620> Y

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
Scripps come into the Y

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.089 
Scripps come into the Y
up<00:03:52.959> into<00:03:53.200> Midway<00:03:53.730> across<00:03:54.730> into<00:03:55.180> probably<00:03:55.480> wake
