a piece of paper the size of the centre

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.020 
a piece of paper the size of the centre
and<00:00:55.050> putting<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.039> between<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.399> centre<00:00:56.850> and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
and putting it in between the centre and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.180 
and putting it in between the centre and
the<00:00:57.239> cab<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:58.170> will<00:00:58.350> ensure<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.920> caps

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
the cab this will ensure that the caps

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.920 
the cab this will ensure that the caps
will<00:00:59.340> not<00:00:59.609> come<00:00:59.879> off<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.329> won't<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.840> to

will not come off and you won't have to

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.500 
will not come off and you won't have to
worry<00:01:01.230> about<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.649> while<00:01:01.800> solving<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:03.239> corner

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
worry about it while solving the corner

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.350 
worry about it while solving the corner
crying<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:04.049> outstanding<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.250> will<00:01:05.610> easily<00:01:05.939> cut

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
crying is outstanding it will easily cut

puzzles<00:01:55.079> are<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.380> same<00:01:55.619> size<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.280> however

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
puzzles are the same size I however

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.139 
puzzles are the same size I however
disagree<00:01:58.380> as<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.250> clearly<00:01:59.399> see<00:01:59.729> the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
disagree as you can clearly see the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.060 
disagree as you can clearly see the
screw<00:02:00.450> head<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.869> 42<00:02:01.140> millimeters<00:02:01.710> anchee

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
screw head of the 42 millimeters anchee

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.050 
screw head of the 42 millimeters anchee
is<00:02:02.189> much<00:02:02.460> smaller<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.390> thinner

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
is much smaller and thinner

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.900 
is much smaller and thinner
than<00:02:05.300> that<00:02:05.570> of<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:06.530> regular<00:02:07.070> 57-millimeter

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
than that of a regular 57-millimeter

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.419 
than that of a regular 57-millimeter
screw<00:02:08.810> head<00:02:08.990> you<00:02:09.590> can<00:02:09.740> also<00:02:09.860> see<00:02:10.160> that<00:02:10.190> the

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
screw head you can also see that the

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.310 
screw head you can also see that the

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
space in between a thread on the 42

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.850 
space in between a thread on the 42
millimeter<00:02:12.770> one<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:13.220> narrower<00:02:13.850> than<00:02:13.970> that<00:02:14.420> of

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
millimeter one is narrower than that of

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.580 
millimeter one is narrower than that of
the<00:02:15.860> 57-millimeter<00:02:16.520> one<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.930> fact<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:18.470> this

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
the 57-millimeter one the fact that this

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.680 
the 57-millimeter one the fact that this
cube<00:02:18.920> is<00:02:19.070> stickerless<00:02:19.550> adds<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:20.120> lot<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.570> the

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
cube is stickerless adds a lot to the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.290 
cube is stickerless adds a lot to the
puzzle<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.709> shades<00:02:21.980> are<00:02:22.160> very<00:02:22.430> vibrant<00:02:22.850> and

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
puzzle the shades are very vibrant and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.960 
puzzle the shades are very vibrant and
all<00:02:23.540> complement<00:02:24.440> each<00:02:24.650> other<00:02:24.950> there<00:02:25.820> is<00:02:25.850> no

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
all complement each other there is no

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.120 
all complement each other there is no
one<00:02:26.450> color<00:02:26.840> that<00:02:26.990> looks<00:02:27.320> like<00:02:27.530> another<00:02:27.830> color

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
one color that looks like another color

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.970 
one color that looks like another color
it<00:02:29.030> also<00:02:29.300> helps<00:02:29.840> with<00:02:30.020> solving<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.740> not

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
it also helps with solving and not

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.620 
it also helps with solving and not
because<00:02:31.310> of<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.550> ability<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:32.060> see<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.420> back

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
because of the ability to see the back

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.990 
because of the ability to see the back
color<00:02:32.870> on<00:02:33.140> pieces<00:02:33.380> but<00:02:34.250> because<00:02:34.550> there<00:02:34.730> are<00:02:34.850> no

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
color on pieces but because there are no

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.610 
color on pieces but because there are no
black<00:02:35.300> lines<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.990> interfere<00:02:36.470> with

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
black lines to interfere with

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:51.559 
black lines to interfere with
recognition

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.899 

in<00:02:51.900> my<00:02:52.319> opinion<00:02:52.620> stickerless<00:02:53.310> cubes<00:02:53.760> are

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
in my opinion stickerless cubes are

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.630 
in my opinion stickerless cubes are
unparalleled<00:02:54.810> in<00:02:55.049> look<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.469> feel<00:02:55.799> so<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.400> would

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
unparalleled in look and feel so I would

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.009 
unparalleled in look and feel so I would
recommend<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.180> queue<00:02:57.480> but<00:02:57.659> I<00:02:57.689> wouldn't

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
recommend this queue but I wouldn't

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.899 
recommend this queue but I wouldn't
consider<00:02:58.109> it<00:02:58.409> a<00:02:58.590> speed<00:02:58.980> cube<00:02:59.340> because<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.790> its

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
consider it a speed cube because of its

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.509 
consider it a speed cube because of its
small<00:03:00.180> size<00:03:00.450> but<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.709> nice<00:03:01.950> collector's

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
small size but it is a nice collector's

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.020 
small size but it is a nice collector's
item

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
item

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.229 
item
so<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.569> give<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:03.959> Cuban<00:03:04.379> a<00:03:04.560> -<00:03:05.069> it's<00:03:05.819> fast

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
so I give this Cuban a - it's fast

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.380 
so I give this Cuban a - it's fast
corner<00:03:07.200> cuts<00:03:07.409> remarkably<00:03:08.250> well<00:03:08.549> and<00:03:08.849> has<00:03:09.150> nice

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
corner cuts remarkably well and has nice

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.880 
corner cuts remarkably well and has nice
vibrant<00:03:09.989> stickerless<00:03:10.439> shades<00:03:11.299> this<00:03:12.299> cube<00:03:12.659> is
