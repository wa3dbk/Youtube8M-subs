rush defense footage playing defense and
rush<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:08.490> basically<00:00:09.000> very<00:00:09.179> simple<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:09.990> like

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
rush is basically very simple and I like

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.410 
rush is basically very simple and I like
to<00:00:10.410> employ<00:00:10.650> whether<00:00:11.190> deploy<00:00:11.730> what's<00:00:12.000> called<00:00:12.240> a

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
to employ whether deploy what's called a

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.240 
to employ whether deploy what's called a
zone<00:00:12.780> defense<00:00:12.830> strategy<00:00:13.830> so<00:00:14.040> if<00:00:14.130> you're

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
zone defense strategy so if you're

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.499 
zone defense strategy so if you're
familiar<00:00:14.400> with<00:00:14.700> football<00:00:15.210> or<00:00:15.360> basketball

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
you'll have an idea of how to basically

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.349 
you'll have an idea of how to basically
operate<00:00:18.750> with<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.080> already<00:00:19.789> and<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.000> basic

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
operate with that already and the basic

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.660 
operate with that already and the basic
tip<00:00:21.510> for<00:00:21.720> rush<00:00:21.900> defense<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.650> basically<00:00:23.100> every

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
tip for rush defense and basically every

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.550 
tip for rush defense and basically every
single<00:00:24.000> lobby<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.359> ever<00:00:24.510> play<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.810> can<00:00:25.109> use

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
single lobby you ever play you can use

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.170 
single lobby you ever play you can use
this<00:00:25.800> strategy<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.430> just<00:00:26.609> depends<00:00:26.970> on<00:00:27.029> how

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
this strategy it just depends on how

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.029 
this strategy it just depends on how
well<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.840> your<00:00:27.990> teammates<00:00:28.439> play<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.890> how

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
well you and your teammates play is how

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.490 
well you and your teammates play is how
well<00:00:29.220> effective<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:29.849> going<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.210> be<00:00:30.439> and<00:00:31.439> I'm

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
well effective it's going to be and I'm

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.870 
well effective it's going to be and I'm
pretty<00:00:31.800> sure<00:00:31.949> most<00:00:32.099> people<00:00:32.489> play<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.790> without

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
pretty sure most people play it without

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.260 
pretty sure most people play it without
even<00:00:33.059> realizing<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:34.730> the<00:00:35.730> zone<00:00:35.910> defense

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
even realizing it the zone defense

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.880 
even realizing it the zone defense
strategy<00:00:36.660> works<00:00:36.840> basically<00:00:37.110> like<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.649> if

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
strategy works basically like this if

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.130 
strategy works basically like this if
you're<00:00:38.010> playing<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.910> area<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.329> am<00:00:39.600> it's

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
you're playing in the area I am it's

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.319 
you're playing in the area I am it's
called<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.620> middle<00:00:40.980> ground<00:00:41.280> zone<00:00:41.820> defense

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
called the middle ground zone defense

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.270 
called the middle ground zone defense
you're<00:00:42.570> playing<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.050> very<00:00:43.260> safe<00:00:43.559> area<00:00:43.980> if

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
you're playing in a very safe area if

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.130 
you're playing in a very safe area if
you<00:00:44.700> pass<00:00:44.969> those<00:00:45.180> buildings<00:00:45.660> I'm<00:00:45.809> as<00:00:46.020> I'm

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
you pass those buildings I'm as I'm

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.139 
you pass those buildings I'm as I'm
about<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.649> second<00:00:46.980> right<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.579> you're

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
about to in a second right here you're

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.319 
about to in a second right here you're
playing<00:00:48.570> sort<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.230> upper<00:00:49.620> range<00:00:50.579> playing

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
playing sort of the upper range playing

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.990 
playing sort of the upper range playing
zone<00:00:51.739> the<00:00:52.739> upper<00:00:52.980> range<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.309> by<00:00:53.460> far<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.760> most

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
zone the upper range is by far the most

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.860 
zone the upper range is by far the most
dangerous<00:00:54.510> because<00:00:54.949> you're<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.129> be

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
dangerous because you're going to be

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.569 
dangerous because you're going to be
keeping<00:00:57.870> yourself<00:00:58.379> pretty<00:00:58.590> much<00:00:58.770> exposed<00:00:59.250> to

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
keeping yourself pretty much exposed to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.580 
keeping yourself pretty much exposed to
well<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.210> exact<00:01:00.539> point<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.960> attack<00:01:01.199> where<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
well the exact point of attack where the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.529 
well the exact point of attack where the
enemies<00:01:02.039> are<00:01:02.100> going<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.640> rushing<00:01:03.030> into<00:01:03.239> you

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
enemies are going to be rushing into you

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.600 
enemies are going to be rushing into you
because<00:01:04.320> rush<00:01:04.589> defense<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.100> pretty<00:01:05.250> simple

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
because rush defense is pretty simple

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.270 
because rush defense is pretty simple
the<00:01:06.390> overall<00:01:06.659> strategies<00:01:07.290> i<00:01:07.470> like<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.830> use<00:01:07.860> our

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
the overall strategies i like to use our

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.179 
the overall strategies i like to use our
to<00:01:08.400> basically<00:01:09.200> control<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.380> middle<00:01:10.650> area<00:01:10.860> and

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
to basically control the middle area and

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.250 
to basically control the middle area and
destroy<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> flanks<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.080> can

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
destroy the flanks and if you can

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.140 
destroy the flanks and if you can
destroy<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.799> outside<00:01:14.189> flanks<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.820> force

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
destroy the outside flanks and force

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.300 
destroy the outside flanks and force
them<00:01:15.360> into<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.930> middle<00:01:16.200> then<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
them into the middle then you have a

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.999 
them into the middle then you have a
really<00:01:17.790> really<00:01:18.420> good<00:01:18.720> chance<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.740> pretty<00:01:19.950> much

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
really really good chance of pretty much

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.710 
really really good chance of pretty much
controlling<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.850> dominating<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.540> whole

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
controlling and dominating the whole

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.840 
controlling and dominating the whole
match<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.259> i<00:01:22.830> did<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> really<00:01:23.250> good<00:01:23.400> job<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.640> it

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
match and i did a really good job of it

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.370 
match and i did a really good job of it
with<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.060> tank<00:01:24.299> footage<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:24.990> one<00:01:25.200> that's

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
with the tank footage in this one that's

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.580 
with the tank footage in this one that's
why<00:01:25.560> i'm<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.890> show<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:27.500> for<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
why i'm going to show you this for the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.069 
why i'm going to show you this for the
most<00:01:28.710> part<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.159> lot<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.579> time<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.360> in

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
most part a lot of the time in this in

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.649 
most part a lot of the time in this in
lansing<00:01:31.799> dam<00:01:32.009> here<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.310> lot<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.670> time<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
lansing dam here a lot of the time the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.319 
lansing dam here a lot of the time the
biggest<00:01:34.110> troublesome<00:01:34.829> spot<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.150> water

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
biggest troublesome spot is on the water

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.149 
biggest troublesome spot is on the water
well<00:01:36.689> though<00:01:36.810> where<00:01:37.140> they'll<00:01:37.290> use<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.680> amtrak

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
well though where they'll use the amtrak

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.890 
well though where they'll use the amtrak
or<00:01:38.340> they'll<00:01:38.490> patrol<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> show<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.450> shoreline

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
or they'll patrol the show the shoreline

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.130 
or they'll patrol the show the shoreline
to<00:01:40.079> try<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.470> get<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:42.030> flank<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.659> if

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
to try and get in on the flank and if

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.749 
in serious trouble because getting them

flanks that I'm pointing out there it's
the<00:02:19.069> safest<00:02:19.430> way<00:02:19.700> I'd<00:02:20.659> say<00:02:20.959> because<00:02:21.319> your

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
the safest way I'd say because your

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.990 
the safest way I'd say because your
threats<00:02:21.890> are<00:02:21.980> going<00:02:22.129> to<00:02:22.189> be<00:02:22.280> highly<00:02:22.489> minimized

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
threats are going to be highly minimized

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.789 
threats are going to be highly minimized
but<00:02:23.359> you're<00:02:23.719> not<00:02:23.780> going<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.290> get<00:02:24.469> as<00:02:24.590> well<00:02:24.769> a

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
but you're not going to get as well a

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.199 
but you're not going to get as well a
lot<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.159> kills<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.579> way<00:02:25.760> unless<00:02:25.939> your

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
lot of kills that way unless your

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.520 
lot of kills that way unless your
counter<00:02:26.510> sniping<00:02:26.930> with<00:02:27.049> a<00:02:27.079> lot<00:02:27.260> of<00:02:27.290> people

counter sniping with a lot of people

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.399 
counter sniping with a lot of people
it's<00:02:27.799> just<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.129> fact<00:02:28.629> if<00:02:29.629> you're<00:02:29.840> playing<00:02:30.049> mid

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
it's just a fact if you're playing mid

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.440 
it's just a fact if you're playing mid
here<00:02:30.709> mid<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.280> nice<00:02:31.549> balance<00:02:32.030> because<00:02:32.329> it

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
here mid to nice balance because it

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.210 
here mid to nice balance because it
gives<00:02:32.599> you<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.900> chance<00:02:33.109> to<00:02:33.500> get<00:02:33.739> away<00:02:33.890> if

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
gives you the chance to get away if

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.830 
gives you the chance to get away if
you're<00:02:34.459> overwhelmed<00:02:35.060> or<00:02:35.180> in<00:02:35.269> serious<00:02:35.629> trouble

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
you're overwhelmed or in serious trouble

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.420 
you're overwhelmed or in serious trouble
but<00:02:35.989> it<00:02:36.200> also<00:02:36.319> gives<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.769> the<00:02:36.859> opportunity<00:02:37.099> to

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
but it also gives you the opportunity to

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.339 
but it also gives you the opportunity to
rack<00:02:37.700> up<00:02:37.730> lots<00:02:38.120> of<00:02:38.269> kills<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.750> play<00:02:38.900> proper

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
rack up lots of kills and play proper

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.039 
rack up lots of kills and play proper
defense<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:40.329> that's<00:02:41.329> where<00:02:41.569> for<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.870> most

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
defense and that's where for the most

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.140 
defense and that's where for the most
part<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.379> like<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.739> keep<00:02:42.889> the<00:02:43.069> tank<00:02:43.310> when<00:02:43.760> I<00:02:43.819> have

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
part I like to keep the tank when I have

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.569 
part I like to keep the tank when I have
the<00:02:44.359> tank<00:02:44.599> in<00:02:44.840> that<00:02:45.049> mid<00:02:45.349> range<00:02:45.459> because<00:02:46.459> it

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
the tank in that mid range because it

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:47.830 
the tank in that mid range because it
gives<00:02:46.639> me<00:02:46.819> the<00:02:46.849> best<00:02:47.090> of<00:02:47.239> both<00:02:47.389> worlds<00:02:47.780> of

gives me the best of both worlds of

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.059 
gives me the best of both worlds of
being<00:02:48.049> able<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.319> get<00:02:48.409> away<00:02:48.530> if<00:02:48.769> I<00:02:48.889> get

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
being able to get away if I get

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.839 
being able to get away if I get
overwhelmed<00:02:49.689> and<00:02:50.689> the<00:02:50.930> ability<00:02:51.349> to

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
overwhelmed and the ability to

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.830 
overwhelmed and the ability to

as you play pushing further up here is

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.229 
as you play pushing further up here is
deadly<00:03:06.799> because<00:03:07.129> now<00:03:07.459> not<00:03:07.819> only<00:03:07.970> are<00:03:08.180> you

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
deadly because now not only are you

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.149 
deadly because now not only are you
exposed<00:03:08.780> in<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.079> middle<00:03:09.319> but<00:03:09.470> on<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.739> flanks

shouldn't repair in that circumstance as

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.789 
shouldn't repair in that circumstance as
well<00:03:49.579> because<00:03:50.000> you<00:03:50.269> could<00:03:50.419> repair<00:03:50.810> it<00:03:50.840> someone

takes your tags and then they have the
tag<00:03:53.479> so<00:03:54.109> that<00:03:54.260> was<00:03:54.440> a<00:03:54.470> bit<00:03:54.709> of<00:03:54.799> a<00:03:54.889> gamble<00:03:55.220> I'd

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
tag so that was a bit of a gamble I'd

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.909 
tag so that was a bit of a gamble I'd
highly<00:03:55.760> advise<00:03:55.970> you<00:03:56.150> guys<00:03:56.180> not<00:03:56.659> to<00:03:56.870> do<00:03:56.959> it<00:03:57.109> but

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
highly advise you guys not to do it but

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.259 
highly advise you guys not to do it but
i<00:03:57.979> just<00:03:58.250> repaired<00:03:58.519> it<00:03:58.669> enough<00:03:58.939> so<00:03:59.090> that<00:03:59.120> i

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
i just repaired it enough so that i

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.719 
i just repaired it enough so that i
could<00:03:59.329> ideally<00:03:59.810> get<00:04:00.109> away<00:04:00.349> and<00:04:00.590> repair<00:04:01.549> myself

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:01.729 
could ideally get away and repair myself

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:03.939 
could ideally get away and repair myself
back<00:04:02.209> but<00:04:02.599> at<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.049> very<00:04:03.079> least<00:04:03.319> you<00:04:03.620> probably

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:03.949 
back but at the very least you probably

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:05.800 
back but at the very least you probably
should<00:04:04.189> go<00:04:04.340> down<00:04:04.519> with<00:04:04.729> the<00:04:04.819> tank<00:04:05.030> that<00:04:05.599> is<00:04:05.629> a

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
should go down with the tank that is a

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.020 
should go down with the tank that is a
bit<00:04:05.989> of<00:04:06.079> a<00:04:06.139> gamble<00:04:06.470> it<00:04:06.919> worked<00:04:07.250> and<00:04:07.519> i

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
bit of a gamble it worked and i

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.189 
bit of a gamble it worked and i
slaughtered<00:04:08.419> the<00:04:08.510> rest<00:04:08.689> of<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:08.870> team<00:04:09.049> from

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:09.199 
slaughtered the rest of the team from

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.610 
slaughtered the rest of the team from
there<00:04:09.409> on<00:04:09.530> out<00:04:09.680> but<00:04:09.979> that<00:04:10.819> would<00:04:11.090> be<00:04:11.120> my<00:04:12.109> tip<00:04:12.379> to

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
there on out but that would be my tip to

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.080 
there on out but that would be my tip to
you<00:04:12.650> is<00:04:12.799> that<00:04:13.040> if<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:13.400> make<00:04:13.579> a<00:04:13.639> mistake<00:04:13.759> like

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
you is that if you make a mistake like

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.879 
you is that if you make a mistake like
that<00:04:14.269> and<00:04:14.569> you<00:04:14.629> over<00:04:14.930> pursue<00:04:15.319> and<00:04:15.560> you<00:04:15.620> end<00:04:15.769> up

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
that and you over pursue and you end up

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.649 
that and you over pursue and you end up
getting<00:04:16.039> disabled<00:04:16.699> or<00:04:16.820> taken<00:04:17.209> down<00:04:17.359> go<00:04:17.630> down

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:17.659 
getting disabled or taken down go down

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:20.050 
getting disabled or taken down go down
with<00:04:18.019> the<00:04:18.109> ship<00:04:18.139> do<00:04:18.979> not<00:04:19.190> let<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.519> enemy<00:04:19.849> take

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
with the ship do not let the enemy take

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.699 
with the ship do not let the enemy take
it<00:04:20.239> I've<00:04:20.359> emphasized<00:04:20.840> this<00:04:21.049> in<00:04:21.260> several

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
it I've emphasized this in several

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.950 
it I've emphasized this in several
videos<00:04:21.889> and<00:04:22.400> it's<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.820> gets<00:04:23.450> of<00:04:23.570> critical

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
videos and it's it gets of critical

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.550 
videos and it's it gets of critical
importance<00:04:24.409> that<00:04:24.469> everyone<00:04:25.039> understand

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
importance that everyone understand

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.740 
importance that everyone understand
that<00:04:25.800> at<00:04:26.280> all<00:04:26.580> times<00:04:27.030> because<00:04:27.360> I<00:04:27.510> see<00:04:27.660> it

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
that at all times because I see it

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.409 
that at all times because I see it
happening<00:04:28.169> way<00:04:28.350> too<00:04:28.380> much<00:04:28.940> but<00:04:29.940> that<00:04:30.090> would<00:04:30.270> be

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
happening way too much but that would be

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.870 
happening way too much but that would be
the<00:04:30.690> general<00:04:30.960> tip<00:04:31.290> with<00:04:32.040> regard<00:04:32.400> to<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.639> zones

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
the general tip with regard to the zones

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.720 
the general tip with regard to the zones
again<00:04:33.470> make<00:04:34.470> sure<00:04:34.500> you<00:04:34.680> use<00:04:35.040> these<00:04:35.250> buildings

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
again make sure you use these buildings

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.760 
again make sure you use these buildings
for<00:04:36.000> pillorying<00:04:36.419> sites<00:04:36.720> and<00:04:36.990> make<00:04:37.470> sure<00:04:37.620> you

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
for pillorying sites and make sure you

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.830 
for pillorying sites and make sure you
take<00:04:38.010> out<00:04:38.250> while<00:04:38.760> all<00:04:38.970> of<00:04:39.210> their<00:04:39.360> armor<00:04:39.720> as

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
take out while all of their armor as

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.050 
take out while all of their armor as
well<00:04:40.020> you<00:04:40.230> don't<00:04:40.440> want<00:04:40.680> because<00:04:41.250> I<00:04:41.400> and<00:04:41.730> I

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
well you don't want because I and I

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.790 
well you don't want because I and I
should<00:04:42.840> go<00:04:42.930> without<00:04:43.110> saying<00:04:43.169> but<00:04:43.500> a<00:04:43.620> lot<00:04:43.770> of

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
here they have that left flank so

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.129 
here they have that left flank so
ideally<00:05:20.910> we<00:05:21.060> should<00:05:21.090> be<00:05:21.419> trying<00:05:21.660> to<00:05:21.750> take<00:05:21.960> out

why'd you back up from the guy repairing
you<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:37.830> problem<00:05:38.220> is<00:05:38.539> the<00:05:39.539> repair<00:05:39.960> rate<00:05:40.200> at

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
you the problem is the repair rate at

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.380 
you the problem is the repair rate at

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
overstepping your bounds when you're

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.430 
overstepping your bounds when you're
playing<00:06:17.669> that<00:06:17.940> aggressive<00:06:18.450> high<00:06:18.600> area<00:06:19.050> I<00:06:19.229> just

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
playing that aggressive high area I just

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.219 
playing that aggressive high area I just
call<00:06:19.620> it<00:06:19.650> high<00:06:19.889> but<00:06:20.360> but<00:06:21.360> the<00:06:21.479> mid<00:06:21.720> if<00:06:21.990> you're

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
call it high but but the mid if you're

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.050 
call it high but but the mid if you're
if<00:06:22.470> you<00:06:22.620> take<00:06:22.950> anything<00:06:23.220> out<00:06:23.520> of<00:06:23.580> this<00:06:23.760> short

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
if you take anything out of this short

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.290 
if you take anything out of this short
little<00:06:24.210> length<00:06:24.510> video<00:06:24.900> here's<00:06:25.220> if<00:06:26.220> if<00:06:27.090> you're

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
little length video here's if if you're

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.779 
little length video here's if if you're
not<00:06:27.450> a<00:06:27.510> very<00:06:27.889> aggressive<00:06:28.889> person<00:06:29.580> or<00:06:29.669> you're

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:29.789 
not a very aggressive person or you're

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:31.580 
not a very aggressive person or you're
still<00:06:30.060> learning<00:06:30.270> the<00:06:30.600> game<00:06:30.630> I'd<00:06:31.110> say<00:06:31.350> play

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
still learning the game I'd say play

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.060 
still learning the game I'd say play
that<00:06:31.800> lower<00:06:32.220> area<00:06:32.669> the<00:06:33.270> further<00:06:33.479> back<00:06:33.630> one<00:06:34.169> or

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
that lower area the further back one or

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.310 
that lower area the further back one or
the<00:06:35.370> mid<00:06:35.580> round<00:06:35.820> the<00:06:36.450> mid-range<00:06:36.780> is<00:06:37.020> probably

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 
the mid round the mid-range is probably

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.380 
the mid round the mid-range is probably
the<00:06:37.440> place<00:06:37.590> that<00:06:37.860> you<00:06:37.979> should<00:06:38.159> play<00:06:38.340> the<00:06:38.520> most

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.390 
the place that you should play the most

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.030 
the place that you should play the most
the<00:06:39.540> safe<00:06:39.780> it's<00:06:40.050> it's<00:06:40.350> sort<00:06:40.680> of<00:06:40.770> the<00:06:40.890> perfect

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040 
the safe it's it's sort of the perfect

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.950 
the safe it's it's sort of the perfect
balance<00:06:41.430> between<00:06:41.700> being<00:06:42.060> able<00:06:42.630> to<00:06:42.720> play<00:06:42.930> the

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
balance between being able to play the

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.010 
balance between being able to play the
objectives<00:06:44.000> appropriately<00:06:45.000> and<00:06:45.180> also

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
objectives appropriately and also

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.230 
objectives appropriately and also
keeping<00:06:46.380> yourself<00:06:46.770> at<00:06:46.920> a<00:06:47.010> distance<00:06:47.430> so<00:06:48.120> that

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
keeping yourself at a distance so that

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.760 
keeping yourself at a distance so that
well<00:06:48.570> not<00:06:48.750> only<00:06:48.840> your<00:06:48.990> teammates<00:06:49.320> can<00:06:49.440> repair

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770 
well not only your teammates can repair

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.260 
well not only your teammates can repair
but<00:06:49.950> you<00:06:50.100> can<00:06:50.280> get<00:06:50.520> away<00:06:50.640> if<00:06:50.940> you<00:06:51.090> get

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270 
but you can get away if you get

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.500 
but you can get away if you get
overwhelmed<00:06:51.930> or<00:06:52.110> you're<00:06:52.320> being<00:06:52.500> rushed<00:06:52.710> madly

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.510 
overwhelmed or you're being rushed madly

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.720 
overwhelmed or you're being rushed madly
now<00:06:54.510> in<00:06:55.170> this<00:06:55.410> particular<00:06:55.620> case<00:06:56.130> here<00:06:56.370> we<00:06:56.550> do

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.730 
now in this particular case here we do

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.990 
now in this particular case here we do
end<00:06:56.910> up<00:06:57.030> holding<00:06:57.570> them<00:06:57.900> off<00:06:58.050> but<00:06:58.760> this<00:06:59.760> was<00:06:59.970> a

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
end up holding them off but this was a

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.550 
end up holding them off but this was a
bit<00:07:00.180> of<00:07:00.270> a<00:07:00.360> troublesome<00:07:00.720> spot<00:07:01.050> because<00:07:01.290> they

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
bit of a troublesome spot because they

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.470 
bit of a troublesome spot because they
have<00:07:01.770> the<00:07:02.070> buildings<00:07:02.550> and<00:07:02.730> they<00:07:02.970> have<00:07:03.180> two

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.480 
have the buildings and they have two

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.660 
have the buildings and they have two
different<00:07:03.720> areas<00:07:04.140> of<00:07:04.170> control<00:07:04.650> they<00:07:05.310> have<00:07:05.430> two

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:05.670 
different areas of control they have two

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.220 
different areas of control they have two
different<00:07:05.910> areas<00:07:06.360> in<00:07:06.510> which<00:07:06.600> they<00:07:06.810> can<00:07:06.840> shoot

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:07.230 
different areas in which they can shoot

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.100 
different areas in which they can shoot
me<00:07:07.410> from<00:07:08.120> but<00:07:09.120> at<00:07:09.240> this<00:07:09.330> point<00:07:09.570> I<00:07:09.720> figure<00:07:09.960> since

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.110 
me from but at this point I figure since

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.420 
me from but at this point I figure since
it's<00:07:10.290> close<00:07:10.500> to<00:07:10.530> the<00:07:10.740> end<00:07:10.860> of<00:07:10.950> the<00:07:11.010> round<00:07:11.130> I<00:07:11.280> can

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.430 
it's close to the end of the round I can

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.980 
it's close to the end of the round I can
continue<00:07:11.760> to<00:07:12.000> play<00:07:12.180> aggressive<00:07:12.660> hopefully

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:12.990 
continue to play aggressive hopefully

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.540 
continue to play aggressive hopefully
run<00:07:13.200> down<00:07:13.380> their<00:07:13.560> ticket<00:07:13.860> count<00:07:14.070> before<00:07:14.250> they

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:14.550 
run down their ticket count before they

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.400 
run down their ticket count before they
can<00:07:14.700> actually<00:07:14.880> mount<00:07:15.240> up<00:07:15.510> a<00:07:15.600> nice<00:07:15.750> strategy<00:07:16.080> as

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:16.410 
can actually mount up a nice strategy as

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.790 
can actually mount up a nice strategy as
well<00:07:16.670> and<00:07:17.670> that<00:07:17.850> would<00:07:18.000> be<00:07:18.030> the<00:07:18.210> tip<00:07:18.680> but<00:07:19.680> the

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 
well and that would be the tip but the

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.170 
well and that would be the tip but the
BF<00:07:20.070> that's<00:07:20.310> basically<00:07:20.580> what<00:07:20.730> I'm<00:07:20.790> saying<00:07:21.000> take

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.180 
BF that's basically what I'm saying take

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.540 
BF that's basically what I'm saying take
control<00:07:21.600> the<00:07:21.750> middle<00:07:21.960> ground<00:07:22.220> control<00:07:23.220> anyone
