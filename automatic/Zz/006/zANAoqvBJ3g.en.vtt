on<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> map<00:00:55.469> let's<00:00:56.039> walk<00:00:56.280> through<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.579> few<00:00:56.789> of

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
on the map let's walk through a few of

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.979 
on the map let's walk through a few of
these<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.300> think<00:00:57.539> you'll<00:00:57.690> want<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.870> know

these that I think you'll want to know
about<00:01:00.260> let's<00:01:01.260> start<00:01:01.500> with<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> area<00:01:01.980> called

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
about let's start with the area called

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.219 
about let's start with the area called
the<00:01:02.370> PR<00:01:02.760> tower<00:01:03.030> due<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> fact<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
the PR tower due to the fact that the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.410 
the PR tower due to the fact that the
battle<00:01:04.589> rifle<00:01:04.860> strong<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.400> top<00:01:05.580> if<00:01:06.270> you're

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
battle rifle strong on top if you're

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.300 
battle rifle strong on top if you're
coming<00:01:06.600> from<00:01:06.720> top<00:01:07.049> made<00:01:07.290> then<00:01:07.650> jumping<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
coming from top made then jumping to the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.200 
coming from top made then jumping to the
top<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.760> as<00:01:08.970> easy<00:01:09.210> as<00:01:09.979> 123

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
top is as easy as 123

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.300 
top is as easy as 123
it's<00:01:11.720> also<00:01:11.900> easy<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:12.350> do<00:01:12.560> from<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.890> left<00:01:13.100> side

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
it's also easy to do from the left side

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.000 
it's also easy to do from the left side
also<00:01:13.970> known<00:01:14.119> as<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.270> open<00:01:14.750> ramp<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.140> also

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
also known as the open ramp and also

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.370 
also known as the open ramp and also
from<00:01:16.190> the<00:01:16.220> right<00:01:16.430> side<00:01:16.670> known<00:01:17.390> as<00:01:17.540> the<00:01:17.630> library

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.200 

now<00:01:20.979> these<00:01:21.189> certainly<00:01:21.640> aren't<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:22.030> only

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
now these certainly aren't the only

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.969 
now these certainly aren't the only
trick<00:01:22.719> jumps<00:01:22.990> we've<00:01:23.140> carried<00:01:23.409> over<00:01:23.619> from<00:01:23.740> the

trick jumps we've carried over from the

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.859 
trick jumps we've carried over from the
original<00:01:24.399> so<00:01:24.789> make<00:01:24.969> sure<00:01:25.000> you<00:01:25.240> play<00:01:25.450> around<00:01:25.689> on

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
original so make sure you play around on

you can pull off next up let's talk
about<00:01:30.549> some<00:01:30.789> of<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:30.970> new<00:01:31.000> features<00:01:31.180> on<00:01:31.810> the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.700 

minimal<00:01:36.420> changes<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:36.930> been<00:01:37.050> made<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.560> walk

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
minimal changes have been made to walk

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.440 
minimal changes have been made to walk
out<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.100> I'll<00:01:38.220> keep<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.640> segment<00:01:39.090> short<00:01:39.330> and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
out so I'll keep this segment short and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.330 
out so I'll keep this segment short and
sweet<00:01:39.600> one<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:40.500> first<00:01:40.770> things<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.159> may

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
sweet one of the first things you may

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.770 
sweet one of the first things you may
notice<00:01:41.640> while<00:01:41.820> playing<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.330> that<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.570> glass

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
notice while playing is that the glass

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.740 
notice while playing is that the glass
on<00:01:42.990> top<00:01:43.200> middle<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.590> now<00:01:43.770> breakable<00:01:44.570> this<00:01:45.570> was

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
on top middle is now breakable this was

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.630 
on top middle is now breakable this was
impossible<00:01:46.080> in<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.619> original<00:01:46.860> but<00:01:47.400> don't
