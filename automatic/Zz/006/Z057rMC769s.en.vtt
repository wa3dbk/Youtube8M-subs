00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
we all need somebody to bit hey guys so

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.780 
we all need somebody to bit hey guys so
I<00:00:05.009> just<00:00:05.220> finished<00:00:05.490> session<00:00:05.940> 6<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.980> I<00:00:07.980> learned

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
I just finished session 6 and I learned

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.570 
I just finished session 6 and I learned
a<00:00:09.330> bunch<00:00:09.719> of<00:00:09.929> stuff<00:00:10.260> so<00:00:10.710> that's<00:00:10.980> kind<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.309> hard

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
a bunch of stuff so that's kind of hard

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.640 
a bunch of stuff so that's kind of hard
so<00:00:12.540> getting<00:00:13.410> harder<00:00:13.860> like<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.700> keep<00:00:14.880> saying<00:00:15.650> so

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
so getting harder like I keep saying so

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.189 
so getting harder like I keep saying so
I<00:00:17.070> learned<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:17.580> versions<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.270> chords<00:00:18.750> today

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
I learned in versions of chords today

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.519 
I learned in versions of chords today
which<00:00:19.980> are<00:00:20.689> like<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.900> had<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.170> root<00:00:22.320> position

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
which are like you had the root position

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.650 
which are like you had the root position
and<00:00:23.100> then<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.400> first<00:00:23.640> inversion<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.539> the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
and then the first inversion and the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.140 
and then the first inversion and the
second<00:00:25.050> inversion<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:26.070> mostly<00:00:26.430> did<00:00:26.849> stuff

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
second inversion we mostly did stuff

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.410 
second inversion we mostly did stuff
with<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.420> first<00:00:27.660> inversion<00:00:28.140> today<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.580> to

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
with the first inversion today so to

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.850 
with the first inversion today so to
move<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.800> says<00:00:32.840> you<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:34.079> form<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.590> first

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
move on it says you can form the first

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:46.240 
move on it says you can form the first
inversions<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.850> C<00:00:37.040> F<00:00:39.710> G<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:41.750> minor<00:00:43.760> D<00:00:44.760> minor<00:00:44.870> and

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
inversions of C F G a minor D minor and

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.529 
inversions of C F G a minor D minor and
e<00:00:47.250> minor<00:00:48.620> you<00:00:49.620> can<00:00:49.860> play<00:00:50.100> lean<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.640> me<00:00:50.910> with<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
e minor you can play lean on me with the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.569 
e minor you can play lean on me with the
metronome<00:00:51.809> at<00:00:52.199> about<00:00:52.410> six<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.890> six<00:00:53.100> beats<00:00:53.340> per

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
metronome at about six to six beats per

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.700 
metronome at about six to six beats per
minute<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> play<00:00:54.149> along<00:00:54.420> CD<00:00:55.199> track<00:00:55.469> is

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
minute the play along CD track is

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.200 
minute the play along CD track is
actually<00:00:56.039> faster<00:00:56.219> than<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.030> I'll<00:00:57.149> just

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
actually faster than that so I'll just

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:23.789 
actually faster than that so I'll just
be<00:00:57.449> doing<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.750> back

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.779 

you<00:01:24.799> can<00:01:25.009> play<00:01:25.219> C<00:01:25.700> F<00:01:26.500> G<00:01:27.500> progression<00:01:28.459> number

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
you can play C F G progression number

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:40.149 
you can play C F G progression number
one<00:01:36.579> and<00:01:37.929> you<00:01:38.929> can<00:01:38.959> play<00:01:39.259> the<00:01:39.289> first<00:01:39.679> inversion

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
one and you can play the first inversion

00:01:40.159 --> 00:02:03.350 
one and you can play the first inversion
progression<00:01:40.880> in<00:01:41.119> a<00:01:41.630> minor

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.029 

and<00:02:04.360> then<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:04.630> also<00:02:04.780> says<00:02:05.229> you<00:02:05.680> can<00:02:05.890> identify

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
and then it also says you can identify

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.190 
and then it also says you can identify
and<00:02:06.640> count<00:02:06.850> whole<00:02:07.119> notes<00:02:07.330> half<00:02:07.570> notes<00:02:07.600> quarter

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
and count whole notes half notes quarter

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.740 
and count whole notes half notes quarter
notes<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:08.649> eighth<00:02:08.860> notes<00:02:09.160> like<00:02:10.000> I<00:02:10.119> said<00:02:10.330> in<00:02:10.630> a

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
notes and eighth notes like I said in a

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.260 
notes and eighth notes like I said in a
previous<00:02:10.929> video<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:11.910> already<00:02:12.910> know<00:02:13.120> how<00:02:13.239> to

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
previous video I already know how to

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.720 
previous video I already know how to
read<00:02:13.600> music<00:02:14.380> which<00:02:14.739> is<00:02:14.950> good<00:02:15.280> even<00:02:15.610> though

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
read music which is good even though

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.520 
read music which is good even though
it's<00:02:15.880> been<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.060> really<00:02:16.270> long<00:02:16.360> time<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.170> it

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
it's been a really long time so it

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.990 
it's been a really long time so it
actually<00:02:17.709> it<00:02:17.950> was<00:02:18.040> nice<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.340> kind<00:02:18.519> of<00:02:18.610> brush<00:02:18.819> up

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
actually it was nice to kind of brush up

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.729 
actually it was nice to kind of brush up
on<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.300> but<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.690> already<00:02:20.019> know<00:02:20.260> how<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.410> read<00:02:20.620> all

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
on it but I already know how to read all

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.680 
on it but I already know how to read all
the<00:02:20.800> notes<00:02:21.010> which<00:02:21.160> is<00:02:21.310> really<00:02:21.550> good<00:02:21.790> for<00:02:22.510> me<00:02:22.660> I

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
the notes which is really good for me I

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.780 
the notes which is really good for me I
think<00:02:22.900> because<00:02:23.110> learning<00:02:23.830> all<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.220> brand

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
think because learning all that brand

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.809 
think because learning all that brand
new<00:02:24.910> I<00:02:25.150> think<00:02:25.209> would<00:02:25.630> be<00:02:25.900> even<00:02:26.860> harder<00:02:29.819> so

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
new I think would be even harder so

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.290 
new I think would be even harder so
that's<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.150> for<00:02:31.180> session<00:02:31.630> 6<00:02:31.870> &amp;<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:33.040> session<00:02:33.790> 7

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
that's it for session 6 &amp; a session 7

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.560 
that's it for session 6 &amp; a session 7
thanks<00:02:34.870> for<00:02:35.050> tagging<00:02:35.470> along
