processor<00:01:51.659> it's<00:01:52.470> actually<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.860> 1.8<00:01:53.759> giga<00:01:53.939> hertz

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299

hexa core processor with 3 gigabytes of

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.300 
hexa core processor with 3 gigabytes of
ram<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.259> doesn't<00:01:58.770> with<00:01:58.890> four<00:01:59.189> and

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
ram so it doesn't with four and

however<00:02:00.619> I<00:02:00.950> can<00:02:01.310> undoubtedly<00:02:01.610> say<00:02:02.150> that<00:02:02.450> this

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
however I can undoubtedly say that this

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.660 
however I can undoubtedly say that this
device<00:02:02.930> will<00:02:03.170> perform<00:02:03.590> like<00:02:03.890> a<00:02:04.070> beast<00:02:04.400> and

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
device will perform like a beast and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.250 
device will perform like a beast and
before<00:02:05.270> I<00:02:05.330> finally<00:02:05.690> get<00:02:05.810> some<00:02:06.020> first

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
before I finally get some first

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.960 
before I finally get some first

is their new turbocharged so motorola

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.760 
is their new turbocharged so motorola
are<00:02:15.140> basically<00:02:15.500> saying<00:02:16.090> 15<00:02:17.090> minutes<00:02:17.420> charged

are basically saying 15 minutes charged
10<00:02:18.770> hour<00:02:19.040> battery<00:02:19.550> life<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.209> that<00:02:20.569> is

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
10 hour battery life and that is

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.600 
10 hour battery life and that is
incredible<00:02:21.560> some<00:02:21.830> phones<00:02:22.069> can't<00:02:22.370> even

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
incredible some phones can't even

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.150
