thought that you know a great example

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.560 
thought that you know a great example
last<00:00:15.839> year<00:00:15.990> we<00:00:16.170> pick<00:00:16.560> Reggie<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.300> we<00:00:18.300> didn't

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
last year we pick Reggie and we didn't

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.330 
last year we pick Reggie and we didn't
need<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.750> three<00:00:19.109> at<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.260> time<00:00:19.560> we<00:00:19.710> had<00:00:19.830> duds<00:00:20.100> and

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
need a three at the time we had duds and

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.679 
need a three at the time we had duds and
we<00:00:20.609> probably<00:00:20.820> felt<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:21.270> were<00:00:21.359> going<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.570> get

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
we probably felt we were going to get

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.060 
we probably felt we were going to get
that<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.609> in<00:00:23.609> Matt<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.630> know<00:00:25.070> we

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
that and and in Matt and you know we

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.240 
that and and in Matt and you know we
have<00:00:26.189> Jamal<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.939> JJ<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.990> but<00:00:28.680> he's<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.039> best

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
have Jamal and JJ and but he's the best

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.609 
have Jamal and JJ and but he's the best
player<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.300> think<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.810> can<00:00:30.990> always<00:00:31.320> make

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
player and I think you can always make

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.430 
player and I think you can always make
it<00:00:31.769> work<00:00:32.390> when<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.719> get<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.870> best<00:00:34.140> player

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
it work when you can get the best player

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.850 
it work when you can get the best player
and<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.739> thought<00:00:35.010> as<00:00:35.610> far<00:00:35.850> as<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.149> shooting<00:00:36.860> in

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
and I thought as far as for shooting in

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.500 
and I thought as far as for shooting in
this<00:00:38.190> league<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.670> need<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.239> never

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
this league you need it you can never

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.630 
this league you need it you can never
have<00:00:39.690> enough<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:41.129> I'm<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> big<00:00:41.489> believer

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
have enough of it and I'm a big believer

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.310 
have enough of it and I'm a big believer
of<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.270> thought<00:00:42.450> he<00:00:42.600> may<00:00:43.079> have<00:00:43.140> been<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
of and I thought he may have been the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440 
of and I thought he may have been the
best<00:00:43.559> shooter<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.040> draft<00:00:44.340> or<00:00:44.579> if<00:00:45.239> not

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450
