00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.489
 hello I'm Luis Larrea that on the web 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.279
 and today I want to present the pulse we have prepared a scholarship 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.050
 monitors and photo printing 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.890
 the course is divided into several sections 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.150
 in which there are several videos in which 101 and that explains step by step 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.670
 as a hired monitor who deserves to use is because maybe those 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.670
 parameters 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.670
 the one that happened to one of them we can not touch our monitor 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.540
 durham anaco very didactic with billy you are going to power the mind like the one 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.950
 calibrated monitor and why the most important thing 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.140
 and then there is a year apart that is an excellent complementary elements 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.910
 already going to be helpful to verify previously bush commented is 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.510
 correctly calibrated 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.700
 because when the lab manifested how these images are coming out 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.500
 then how did it published as 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.100
 all comment what they go sant a series of images a series of 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.020
 images 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.340
 or we did have the original document that we will include in support 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.720
 and then it was also walked logos indicate with what role and build and 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.310
 positive have been printed 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.710
 to be in a glossy finish in finishing it is accurate 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.790
 and then he is also attentive and with the regulations 6 6 7 floors that the 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.300
 math activist we have also entrusted magenta sailor 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.440
 and also that these tests this city and companies with a rigorous control of 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.240
 quality 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.290
 in the case of the notice that 4 7 even comes with the certification standard 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.200
 so that definitely this would be the right color at the same time all ten 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.870
 images 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.100
 if it was sent by pamos-paÃºl press or we removed it for an outbreak that works 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.530
 concia magenta yellow good 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.260
 however he followed another document 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.160
 that this guy 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.300
 this is a common to the color cart that is what it is for boston lovergi 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.580
 first time in three hours or send it speech lab a state standard 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.059
 we indicate them in a video 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:21.259
 this Caracas once you have not printed with those controls 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:23.849
 quality tradition we can probatory 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.019
 we can win or be profile and cc 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.639
 It is up to you to use it as an output profile in photos or 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:31.159
 so good 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.049
 wolf also another product another small information that is proprietary and 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.489
 the economic rules 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.900
 of how we always have to dig in front of the computer and in front of monitors and 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.969
 conciliation at what distance to complications and pure standards 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:46.769
 economic 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.260
 that what you do you spend monthly that is going down and that is not easy 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.959

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.180
 of monitors calibration with these complementary products 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.969
 that we think can be percent and interest 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.110
 especially to improve our quality and also have the certainty 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.029
