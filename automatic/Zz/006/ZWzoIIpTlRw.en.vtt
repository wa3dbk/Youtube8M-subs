00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
mounts so you see you can make yourself

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.840 
mounts so you see you can make yourself
this<00:00:33.930> real<00:00:34.200> quickly<00:00:34.440> mounted<00:00:34.980> on<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.610> Mount

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
this real quickly mounted on the Mount

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.500 
this real quickly mounted on the Mount
so<00:00:36.630> now<00:00:38.059> depending<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.120> which<00:00:39.300> way<00:00:39.420> you're

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
so now depending on which way you're

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.940 
so now depending on which way you're
amount<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.110> if<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.649> side<00:00:40.920> of

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
amount so this is if this is the side of
