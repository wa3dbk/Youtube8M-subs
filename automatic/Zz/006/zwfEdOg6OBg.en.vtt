00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919 
the first innings it got probably a

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:28.380 
the first innings it got probably a
little<00:00:27.039> bit<00:00:27.189> harder<00:00:27.519> but<00:00:27.640> you<00:00:28.150> know<00:00:28.239> we've

got extremely close today we just
stumbled<00:00:32.739> at<00:00:33.220> the<00:00:33.280> last<00:00:33.489> hurdle<00:00:33.700> I<00:00:33.880> guess

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.060 
stumbled at the last hurdle I guess

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.600 
stumbled at the last hurdle I guess
right<00:00:34.270> at<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:34.450> end<00:00:34.570> there<00:00:34.750> but<00:00:35.399> I'm<00:00:36.399> very

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
right at the end there but I'm very

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.920 
right at the end there but I'm very
proud<00:00:36.910> of<00:00:36.970> what<00:00:37.180> the<00:00:37.270> guys<00:00:37.450> have<00:00:37.480> achieved

proved<00:00:41.560> a<00:00:41.650> lot<00:00:41.680> to<00:00:41.830> ourselves<00:00:42.040> as<00:00:42.520> a<00:00:42.550> group

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
proved a lot to ourselves as a group

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.460

losing<00:01:17.440> a<00:01:17.500> wicket<00:01:17.590> really<00:01:17.980> so<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:20.290> us<00:01:20.320> to<00:01:20.620> have

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
losing a wicket really so for us to have

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.430 
losing a wicket really so for us to have
done<00:01:21.580> what<00:01:21.729> we<00:01:21.850> did<00:01:21.880> today<00:01:22.150> and<00:01:22.510> create<00:01:22.930> a<00:01:23.110> few

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
done what we did today and create a few

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.980 
done what we did today and create a few
chances<00:01:23.680> and<00:01:24.100> take<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.030> seven<00:01:25.600> wickets<00:01:25.720> that

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
chances and take the seven wickets that

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.570 
chances and take the seven wickets that
we<00:01:26.080> took<00:01:26.229> I<00:01:26.409> think<00:01:26.590> was<00:01:26.740> a<00:01:26.770> reasonable<00:01:27.310> effort

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
we took I think was a reasonable effort

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.070 
we took I think was a reasonable effort
from<00:01:27.700> everyone<00:01:27.909> I'm<00:01:28.510> not<00:01:28.659> looking<00:01:28.930> at<00:01:28.990> this

because they had withheld it hell of a

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.100 
because they had withheld it hell of a
lot<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.900> pressure<00:02:43.140> there<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:44.360> yeah<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:45.930> was

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
lot of pressure there and yeah it was

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.140

out it did seem a long time for us to
bat<00:03:06.360> but<00:03:07.080> we<00:03:07.290> just<00:03:07.380> took<00:03:07.560> it<00:03:07.620> ball<00:03:07.860> by<00:03:08.010> ball

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190

we're<00:03:23.880> sitting<00:03:24.299> there<00:03:24.420> with<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.570> jewel<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:25.049> think

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
we're sitting there with a jewel I think

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.680 
we're sitting there with a jewel I think
to<00:03:25.829> a<00:03:25.859> certain<00:03:26.070> extent<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:27.180> conditions

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
to a certain extent the conditions

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.449 
to a certain extent the conditions
favored<00:03:28.530> batting<00:03:28.920> there's<00:03:29.130> no<00:03:29.250> doubt<00:03:29.430> about

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
favored batting there's no doubt about

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.390 
favored batting there's no doubt about
that<00:03:29.820> so<00:03:30.120> that's<00:03:30.750> why<00:03:30.900> i<00:03:30.930> said<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.410> know<00:03:31.470> our

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
that so that's why i said you know our

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.160 
that so that's why i said you know our
first<00:03:32.760> innings<00:03:33.209> probably<00:03:33.540> wasn't<00:03:33.810> as<00:03:33.870> good<00:03:34.049> as

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
first innings probably wasn't as good as

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.210 
first innings probably wasn't as good as
it<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.590> effort<00:03:35.010> as<00:03:35.069> it<00:03:35.190> should<00:03:35.370> be<00:03:36.590> but<00:03:37.590> i

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
it and effort as it should be but i

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.580 
it and effort as it should be but i
think<00:03:38.940> we<00:03:39.030> probably<00:03:39.239> need<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.569> get<00:03:39.750> more<00:03:39.930> more

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
think we probably need to get more more

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.319 
think we probably need to get more more
balls<00:03:40.799> consistently<00:03:41.069> in<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:41.609> right<00:03:41.790> areas<00:03:42.180> we

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
balls consistently in the right areas we

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.789 
balls consistently in the right areas we
weren't<00:03:42.510> able<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.780> do<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:43.019> on<00:03:43.230> on<00:03:43.500> this

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
weren't able to do that on on this

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.629 
weren't able to do that on on this
wicked<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:45.799> and<00:03:46.799> probably<00:03:47.130> yeah<00:03:47.250> just<00:03:47.489> maybe

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
wicked and and probably yeah just maybe

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.370 
wicked and and probably yeah just maybe
execute<00:03:48.150> our<00:03:48.209> plans<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.630> little<00:03:48.660> bit<00:03:48.900> better<00:03:49.079> so

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
execute our plans a little bit better so

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.740 
execute our plans a little bit better so
yeah<00:03:49.859> as<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.250> said<00:03:50.280> there's<00:03:51.090> relief<00:03:51.389> that<00:03:51.630> we

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
yeah as I said there's relief that we

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.970 
yeah as I said there's relief that we
came<00:03:51.900> away<00:03:52.019> with<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.290> draw<00:03:52.500> but<00:03:52.709> we're<00:03:52.859> not

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
came away with a draw but we're not

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.349 
came away with a draw but we're not
going<00:03:53.160> to<00:03:53.220> sit<00:03:53.340> here<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.579> pretend<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:54.060> we

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
going to sit here and pretend that we

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.000 
going to sit here and pretend that we
have<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.630> be<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.840> way<00:03:54.959> we<00:03:54.989> perform<00:03:55.470> this<00:03:55.650> this

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
have to be the way we perform this this

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.069 
have to be the way we perform this this
week<00:03:56.280> we<00:03:57.000> were<00:03:57.090> down<00:03:57.329> on<00:03:57.359> where<00:03:57.690> we<00:03:57.810> needed<00:03:57.989> to

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
week we were down on where we needed to

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.300 
week we were down on where we needed to
be<00:03:58.850> Australia<00:03:59.850> kind<00:04:00.810> of<00:04:00.900> showed<00:04:01.109> is<00:04:01.260> that

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
be Australia kind of showed is that

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.379 
be Australia kind of showed is that
they're<00:04:02.310> going<00:04:02.459> to<00:04:02.549> be<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.700> tough<00:04:02.970> nut<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.239> crack

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
they're going to be a tough nut to crack

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.780 
they're going to be a tough nut to crack
there's<00:04:03.870> no<00:04:03.989> doubt<00:04:04.170> about<00:04:04.200> that<00:04:04.410> and<00:04:04.650> we<00:04:05.639> need

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
there's no doubt about that and we need

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.150 
there's no doubt about that and we need
to<00:04:05.850> get<00:04:05.940> better
