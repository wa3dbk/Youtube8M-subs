00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
create a knockin pattern here which

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.220 
create a knockin pattern here which
allows<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.849> to<00:02:10.060> unlock<00:02:10.599> your<00:02:10.780> phone<00:02:10.840> so<00:02:11.200> I

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
allows you to unlock your phone so I

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.370 
allows you to unlock your phone so I
guess<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.739> pattern<00:02:12.099> here<00:02:12.340> is<00:02:12.489> this<00:02:12.730> one<00:02:13.380> and

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
guess the pattern here is this one and

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.250 
guess the pattern here is this one and
there<00:02:14.739> you<00:02:15.099> go<00:02:15.370> we<00:02:16.120> have<00:02:16.330> just<00:02:16.660> unlocked<00:02:17.080> the

there you go we have just unlocked the
