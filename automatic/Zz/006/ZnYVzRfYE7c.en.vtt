00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.640
 super we are trotting on the hand 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.830
 left 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.269
 if I was in horse I never 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.070
 will not accept having someone on the 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.500
 back the man who is saying these things and 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.120
 yet albert von voltigeurs riders 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.710
 Dutch won the medal 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.660
 Silver at the Sydney Olympics 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.660
 in 2000 with his pram horse 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.430
 we use the young horse for our 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.070
 ego for our success and when the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.250
 success does not happen fast enough in chile 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.520
 where there is the horse who suffer 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.660
 weight on the stirrups is not more than 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.020
 the weight of your feet very well very 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.210
 well 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.010
 this suffering albert von took some 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.480
 consciousness a few years ago he has 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.030
 also found that ignorance 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.100
 horse was born the brutality of the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.770
 jumper for example at a level 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.440
 accepting what is the highest of 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.070
 all animals and because of that it's 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.920
 not necessary for most cases 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.380
 nothing to really think about his horse 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.670
 because he still does 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.600
 to sell them to do everything to 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.700
 alleviate this suffering 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.409
 he will change his method that transmits 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.390
 for several years he is especially 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.310
 the regular guest of the equestrian center of 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.850
 silva foucault then as they decry 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.549
 the posture is to be in the middle of his 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.020
 horse and move as little as possible 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.509
 to try to hinder as little as possible 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.689
 his horse is a question of posture 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.210
 so we stay centered in the middle of 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.720
 his horse plus the orders are 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.659
 easy 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.880
 here is the horse must be listened to 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.909
 theza will support your serious and we 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.119
 buy is neutral because because of the thumb 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.100
 it opens the troll ropes tordjman for 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.020
 maeva future instructor in brittany 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.810
 the first work session she from there 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.000
 discover a new horse riding one is 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.890
 more relaxed in fact with the 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.829
 horse more is that much 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.119
 much better the explanations are 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.770
 a lot less complicated actually we have 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.000
 it's a lot simpler a horse 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.170
 relaxed is a horse that goes 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.390
 give the best of himself to his 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.210
 rider and unconstrained without force 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.100
 simply by the agreement and then haircuts 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.040
 that we have previously established with him 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.610
 because I say I want a tour that brings 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.610
 outside who is coming forward to give the 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.530
 possibility to ride horse and in 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.170
 the same time the leg an interior which 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.060
 come forward people for not pushed he has 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:33.280
 built outside ok starts again 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.350
 our responsibility is alignment 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.120
 it is to put in a good situation 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.239
 who has the least possible for him 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.910
 that's what he'll be our 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.920
 concave responsablity and this approach 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.780
 of animal made school the goal is 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.370
 to arrive at the perfection of the unity of 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.690
 rider or rider with the 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.690
 horse without suffering
