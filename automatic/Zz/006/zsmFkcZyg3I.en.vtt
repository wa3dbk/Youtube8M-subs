you<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:31.950> see<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> little<00:01:32.430> hint<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.759> Corvette

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
you can see a little hint a Corvette

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.719 
you can see a little hint a Corvette
their<00:01:33.570> bow<00:01:33.960> tie<00:01:34.229> very<00:01:35.009> prevalent<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.579> me<00:01:35.700> I

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
their bow tie very prevalent to me I

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.030 
their bow tie very prevalent to me I
think<00:01:35.820> that's<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.570> was<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.930> was<00:01:37.079> important

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
think that's that was that was important

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.520 
think that's that was that was important
on<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.250> vehicle<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:40.229> stance

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
on this vehicle just like the stance

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.990 
on this vehicle just like the stance
here<00:01:40.829> says<00:01:41.189> we're<00:01:41.640> wheel<00:01:41.820> drive<00:01:43.009> exhaust<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.280> v8

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
here says we're wheel drive exhaust a v8

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.410 
here says we're wheel drive exhaust a v8
and<00:01:45.500> powerful<00:01:46.500> v8<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.670> from<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.030> standpoint

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
and powerful v8 so from that standpoint

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.469 
and powerful v8 so from that standpoint
I<00:01:49.020> think<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.189> really<00:01:50.220> really<00:01:50.670> sends<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.119> strong

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
I think it really really sends a strong

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.679 
I think it really really sends a strong
message<00:01:51.540> here<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.790> see<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:53.970> separation

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
message here you can see the separation

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.020 
message here you can see the separation
of<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:55.170> pillar<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.770> b-pillar<00:01:56.189> do<00:01:56.369> not<00:01:56.549> flow

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
of a pillar and the b-pillar do not flow

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.209 
of a pillar and the b-pillar do not flow
into<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.540> body<00:01:57.899> there<00:01:58.350> separates<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.189> a

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
into the body there separates like a

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.719 
into the body there separates like a
canopy<00:01:59.939> on<00:01:59.969> top<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.540> fuselage<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:02.549> other

successful have that send it look a
little<00:02:21.010> awkward<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.519> little<00:02:21.879> unstable<00:02:22.239> but<00:02:22.599> the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
little awkward a little unstable but the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.289 
little awkward a little unstable but the
tires<00:02:23.230> are<00:02:23.500> in<00:02:23.769> so<00:02:24.580> that's<00:02:24.730> this<00:02:25.000> platform

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
tires are in so that's this platform

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.030

allows<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:25.989> to<00:02:26.049> do<00:02:26.140> front<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.590> rear<00:02:26.769> so<00:02:26.980> you

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
allows you to do front and rear so you

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.190 
allows you to do front and rear so you
have<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.459> sense<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:27.849> stance<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.660> and

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
have that sense of stance and and and

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.720 
have that sense of stance and and and
power<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.739> purpose<00:02:30.069> you<00:02:30.400> look<00:02:30.549> at<00:02:30.640> the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
power and purpose you look at the

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.259 
power and purpose you look at the
