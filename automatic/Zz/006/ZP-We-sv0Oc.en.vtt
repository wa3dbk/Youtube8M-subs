00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
I stumbled across the Benelli I bought

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.469 
I stumbled across the Benelli I bought
it<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.460> quickly<00:01:29.729> fell<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.149> love<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
it I quickly fell in love with the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.889 
it I quickly fell in love with the
shotgun<00:01:30.719> this<00:01:31.680> shotgun<00:01:31.950> holds<00:01:32.820> nine<00:01:33.119> rounds

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
shotgun this shotgun holds nine rounds

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.090 
shotgun this shotgun holds nine rounds
it<00:01:33.990> holds<00:01:34.170> seven<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.469> the<00:01:34.560> tube<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.920> two<00:01:35.009> in

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
it holds seven in the tube and two in

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.380 
it holds seven in the tube and two in
the<00:01:35.189> receiver<00:01:35.490> I'll<00:01:35.700> show<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.969> how<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.210> works

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
the receiver I'll show you how it works

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.389 
the receiver I'll show you how it works
so<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.320> load<00:01:37.500> two<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> receiver<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
so you can load two in the receiver and

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.639 
so you can load two in the receiver and
the<00:01:38.490> gun<00:01:38.640> still<00:01:38.880> functions<00:01:39.299> as<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.539> should<00:01:39.780> but

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
the gun still functions as it should but

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.410 
the gun still functions as it should but
anyway<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.070> shotgun<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.700> really<00:01:42.000> cool<00:01:42.210> and

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
anyway this shotgun is really cool and

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.779 
anyway this shotgun is really cool and
that<00:01:42.450> because<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.079> not<00:01:43.229> gas<00:01:43.619> operated<00:01:44.189> its

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
that because it's not gas operated its

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.849 
that because it's not gas operated its
recoil<00:01:45.179> operator<00:01:45.659> or<00:01:45.810> inertia<00:01:46.049> operated<00:01:46.679> it

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
recoil operator or inertia operated it

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:49.669 
recoil operator or inertia operated it
can<00:01:47.009> cycle<00:01:47.399> everything<00:01:47.820> from<00:01:48.420> these<00:01:48.570> son<00:01:49.500> and

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
can cycle everything from these son and

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.340

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.550 
only weighs something like seven pounds
so<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.939> recoil<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.570> pretty<00:02:06.810> fierce<00:02:07.109> we<00:02:07.320> start

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
so the recoil is pretty fierce we start

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.050 
so the recoil is pretty fierce we start
using<00:02:07.649> two<00:02:07.890> heavier<00:02:08.160> loads<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
using two heavier loads but the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.700 
using two heavier loads but the
reliability<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.750> shotgun<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.259> really

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
reliability this shotgun is really

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.650 
reliability this shotgun is really
surprising<00:02:10.890> even<00:02:11.670> when<00:02:11.819> using<00:02:12.030> light<00:02:12.360> bird

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
surprising even when using light bird

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.250 
surprising even when using light bird
loads
