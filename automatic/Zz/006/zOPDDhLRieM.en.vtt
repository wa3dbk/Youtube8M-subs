00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
downs where they're gonna run the Titan

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.840

and<00:03:06.930> an<00:03:07.380> angle<00:03:07.739> route<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.160> then<00:03:08.280> do<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.610> same

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
and an angle route and then do the same

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.699 
and an angle route and then do the same
thing<00:03:09.150> on<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.630> running<00:03:09.959> back<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:10.350> just<00:03:10.380> in

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
thing on the running back so just in

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.280 
thing on the running back so just in
case<00:03:10.950> they<00:03:11.489> tighten<00:03:12.030> isn't<00:03:12.540> open<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.959> running

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
case they tighten isn't open the running

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.500 
case they tighten isn't open the running
back<00:03:13.470> can<00:03:13.709> be<00:03:14.130> open<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:14.700> vice<00:03:14.880> versa<00:03:15.209> but

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
back can be open and vice versa but

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.690 
back can be open and vice versa but
that's<00:03:16.019> easier<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.500> cover<00:03:16.860> maybe<00:03:17.430> it's<00:03:17.640> just

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
that's easier to cover maybe it's just

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.290 
that's easier to cover maybe it's just
me<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.320> don't<00:03:19.320> know<00:03:19.470> maybe<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:20.040> don't<00:03:20.970> know<00:03:21.180> how
