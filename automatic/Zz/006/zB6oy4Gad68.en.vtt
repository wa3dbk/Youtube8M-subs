00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.730
 in his the agricultural cooperative 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.799
 of wasteland free has set up a 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.270
 action program to reduce the 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.220
 transfer of phytosanitary products 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.220
 to the waters of its territory 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.900
 the cooperative the cheating she exists 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.509
 since 1936 a little the birth of 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.829
 all the cooperatives following the marasmus 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.570
 agricultural who had that time 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.550
 today represents 200 members 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.140
 assets in a territory of 20 thousand 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.730
 global hectares and sixteen thousand hectares 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.589
 of crops mainly cereals and 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.230
 oilseeds on a sector strongly 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:46.250
 urbanized on the on the ridge on the spine 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.250
 dorsal departments of vienne 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.620
 the cooperative has since initiated 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.510
 now fifteen years a 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.179
 differentiation approach with 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.940
 its members in order to promote the 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:02.010
 production of producers through 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.870
 sectors so value the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.250
 Producer production allows 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.820
 to improve their margins ha their 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.570
 bringing added value finally from 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.860
 2000s the cooperative decides 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.870
 engage in sustainable development 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.330
 in order to draw up a roadmap on 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.850
 the vision of the profession that we can have 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.680
 to 15 20 years and therefore take into account 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.390
 the environmental impact of practices 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.600
 of our producers and especially those 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.650
 targeting the water the cooperative to a 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.130
 very strong relationship with their 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.229
 producer and has always animated 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.030
 collective the steps a little 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.090
 innovative 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:44.090
 that's why we used a 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.310
 footways service provider who will 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.930
 modeled and who modeled the products 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.100
 phytosanitary products used by our 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.720
 members in the territory of the 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.729
 cooperative in relation to their risks 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.080
 transfers to the waters they 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.820
 be superficial and underground 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.399
 it takes a first inventory first 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.050
 to help products that we use 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.280
 currently on the cooperative have a 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.800
 state of play of the risk of transfer 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.600
 to target and define axes 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.610
 improvement in terms of 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.160
 referencing of certain materials 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.160
 which will be promoted by the 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.540
 following our to our members isolate the 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.480
 products that raises worries 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.590
 and if there is a technical alternative 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.200
 available on the market 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.459
 well we deference the product that 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.830
 transfers to replace it with a 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.269
 product that transfers door and the big 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.670
 also benefit from modeling that 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.769
 allows to target possibly type of 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.590
 soil or types of crops that would 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:37.280
 favoring the transfer of 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.150
 plant protection products as 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.989
 approach is global 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.340
 they affect all of our 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.440
 members ie 200 members 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.510
 sixteen thousand hectares and therefore inevitably 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.209
 the impact of our practices will be beneficial 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.860
 for the environment and for quality 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.980
 of the waters that crosses us 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.980
 territories 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.019
 it's a very strong commitment from the 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.360
 cooperative that places the quality of 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.260
 water at the heart of these missions is 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.920
 really his daily work 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.239
 and in the long term it's a process 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.860
 multiannual it started already there 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.450
 over a year and it will continue it's 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.799
 in the long run it's really a 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.150
 a process that will benefit all 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.150
 the actors of the territory 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.159
 it's a win-win 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.780
 farmers because they can 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:31.060
 prove that they are capable of producing 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.680
 without polluting so that then it values 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.180
 their job and then maybe for 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.030
 some it gives them some 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.159
 pride that they had maybe a little 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.500
 lost is also a winner for 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:43.139
 water managers and they they 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.040
 can see concretely 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.329
 improving the quality of water 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.459
 on the territory 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.220
 and then finally it's a winner for the 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.430
 cooperative because she can she 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.680
 value this approach to its 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.260
 agri-food buyers langer 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.879
 here is to treat better is to 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.700
 treat better by taking into account 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:06.730
 the impact of treatments on 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.150
 territorial water resources the goal 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.430
 is to have good results 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.549
 Phytosanitary good health status 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.870
 crops without penalizing 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.829
 the environment and without penalizing 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.829
 major economic
