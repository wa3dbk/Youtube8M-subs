00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
gonna be building their legs for the

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.999 
gonna be building their legs for the
Walker<00:00:09.789> which<00:00:10.789> you<00:00:10.879> can<00:00:10.999> see<00:00:11.150> here<00:00:11.889> i'ma<00:00:12.889> be

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
Walker which you can see here i'ma be

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.890 
Walker which you can see here i'ma be
doing<00:00:13.190> them<00:00:13.280> in<00:00:13.459> the<00:00:13.700> wall<00:00:14.389> alone<00:00:14.629> as<00:00:14.929> usual

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
doing them in the wall alone as usual

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.150 
doing them in the wall alone as usual
what<00:00:17.900> I<00:00:17.929> did<00:00:18.080> here<00:00:18.109> first<00:00:18.500> was<00:00:18.710> just<00:00:18.949> to<00:00:19.010> build

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
what I did here first was just to build

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.529 
what I did here first was just to build
one<00:00:19.310> of<00:00:19.340> the<00:00:19.490> legs<00:00:19.609> straight<00:00:20.000> down<00:00:20.150> to<00:00:20.390> work

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
one of the legs straight down to work

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.790 
one of the legs straight down to work
out<00:00:20.689> all<00:00:20.840> the<00:00:20.990> dimensions<00:00:21.349> that<00:00:21.410> was<00:00:21.619> gonna

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
out all the dimensions that was gonna

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.950 
out all the dimensions that was gonna
need<00:00:22.009> and<00:00:22.820> this<00:00:23.060> was<00:00:23.210> handy<00:00:23.420> to<00:00:23.509> do<00:00:23.599> just<00:00:23.900> so

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
need and this was handy to do just so

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.089 
need and this was handy to do just so
I'll<00:00:24.019> go<00:00:24.140> get<00:00:24.259> all<00:00:24.380> the<00:00:24.500> measurements<00:00:24.890> before

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
I'll go get all the measurements before

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.310 
I'll go get all the measurements before
I<00:00:25.339> started<00:00:25.730> putting<00:00:26.029> the<00:00:26.240> quarter<00:00:26.810> for<00:00:26.960> legs

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
I started putting the quarter for legs

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.620 
I started putting the quarter for legs
building<00:00:28.220> damn<00:00:28.339> angles<00:00:28.880> to<00:00:29.029> show<00:00:29.179> the<00:00:29.240> motion

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
building damn angles to show the motion

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.279 
building damn angles to show the motion
of<00:00:29.720> the<00:00:29.839> Walker<00:00:30.019> I<00:00:31.960> suggest<00:00:32.960> if<00:00:33.079> you're<00:00:33.170> doing

00:00:33.279 --> 00:00:33.289 
of the Walker I suggest if you're doing

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:35.020 
of the Walker I suggest if you're doing
any<00:00:33.469> major<00:00:33.770> builds<00:00:34.100> of<00:00:34.190> your<00:00:34.340> own<00:00:34.430> to<00:00:34.760> used

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
any major builds of your own to used

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.880 
any major builds of your own to used
method<00:00:35.450> of<00:00:35.600> different<00:00:36.050> color<00:00:36.200> walls<00:00:36.410> for<00:00:36.829> an

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
method of different color walls for an

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.200 
method of different color walls for an
outline<00:00:37.129> because<00:00:37.460> it<00:00:37.550> gives<00:00:37.670> a<00:00:37.730> real<00:00:37.879> taste<00:00:38.120> of

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
outline because it gives a real taste of

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.610 
outline because it gives a real taste of
rainbow<00:00:38.510> effect<00:00:38.780> and<00:00:38.960> makes<00:00:39.140> things<00:00:39.350> a<00:00:39.469> lot

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
rainbow effect and makes things a lot

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.799 
rainbow effect and makes things a lot
more<00:00:39.649> easier<00:00:40.129> to<00:00:40.190> track<00:00:40.820> and<00:00:41.000> follow<00:00:41.030> for<00:00:41.690> what

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
more easier to track and follow for what

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.260 
more easier to track and follow for what
you're<00:00:41.930> doing

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
you're doing

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.279 
you're doing
normally<00:00:44.270> for<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.570> part<00:00:44.750> of<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:45.020> leg<00:00:45.140> that

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
normally for the part of the leg that

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.470 
normally for the part of the leg that
has<00:00:45.410> been<00:00:45.590> made<00:00:45.739> of<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.219> pink<00:00:46.520> blocks<00:00:46.789> I<00:00:47.030> would

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
has been made of the pink blocks I would

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.270 
has been made of the pink blocks I would
do<00:00:47.539> that<00:00:47.719> in<00:00:47.809> two<00:00:47.989> separate<00:00:48.469> kind<00:00:48.920> of<00:00:49.010> colors

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
do that in two separate kind of colors

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.910 
do that in two separate kind of colors
for<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:50.809> actual<00:00:51.140> working<00:00:51.410> you<00:00:51.530> of<00:00:51.710> how<00:00:51.859> the

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
for the actual working you of how the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.889 
for the actual working you of how the
lake<00:00:52.190> operates<00:00:52.579> through<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:53.359> circle<00:00:53.719> joint

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
lake operates through the circle joint

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.990 
lake operates through the circle joint
in<00:00:54.019> the<00:00:54.109> middle<00:00:54.250> using<00:00:55.250> one<00:00:55.399> big<00:00:55.609> unit<00:00:55.879> of

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
in the middle using one big unit of

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.670 
in the middle using one big unit of
blocks<00:00:56.269> was<00:00:56.539> a<00:00:56.570> lot<00:00:56.750> easier<00:00:57.050> than<00:00:57.260> trying<00:00:57.559> to

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
blocks was a lot easier than trying to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.500 
blocks was a lot easier than trying to
work<00:00:57.980> out<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:58.250> different<00:00:58.489> scales<00:00:58.699> of<00:00:59.000> two

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
work out the different scales of two

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.139 
work out the different scales of two
different<00:00:59.840> sets<00:01:00.550> because<00:01:01.550> when<00:01:01.820> it<00:01:01.910> come<00:01:02.030> to

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
different sets because when it come to

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.669 
different sets because when it come to
the<00:01:02.239> stage<00:01:02.449> of<00:01:02.600> putting<00:01:02.989> detail<00:01:03.320> into<00:01:03.530> the

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:03.679 
the stage of putting detail into the

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.530 
the stage of putting detail into the
build<00:01:03.859> you'll<00:01:04.129> really<00:01:04.339> see<00:01:04.549> that<00:01:04.820> payoff<00:01:05.150> and

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
build you'll really see that payoff and

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.710 
build you'll really see that payoff and
way<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.500> legs<00:01:07.460> work<00:01:07.970> with<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.299> circle<00:01:08.570> joint

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
way the legs work with the circle joint

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.570 
way the legs work with the circle joint
in<00:01:08.900> the<00:01:08.960> middle<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:10.250> make<00:01:10.369> life<00:01:10.549> more

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
in the middle and to make life more

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.460 
in the middle and to make life more
difficult<00:01:10.759> for<00:01:11.270> myself<00:01:11.630> I<00:01:11.720> decided<00:01:12.049> to<00:01:12.200> go<00:01:12.290> the

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
difficult for myself I decided to go the

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.609 
difficult for myself I decided to go the
front<00:01:12.650> right<00:01:12.920> foot<00:01:12.950> up<00:01:13.580> off<00:01:13.909> the<00:01:14.060> ground<00:01:14.619> which

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
front right foot up off the ground which

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.160 
front right foot up off the ground which
actually<00:01:16.220> it's<00:01:17.060> all<00:01:17.600> much<00:01:17.750> harder<00:01:17.990> than<00:01:18.110> you

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
actually it's all much harder than you

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.539 
actually it's all much harder than you
might<00:01:18.320> think<00:01:18.350> it<00:01:18.560> is<00:01:18.710> because<00:01:19.220> all<00:01:19.430> the

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
might think it is because all the

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.899 
might think it is because all the
different<00:01:19.790> angles<00:01:20.000> are<00:01:20.090> being<00:01:20.329> used<00:01:20.479> her<00:01:20.630> and

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
different angles are being used her and

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.730 
different angles are being used her and
this<00:01:22.909> bottom<00:01:23.329> part<00:01:23.450> leg<00:01:23.750> I<00:01:23.960> think<00:01:24.170> of<00:01:24.320> rebuilds

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
this bottom part leg I think of rebuilds

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.819 
this bottom part leg I think of rebuilds
now<00:01:24.890> a<00:01:24.920> total<00:01:25.369> of<00:01:25.600> six<00:01:26.600> maybe<00:01:26.840> seven<00:01:26.960> times<00:01:27.530> and

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
now a total of six maybe seven times and

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.310 
now a total of six maybe seven times and
it's<00:01:28.820> taking<00:01:29.090> up<00:01:29.149> a<00:01:29.390> lot<00:01:29.600> more<00:01:29.720> time<00:01:29.960> than<00:01:30.170> any

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
it's taking up a lot more time than any

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.499 
it's taking up a lot more time than any
order<00:01:30.560> individual<00:01:31.220> part<00:01:31.460> of<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.820> build<00:01:32.000> it

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
order individual part of the build it

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.450 
order individual part of the build it
was<00:01:32.659> a<00:01:32.689> very<00:01:32.869> long<00:01:33.020> process<00:01:33.079> and<00:01:33.590> you'll<00:01:34.100> start

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
was a very long process and you'll start

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.899 
was a very long process and you'll start
to<00:01:34.520> see<00:01:34.610> somebody<00:01:35.060> in<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.360> next<00:01:35.780> episode<00:01:36.140> and

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
to see somebody in the next episode and

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.280
