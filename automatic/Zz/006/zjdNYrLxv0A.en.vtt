foam<00:00:06.000> craft<00:00:06.359> 4<00:00:06.629> tutorial<00:00:06.990> today<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:08.040> we<00:00:08.250> took

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
foam craft 4 tutorial today and we took

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.060 
foam craft 4 tutorial today and we took
about<00:00:08.670> two<00:00:09.420> great<00:00:09.840> additions<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.410> full<00:00:10.769> craft

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
about two great additions to full craft

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.589 
about two great additions to full craft
for<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.750> first<00:00:12.750> one<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.080> for<00:00:13.769> our<00:00:13.920> king<00:00:14.099> lab<00:00:14.599> it

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
for the first one is for our king lab it

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.650 
for the first one is for our king lab it
will<00:00:15.900> light<00:00:16.260> up<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.680> pretty<00:00:17.400> big<00:00:17.580> area<00:00:17.789> like

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
will light up a pretty big area like

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.330 
will light up a pretty big area like
this<00:00:19.760> when<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.850> place<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.060> down<00:00:22.130> you<00:00:23.130> should

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
this when you place it down you should

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.320 
this when you place it down you should
note<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:24.680> you<00:00:25.680> can<00:00:25.859> place<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.310> against<00:00:27.269> force

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
note that you can place it against force

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.170 
note that you can place it against force
like<00:00:30.560> this<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.309> actually<00:00:32.489> looks<00:00:32.730> pretty

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
like this and it actually looks pretty

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.229 
like this and it actually looks pretty
nice<00:00:33.329> most<00:00:34.230> connected<00:00:34.739> textures<00:00:35.700> things<00:00:36.030> like

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
nice most connected textures things like

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.389 
nice most connected textures things like
this<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.600> have<00:00:36.780> seen<00:00:36.930> hasn't<00:00:37.890> looked<00:00:38.010> at<00:00:38.160> that

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
this I have seen hasn't looked at that

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.750 
this I have seen hasn't looked at that
much<00:00:39.260> and<00:00:40.260> like<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.829> then<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.550> also

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
much and like that then it can also

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.040 
much and like that then it can also
place<00:00:42.300> from<00:00:42.620> like<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:46.309> you<00:00:47.309> should<00:00:47.520> know

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
place from like this you should know

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.310 
place from like this you should know
that<00:00:49.610> when<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.760> destroy<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.600> block<00:00:51.870> where

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
that when you destroy the block where

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.170 
that when you destroy the block where
connected<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.960> they<00:00:54.960> will<00:00:55.199> fall<00:00:55.590> as<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.879> saw

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
connected to they will fall as you saw

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.189 
connected to they will fall as you saw
like<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.590> even<00:00:58.640> if<00:00:59.640> we<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.719> something

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
like that even if we have something

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.550 
like that even if we have something
under<00:01:01.710> bump<00:01:02.539> so<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:04.170> could<00:01:04.439> stand<00:01:05.339> there<00:01:06.560> as

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
under bump so we could stand there as

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.410 
under bump so we could stand there as
you<00:01:07.770> see<00:01:07.950> there<00:01:10.640> you<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.850> also<00:01:13.189> use<00:01:14.189> them<00:01:14.430> with

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
you see there you can also use them with

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.340 
you see there you can also use them with
an<00:01:15.570> arcane<00:01:16.140> ball<00:01:17.750> but<00:01:18.750> now<00:01:19.080> uses<00:01:20.900> one<00:01:21.900> focus<00:01:22.259> I

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
an arcane ball but now uses one focus I

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.570 
an arcane ball but now uses one focus I
situation<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.280> way<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.270> set<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.689> a

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
situation is in a way in the set of a

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.840 
situation is in a way in the set of a
one<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.729> escalation<00:01:27.829> when<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.920> use<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.250> with

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
one of escalation when you use it with

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.569 
one of escalation when you use it with
an<00:01:30.000> arcing<00:01:30.390> ball<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:31.170> need<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.409> place<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.680> next

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
an arcing ball you need to place it next

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.749 
an arcing ball you need to place it next
to<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.150> base<00:01:33.409> not<00:01:34.409> one<00:01:34.770> block<00:01:35.009> away<00:01:35.159> from<00:01:35.490> it

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
to the base not one block away from it

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.950 
to the base not one block away from it
like<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:37.290> need<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.560> place<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:38.720> jar<00:01:39.720> of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
like this and you need to place a jar of

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.789 
like this and you need to place a jar of
essence<00:01:40.759> with<00:01:41.759> especially<00:01:42.750> with<00:01:43.020> blocks<00:01:43.500> in

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
essence with especially with blocks in

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.920 
essence with especially with blocks in
it<00:01:44.009> next<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.850> it

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
it next to it

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.520 
it next to it
and<00:01:46.860> then<00:01:47.070> when<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.610> put<00:01:47.940> on<00:01:48.060> working<00:01:48.690> work<00:01:48.870> or

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
and then when you put on working work or

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.960 
and then when you put on working work or
turn<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:51.240> will<00:01:51.480> let<00:01:51.750> up<00:01:51.900> very<00:01:52.670> like<00:01:53.670> this

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
turn it on it will let up very like this

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:02.330 
turn it on it will let up very like this
and<00:01:55.310> -<00:01:56.870> it<00:01:57.870> means<00:01:58.580> 32<00:01:59.580> works<00:02:00.120> to<00:02:00.840> finish<00:02:01.350> one

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
and - it means 32 works to finish one

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.590 
and - it means 32 works to finish one
cycle<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.390> light<00:02:04.260> as<00:02:04.850> at<00:02:05.850> least<00:02:06.090> when<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.360> try<00:02:06.570> to

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
cycle of light as at least when I try to

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.480 
cycle of light as at least when I try to
do<00:02:06.870> here<00:02:07.970> then<00:02:09.649> we<00:02:10.649> have<00:02:10.680> the<00:02:11.520> lamp<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.940> growth

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
do here then we have the lamp of growth

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.520 
do here then we have the lamp of growth
without<00:02:14.490> any<00:02:15.030> power<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:17.280> will<00:02:17.640> generate

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
without any power to it it will generate

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.060 
without any power to it it will generate
light<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.460> 7<00:02:20.790> block<00:02:20.940> area<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.830> not<00:02:22.830> sweat

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
light in a 7 block area and not sweat

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.600 
light in a 7 block area and not sweat
bright<00:02:23.810> as<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:25.050> can<00:02:25.230> see<00:02:25.380> here<00:02:25.560> next<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.340> it

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
bright as you can see here next to it it

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.030 
bright as you can see here next to it it
has<00:02:26.790> light<00:02:27.120> level<00:02:28.010> 6<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:30.560> it's<00:02:31.560> not<00:02:31.740> very

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
has light level 6 so it's not very

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.640 
has light level 6 so it's not very
strong<00:02:32.220> light<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:33.780> stronger<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.380> light

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
strong light and the stronger the light

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.360 
strong light and the stronger the light
you<00:02:35.550> get<00:02:35.700> from<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.030> but<00:02:36.600> more<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:38.100> quicker

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
you get from it but more the quicker

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.160 
you get from it but more the quicker
things<00:02:38.850> around<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.420> will<00:02:39.600> grow<00:02:40.430> so<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.940> guy

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
things around it will grow so this guy

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.110 
things around it will grow so this guy
but<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.490> powered<00:02:44.490> by<00:02:44.760> herba<00:02:46.670> has<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.880> light

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
but is powered by herba has a light

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.190 
but is powered by herba has a light
level<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.600> 13<00:02:49.440> next<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:51.120> light<00:02:51.330> has

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
level of 13 next to it and the light has

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:01.330 
level of 13 next to it and the light has
a<00:02:52.230> range<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:53.959> 40<00:02:56.900> when<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:57.930> looked<00:02:58.200> there<00:02:58.700> for<00:02:59.700> me

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
a range of 40 when I looked there for me

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.970 
a range of 40 when I looked there for me
so<00:03:02.340> it's<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:02.909> lot<00:03:03.150> better<00:03:05.030> so<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.090> can<00:03:06.269> use<00:03:06.450> it

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
so it's a lot better so you can use it

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.399 
so it's a lot better so you can use it
to<00:03:07.980> build<00:03:08.189> forms<00:03:08.900> but<00:03:09.900> looks<00:03:10.140> similar<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.980> this

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
to build forms but looks similar to this

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:18.910 
to build forms but looks similar to this
so<00:03:13.409> you<00:03:13.469> have<00:03:13.799> your<00:03:13.920> lab<00:03:14.310> on<00:03:15.180> top<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.629> it<00:03:17.540> of<00:03:18.540> the

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
so you have your lab on top of it of the

so you have your lab on top of it of the
forum<00:03:19.920> area<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:20.819> it<00:03:20.879> lights<00:03:21.150> down<00:03:21.689> on<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:22.079> big

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
forum area so it lights down on a big

forum area so it lights down on a big
area<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:24.799> you<00:03:25.799> have<00:03:26.370> an<00:03:27.209> arcane<00:03:29.030> furnace<00:03:30.319> next

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
area and you have an arcane furnace next

to the field but supplies it's put herba
you<00:03:35.970> could<00:03:36.150> use<00:03:37.129> golems<00:03:38.129> or<00:03:38.629> a<00:03:39.799> solution<00:03:40.799> from

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
you could use golems or a solution from

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.099 
you could use golems or a solution from
some<00:03:41.189> other<00:03:41.340> model<00:03:41.669> to<00:03:42.180> collect<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:42.900> wheat

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
some other model to collect the wheat

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.990 
some other model to collect the wheat
and<00:03:43.970> create<00:03:44.970> herba<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:46.620> even<00:03:47.280> remember<00:03:47.669> it

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
and create herba and even remember it

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.270 
and create herba and even remember it
has<00:03:48.180> happened<00:03:48.389> but<00:03:48.959> probably<00:03:49.560> some<00:03:49.799> plants<00:03:50.129> do

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
has happened but probably some plants do

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.899 
has happened but probably some plants do
and<00:03:50.489> you<00:03:51.450> can<00:03:51.919> use<00:03:52.919> it<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:54.799> always<00:03:55.799> have<00:03:56.159> foster

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
and you can use it to always have foster

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:02.440 
and you can use it to always have foster
growing<00:03:57.299> plants

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.520 

in<00:04:03.170> this<00:04:03.530> particular<00:04:04.220> field<00:04:04.569> you<00:04:05.569> will<00:04:05.780> at

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
in this particular field you will at

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:13.660 
in this particular field you will at
minimum<00:04:06.980> have<00:04:07.910> a<00:04:08.480> light<00:04:09.319> level<00:04:09.709> of<00:04:09.830> eight<00:04:12.670> so

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
minimum have a light level of eight so

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.170 
minimum have a light level of eight so
you<00:04:14.300> could<00:04:14.630> to<00:04:15.350> get<00:04:15.700> more<00:04:16.700> or<00:04:16.760> less<00:04:16.820> the<00:04:17.030> same

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
you could to get more or less the same

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.450 
you could to get more or less the same
effect<00:04:17.540> you<00:04:17.840> could<00:04:18.500> put<00:04:19.570> one<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:21.280> lamp<00:04:22.280> of

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
effect you could put one the lamp of

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.760 
effect you could put one the lamp of
growing<00:04:23.680> over<00:04:24.680> each<00:04:24.950> block<00:04:25.820> of<00:04:25.850> wheat<00:04:26.770> but

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
growing over each block of wheat but

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.409 
growing over each block of wheat but
that's<00:04:28.220> a<00:04:28.669> lot<00:04:29.090> more<00:04:29.270> expensive<00:04:30.940> but<00:04:31.940> it<00:04:32.210> would

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
that's a lot more expensive but it would

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.920 
that's a lot more expensive but it would
do<00:04:32.660> give<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.080> same<00:04:33.260> effect<00:04:33.410> so<00:04:34.419> your<00:04:35.419> choice<00:04:35.690> I

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
do give the same effect so your choice I

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.540 
do give the same effect so your choice I
would<00:04:36.230> choose<00:04:36.440> something<00:04:36.680> like<00:04:36.919> this<00:04:37.190> or

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
would choose something like this or

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.540 
would choose something like this or
maybe<00:04:38.240> double<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:39.470> amount<00:04:40.510> or<00:04:41.510> let's<00:04:42.260> see<00:04:42.550> put

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
maybe double the amount or let's see put

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.460 
maybe double the amount or let's see put
one<00:04:44.270> here<00:04:44.860> one<00:04:45.860> middle<00:04:46.130> one<00:04:46.430> winner<00:04:47.110> put<00:04:48.110> in

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
one here one middle one winner put in

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.150 
one here one middle one winner put in
five<00:04:49.130> more<00:04:49.430> probably<00:04:51.160> and<00:04:52.540> the<00:04:53.540> good<00:04:53.690> thing<00:04:53.840> is

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
five more probably and the good thing is

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.740 
five more probably and the good thing is
nothing<00:04:55.160> will<00:04:55.310> spawn<00:04:55.580> in<00:04:56.200> the<00:04:57.200> field<00:04:57.730> on

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
nothing will spawn in the field on

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.100 
nothing will spawn in the field on
blocks<00:04:59.750> like<00:04:59.990> that<00:05:01.450> so<00:05:02.450> if<00:05:02.660> you<00:05:02.780> have<00:05:02.930> any

blocks like that so if you have any
