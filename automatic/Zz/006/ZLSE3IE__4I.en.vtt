months now and maybe you'll love but I
really<00:00:29.580> really<00:00:29.910> saw<00:00:30.750> no<00:00:31.650> use<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.160> it

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
really really saw no use of it

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.049 
really really saw no use of it
it's<00:00:33.150> just<00:00:33.680> beeps<00:00:34.680> like<00:00:36.470> all<00:00:37.470> the<00:00:37.739> time<00:00:37.949> for<00:00:38.520> no

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
it's just beeps like all the time for no

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.220 
it's just beeps like all the time for no
reason<00:00:39.320> here<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.559> there<00:00:40.850> by<00:00:42.080> there<00:00:43.080> was<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
reason here and there by there was a

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.860 
reason here and there by there was a
police<00:00:43.710> just<00:00:44.610> passed<00:00:44.970> from<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.420> other<00:00:45.540> lane

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
police just passed from the other lane

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.569 
police just passed from the other lane
and<00:00:46.380> then<00:00:47.690> didn't<00:00:48.690> give<00:00:49.470> me<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> signal<00:00:50.040> I

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and then didn't give me the signal I

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.770 
and then didn't give me the signal I
mean<00:00:50.760> maybe<00:00:51.210> it's<00:00:51.450> just<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.050> police<00:00:52.500> but

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
mean maybe it's just that police but

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.209 
mean maybe it's just that police but
three<00:00:54.780> months<00:00:55.140> I'm<00:00:55.290> talking<00:00:55.649> about<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.100> know

around five hundred dollars it's a lot

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.550 
around five hundred dollars it's a lot
