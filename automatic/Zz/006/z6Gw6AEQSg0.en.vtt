00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.670 
these ruched well it's kind of ruched
but<00:03:13.389> I<00:03:13.540> gathered<00:03:14.079> where<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.290> can<00:03:14.439> tie<00:03:14.620> it

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.589 
but I gathered where you can tie it
tighter<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.189> make<00:03:15.370> it<00:03:15.489> looser<00:03:15.639> so<00:03:16.299> it<00:03:16.419> goes<00:03:16.569> a

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
tighter and make it looser so it goes a

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.110 
tighter and make it looser so it goes a
little<00:03:16.870> bit<00:03:17.049> longer<00:03:17.319> if<00:03:17.620> you<00:03:17.650> want<00:03:17.949> but<00:03:18.879> just<00:03:18.910> a

black<00:04:50.170> and<00:04:50.380> gray<00:04:50.530> in<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.710> winter<00:04:50.980> so<00:04:51.160> it's

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
black and gray in the winter so it's

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.430 
black and gray in the winter so it's
trying<00:04:51.610> to<00:04:51.820> add<00:04:51.940> a<00:04:51.970> little<00:04:52.090> color<00:04:52.480> so<00:04:52.780> I<00:04:53.050> think
