00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.630
 if not sad sony decided to refuse 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:06.610
 from release to a mundane transparent mirror 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.379
 but finally, the Japanese company is still 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.240
 released her vision mirror 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:11.320
 entry level camera to 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.539
 as they say keep up with 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.840
 competitors last of the tribe slt 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:18.920
 sony 1 58 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.920
 [music] 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.960
 [music] 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.520
 [music] 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.760
 258 replaced at once two budget 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.989
 cameras alpa 37 and 57 respectively to me 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.399
 all the family traits are preserved 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.230
 sony budget cameras 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.239
 The camera body is made of 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.699
 plastic and in size it is practically 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.199
 Same as Alpha 57 predecessor 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.960
 from it also got controls 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.030
 with flash but hot shoe replaced 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.860
 on standard aisa 518 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.960
 But the design of the display got from 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.800
 arts 37 and it becomes big 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.570
 disadvantage 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.330
 indeed , unlike the main competitors in 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.429
 the face of nikon d5200 and canon 700d 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.369
 Sonya's display only moves in one 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:17.890
 plane but if only the display 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.869
 bayonet made of plastic caps 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.950
 and a special memory card cover 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.110
 trust does not inspire 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.220
 electronic viewfinder is not enough 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.899
 update frequency 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.399
 what makes uncomfortable shooting when 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.660
 low light 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.850
 despite many shortcomings 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.009
 use the camera is very convenient 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.289
 This concerns both the convenience of grip and 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.899
 arrangement of heart controls 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.300
 sony alpha 58 is brand new 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.600
 matrix under the loud name exmor and 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.280
 dogs letter with a resolution of 20 megapixels 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.250
 that works with stuffing from 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.780
 predecessor on the 57 and this is not the 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.740
 best impact on quality 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.020
 Images 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.509
 if I lie, you can safely shoot yes and iso 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.310
 1600 then when shooting in jpeg camera 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.860
 behaving in unpredictable ways 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.799
 in some shooting situations the noise and 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.780
 climb already at and iso 400 aggressive 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.799
 operation of the noise reduction system can 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.840
 be seen at minimum 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.579
 sensitivity and if still use 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.410
 whale lens on detail 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.810
 there will be no photos at all 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.459
 autofocus without hitting its speed as 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.500
 and does not affect the speed of the camera 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.239
 whole burst shoot look frame in 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.489
 a second is leveled quite a bit 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.160
 photo buffer capacity is recorded 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.709
 well, very slowly, is it really so 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.790
 bad no not quite like everything 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.220
 sony cameras 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.250
 158 has its own interesting features 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.440
 like digital auto zoom 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.989
 shooting panoramas shooting hdr 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.760
 Bracketing by various parameters large 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.560
 number of creative and artistic 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.660
 filters with tracking focus 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.160
 phase sensors are used add 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.570
 here is the entrance for the external 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.270
 microphone image stabilization 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.280
 manual control 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.200
 and you get one of the best cameras for 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.720
 video recording but only one of the best 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.850
 because competitors are not asleep and are selected 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.380
 getting closer in fact the camera is not 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.330
 as bad as we told them 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.460
 and she has the right to life 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.920
 if you have a laptop vaio xperia smartphone 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.370
 then the camera should be only one sony 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.370
 alpha 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.520
