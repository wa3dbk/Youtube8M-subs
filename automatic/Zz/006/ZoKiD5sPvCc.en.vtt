characters represented in video games
games<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.199> think<00:00:31.380> there<00:00:31.560> are<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.710> lot<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.890> them

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
there are incredibly the representation

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.369 
there are incredibly the representation
isn't<00:00:37.730> all<00:00:38.090> that<00:00:38.120> great<00:00:38.590> circle

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
isn't all that great circle

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.250 
isn't all that great circle
we<00:00:41.680> get<00:00:41.829> lots<00:00:42.010> of<00:00:42.100> left<00:00:42.280> leg<00:00:42.519> way

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
we get lots of left leg way

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.410 
we get lots of left leg way
gays<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:44.920> heart<00:00:45.130> it's<00:00:45.430> actually<00:00:45.850> our<00:00:46.120> queers

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
gays the heart it's actually our queers

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.710 
gays the heart it's actually our queers
are<00:00:46.660> exactly

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.780 

I<00:00:49.750> just<00:00:50.080> don't<00:00:50.290> think<00:00:50.590> that<00:00:50.740> the<00:00:51.460> sexual

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
I just don't think that the sexual

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.460 
I just don't think that the sexual
orientation<00:00:51.910> of<00:00:52.330> characters<00:00:52.780> ever<00:00:52.960> comes<00:00:53.290> up

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
orientation of characters ever comes up

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.810 
orientation of characters ever comes up
because

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.740 

there's<00:00:56.820> not<00:00:56.880> a<00:00:56.940> lot<00:00:57.060> of<00:00:57.120> games<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.570> have

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
there's not a lot of games that have

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.700 
there's not a lot of games that have
your<00:00:58.230> manual<00:00:59.010> romance<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.970> as<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:01.380> centerpiece

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
your manual romance it as a centerpiece

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.729 
your manual romance it as a centerpiece
so<00:01:02.130> I<00:01:02.160> feel<00:01:02.490> like<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.180> mean<00:01:03.690> for<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.960> role

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
so I feel like it's I mean for the role

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.010 
so I feel like it's I mean for the role
there<00:01:05.339> could<00:01:06.060> be<00:01:06.150> days<00:01:06.329> maybe<00:01:06.659> there<00:01:06.899> would

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
there could be days maybe there would

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.389 
there could be days maybe there would
just<00:01:07.170> be<00:01:07.259> too<00:01:07.380> much<00:01:07.409> backlash<00:01:07.890> from<00:01:08.189> it

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
just be too much backlash from it

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:09.859 
just be too much backlash from it
because<00:01:08.610> some<00:01:09.149> people<00:01:09.450> aren't<00:01:09.659> accepting

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
because some people aren't accepting

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.389 
because some people aren't accepting
like<00:01:10.259> there<00:01:10.439> was<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> huge<00:01:10.829> backlash<00:01:11.009> for

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
like there was a huge backlash for

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.280 
like there was a huge backlash for
Dragon<00:01:11.729> Age<00:01:11.850> where<00:01:12.119> if<00:01:12.509> you<00:01:12.720> make<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.110> choice

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
Dragon Age where if you make the choice

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.770 
Dragon Age where if you make the choice
then<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.270> wasn't<00:01:15.509> just

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
then you can have it but it wasn't just

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.870 
then you can have it but it wasn't just
like<00:01:15.899> stone<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.890> maybe<00:01:17.369> that's<00:01:17.580> why<00:01:17.700> they're

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
like stone so maybe that's why they're

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.789 
like stone so maybe that's why they're
afraid<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.149> do<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.689> mean<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.049> think<00:01:19.320> generally

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
afraid to do it I mean I think generally

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.950 
afraid to do it I mean I think generally
there<00:01:20.460> has<00:01:20.579> been<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.939> lot<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.210> representation

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
there has been a lot of representation

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.179 
there has been a lot of representation
there<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.200> hasn't<00:01:22.320> been<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.619> lot<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.860> queer

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
there just hasn't been a lot of queer

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.609 
there just hasn't been a lot of queer
characters<00:01:23.640> from<00:01:23.759> way<00:01:23.970> or<00:01:24.030> another<00:01:24.530> there<00:01:25.530> are

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
characters from way or another there are

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.810 
characters from way or another there are
certain<00:01:25.860> developers<00:01:26.189> who<00:01:26.280> are<00:01:26.340> starting<00:01:26.610> to

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
certain developers who are starting to

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.600 
certain developers who are starting to
do<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.320> love<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.439> see<00:01:28.590> more<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.130> imagine

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
do it love to see more of it I imagine

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.730 
do it love to see more of it I imagine
that<00:01:30.030> there's<00:01:30.270> just<00:01:30.810> traditional<00:01:31.350> kind<00:01:31.679> of

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
that there's just traditional kind of

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.050 
that there's just traditional kind of
game<00:01:32.520> sex<00:01:32.939> appeal<00:01:33.090> thing<00:01:33.539> going<00:01:33.840> on

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.100 

relatives<00:01:41.330> like

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.030 

representation<00:01:45.110> going<00:01:45.350> on

this<00:01:46.370> problem<00:01:46.610> is

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
this problem is

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.380 
this problem is
so<00:01:48.350> we<00:01:48.530> are<00:01:48.650> going<00:01:49.010> on

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.820 

yeah<00:01:51.540> no<00:01:51.690> that<00:01:51.870> makes<00:01:51.900> sense<00:01:52.530> why<00:01:52.680> do<00:01:52.740> you

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
yeah no that makes sense why do you

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.200

with
I<00:02:58.780> got<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.900> core<00:03:00.140> of<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.409> story<00:03:00.680> of<00:03:00.860> that<00:03:00.980> game
