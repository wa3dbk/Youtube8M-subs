00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.109 

make<00:01:51.840> sure<00:01:51.990> we<00:01:52.140> got<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.409> dialed<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.890> right<00:01:53.119> get

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
make sure we got it dialed in right get

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.709 
make sure we got it dialed in right get
the<00:01:54.270> pressure<00:01:54.689> right<00:01:54.899> on<00:01:55.020> this

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
the pressure right on this

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:01.730 
the pressure right on this
and<00:01:57.719> we<00:01:57.930> will<00:01:58.610> shoot<00:01:59.610> the<00:02:00.119> second<00:02:00.570> cook<00:02:00.780> clear

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
and we will shoot the second cook clear

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.600 
and we will shoot the second cook clear
on<00:02:01.860> it

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
on it

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.240 
on it
and<00:02:03.610> that<00:02:04.600> will<00:02:04.780> be<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:05.049> drop<00:02:05.320> coat<00:02:05.650> that<00:02:06.159> we

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
and that will be the drop coat that we

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.449 
and that will be the drop coat that we
put<00:02:06.460> on<00:02:06.580> it<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:07.900> of<00:02:08.709> course<00:02:08.920> it'll<00:02:09.100> have<00:02:09.280> some

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
put on it and of course it'll have some

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.850 
put on it and of course it'll have some
imperfections<00:02:10.119> in<00:02:10.240> it<00:02:10.590> expect<00:02:11.590> nothing<00:02:11.709> less

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
imperfections in it expect nothing less

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.720 
imperfections in it expect nothing less
but<00:02:12.930> we<00:02:13.930> do<00:02:14.080> then

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
but we do then

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.550 
but we do then
it's<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.790> wet<00:02:16.000> sanded<00:02:16.420> again<00:02:16.750> this<00:02:17.170> time<00:02:17.410> with<00:02:17.530> a

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
it's a wet sanded again this time with a

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.750 
it's a wet sanded again this time with a
mm<00:02:19.050> we<00:02:20.050> will<00:02:20.200> actually<00:02:20.290> buff<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:21.100> out<00:02:21.370> with<00:02:23.760> a

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
mm we will actually buff it out with a

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:35.310 
mm we will actually buff it out with a
rubbing<00:02:25.300> compound<00:02:27.360> then<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.709> medium<00:02:31.290> cut<00:02:34.320> and

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
rubbing compound then a medium cut and

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.360 
rubbing compound then a medium cut and
then<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.890> Polish<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:37.650> then<00:02:38.650> for<00:02:39.550> a<00:02:39.580> total<00:02:40.330> 10<00:02:41.370> we

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
then a Polish and then for a total 10 we

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.699 
then a Polish and then for a total 10 we
actually<00:02:42.820> put<00:02:42.910> a<00:02:42.940> swirl<00:02:43.269> remover<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:44.350> top<00:02:44.560> of

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
actually put a swirl remover on top of

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.390 
actually put a swirl remover on top of
that<00:02:44.830> so<00:02:45.190> we<00:02:45.370> are<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:46.560> long<00:02:47.560> way<00:02:47.890> from<00:02:47.920> being
