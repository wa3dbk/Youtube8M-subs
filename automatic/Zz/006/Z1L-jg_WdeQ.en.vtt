wager<00:05:16.949> and<00:05:17.190> that<00:05:17.279> is<00:05:17.400> workable<00:05:17.849> I<00:05:18.180> was

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
wager and that is workable I was

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:19.760 
wager and that is workable I was
actually<00:05:18.569> looking<00:05:18.810> at<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.110> reg<00:05:19.289> or<00:05:19.500> players

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
actually looking at the reg or players

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.409 
actually looking at the reg or players
for<00:05:20.279> defenders<00:05:20.729> and<00:05:20.879> there<00:05:21.000> was<00:05:21.090> none<00:05:21.240> which

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
for defenders and there was none which

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.839 
for defenders and there was none which
actually<00:05:21.599> took<00:05:21.870> my<00:05:22.020> eye<00:05:22.050> and<00:05:22.440> obviously<00:05:23.219> this

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
actually took my eye and obviously this

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:25.399 
actually took my eye and obviously this
team<00:05:24.120> is<00:05:24.300> built<00:05:24.479> for<00:05:24.599> counter-attack<00:05:24.960> and

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
team is built for counter-attack and

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:28.010 
team is built for counter-attack and
peers<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:25.969> Kabul<00:05:26.969> was<00:05:27.150> the<00:05:27.240> only<00:05:27.360> one<00:05:27.569> who<00:05:27.689> fit

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
peers and Kabul was the only one who fit

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.230 
peers and Kabul was the only one who fit
that<00:05:28.050> criteria<00:05:28.439> which<00:05:29.099> I<00:05:29.219> was<00:05:29.340> looking<00:05:29.580> for<00:05:29.759> it

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
that criteria which I was looking for it

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.409 
that criteria which I was looking for it
falls<00:05:30.569> and<00:05:30.810> coins<00:05:31.580> 276,000<00:05:32.580> coins<00:05:32.819> in<00:05:33.029> profit

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
falls and coins 276,000 coins in profit

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.950 
falls and coins 276,000 coins in profit
so<00:05:33.750> we<00:05:33.840> could<00:05:34.020> rock<00:05:34.229> it<00:05:34.259> up<00:05:34.440> to<00:05:34.590> over<00:05:35.960> 280,000

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
so we could rock it up to over 280,000

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.019 
so we could rock it up to over 280,000
Cline's<00:05:37.169> if<00:05:37.409> we<00:05:37.740> do<00:05:37.919> win<00:05:38.129> the<00:05:38.250> next<00:05:38.370> game<00:05:38.490> the
