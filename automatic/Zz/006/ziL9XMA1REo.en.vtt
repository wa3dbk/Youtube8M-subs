 Hello everyone today, I 'll show you how 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:10.950
 fix this problem at startup no 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.900
 glorified the world what this shows 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.139
 moment north and availability thanks for 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.520
 patience with this problem I ran into 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.260
 recently at first thought that yes so 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.090
 there must really be some 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:32.850
 technical work go waited a day or two 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:37.469
 and learned that in the meantime while I was waiting for my 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.649
 friends played it calmly I of course 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.219
 immediately started googling on the internet like 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:48.469
 fix this back and forth but unfortunately 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.449
 I was there nifiga sensible found 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:55.020
 technical support sand wrote 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.829
 games, too, they really mean nothing to me 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.899
 have said 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:06.299
 and this way I found a shorter clean 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:09.360
 accidentally this way of post 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.439
 go go we can not go in the panel 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.280
 taste 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.340
 control panel to the Internet 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.970
 browser properties connection setting 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.229
 networks and remove these two checkboxes here 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.320
 they are two damn ticks for which 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.950
 how could they not play this one 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:36.329
 remove under the hatch and here we remove this under and 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.590
 here it is that dragged good so we set 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.450
 on hockey 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:47.200
 kay u kate and go 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:52.490
 these we went glory to the eggs and went here she 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:55.840
 I will not go but play together already 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.119
 we can all love 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.460
 there may still be one nuance what these 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.340
 ticks can shine back get on 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.789
 your seats and now again you can't 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.739

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:15.530
 just can't click to enter 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:20.299

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:23.420

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:28.190
 shining ticks see you again also 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:37.190
 take off and put on automatically ok 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:41.650
 and come here at 5 gone 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.650
 now checked the networks and they again 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.930
