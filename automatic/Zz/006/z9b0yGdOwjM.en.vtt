 produces manual optics 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.240
 advantage speak with alexey with 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.090
 representatives of the companies behind the wheel 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.280

 yong this year brought to the photo forum 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.830
 this year introduced two new own 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.570
 The lens is 10 millimeters undermining 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:11.490
 matrix format under the fireplace under the name 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.940
 under the standard sizes with aperture 2 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.190

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.390
 on 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.820
 leave photo forum 2014 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.240
 come from the sale literally in May 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.270
 month that is everyone expects all such 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.990
 what price to expect to die 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.350
 estimated price will be 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.570
 to spend 18 thousand rubles he is also 40 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.330
 it is straightforward to me just designed for 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.170
 but it doesnâ€™t bother for 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.090
 g-spot shooting 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.920
 yes unfortunately not this year not worth it 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.430
 on a removable hood for example two 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.810
 Months probably since you until now 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.630
 under the video and also they will finish here 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.770
 a new lens will also appear 12 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.770
 millimeters agree 2 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.380
 mirror that is, under micro 4 3 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.720
 the gx3 square signaling option disappears 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.880
 he will also be under the circle around the matrix 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.650
 under not full format but only for 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.000
 mirrorless 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.850
 know the catalog and know the approach of the company 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.100
 I myself ate it as I understand it there is very sharpness 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.770
 good will be pictures 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:26.080
 the feast is also a cut off and building lenses 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:28.120
 with him are considered ultra matte Comte its 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.070
 enlightenment so how would so much 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.000
 it seems to me the same sharp all such 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:41.230
 same technology and of course 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:45.050
 quality and the second option is 16 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.960
 22 I understand that this is an option for 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:52.340
 video finished rank broff test also 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:57.910

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.020
 spherical garden lenses to ride such 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.900
 same sharp clear and due to the fact that they 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.940
 want ford focus also shooting 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:21.140
 accompanies noiselessness ie no 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:24.410
