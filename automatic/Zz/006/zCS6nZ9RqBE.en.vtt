Coco<00:01:30.420> Chanel<00:01:30.840> was<00:01:31.020> coming<00:01:31.380> from<00:01:32.479> if<00:01:33.479> you

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
Coco Chanel was coming from if you

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.289 
Coco Chanel was coming from if you
notice<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.229> our<00:01:34.700> monogram<00:01:35.700> Alma<00:01:36.150> you'll

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
notice on our monogram Alma you'll

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.749 
notice on our monogram Alma you'll
notice<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.960> base<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> handbag<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.430> a

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
notice that the base of the handbag is a

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.140 
notice that the base of the handbag is a
lot<00:01:39.119> lighter<00:01:39.420> than<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.380> handles<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
lot lighter than the handles and the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.600 
lot lighter than the handles and the
reason<00:01:42.540> for<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.079> we<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.009> actually

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
reason for this is that we have actually

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.719 
reason for this is that we have actually
had<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.540> bottom<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.380> Alma<00:01:46.799> replaced<00:01:47.399> by

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
had the bottom of the Alma replaced by

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.069 
had the bottom of the Alma replaced by
louis<00:01:48.119> vuitton<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:49.799> Alma<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.369> we<00:01:50.549> had<00:01:51.049> had<00:01:52.049> a

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
louis vuitton the Alma that we had had a

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.010 
louis vuitton the Alma that we had had a
few<00:01:52.579> nasty<00:01:53.720> marks<00:01:54.720> underneath<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:57.719> sent

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
few nasty marks underneath it so we sent

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.580 
few nasty marks underneath it so we sent
the<00:01:58.170> bag<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.619> Louis<00:01:58.860> Vuitton<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.729> get<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.060> base

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
the bag to Louis Vuitton to get the base

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.840 
the bag to Louis Vuitton to get the base
replaced<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:03.439> with<00:02:04.439> fit<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.920> bit<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.130> time<00:02:05.399> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
replaced and with fit a bit of time the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.479 
replaced and with fit a bit of time the
base<00:02:06.060> will<00:02:06.390> turn<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> honeycomb<00:02:07.530> color<00:02:07.890> like

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
base will turn a honeycomb color like

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.150 
base will turn a honeycomb color like
the<00:02:08.700> handles<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:10.050> that's<00:02:10.259> why<00:02:10.500> there's<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.009> bit

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
the handles so that's why there's a bit

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.210 
the handles so that's why there's a bit
of<00:02:11.250> difference<00:02:11.640> there

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
of difference there

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.720 
of difference there
you<00:02:12.850> can<00:02:13.120> prematurely<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.740> can<00:02:15.070> speed<00:02:15.700> up

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
you can prematurely so you can speed up

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.570 
you can prematurely so you can speed up
the<00:02:15.880> aging<00:02:16.360> process<00:02:16.540> but<00:02:17.470> I've<00:02:17.980> decided<00:02:18.430> to

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
the aging process but I've decided to

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.540 
the aging process but I've decided to
just<00:02:18.820> leave<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.390> let<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.050> gain<00:02:20.950> its<00:02:21.220> color

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
just leave it and let it gain its color

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.410 
just leave it and let it gain its color
naturally<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:22.710> I<00:02:23.710> think<00:02:24.640> it's<00:02:24.820> always<00:02:25.120> nice

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
naturally and I think it's always nice

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.380 
naturally and I think it's always nice
to<00:02:25.780> get<00:02:26.590> items<00:02:26.860> repaired<00:02:27.580> by<00:02:27.760> Louis<00:02:28.060> Vuitton

to get items repaired by Louis Vuitton

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.720
