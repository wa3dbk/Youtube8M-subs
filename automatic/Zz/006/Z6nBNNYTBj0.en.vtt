00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.240
 welcome my name is soma la 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:11.220
 dotcom hiphop production I hope that 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.810
 is working well the week ago a 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.280
 time publish a video about 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.680
 equalization of some bass drums 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.810
 fundamental frequencies to start 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.730
 update them and continue with that line 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.770
 of drums equalization today we are going to 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.140
 talk about the boxes and I want to share 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.210
 with you 5 fundamental frequencies for 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.770
 equalize boxes like almost everything 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.990
 it has to do with equalization or with 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.730
 compression in this case are guides 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.770
 It depends a lot on the original material 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.239
 with which you are working and more 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.920
 electronic production you can 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.000
 find with boxes that have nothing 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.040
 what to see with each other 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.390
 in this case we start from a box of 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.460
 macma drum pack 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.899
 I think it belongs to the kit neighborhood and it's 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.899
 a pretty balanced box 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.609
 we have low frequency frequencies 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.140
 sharp stockings a little clap but the 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.940
 that we are going to comment can be very 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.850
 good starting points again and 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.890
 They are also common areas in 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.960
 box sounds before you start with 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.600
 specific frequencies I want to tell you 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.310
 something about the filter high pass filter and 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.330
 look more than comment we'll see what 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.369
 I activate a filter around 70 and I want 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.380
 that you see on the screen in the graph what 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.229
 what happens if I put the graph so that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.380
 show me the equalization before the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.300
 filter you can see that from 70 to 80 towards 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.720
 below we have serious frequencies and their 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.720
 serious 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.990
 and it is very important to eliminate them because 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.659
 On the one hand they do not add anything to the sound of 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.659
 but most of all they are occupying 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.250
 dynamic range energy for the range of 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.439
 frequencies that are going to use the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.990
 hype and bass and we have to understand 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.179
 all the sounds of the drum kit as a 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.579
 only set and it's not just about 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.709
 Equalize each sound separately 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.420
 the rest of sounds to each other in fact if 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:59.569
 you look at the graph before and after 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.270
 in the before we have the frequencies 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:05.000
 serious and sub serious with the filter 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.319
 applied that is left perfect clean and 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.229
 the sound does not change 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.970
 ok then let's go to the range of 150 hertz 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.980
 This is very interesting range 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.040
 frequencies if you have boxes to which 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.900
 they lack weight if they sound thin and 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.510
 you want them to have an extra weight in 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.099
 around 150 is a good point in this 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.410
 case this box is pretty good from 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.410
 serious but let's check what happens 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.700
 more than interesting if we wanted 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.180
 add an extra weight more than interesting 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.180
 this range 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.770
 if our box will sound too dark 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.980
 a good range of frequencies is between 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.920
 300 and 600 hertz in fact is the same 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.830
 range that I mentioned in the hype because in 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.220
 general in the drums in the batteries of 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.620
 300 to 600 is very good to reduce if 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.600
 we want to clarify the sound a little 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.700
 that is not so dark in the case of this 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.380
 box is not like this is not a box that sounds 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.380
 dark but let's see the difference 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.950
 I'm in 360 and you can see that it clarifies a 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.000
 little the sound although in this case already 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.360
 I say it's not a box that 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.490
 we will need to go to the area of ​​500 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.070
 Hertz comes to us very interesting if 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.570
 we want to add body to the box and 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.410
 get affine out a type of sound 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.410
 rounder 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.690
 You can see how he adds a little more 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.150
 body in that frequency range of 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.610
 there we are going to go to the zone between 3 and 5 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.220
 very interesting to add clarity and 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.440
 stuck to the box sounds is an area 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.900
 to which we are very sensitive way that 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.099
 even with little a couple of times already 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.099
 let's notice the difference 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.960
 notice 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.690
 it's not something that needs this box 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.670
 neither is it a very balanced box 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.160
 but if you had a kind of sound the 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.530
 what you need is clarity a little more than 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.420
 stuck between 3 and 6 you will find 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.280
 some very interesting frequencies 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.020
 for it and finally we go to the 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.990
 upper area of the spectrum above 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.240
 10,000 is an area to add air yes 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.860
 that it is true that even in this area 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.230
 we can meet with two 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.230
 situations or we directly add a 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.330
 lowpass filter 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.120
 depends on the type of sound we are 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.370
 looking for us to eliminate that 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.440
 sharper part of the box for a type 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.600
 of very specific hip-hop sound and more 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.610
 dark is very interesting but it depends 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.520
 of how we might want to add something 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.850
 more air that space around the 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.850
 box 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:21.399
 Look, I did not say it at the beginning but 

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:23.860
 it is important to listen to these tutorials 

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:25.629
 with headphones or good monitors 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.939
 if you listen to it with the output of a 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:30.639
 portable surely you're going to miss 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:32.259
 some of the frequencies so this 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.299
 as the five main frequencies 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:37.449
 that you can use as points of 

00:05:34.299 --> 00:05:40.299
 heading to find or more weight a little 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.879
 more than a little more body clarity a 

00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:45.459
 little more than glued a little more air 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:47.049
 they are good starting points depending 

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:49.059
 of what you are looking for in each case 

00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:51.099
 so I hope you like me to help you 

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:53.079
 to better equalize your box sounds 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:54.519
 here to the future, share it on the networks 

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:56.319
 is something the issue of the equalization of 

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:58.389
 drums very very interesting very 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:00.369
 determinant and you're going to help others if 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.769
 you share any doubt leave it in 

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:04.569
 comments tell me what you think of it as 

00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:07.439
 you usually do it and see you in the 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.439
 next peace
