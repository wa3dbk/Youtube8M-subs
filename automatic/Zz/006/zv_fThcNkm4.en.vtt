00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.630
 respect you have to wait a while to heal 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.710

 I should know that instructive should be 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.720
 delivered when the person buys and 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.079
 when jp his building was changed and 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.079
 I would say nothing 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.850
 currently they finish a preserv to heaven 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.510
 beginning 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.510
 service 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:16.910
 and it is exactly what happens with the 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.620
 most vulnerable people I have an uncle 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.320

 two checks without a fund 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.730
 a consumer credit that does not think 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:33.520
 pay because the world ends this 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.520
 Saturday plans to rape his sister-in-law 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.259
 they are situations that make good 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.659
 wrong behaviors 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:45.759
 when the world is going to end the same 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:49.960
 no moral to me does not seem to 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.890
 no way is it for me part of the 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.020
 past 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.880
 Today I am entertained and today I have a good time today 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.460
 I'm living the best moments of 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.950

 have fun 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.149
 it's like he's ahead of me from behind 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.380
 the future 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:24.680
 is part of the past and part of the 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:27.040
 history I wanted to ask the 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.040
 girl 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:42.340
 the reason is that he is not a Christian because 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.340
 result 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:55.980
 and it would be in the body has limited 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:59.030
 she has five minutes a book 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.030
 instead he threw 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.890
 thiago la mancha 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.980
 my gray 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.750
 I prefer, I do not know, I got miccoli 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.750
 shines good I the truth of things 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.310
 the character 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.510
 20 with my friends so just misfortune not 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.830
 there were guarantees for the greens 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.830
 and today it contains 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.180
 he does not tell you then they are more coquettish 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.500
 but what does come 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:12.610
 to a very professional guy 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.560
 who does not care 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.550
 this is a character called mine 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.919
 with that of channeling with the character 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:46.319
 of the hummingbird 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:46.319
 and we will also continue 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:03.720
 even in a very successful teleserie there 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.720
 with him I think his relationship was serious 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.640
 equal the then then to the 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.950
 impression that is betting on the 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.660
 Devil because he really wants 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.810
 to be with him in addition to one of these 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.810
 things 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:43.260

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.830
 and I do not 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:11.010
