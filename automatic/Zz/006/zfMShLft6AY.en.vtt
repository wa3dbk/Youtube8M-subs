00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
because I don't have a wide span with my

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.529 
because I don't have a wide span with my
hand<00:01:17.899> so<00:01:18.079> I<00:01:18.109> have<00:01:18.350> to<00:01:18.500> roll<00:01:18.679> the<00:01:18.829> cords<00:01:19.329> if<00:01:20.329> you

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
some extra chords in there that might

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.220 
some extra chords in there that might
help<00:01:25.069> to<00:01:25.759> make<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.060> sound<00:01:26.359> of<00:01:26.569> it<00:01:26.689> better

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230
