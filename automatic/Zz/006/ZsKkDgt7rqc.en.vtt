00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
or is it really some clever marketing

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.900 
or is it really some clever marketing
for<00:00:52.660> instance<00:00:52.989> hear<00:00:53.170> me<00:00:53.289> out<00:00:53.320> let's<00:00:54.190> say<00:00:54.460> the

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
for instance hear me out let's say the

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.610 
for instance hear me out let's say the
worst<00:00:55.149> thing<00:00:55.449> in<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.629> world<00:00:55.660> for<00:00:55.870> investors

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
worst thing in the world for investors

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.670 
worst thing in the world for investors
and<00:00:56.829> public<00:00:57.640> opinion<00:00:58.059> would<00:00:58.600> be<00:00:58.660> a<00:00:58.960> total

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
and public opinion would be a total

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.830 
and public opinion would be a total
collapse<00:00:59.829> of<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.309> launch<00:01:01.000> that<00:01:01.570> would<00:01:01.750> be

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
collapse of the launch that would be

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
collapse of the launch that would be
disastrous<00:01:02.340> but<00:01:03.340> hear<00:01:03.850> me<00:01:03.879> out<00:01:03.969> if<00:01:04.330> you<00:01:05.229> have<00:01:05.530> a

disastrous but hear me out if you have a

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.219 
disastrous but hear me out if you have a
server<00:01:06.400> overload<00:01:07.000> for<00:01:07.330> a<00:01:07.390> short<00:01:07.780> period<00:01:07.840> of

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
server overload for a short period of

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.719 
server overload for a short period of
time<00:01:08.490> right<00:01:09.490> when<00:01:09.729> it<00:01:09.850> starts<00:01:09.880> at<00:01:10.479> some

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
time right when it starts at some

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.390 
time right when it starts at some
ungodly<00:01:12.729> hour<00:01:13.390> like<00:01:13.810> at<00:01:14.080> midnight<00:01:14.560> at<00:01:15.340> a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
ungodly hour like at midnight at a

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.270 
ungodly hour like at midnight at a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
launch and you have a hiccup you can go

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.580 
launch and you have a hiccup you can go
to<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.520> ER<00:01:18.549> investors<00:01:19.150> and<00:01:19.360> say<00:01:19.570> we<00:01:20.080> prepared

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
to the ER investors and say we prepared

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.740

for<00:01:20.680> this<00:01:20.920> we<00:01:21.400> really<00:01:21.790> built<00:01:22.030> all<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.390> service

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
for this we really built all the service

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.929 
for this we really built all the service
to<00:01:22.869> handle<00:01:23.140> capacity<00:01:23.619> but<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.159> demand<00:01:24.340> was<00:01:24.880> so

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
to handle capacity but the demand was so

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.350 
to handle capacity but the demand was so
much<00:01:25.810> that<00:01:26.409> it<00:01:26.680> just<00:01:27.070> took<00:01:27.549> down<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:27.939> servers

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
much that it just took down the servers
