more<00:01:37.219> extreme<00:01:37.579> angle<00:01:37.909> now<00:01:37.999> so<00:01:38.479> if<00:01:38.539> I<00:01:38.600> were<00:01:38.719> to

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
more extreme angle now so if I were to

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.849 
more extreme angle now so if I were to
play<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.079> ball<00:01:39.229> into<00:01:39.380> it<00:01:39.499> it's<00:01:39.710> going<00:01:39.799> to

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:39.859 
play the ball into it it's going to

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:41.529 
play the ball into it it's going to
bounce<00:01:40.039> up<00:01:40.219> a<00:01:40.340> little<00:01:40.490> bit<00:01:40.670> higher<00:01:40.819> but<00:01:41.390> if<00:01:41.479> I

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
bounce up a little bit higher but if I

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.300 
bounce up a little bit higher but if I
wanted<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:41.899> just<00:01:42.200> angle<00:01:42.499> a<00:01:42.560> little<00:01:42.590> bit<00:01:42.770> less<00:01:43.039> I

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
wanted to just angle a little bit less I

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.129 
wanted to just angle a little bit less I
can<00:01:43.700> make<00:01:43.939> it<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.090> little<00:01:44.240> more<00:01:44.719> towards<00:01:45.020> my

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:45.139 
can make it a little more towards my

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:47.499 
can make it a little more towards my
chest<00:01:45.409> if<00:01:45.920> I<00:01:46.009> go<00:01:46.189> all<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.369> way<00:01:46.490> down<00:01:46.759> and<00:01:47.240> angle

chest if I go all the way down and angle

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.270 
chest if I go all the way down and angle
it<00:01:47.539> almost<00:01:47.869> negative<00:01:48.109> it's<00:01:48.799> going<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:48.979> go<00:01:49.069> back

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
it almost negative it's going to go back

little<00:02:47.329> bit<00:02:47.420> higher<00:02:47.599> a<00:02:47.900> little<00:02:48.110> bit<00:02:48.349> lower<00:02:48.560> or

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
little bit higher a little bit lower or

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.620 
little bit higher a little bit lower or
kind<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:49.400> at<00:02:49.519> your<00:02:49.640> midsection<00:02:50.000> in<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:50.390> chest

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
kind of at your midsection in the chest

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.509 
kind of at your midsection in the chest
area<00:02:50.840> as<00:02:51.709> you<00:02:51.860> can<00:02:51.980> see<00:02:52.099> I've<00:02:52.190> done<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.370> couple

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
area as you can see I've done a couple

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.069 
area as you can see I've done a couple
different<00:02:52.910> things<00:02:52.940> here's<00:02:53.599> a<00:02:53.690> little<00:02:53.900> bit<00:02:54.019> of

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
different things here's a little bit of

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.300 
different things here's a little bit of
a<00:02:54.140> first-person<00:02:54.560> view<00:02:54.739> so<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.069> can<00:02:55.130> get<00:02:55.280> a

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
a first-person view so you can get a

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.039 
a first-person view so you can get a
better<00:02:55.400> idea<00:02:55.519> of<00:02:55.790> how<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.030> actual<00:02:56.450> ball<00:02:56.780> does

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
better idea of how the actual ball does

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.599 
better idea of how the actual ball does
bounce<00:02:57.319> off<00:02:57.530> with<00:02:57.680> rebounder<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.280> come<00:02:58.489> back

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
bounce off with rebounder and come back

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.240 
bounce off with rebounder and come back
at<00:02:58.850> you<00:02:59.030> like<00:02:59.930> I<00:03:00.019> said<00:03:00.079> very<00:03:00.440> easy<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.920> use<00:03:01.100> and

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
at you like I said very easy to use and

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.410 
at you like I said very easy to use and
you<00:03:01.310> can<00:03:01.459> see<00:03:01.579> you<00:03:01.760> don't<00:03:01.850> have<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.030> put<00:03:02.209> very

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
you can see you don't have to put very

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.720 
you can see you don't have to put very
much<00:03:02.660> power<00:03:03.530> on<00:03:03.859> the<00:03:04.010> ball<00:03:04.190> into<00:03:04.489> the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
much power on the ball into the

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.550 
much power on the ball into the
rebounder<00:03:05.269> to<00:03:05.389> get<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.569> really<00:03:05.930> good<00:03:06.079> return

rebounder to get a really good return

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.800 
rebounder to get a really good return
and<00:03:06.859> you<00:03:07.819> can<00:03:07.940> just<00:03:08.120> adjust<00:03:08.389> that<00:03:08.450> angle

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
and you can just adjust that angle

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.920 
and you can just adjust that angle
accordingly<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.500> get<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.940> exact<00:03:11.329> ball<00:03:11.630> back

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
and you want to practice a little bit

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.340

more on your own this is really the best
way<00:03:24.530> to<00:03:24.560> improve<00:03:25.130> truly<00:03:26.060> improve<00:03:26.389> rather<00:03:26.600> than

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
way to improve truly improve rather than

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.900 
way to improve truly improve rather than
spending<00:03:27.230> more<00:03:27.440> money<00:03:27.500> on<00:03:27.739> shoes<00:03:28.250> or<00:03:28.489> balls<00:03:28.730> or

spending more money on shoes or balls or
anything<00:03:28.940> like<00:03:29.239> that

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
anything like that

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.539 
anything like that
here<00:03:30.079> is<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.290> kind<00:03:30.980> of<00:03:31.100> shot<00:03:31.280> where<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.459> camera

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
here is a kind of shot where the camera

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.550 
here is a kind of shot where the camera
is<00:03:31.850> behind<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.420> rebounder<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.019> again<00:03:33.290> like<00:03:33.470> I

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
is behind the rebounder and again like I

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.410 
is behind the rebounder and again like I
said<00:03:33.620> you<00:03:34.280> can<00:03:34.400> see<00:03:34.519> how<00:03:34.639> tight<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.090> actual

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
said you can see how tight the actual

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.809 
said you can see how tight the actual
tension<00:03:35.810> is<00:03:35.959> on<00:03:36.200> this<00:03:36.440> particular<00:03:37.310> rebounding

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
tension is on this particular rebounding

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.000 
tension is on this particular rebounding
surface<00:03:38.239> because<00:03:38.780> it's<00:03:38.900> barely<00:03:39.200> moving<00:03:39.709> from

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
surface because it's barely moving from

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.129 
surface because it's barely moving from
when<00:03:40.579> the<00:03:40.730> ball<00:03:40.880> does<00:03:41.090> make<00:03:41.299> contact<00:03:41.810> with<00:03:41.930> it

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
when the ball does make contact with it

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.410 
when the ball does make contact with it
you<00:03:42.500> can<00:03:42.620> also<00:03:42.739> see<00:03:42.980> how<00:03:43.099> even<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:43.519> is<00:03:43.639> by<00:03:44.359> no

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
you can also see how even it is by no

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.879 
you can also see how even it is by no
means<00:03:44.569> by<00:03:44.989> hitting<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.349> middle<00:03:45.590> of<00:03:45.739> this

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
means by hitting the middle of this

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.710 
means by hitting the middle of this
rebound<00:03:46.250> every<00:03:46.549> time<00:03:46.790> but<00:03:47.269> I'm<00:03:47.389> still<00:03:47.599> getting

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
rebound every time but I'm still getting

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.559 
rebound every time but I'm still getting
a<00:03:48.019> consistent<00:03:48.519> rebound<00:03:49.519> from<00:03:49.819> the<00:03:50.120> net<00:03:50.299> which

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
a consistent rebound from the net which

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.030 
a consistent rebound from the net which
is<00:03:50.750> really<00:03:51.079> really<00:03:51.290> impressive<00:03:51.620> and

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
is really really impressive and

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.920 
is really really impressive and
something<00:03:52.549> that<00:03:52.639> you<00:03:52.760> can't<00:03:53.060> find<00:03:53.150> very<00:03:53.690> often

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
something that you can't find very often

consistent<00:04:14.480> touching<00:04:14.810> to<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:14.930> rebounder<00:04:15.410> and

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
consistent touching to the rebounder and

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.720 
consistent touching to the rebounder and
you're<00:04:15.740> going<00:04:15.890> to<00:04:15.920> get<00:04:16.070> that<00:04:16.220> consistent

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
you're going to get that consistent

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.360 
you're going to get that consistent
touch<00:04:16.850> back<00:04:17.120> here<00:04:18.080> I<00:04:18.110> have<00:04:18.350> a<00:04:18.380> couple<00:04:18.650> of<00:04:18.769> nine

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
touch back here I have a couple of nine

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.009 
touch back here I have a couple of nine
by<00:04:19.549> nine<00:04:19.730> and<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.000> seven<00:04:20.269> by<00:04:20.390> seven<00:04:20.690> one<00:04:20.840> set

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
by nine and the seven by seven one set

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.390 
by nine and the seven by seven one set
up<00:04:21.170> it's<00:04:21.620> kind<00:04:21.769> of<00:04:21.799> going<00:04:21.950> back<00:04:22.160> and<00:04:22.190> forth

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
up it's kind of going back and forth

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.180 
up it's kind of going back and forth
doing<00:04:22.700> some<00:04:22.940> fun<00:04:23.150> stuff<00:04:23.860> trying<00:04:24.860> to<00:04:24.950> keep<00:04:25.070> the

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
doing some fun stuff trying to keep the

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.250 
doing some fun stuff trying to keep the
ball<00:04:25.340> in<00:04:25.370> there<00:04:25.670> as<00:04:25.880> long<00:04:26.060> as<00:04:26.210> possible<00:04:26.420> but

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
ball in there as long as possible but

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.900 
ball in there as long as possible but
again<00:04:27.380> changing<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.310> angles<00:04:28.640> you<00:04:28.700> can<00:04:28.820> see

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
again changing the angles you can see

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.700 
again changing the angles you can see
that<00:04:29.000> these<00:04:29.090> two<00:04:29.150> Reba's<00:04:29.750> are<00:04:29.870> rebounders<00:04:30.530> are

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
that these two Reba's are rebounders are

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.500 
that these two Reba's are rebounders are
at<00:04:30.830> different<00:04:31.010> angles<00:04:31.310> from<00:04:31.610> each<00:04:31.820> other<00:04:32.000> so

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
at different angles from each other so

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.400 
at different angles from each other so
I'm<00:04:32.570> getting<00:04:32.810> kind<00:04:33.020> of<00:04:33.050> a<00:04:33.140> little<00:04:33.290> bit

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
I'm getting kind of a little bit

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.230 
I'm getting kind of a little bit
different<00:04:33.710> return<00:04:34.010> between<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.580> two<00:04:34.730> which

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
different return between the two which

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.390 
different return between the two which
is<00:04:35.360> really<00:04:35.600> great<00:04:36.010> obviously<00:04:37.010> having

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
is really great obviously having

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.920 
is really great obviously having
multiple<00:04:37.760> rebounders<00:04:38.210> is<00:04:38.390> not<00:04:38.540> going<00:04:38.720> to<00:04:38.780> be

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
multiple rebounders is not going to be

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.370 
multiple rebounders is not going to be
an<00:04:39.860> ideal<00:04:40.220> situation<00:04:41.080> but<00:04:42.080> it's<00:04:42.260> not<00:04:42.350> a

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
an ideal situation but it's not a

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.320 
an ideal situation but it's not a
realistic<00:04:42.950> situation<00:04:43.130> have<00:04:43.640> but<00:04:44.180> I<00:04:44.210> thought

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
realistic situation have but I thought

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.460 
realistic situation have but I thought
it'd<00:04:44.450> be<00:04:44.540> cool<00:04:44.720> to<00:04:44.750> kind<00:04:44.990> of<00:04:45.020> show<00:04:45.140> you<00:04:45.200> guys

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
it'd be cool to kind of show you guys

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.410 
it'd be cool to kind of show you guys
just<00:04:45.770> how<00:04:46.190> good<00:04:46.520> they're<00:04:46.790> pretty<00:04:47.120> much<00:04:47.240> all

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
just how good they're pretty much all

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.330 
just how good they're pretty much all
the<00:04:47.660> tension<00:04:47.990> is<00:04:48.080> even<00:04:48.440> on<00:04:48.560> all<00:04:49.070> of<00:04:49.190> them

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
the tension is even on all of them

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.890 
the tension is even on all of them
regardless<00:04:49.700> of<00:04:49.880> the<00:04:49.940> size<00:04:50.210> there's<00:04:50.540> a<00:04:50.600> nine<00:04:50.750> by

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
regardless of the size there's a nine by

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.570 
regardless of the size there's a nine by
nine<00:04:51.080> seven<00:04:51.470> by<00:04:51.560> seven<00:04:51.830> five<00:04:51.950> by<00:04:52.100> five<00:04:52.310> like<00:04:52.550> I

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
nine seven by seven five by five like I

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.090 
nine seven by seven five by five like I
said<00:04:52.910> and<00:04:53.150> then<00:04:53.630> here's<00:04:53.870> kind<00:04:54.080> of<00:04:54.140> a<00:04:54.320> little

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
said and then here's kind of a little

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.590 
said and then here's kind of a little
bit<00:04:55.190> of<00:04:55.220> a<00:04:55.430> fun<00:04:55.640> reaction<00:04:55.850> drill<00:04:56.420> that<00:04:56.510> I

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
bit of a fun reaction drill that I

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.360 
bit of a fun reaction drill that I
decided<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:57.050> do<00:04:57.200> kind<00:04:57.440> of<00:04:57.470> invented<00:04:57.980> myself

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
decided to do kind of invented myself

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.820 
decided to do kind of invented myself
there<00:04:58.580> and<00:04:59.080> like<00:05:00.080> I<00:05:00.170> said<00:05:00.230> obviously<00:05:00.500> you

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
there and like I said obviously you

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.110 
there and like I said obviously you
would<00:05:00.920> need<00:05:01.040> to<00:05:01.250> do<00:05:01.490> this<00:05:01.640> it's<00:05:01.880> a<00:05:01.940> little

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
would need to do this it's a little

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.640 
would need to do this it's a little
pretty<00:05:02.300> difficult<00:05:02.480> to<00:05:02.720> do<00:05:02.840> it's<00:05:03.230> a<00:05:03.260> very<00:05:03.470> windy

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
pretty difficult to do it's a very windy

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.680 
pretty difficult to do it's a very windy
day<00:05:03.770> as<00:05:04.010> well<00:05:04.190> then<00:05:04.790> here<00:05:05.000> I<00:05:05.030> have<00:05:05.150> the

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
day as well then here I have the

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.430 
day as well then here I have the
rebounder<00:05:06.500> angled<00:05:06.890> negatively<00:05:07.520> so<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:09.260> ball

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
rebounder angled negatively so the ball

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.870 
rebounder angled negatively so the ball
is<00:05:09.530> going<00:05:09.680> to<00:05:09.770> come<00:05:09.920> back<00:05:10.130> me<00:05:10.310> at<00:05:10.490> the<00:05:10.640> ground

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
is going to come back me at the ground

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.280 
is going to come back me at the ground
you<00:05:11.060> can<00:05:11.210> see<00:05:11.240> that<00:05:11.510> I'm<00:05:11.630> hitting<00:05:11.990> the<00:05:12.080> ball

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
you can see that I'm hitting the ball

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.080 
you can see that I'm hitting the ball
into<00:05:12.560> the<00:05:12.800> rebounder<00:05:13.280> in<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.430> air<00:05:13.700> and<00:05:13.970> it's

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
into the rebounder in the air and it's

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.090 
into the rebounder in the air and it's
coming<00:05:14.330> back<00:05:14.480> at<00:05:14.720> me<00:05:14.900> on<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.200> ground<00:05:15.440> kind<00:05:15.980> of

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
coming back at me on the ground kind of

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.610 
coming back at me on the ground kind of
a<00:05:16.250> somewhat<00:05:17.060> inconsistent<00:05:17.870> past<00:05:18.110> but<00:05:18.470> that's

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
a somewhat inconsistent past but that's

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.810 
a somewhat inconsistent past but that's
actually<00:05:18.770> what<00:05:19.040> you<00:05:19.070> would<00:05:19.280> want<00:05:19.460> for<00:05:19.730> this

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
actually what you would want for this

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.909 
actually what you would want for this
type<00:05:20.060> of<00:05:20.090> training<00:05:20.510> kind<00:05:21.169> of<00:05:21.290> really<00:05:21.710> allows

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
type of training kind of really allows

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:22.900 
type of training kind of really allows
you<00:05:22.070> to<00:05:22.190> move<00:05:22.310> your<00:05:22.490> feet

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
you to move your feet

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.340 
you to move your feet
but<00:05:23.180> it's<00:05:23.300> nice<00:05:23.419> again<00:05:23.810> that<00:05:23.960> you<00:05:24.050> don't<00:05:24.200> have

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
but it's nice again that you don't have

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.780 
but it's nice again that you don't have
to<00:05:24.470> hit<00:05:24.590> the<00:05:24.710> rebounder<00:05:25.250> right<00:05:25.430> in<00:05:25.520> the<00:05:25.610> middle

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
to hit the rebounder right in the middle

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.150 
to hit the rebounder right in the middle
which<00:05:26.390> is<00:05:26.419> really<00:05:26.900> not<00:05:27.050> a<00:05:27.110> pass<00:05:27.410> you<00:05:27.680> can<00:05:27.710> this

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
which is really not a pass you can this

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.130 
which is really not a pass you can this
is<00:05:28.280> more<00:05:28.490> of<00:05:28.550> a<00:05:28.610> realistic<00:05:28.970> pass<00:05:29.390> in<00:05:29.660> if<00:05:30.020> you're

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
is more of a realistic pass in if you're

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.420 
is more of a realistic pass in if you're
going<00:05:30.290> to<00:05:30.350> play<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:30.650> ball<00:05:30.770> into<00:05:31.010> somebody

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
going to play the ball into somebody

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.460 
going to play the ball into somebody
from<00:05:31.490> a<00:05:31.790> little<00:05:32.000> little<00:05:32.540> bit<00:05:32.660> of<00:05:32.780> distance<00:05:33.020> and

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
from a little little bit of distance and

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.750 
from a little little bit of distance and
it's<00:05:33.770> cool<00:05:33.950> that<00:05:34.070> the<00:05:34.160> ball<00:05:34.310> comes<00:05:34.430> at<00:05:34.640> you

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
it's cool that the ball comes at you

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.100 
it's cool that the ball comes at you
with<00:05:34.790> a<00:05:34.910> little<00:05:35.030> bit<00:05:35.120> of<00:05:35.210> bounce<00:05:35.419> to<00:05:35.720> it<00:05:35.750> so<00:05:35.990> it

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
with a little bit of bounce to it so it

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.930 
with a little bit of bounce to it so it
adds<00:05:36.260> somewhat<00:05:37.070> of<00:05:37.160> a<00:05:37.220> challenge<00:05:37.400> but<00:05:37.790> it's

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
adds somewhat of a challenge but it's

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.640 
adds somewhat of a challenge but it's
nice<00:05:38.090> that<00:05:38.270> you<00:05:38.360> can<00:05:38.510> angle<00:05:38.930> that<00:05:39.050> rebounder

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
nice that you can angle that rebounder

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.520 
nice that you can angle that rebounder
negatively<00:05:40.250> to<00:05:40.760> get<00:05:40.910> that<00:05:41.090> kind<00:05:41.390> of<00:05:41.510> a<00:05:41.720> pass

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
negatively to get that kind of a pass

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.020 
negatively to get that kind of a pass
going<00:05:42.919> then<00:05:43.340> here<00:05:43.490> I<00:05:43.550> have<00:05:43.700> kind<00:05:43.910> of<00:05:43.940> a

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
going then here I have kind of a

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.580 
going then here I have kind of a
first-person<00:05:44.390> view<00:05:44.570> of<00:05:44.780> a<00:05:44.840> long<00:05:45.080> pass<00:05:45.350> and

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
first-person view of a long pass and

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.159 
first-person view of a long pass and
what's<00:05:46.100> amazing<00:05:46.370> about<00:05:46.669> this<00:05:47.150> is<00:05:47.360> that<00:05:47.390> if

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
what's amazing about this is that if

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:49.330 
what's amazing about this is that if
you've<00:05:48.290> ever<00:05:48.500> tried<00:05:48.770> to<00:05:48.830> do<00:05:49.010> this<00:05:49.130> on<00:05:49.310> a

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
you've ever tried to do this on a

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.130 
you've ever tried to do this on a
regular<00:05:49.550> sports<00:05:49.940> rebounder<00:05:50.480> it's<00:05:50.870> almost

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
regular sports rebounder it's almost

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.870 
regular sports rebounder it's almost
impossible<00:05:51.530> to<00:05:51.860> get<00:05:52.010> a<00:05:52.070> pass<00:05:52.340> that's<00:05:52.580> going<00:05:52.790> to

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
impossible to get a pass that's going to

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.730 
impossible to get a pass that's going to
come<00:05:53.030> right<00:05:53.330> back<00:05:53.540> to<00:05:53.600> you<00:05:54.050> and<00:05:54.410> I<00:05:54.470> was<00:05:54.620> having

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
come right back to you and I was having

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.350 
come right back to you and I was having
no<00:05:55.040> trouble<00:05:55.100> at<00:05:55.520> all<00:05:55.550> I<00:05:55.669> was<00:05:55.820> doing<00:05:56.090> this<00:05:56.180> on

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
no trouble at all I was doing this on

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.220 
no trouble at all I was doing this on
the<00:05:56.450> first<00:05:56.600> try

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
the first try

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.710 
the first try
back<00:05:57.620> and<00:05:57.830> forth<00:05:58.100> really<00:05:58.580> consistent<00:05:59.210> and

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
back and forth really consistent and

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.940 
back and forth really consistent and
then<00:05:59.870> here's<00:06:00.050> kind<00:06:00.230> of<00:06:00.260> a<00:06:00.350> shooting<00:06:00.620> drill<00:06:00.830> you

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
then here's kind of a shooting drill you

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.560 
then here's kind of a shooting drill you
can<00:06:01.010> do<00:06:01.160> where<00:06:01.340> I<00:06:01.370> shoot<00:06:01.910> the<00:06:02.060> ball<00:06:02.180> into<00:06:02.210> the

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
can do where I shoot the ball into the

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.000 
can do where I shoot the ball into the
rebounder<00:06:02.960> and<00:06:03.080> it<00:06:03.169> bounces<00:06:03.500> over<00:06:03.620> my<00:06:03.830> head

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
rebounder and it bounces over my head

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.650 
rebounder and it bounces over my head
pretty<00:06:04.520> much<00:06:04.730> like<00:06:04.850> a<00:06:04.880> through<00:06:05.120> ball<00:06:05.300> and<00:06:05.570> then

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
pretty much like a through ball and then

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.350 
pretty much like a through ball and then
obviously<00:06:06.020> the<00:06:06.320> nuts<00:06:06.500> there<00:06:06.710> for<00:06:06.919> a<00:06:06.950> finish

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
obviously the nuts there for a finish

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.700 
obviously the nuts there for a finish
again<00:06:08.360> something<00:06:08.870> that<00:06:08.990> you<00:06:09.110> really<00:06:09.440> wouldn't

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
again something that you really wouldn't

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.500 
again something that you really wouldn't
be<00:06:09.860> able<00:06:09.950> to<00:06:10.070> do<00:06:10.310> by<00:06:10.880> yourself<00:06:11.030> without

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
be able to do by yourself without

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.940 
be able to do by yourself without
something<00:06:11.900> like<00:06:12.050> an<00:06:12.290> all<00:06:12.410> ball<00:06:12.620> pro<00:06:12.770> sports

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
something like an all ball pro sports

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.159 
something like an all ball pro sports
rebounder<00:06:13.610> and<00:06:13.760> again<00:06:14.210> changing<00:06:14.690> that<00:06:14.810> angle

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
rebounder and again changing that angle

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:16.210 
rebounder and again changing that angle
is<00:06:15.230> going<00:06:15.320> to<00:06:15.380> allow<00:06:15.560> you<00:06:15.620> to<00:06:15.740> play<00:06:15.979> a<00:06:16.010> ball

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
is going to allow you to play a ball

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.710 
is going to allow you to play a ball
over<00:06:16.490> your<00:06:16.580> head<00:06:16.640> or<00:06:17.000> if<00:06:17.300> you<00:06:17.360> wanted<00:06:17.510> to<00:06:17.570> play

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
over your head or if you wanted to play

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.090 
over your head or if you wanted to play
a<00:06:17.750> ball<00:06:17.960> to<00:06:18.110> yourself<00:06:18.470> what<00:06:18.620> you<00:06:18.710> see<00:06:18.830> a<00:06:18.860> little

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
a ball to yourself what you see a little

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.130 
a ball to yourself what you see a little
bit<00:06:19.220> later<00:06:19.370> but<00:06:19.940> like<00:06:20.090> I<00:06:20.180> said<00:06:20.240> to<00:06:20.810> play

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.140 
bit later but like I said to play

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.810 
bit later but like I said to play
over<00:06:21.560> yourself<00:06:21.890> this<00:06:22.010> is<00:06:22.160> really<00:06:22.490> something

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
over yourself this is really something

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.490 
over yourself this is really something
that<00:06:22.940> you<00:06:23.060> could<00:06:23.330> not<00:06:23.480> do<00:06:23.780> on<00:06:24.110> your<00:06:24.350> own

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
that you could not do on your own

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.380 
that you could not do on your own
without<00:06:24.710> a<00:06:24.860> rebounder<00:06:25.490> of<00:06:25.670> this<00:06:25.850> type<00:06:26.120> and

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
without a rebounder of this type and

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.480 
without a rebounder of this type and
it's<00:06:27.140> just<00:06:27.320> super<00:06:27.440> easy<00:06:27.770> to<00:06:27.920> use<00:06:28.010> I'm<00:06:28.190> sending

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
it's just super easy to use I'm sending

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.130 
it's just super easy to use I'm sending
super<00:06:28.850> consistent<00:06:29.150> balls<00:06:29.570> over<00:06:29.870> my<00:06:29.990> head

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
super consistent balls over my head

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.630 
super consistent balls over my head
pretty<00:06:30.440> much<00:06:30.590> the<00:06:30.710> same<00:06:30.920> pass<00:06:31.130> every<00:06:31.430> time

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
pretty much the same pass every time

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.530 
pretty much the same pass every time
without<00:06:32.600> having<00:06:32.990> any<00:06:33.110> trouble<00:06:34.330> again<00:06:35.330> there's

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.540 
without having any trouble again there's

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.820 
without having any trouble again there's
really<00:06:35.600> nothing<00:06:36.050> that<00:06:36.170> you<00:06:36.260> couldn't<00:06:36.590> do<00:06:36.680> with

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
really nothing that you couldn't do with

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.960 
really nothing that you couldn't do with
this<00:06:36.950> particular<00:06:37.190> rebound<00:06:37.640> they're<00:06:37.760> sending

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
this particular rebound they're sending

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.340 
this particular rebound they're sending
it<00:06:38.060> over<00:06:38.210> your<00:06:38.300> head<00:06:38.390> for<00:06:38.540> a<00:06:38.600> volley<00:06:38.810> here's

it over your head for a volley here's
some<00:06:39.530> first-person<00:06:40.040> where<00:06:40.160> I'm<00:06:40.220> setting<00:06:40.490> it

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
some first-person where I'm setting it

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.610 
some first-person where I'm setting it
into<00:06:40.730> myself<00:06:41.000> turning<00:06:41.540> and<00:06:41.810> shooting<00:06:42.140> like<00:06:42.590> I

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
into myself turning and shooting like I

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.020 
into myself turning and shooting like I
said<00:06:42.860> doesn't<00:06:43.010> necessarily<00:06:43.460> have<00:06:43.550> to<00:06:43.580> be<00:06:43.730> over

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030 
said doesn't necessarily have to be over

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.540 
said doesn't necessarily have to be over
your<00:06:44.120> head<00:06:44.180> but<00:06:44.960> just<00:06:45.410> really<00:06:46.040> neat<00:06:46.220> how<00:06:46.250> this

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
your head but just really neat how this

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.550 
your head but just really neat how this
particular<00:06:46.790> rebounder<00:06:47.360> does<00:06:47.570> work<00:06:47.810> and<00:06:48.020> then

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 
particular rebounder does work and then

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.050 
particular rebounder does work and then
here's<00:06:48.770> kind<00:06:49.010> of<00:06:49.040> a<00:06:49.130> first-person<00:06:49.490> view<00:06:49.700> of

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
here's kind of a first-person view of

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.670 
here's kind of a first-person view of
the<00:06:50.270> ball<00:06:50.420> kind<00:06:50.690> of<00:06:50.750> getting<00:06:50.960> shot<00:06:51.170> over<00:06:51.530> my

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
the ball kind of getting shot over my

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.590 
the ball kind of getting shot over my
head<00:06:51.860> and<00:06:52.100> then<00:06:52.580> of<00:06:52.700> course<00:06:52.730> the<00:06:53.030> finish<00:06:53.360> same

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:53.600 
head and then of course the finish same

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.880
