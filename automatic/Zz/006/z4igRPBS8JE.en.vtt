that<00:04:42.700> no<00:04:43.120> wonder<00:04:43.390> he<00:04:43.720> has<00:04:44.140> post-traumatic

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
that no wonder he has post-traumatic

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.310 
that no wonder he has post-traumatic
stress<00:04:45.400> because<00:04:45.970> I<00:04:46.210> mean<00:04:46.510> imagine<00:04:47.080> the

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
stress because I mean imagine the

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.590 
stress because I mean imagine the
carnage<00:04:47.830> you<00:04:47.950> probably<00:04:48.220> saw<00:04:48.600> one-sided

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
carnage you probably saw one-sided

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.420 
carnage you probably saw one-sided
fucking<00:04:49.960> fought<00:04:50.200> like<00:04:50.380> a<00:04:50.440> manslaughter<00:04:51.280> I

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
fucking fought like a manslaughter I

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.640 
fucking fought like a manslaughter I
mean<00:04:51.640> that<00:04:51.820> oh<00:04:52.000> I'd<00:04:52.870> have<00:04:52.930> been<00:04:53.080> terrible<00:04:53.440> but

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
mean that oh I'd have been terrible but

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.650 
mean that oh I'd have been terrible but
the<00:04:54.340> big<00:04:54.490> thing<00:04:54.520> I<00:04:54.850> do<00:04:54.910> want<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.270> bring<00:04:55.360> up<00:04:55.540> now

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
the big thing I do want to bring up now

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.360 
the big thing I do want to bring up now
let's<00:04:55.900> talk<00:04:56.050> about<00:04:56.110> a<00:04:56.350> couple<00:04:56.740> of<00:04:56.800> theories<00:04:57.070> so

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
let's talk about a couple of theories so

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.460 
let's talk about a couple of theories so
they<00:04:57.520> pretty<00:04:57.760> much<00:04:57.940> laid<00:04:58.330> out<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.810> groundwork

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
they pretty much laid out the groundwork

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.230 
they pretty much laid out the groundwork
of<00:04:59.620> what<00:04:59.830> we<00:04:59.920> should<00:05:00.100> probably<00:05:00.250> expect<00:05:00.700> most

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
of what we should probably expect most

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.120 
of what we should probably expect most
likely<00:05:01.570> it's<00:05:01.720> going<00:05:01.900> to<00:05:02.020> happen<00:05:02.230> it<00:05:02.590> really<00:05:03.040> is

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
likely it's going to happen it really is

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.280 
likely it's going to happen it really is
a<00:05:03.160> theory<00:05:03.430> about<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.700> same<00:05:04.090> time<00:05:04.330> it<00:05:04.630> can't<00:05:05.080> be

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
a theory about the same time it can't be

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.200 
a theory about the same time it can't be
because<00:05:05.500> it's<00:05:06.220> pretty<00:05:06.400> obvious<00:05:06.850> what<00:05:07.060> they

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
because it's pretty obvious what they

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.890 
because it's pretty obvious what they
might<00:05:07.390> do

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
might do

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.050 
might do
for<00:05:08.260> instance<00:05:08.620> slain<00:05:08.920> as<00:05:09.250> I<00:05:09.490> talked<00:05:10.000> about

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
for instance slain as I talked about

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.490 
for instance slain as I talked about
earlier<00:05:10.270> in<00:05:10.510> this<00:05:10.600> review<00:05:10.780> I<00:05:10.840> said<00:05:11.230> that<00:05:11.410> you

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
earlier in this review I said that you

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.870 
earlier in this review I said that you
know<00:05:11.590> his<00:05:11.770> father<00:05:11.950> was<00:05:12.220> doing<00:05:12.340> research<00:05:12.640> on

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
know his father was doing research on

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.790 
know his father was doing research on
all<00:05:13.090> dhanoa<00:05:13.390> we<00:05:13.870> find<00:05:14.110> out<00:05:14.260> that<00:05:14.380> all<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:14.650> noah

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
all dhanoa we find out that all the noah

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.530 
all dhanoa we find out that all the noah
stems<00:05:15.460> from<00:05:15.700> mars<00:05:16.060> it's<00:05:16.300> like<00:05:16.390> this

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
stems from mars it's like this

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.120 
stems from mars it's like this
technology<00:05:17.170> or<00:05:17.290> some<00:05:17.620> form<00:05:17.830> of<00:05:17.920> ancient

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
technology or some form of ancient

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.710 
technology or some form of ancient
relics<00:05:18.550> or<00:05:18.670> something<00:05:18.970> i<00:05:19.030> didn't<00:05:19.330> really<00:05:19.450> see

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
relics or something i didn't really see

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.600 
relics or something i didn't really see
much<00:05:20.320> into<00:05:20.710> that<00:05:20.830> but<00:05:20.980> was<00:05:21.100> something<00:05:21.340> that's

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
much into that but was something that's

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
much into that but was something that's
only<00:05:21.850> on<00:05:22.000> mars

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
only on mars

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.120 
only on mars
I'm<00:05:22.780> guessing<00:05:23.080> material<00:05:23.470> resource<00:05:23.860> something

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
I'm guessing material resource something

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.010 
I'm guessing material resource something
like<00:05:24.250> that<00:05:24.460> and<00:05:24.940> then<00:05:25.240> you<00:05:25.450> had<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:25.810> vers

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
like that and then you had the vers

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.140 
like that and then you had the vers
Empire<00:05:26.410> the<00:05:26.920> you<00:05:27.130> know<00:05:27.220> the<00:05:27.340> grandpa<00:05:27.730> of<00:05:27.970> our

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
Empire the you know the grandpa of our

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.950 
Empire the you know the grandpa of our
princess

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
princess

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.050 
princess
find<00:05:29.440> it<00:05:29.710> and<00:05:30.010> he<00:05:30.190> had<00:05:30.280> to<00:05:30.310> integrated<00:05:30.910> it<00:05:31.000> into

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
find it and he had to integrated it into

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.180 
find it and he had to integrated it into
his<00:05:31.300> DNA<00:05:31.690> to<00:05:31.750> where<00:05:32.080> he<00:05:32.260> can<00:05:32.410> access<00:05:32.920> all<00:05:33.130> the

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
his DNA to where he can access all the

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.520 
his DNA to where he can access all the
noah<00:05:33.460> technology<00:05:34.150> and<00:05:34.390> the<00:05:34.600> only<00:05:34.780> way<00:05:35.050> you

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
noah technology and the only way you

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.810 
noah technology and the only way you
could<00:05:35.650> activate<00:05:36.130> it<00:05:36.280> is<00:05:36.370> by<00:05:36.490> being<00:05:36.730> a

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
could activate it is by being a

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.540 
could activate it is by being a
descendent<00:05:37.450> from<00:05:37.660> him<00:05:38.020> or<00:05:38.320> if<00:05:38.590> he<00:05:38.740> gives<00:05:39.130> the

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
descendent from him or if he gives the

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.880 
descendent from him or if he gives the
ability<00:05:40.180> to<00:05:40.210> do<00:05:40.510> it<00:05:40.660> to<00:05:40.840> you<00:05:41.170> and<00:05:41.410> that's<00:05:41.680> where

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
ability to do it to you and that's where

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.920 
ability to do it to you and that's where
the<00:05:42.070> floating<00:05:42.400> fortresses<00:05:42.910> came<00:05:43.270> about<00:05:43.600> the

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
the floating fortresses came about the

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.990 
the floating fortresses came about the
knights<00:05:44.320> and<00:05:44.980> so<00:05:45.130> i<00:05:45.160> like<00:05:45.460> that<00:05:45.490> a<00:05:45.670> lot<00:05:45.820> it

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
knights and so i like that a lot it

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.100 
knights and so i like that a lot it
really<00:05:46.210> explains<00:05:46.450> a<00:05:46.570> lot<00:05:46.720> but<00:05:46.870> the<00:05:46.930> big<00:05:47.080> thing

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
really explains a lot but the big thing

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.410 
really explains a lot but the big thing
is<00:05:47.560> is<00:05:47.830> that<00:05:48.010> slain<00:05:48.370> spaulder<00:05:48.880> was<00:05:49.030> also

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.420 
is is that slain spaulder was also

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.720 
is is that slain spaulder was also
researching<00:05:49.930> this<00:05:50.200> so<00:05:50.680> it<00:05:51.010> makes<00:05:51.310> me<00:05:51.520> believe

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
researching this so it makes me believe

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.290 
researching this so it makes me believe
that<00:05:52.180> slain<00:05:52.990> knows<00:05:53.890> how<00:05:54.220> to<00:05:54.280> build<00:05:54.700> all<00:05:55.060> to

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
that slain knows how to build all to

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.390 
that slain knows how to build all to
Noah's<00:05:55.630> and<00:05:55.900> you<00:05:56.320> have<00:05:56.500> the<00:05:56.620> vers<00:05:56.740> princess<00:05:57.250> on

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
Noah's and you have the vers princess on

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.190 
Noah's and you have the vers princess on
board<00:05:57.640> with<00:05:57.730> slain<00:05:58.000> in<00:05:58.180> inaho<00:05:58.540> and<00:05:58.840> the<00:05:59.020> first

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
board with slain in inaho and the first

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.200 
board with slain in inaho and the first
princess<00:05:59.590> can<00:05:59.800> access<00:06:00.400> this<00:06:00.640> technology

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
princess can access this technology

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.790 
princess can access this technology
since<00:06:01.450> she<00:06:01.570> can<00:06:01.690> activate<00:06:02.200> it<00:06:02.380> so<00:06:02.530> you<00:06:02.590> have

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
since she can activate it so you have

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.320 
since she can activate it so you have
two<00:06:02.980> parts<00:06:03.250> of<00:06:03.340> the<00:06:03.400> puzzle<00:06:03.700> and<00:06:04.060> then<00:06:04.240> you

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
two parts of the puzzle and then you

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.930 
two parts of the puzzle and then you
have<00:06:04.450> inaho<00:06:04.990> that's<00:06:05.560> a<00:06:05.710> master<00:06:06.160> at<00:06:06.250> piloting<00:06:06.820> a

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
have inaho that's a master at piloting a

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.580 
have inaho that's a master at piloting a
mech<00:06:07.390> because<00:06:07.810> we've<00:06:07.990> seen<00:06:08.110> a<00:06:08.170> pile<00:06:08.380> of<00:06:08.410> the

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
mech because we've seen a pile of the

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.010 
mech because we've seen a pile of the
mechs<00:06:08.740> like<00:06:08.860> a<00:06:08.890> fucking<00:06:09.250> bad-ass<00:06:09.490> so<00:06:09.940> slain<00:06:10.810> is

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
mechs like a fucking bad-ass so slain is

to know about is more about having small
yes<00:06:46.200> it's<00:06:46.380> pretty<00:06:46.560> obvious<00:06:46.950> what<00:06:47.100> heavens

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
yes it's pretty obvious what heavens

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.570 
yes it's pretty obvious what heavens
fault<00:06:47.580> is<00:06:47.760> by<00:06:47.970> now<00:06:48.240> but<00:06:48.840> I<00:06:49.140> mean<00:06:49.410> the<00:06:50.010> carnage

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
fault is by now but I mean the carnage

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.340 
fault is by now but I mean the carnage
of<00:06:50.790> it<00:06:50.970> just<00:06:51.420> seems<00:06:51.600> to<00:06:51.750> be<00:06:51.840> on<00:06:51.960> a<00:06:51.990> colossal

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:52.350 
of it just seems to be on a colossal

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.930 
of it just seems to be on a colossal
scale<00:06:52.590> you<00:06:52.830> got<00:06:52.920> to<00:06:53.010> think<00:06:53.130> of<00:06:53.250> moon<00:06:53.460> falling

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
scale you got to think of moon falling

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.940 
scale you got to think of moon falling
fucking<00:06:54.270> down<00:06:54.420> on<00:06:54.630> earth<00:06:54.750> you'd<00:06:54.960> be<00:06:55.110> colossal

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950 
fucking down on earth you'd be colossal

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.590 
fucking down on earth you'd be colossal
I'm<00:06:56.250> surprised<00:06:56.610> earth<00:06:56.850> is<00:06:57.030> actually<00:06:57.360> still

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 
I'm surprised earth is actually still

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.140 
I'm surprised earth is actually still
fucking<00:06:57.960> standing<00:06:58.440> after<00:06:58.620> a<00:06:59.100> moon<00:06:59.670> half<00:06:59.970> the

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.150 
fucking standing after a moon half the

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.640 
fucking standing after a moon half the
fucking<00:07:00.420> moon<00:07:00.570> falling<00:07:01.050> down<00:07:01.170> on<00:07:01.350> the<00:07:01.440> earth

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650 
fucking moon falling down on the earth

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.030 
fucking moon falling down on the earth
so<00:07:02.010> it's<00:07:02.550> pretty<00:07:02.730> close<00:07:03.090> all<00:07:03.330> damaged<00:07:03.750> but<00:07:04.040> but

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.040 
so it's pretty close all damaged but but

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.040 
so it's pretty close all damaged but but
the<00:07:05.160> big<00:07:05.310> thing<00:07:05.340> though<00:07:05.700> is<00:07:05.970> is<00:07:06.270> that<00:07:06.600> I<00:07:06.630> wonder

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
the big thing though is is that I wonder

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.550 
the big thing though is is that I wonder
if<00:07:07.410> inside<00:07:08.310> the<00:07:08.550> moon<00:07:08.910> if<00:07:09.540> there's<00:07:09.900> any<00:07:10.170> like

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 
if inside the moon if there's any like

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.010 
if inside the moon if there's any like
resources<00:07:11.280> and<00:07:11.460> stuff<00:07:11.730> like<00:07:11.940> old<00:07:12.210> inoa<00:07:12.570> for

instance you know how all the Noah's
found<00:07:14.850> on<00:07:15.060> Mars

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:15.540 
found on Mars

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.170 
found on Mars
a<00:07:15.750> different<00:07:16.380> planet<00:07:16.740> what<00:07:17.400> if<00:07:17.580> inside<00:07:18.000> the

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
a different planet what if inside the

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.420 
a different planet what if inside the
moon<00:07:18.420> there<00:07:19.080> was<00:07:19.200> that<00:07:19.350> technology<00:07:19.980> to<00:07:20.070> olden

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430

moon there was that technology to olden
Oh<00:07:20.490> a<00:07:20.520> technology<00:07:21.150> inside<00:07:22.050> of<00:07:22.380> the<00:07:22.740> moon<00:07:23.040> and

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.370 
Oh a technology inside of the moon and

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.420 
Oh a technology inside of the moon and
when<00:07:23.820> the<00:07:24.000> moon<00:07:24.210> broke<00:07:24.630> in<00:07:24.810> half<00:07:25.160> some<00:07:26.160> of<00:07:26.340> that

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.430 
when the moon broke in half some of that

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.890 
when the moon broke in half some of that
stuff<00:07:26.670> that<00:07:26.700> was<00:07:26.910> locked<00:07:27.270> away<00:07:27.450> in<00:07:27.630> the<00:07:27.720> core

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:27.900 
stuff that was locked away in the core

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.620 
stuff that was locked away in the core
of<00:07:27.930> the<00:07:28.050> Moon<00:07:28.260> fell<00:07:28.770> to<00:07:29.010> earth<00:07:29.270> that<00:07:30.270> could<00:07:30.570> be

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:30.630 
of the Moon fell to earth that could be

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.060 
of the Moon fell to earth that could be
possible<00:07:31.230> that<00:07:31.290> could<00:07:31.500> be<00:07:31.590> where<00:07:31.740> they<00:07:31.890> can

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.070 
possible that could be where they can

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.070 
possible that could be where they can
get<00:07:32.250> the<00:07:32.400> material<00:07:32.910> to<00:07:32.940> do<00:07:33.270> it<00:07:33.420> and<00:07:33.900> I'd<00:07:34.050> be

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 
get the material to do it and I'd be

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.480 
get the material to do it and I'd be
really<00:07:34.410> interesting<00:07:34.890> if<00:07:34.950> that<00:07:35.130> did<00:07:35.280> happen

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:35.490 
really interesting if that did happen

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.910 
really interesting if that did happen
and<00:07:35.760> supposedly<00:07:36.150> from<00:07:36.480> what<00:07:36.870> we<00:07:36.990> saw<00:07:37.260> in<00:07:37.560> the

flashback but post-traumatic stress
soldier<00:07:40.620> we<00:07:40.800> saw<00:07:40.980> that<00:07:41.130> there<00:07:41.280> was<00:07:41.370> another

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:41.580

you<00:07:41.850> know<00:07:41.940> all<00:07:42.150> the<00:07:42.330> know<00:07:42.450> drive<00:07:42.720> being<00:07:42.900> used

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.110 
you know all the know drive being used

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.690 
you know all the know drive being used
one<00:07:43.260> of<00:07:43.320> those<00:07:43.410> necks<00:07:43.740> and<00:07:43.980> so<00:07:44.130> most<00:07:44.580> likely

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:44.700 
one of those necks and so most likely
