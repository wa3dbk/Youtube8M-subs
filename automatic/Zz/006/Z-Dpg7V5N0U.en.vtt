instructional screen so that you can

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:46.290 
instructional screen so that you can
show<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.469> class<00:00:44.889> how<00:00:45.399> the<00:00:45.460> naming<00:00:45.940> of<00:00:46.059> notes

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
show the class how the naming of notes

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.549 
show the class how the naming of notes
work<00:00:46.800> using<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:47.920> lines<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:48.429> all<00:00:48.639> the<00:00:48.789> spaces

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
work using the lines and all the spaces

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.590 
work using the lines and all the spaces
we've<00:00:50.559> purposely<00:00:51.159> left<00:00:51.460> it<00:00:51.670> quite<00:00:51.819> open<00:00:52.389> and

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
we've purposely left it quite open and

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.199 
we've purposely left it quite open and
the<00:00:53.019> materials<00:00:53.559> are<00:00:53.739> editable<00:00:54.190> so<00:00:54.819> if<00:00:55.030> it's

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:55.209 
the materials are editable so if it's

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:57.930 
the materials are editable so if it's
off<00:00:55.749> inch<00:00:56.049> you<00:00:56.589> can<00:00:56.620> use<00:00:56.949> that<00:00:57.219> or<00:00:57.429> if<00:00:57.819> we

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
off inch you can use that or if we

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.239 
off inch you can use that or if we
prefer<00:00:58.269> this<00:00:58.479> rhymes<00:00:58.870> approach<00:00:59.379> like<00:00:59.799> every

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:00.249 
prefer this rhymes approach like every

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:02.879 
prefer this rhymes approach like every
good<00:01:00.399> boy<00:01:00.639> does<00:01:00.850> fine<00:01:00.929> then<00:01:01.929> you<00:01:02.049> can<00:01:02.170> also<00:01:02.409> do

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:02.889 
good boy does fine then you can also do

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:05.250 
good boy does fine then you can also do
that<00:01:03.100> now<00:01:03.940> my<00:01:04.150> preferred<00:01:04.570> method<00:01:04.600> is<00:01:05.019> just<00:01:05.140> to

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
that now my preferred method is just to

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.040 
that now my preferred method is just to
know<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.860> signpost<00:01:06.549> notes<00:01:06.880> like<00:01:07.360> middle<00:01:07.810> C

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
know the signpost notes like middle C

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
know the signpost notes like middle C
and<00:01:08.350> count<00:01:08.980> up<00:01:09.130> lines<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:09.730> spaces<00:01:09.910> from<00:01:10.390> there

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
and count up lines and spaces from there

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.040 
and count up lines and spaces from there
whatever<00:01:12.070> way<00:01:12.400> you<00:01:12.640> choose<00:01:12.910> to<00:01:12.940> do<00:01:13.210> it<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.810> key

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
whatever way you choose to do it the key

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.020 
whatever way you choose to do it the key
point<00:01:14.350> is<00:01:14.560> to<00:01:14.620> place<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.340> notes<00:01:15.550> on<00:01:15.760> the<00:01:15.820> staff

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.840 
point is to place the notes on the staff
in<00:01:16.600> this<00:01:16.930> first<00:01:17.230> activity<00:01:17.800> and<00:01:18.040> then<00:01:18.610> have

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
in this first activity and then have

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.020 
in this first activity and then have
students<00:01:19.270> take<00:01:19.450> turns<00:01:19.690> to<00:01:19.930> place<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.350> notes

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
students take turns to place the notes

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
for the purposes of this lesson we've

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.820 
for the purposes of this lesson we've
kept<00:01:24.340> it<00:01:24.460> to<00:01:24.610> C<00:01:24.940> to<00:01:25.180> G<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.570> treble<00:01:25.930> clef<00:01:25.960> but

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
kept it to C to G the treble clef but

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.170 
kept it to C to G the treble clef but
you<00:01:26.950> can<00:01:27.100> do<00:01:27.220> this<00:01:27.370> activity<00:01:27.700> for<00:01:27.970> whatever

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
you can do this activity for whatever

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.240 
you can do this activity for whatever
pitch<00:01:28.750> range<00:01:29.050> you're<00:01:29.410> working<00:01:29.800> with<00:01:29.950> at<00:01:30.130> the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
pitch range you're working with at the

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.240 
pitch range you're working with at the
time<00:01:31.050> after<00:01:32.050> that<00:01:32.230> they<00:01:32.680> need<00:01:32.830> to<00:01:32.860> practice

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
time after that they need to practice

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.010 
time after that they need to practice
writing<00:01:33.550> those<00:01:33.850> notes<00:01:34.120> so<00:01:34.360> we've<00:01:34.780> got<00:01:34.990> a

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
writing those notes so we've got a

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.720 
writing those notes so we've got a
worksheet<00:01:35.680> that<00:01:35.710> goes<00:01:36.100> along<00:01:36.460> with<00:01:36.610> the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
worksheet that goes along with the

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.430 
worksheet that goes along with the
whiteboards<00:01:37.270> slide<00:01:37.510> that<00:01:37.750> will<00:01:37.870> extend<00:01:38.260> the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
whiteboards slide that will extend the

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.830 
whiteboards slide that will extend the
students<00:01:38.980> and<00:01:39.220> help<00:01:39.850> them<00:01:39.910> to<00:01:40.180> name<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:40.660> write

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
students and help them to name and write

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.250 
students and help them to name and write
those<00:01:41.050> notes<00:01:41.910> the<00:01:42.910> whiteboards<00:01:43.570> slide<00:01:43.960> has

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
those notes the whiteboards slide has

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260 
those notes the whiteboards slide has
the<00:01:44.290> answers<00:01:44.830> built<00:01:45.070> in<00:01:45.280> so<00:01:45.850> once<00:01:46.090> they've

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
the answers built in so once they've

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.510 
the answers built in so once they've
completed<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.990> worksheet<00:01:47.200> you<00:01:47.950> can<00:01:48.100> use<00:01:48.340> the

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
completed the worksheet you can use the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.120 
completed the worksheet you can use the
erase<00:01:48.909> to<00:01:49.210> reveal<00:01:49.659> feature<00:01:49.990> to<00:01:50.710> check<00:01:50.980> the

erase to reveal feature to check the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.570 
erase to reveal feature to check the
answers<00:01:51.580> as<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:51.760> class<00:01:52.620> next<00:01:53.620> they<00:01:54.250> can<00:01:54.430> go

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580
