00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.389
 May together and welcome to 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.070
 park road and sleep i am city of 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.870
 mostly a joke and I have today 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.790
 again a series of highly copied and 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.890
 taken away for you because we do 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.199
 right now a star hairdresser 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.210
 namely by rachel bilson now namely 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.880
 worn because at the film premiere of 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.680
 the to do list and i think hairstyle is 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.689
 just so easy to copy 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.400
 and gave a nice summer hairstyle 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.960
 easy if you take the hair out of the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.700
 would like to have face and nevertheless 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.710
 still a little something to have open 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.660
 it is not too complicated and no 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.000
 French braid or other 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.230
 it is necessary very simple and me 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.670
 Hope the feet please you as 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.680
 inspiration and I wish you much 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.969
 fun with the tutorial should be the first 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.219
 your hair is good in any case 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.190
 comb through and you are welcome too 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.809
 already make curls in your lengths 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.910
 Then we divide up our hair 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.340
 and start to sleep here 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.840
 how could I divide the animal that could then 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.160
 ever get stuck and the same 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.160
 then on the other side too 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.180
 for a little more volume namely the top 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.950
 the count animals the whole thing a bit 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.320
 the crest of the one disappears too 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.119
 actually you can of course quite 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.229
 copy or copy a bit more 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.229
 omit the whole thing 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.430
 then we take only one left and right 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.740
 few more hairs on that you have to 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.020
 Just adjust to your head like you 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.300
 you feel most comfortable because of this 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.159
 area, it is set the same way 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.750
 that there is such a volume 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.210
 and it does it by that's easy 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.680
 one to two times rotates and then to 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.660
 the same way I push this right here 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.940
 have done and then puts the whole 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.280
 Simply firmly best with two braces 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.320
 we can hide the clips already 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.860
 at this point or just like that 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.350
 cover how I do that then take care of it 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.200
 we look for the parts in front and this one 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.030
 Maybe just important to me 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.680
 this is only if your ponies have that 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.539
 In each of the three strands really too 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.070
 long hair are there because we're up 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.989
 to braid 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.000
 and most beautiful I personally think 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.670
 it looks like if you are with the front 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.620
 streak start so and then completely 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.940
 normal braid and you should braid 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.530
 Keep it a bit behind as well 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.510
 so that he is already on the head 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.810
 later and do not want to be funny 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.810
 form 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.940
 you can still do that at the end 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.800
 a rubber fix in any case 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.200
 you braid up to her behind the head 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.660
 arrived and the whole thing is 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.740
 their just below the previous one 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.740
 cling 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.300
 just like we also, of course, 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.890
 on the other side that also means 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.960
 here again three strands and we 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.430
 start with the front the whole 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.560
 Let's face back so easily 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.000
 so that fits nicely on the head and what we 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.490
 can still do so with the zob 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.930
 you get a little wider and voluminous 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.790
 can always do as I do here now 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.530
 pull out these individual bows 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.610
 but it does not at the circuit has 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.440
 then it is more difficult but 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.150
 always after the piece you can again 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.530
 lighten up the whole and a little 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.150
 Personally, I think that looks a lot 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.430
 beautiful and I think also rachel 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.220
 bilson did it that way because so many 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.540
 Do not have hair on the front and not head 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:26.050
 I put the whole thing in the back like you 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:27.970
 look over cross tight to the end with trouble 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.800
 and now this hair around here 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.680
 around the ear and already so easy on 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.140
 neck and this I am through 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.970
 and now I cover the whole 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.490
 so everything clinging to it so close behind 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.890
 see is and the plaited braids 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.680
 disappear in the end as it were 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.420
 under this tap and at the same time 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.220
 should remember that this 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.260
 cling that you use here so well 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.700
 as possible really among the others 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.370
 so that his hair can be plugged 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.870
 are not visible 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.510
 Rachel Bilson then wears the rest 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.040
 open hair very natural so with 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.440
 Of course you can do light waves 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.000
 to adapt to your wishes and thus 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.000
 the hairstyle also finished 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.540
 i hope you have it looks first of all 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.920
 the hairstyle would have fallen all the way 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.780
 I would always be very happy 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.150
