00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.400 
let's just hope is not free to attack I
have<00:00:16.609> seen<00:00:16.849> some<00:00:17.150> games<00:00:17.449> where<00:00:17.810> they<00:00:17.840> go<00:00:18.199> for

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
have seen some games where they go for

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.260 
have seen some games where they go for
the<00:00:18.529> economy<00:00:19.039> in<00:00:19.099> the<00:00:19.250> surrender<00:00:19.759> opponent

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
the economy in the surrender opponent

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.269 
the economy in the surrender opponent
and<00:00:20.390> then<00:00:20.960> they<00:00:21.110> just<00:00:21.289> like<00:00:21.500> them<00:00:21.710> center<00:00:22.099> base

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
and then they just like them center base

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.460 
and then they just like them center base
until<00:00:22.669> they<00:00:22.820> run<00:00:22.970> out<00:00:23.029> of<00:00:23.180> war<00:00:23.509> which<00:00:23.750> can<00:00:24.230> take

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
until they run out of war which can take

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.830 
until they run out of war which can take
some<00:00:24.739> time<00:00:24.770> so<00:00:25.279> just<00:00:26.000> hoping<00:00:26.329> is<00:00:26.419> not<00:00:26.570> doing
