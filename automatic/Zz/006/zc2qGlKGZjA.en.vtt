00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.470
 build a fake little fish o 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.030
 so-called mino is used 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.410
 for the sea 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.990
 a wood 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:22.240
 can now be mahogany or the 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.610
 sheet in this case we have move 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:36.519
 fourth is a piece that is obtained 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:44.980
 this form of fish that you then go to 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:48.460
 shape as everyone knows interest in 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:55.300
 this case I did on the type of weapon 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:01:01.590
 motions of their long about 20 cm later 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.590
 having shaped it made a cut with 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:13.470
 an electric saw deprives by making a 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:19.030
 sign with the pencil finding the centerline 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:22.720
 then I made one with a thin saw 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.990
 first sign then I intervened 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.990
 when 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.790
 once this cut is made go to 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.790
 drill 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:49.130
 and make hearts with a note of 5 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.100
 for woods, especially where there is more 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:57.260
 thickness where there is the new of the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:59.300
 minnow at a depth based on the 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.500
 which the deo fish float oa 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:14.570
 found once this is done 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:25.220
 operation takes harmonic thread 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:27.970
 malleable which is found and found in 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.970
 parliament 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:41.310
 after which the thread is placed inside 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.310
 of the cut that must be positioned 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.470
 the armor 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.060
 with a pair of old rounds you start a 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.060
 do 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.240
 the thread attachment ring 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.940
 in this way 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.069
 is positioned 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:44.120
 inside the bank keep it inside 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.120
 after that 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:54.239
 you do 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.239
 the second link 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.329
 then the third 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.810
 once positioned 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.930
 what's now 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.930
 the third ring 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.300
 finished the point 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:10.000
 with the burner is a three torino with 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:18.060
 lead is glued to the part that must 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:22.550
 to be forgotten I forgot 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.550
 first in detail 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:29.740
 foto pace it's about making a cut 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:33.800
 for the scoop of approx 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:37.509
 45 maximum 60 degrees 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.509
 and place the pallet in 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:49.819
 plastic material which can be who 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:52.369
 is not in possession of polycarbonate or 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:59.749
 use a plastic bottle 

00:05:52.369 --> 00:06:03.219
 lasts and glues then you try everything 

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:03.219
 in the water mirror 

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:09.020
 I repeat this must be a minus 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:10.159
 sailing to the sea if you want to do it 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.399
 more abundant 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:17.209
 just add a little more lead and 

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:23.029
 consequently increase the drilling in the 

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:26.990
 girth then switch to 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:30.259
 painting the wording I have before do 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:33.619
 one hand with the brush paints them 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:35.330
 to white water and then to be colored with pleasure 

00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:38.389
 if you had you are in possession of a 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:41.990
 autograph is the maximum you can do i 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:44.839
 drawings you want you can make drain 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.139
 fish scales and do all that 

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:47.959
 wants 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:50.930
 then with a varnish or with 

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:53.119
 of the beads you can draw the eyes 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.499
 above the fish by making small 

00:06:53.119 --> 00:07:03.430
 small holes to fit the eyes 

00:06:56.499 --> 00:07:03.430
 glued with the tac 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.300
 once you put the lead for 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.100
 cover everything just use one 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:20.560
 two-component rape and close the 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:20.560
 Injured girth the job is done
