disney has developed a magical device to

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.849 
disney has developed a magical device to
make<00:00:02.790> your<00:00:02.970> fingertips<00:00:03.540> whisper<00:00:04.110> and<00:00:04.290> sing

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
make your fingertips whisper and sing

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.309 
make your fingertips whisper and sing
and<00:00:05.100> it's<00:00:05.700> probably<00:00:06.120> not<00:00:06.359> as<00:00:06.480> disgusting<00:00:06.960> as

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
and it's probably not as disgusting as

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.180 
and it's probably not as disgusting as
it<00:00:07.379> sounds<00:00:07.919> no<00:00:08.639> no<00:00:09.450> no<00:00:10.349> Disney<00:00:10.740> research<00:00:11.160> no<00:00:11.960> um

it sounds no no no Disney research no um
yeah<00:00:14.190> don't<00:00:14.370> do<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:14.460> again<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.500> Asian

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
yeah don't do that again the Asian

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.250 
yeah don't do that again the Asian
tension<00:00:17.190> technology<00:00:17.910> or<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.119> Asian<00:00:18.960> dense

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
tension technology or the Asian dense

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.349 
tension technology or the Asian dense
Shin<00:00:19.740> audio<00:00:20.160> system<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.730> what<00:00:20.880> I'm<00:00:20.970> talking

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
Shin audio system is what I'm talking

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.599 
Shin audio system is what I'm talking
about<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:22.199> uses<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.470> standard<00:00:23.010> microphone

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
about and it uses a standard microphone

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.460 
about and it uses a standard microphone
to<00:00:23.970> record<00:00:24.060> audio<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.900> then<00:00:24.990> convert<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.439> to

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
to record audio and then convert it to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.130 
to record audio and then convert it to
an<00:00:25.830> inaudible<00:00:26.189> signal<00:00:26.990> transmitted<00:00:27.990> through

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
an inaudible signal transmitted through

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.540 
an inaudible signal transmitted through
the<00:00:28.170> body<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.010> person<00:00:29.130> holding<00:00:29.369> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
the body of the person holding the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.650 
the body of the person holding the
microphone<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.090> then<00:00:30.240> if<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.449> touch

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
microphone and then if you touch

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.330 
microphone and then if you touch
someone's<00:00:31.019> ear<00:00:31.790> they'll<00:00:32.790> be<00:00:32.910> able<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.210> hear<00:00:33.480> it

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
someone's ear they'll be able to hear it

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.430 
someone's ear they'll be able to hear it
so<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.730> would<00:00:36.390> be<00:00:36.420> holding<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.780> microphone<00:00:36.960> I

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
so I would be holding a microphone I

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.770 
so I would be holding a microphone I
can't<00:00:38.280> hear<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> sound<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.969> touch<00:00:39.360> your<00:00:39.510> ear

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
can't hear the sound I touch your ear

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.270 
can't hear the sound I touch your ear
you<00:00:40.260> can<00:00:40.290> hear<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.910> singing<00:00:41.989> fingertips<00:00:43.280> it's

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
you can hear it singing fingertips it's

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.069 
you can hear it singing fingertips it's
 weird<00:00:44.670> Disney<00:00:45.120> yeah<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.809> was<00:00:45.960> weird

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
 weird Disney yeah it was weird

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.690 
 weird Disney yeah it was weird
to<00:00:46.260> say<00:00:46.379> would<00:00:46.530> put<00:00:46.860> their<00:00:46.980> research<00:00:47.399> into

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
to say would put their research into

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.850 
to say would put their research into
that<00:00:47.850> when<00:00:48.210> touching<00:00:48.570> another<00:00:48.930> person's<00:00:49.440> ear

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
that when touching another person's ear

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.310 
that when touching another person's ear
the<00:00:50.460> modulated<00:00:51.090> electrostatic<00:00:51.320> field

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
the modulated electrostatic field

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.799 
the modulated electrostatic field
creates<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.399> very<00:00:53.579> small<00:00:53.850> vibration<00:00:54.539> on<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
creates a very small vibration on the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.830 
creates a very small vibration on the
earlobe<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:56.340> turns<00:00:56.640> your<00:00:56.879> ear<00:00:57.090> into<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.449> speaker

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
earlobe it turns your ear into a speaker

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.660 
earlobe it turns your ear into a speaker
well<00:00:58.170> pretty<00:00:58.350> much<00:00:58.530> together<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
well pretty much together the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.819 
well pretty much together the
combination<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:00.809> our<00:01:00.989> forces<00:01:01.410> combined

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
combination with our forces combined

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.830 
combination with our forces combined
who's<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.520> speaker<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.180> inaudible<00:01:03.449> signal

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
who's the speaker the inaudible signal

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.450 
who's the speaker the inaudible signal
can<00:01:04.379> be<00:01:04.409> transmitted<00:01:04.949> from<00:01:04.979> body<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.339> body

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
can be transmitted from body to body

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.570 
can be transmitted from body to body
using<00:01:06.119> any<00:01:06.390> sort<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:07.020> physical<00:01:07.229> contact<00:01:07.650> which

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
using any sort of physical contact which

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.789 
using any sort of physical contact which
makes<00:01:08.880> me<00:01:09.030> think<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.990> could<00:01:10.290> get<00:01:10.439> super

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
makes me think this could get super

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.580 
makes me think this could get super
weird<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.369> thought<00:01:11.520> before<00:01:11.869> any<00:01:12.869> kind<00:01:13.350> it

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
weird like we thought before any kind it

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.190 
weird like we thought before any kind it
doesn't<00:01:13.860> have<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.189> be<00:01:14.220> your<00:01:14.430> finger<00:01:14.790> huh<00:01:15.270> get

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
record descent can only be heard by the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.690 
record descent can only be heard by the
specific<00:01:22.350> ear<00:01:22.530> touch<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.130> hear<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.400> if

Trevor dr. Cox well they're just using
bone<00:02:01.680> conduction<00:02:02.100> which<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.640> something

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
bone conduction which is something

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.749 
bone conduction which is something
similar<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.390> what<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:03.659> spoken<00:02:03.990> about<00:02:04.079> before

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
similar to what we spoken about before

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.180 
similar to what we spoken about before
transmitting<00:02:05.759> sound<00:02:06.479> through<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.740> through

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
transmitting sound through the through

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.699 
transmitting sound through the through
to<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.489> inner<00:02:08.759> ear<00:02:09.050> through<00:02:10.050> bones<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
to the inner ear through bones of the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.100 
to the inner ear through bones of the
skull<00:02:10.979> it's<00:02:11.640> used<00:02:11.819> in<00:02:11.940> google<00:02:12.209> glass<00:02:12.390> to

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
skull it's used in google glass to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.900 
skull it's used in google glass to
I<00:02:13.200> mean<00:02:13.620> maybe<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.100> can<00:02:14.220> be<00:02:14.310> applied<00:02:14.520> to

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
I mean maybe it can be applied to

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.250 
I mean maybe it can be applied to
something<00:02:15.360> less<00:02:16.110> totally<00:02:16.950> weird<00:02:17.900> like<00:02:18.900> Google

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
something less totally weird like Google

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.710 
something less totally weird like Google
glass<00:02:19.610> well<00:02:20.610> hopefully<00:02:20.850> science<00:02:21.330> gets<00:02:21.450> less

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
glass well hopefully science gets less

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.680 
glass well hopefully science gets less
totally<00:02:22.080> weird<00:02:22.260> yeah<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:23.420> outlaws<00:02:24.420> wet
