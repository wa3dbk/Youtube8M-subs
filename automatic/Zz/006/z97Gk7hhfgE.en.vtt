00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.269
 the housewives received antwerp fc twente from the benelux on Friday 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:13.949
 with not a single win in your pocket 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:18.500
 the Belgian supported by a small group of fanatic supporters 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.119
 on a bright future 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.119
 was this match is ajax side was finished 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.050
 he only plays for third place 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.480
 fc twente champion of the netherlands they compete with 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.800
 standard hatch 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.680
 for the title in the b league 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.850
 and with this liter rose with a good cross on the head 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.850
 Only later did fighting flare offside 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.410
 The result is one you hear 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.130
 in the ideal you can clearly see this 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.130
 wrongly disapproved of the holy mountain does not get it 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.620
 where no lead for ajax so 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.010
 here ahead of antwerp with the goal 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.260
 fixed a loss of books 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
 first the best chance for antwerp 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.080
 and from book with a handy 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.300
 pop ball 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.900
 about e books 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.909
 there are seventeen minutes ahead of the Belgians 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.700
 of the current work 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.200
 ajax that not too well playable 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.310
 sloppy and a lot of ball loss here with a good shot I don't feel sharp 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.120
 the boring left back today 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.120
 because the petra high residence remained on the bank with minor complaints 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.330
 but despite that ajax 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.720
 so no best game on the mat, belga prevailed 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.340
 and the best chances of being strengthened at a sli baker 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.340
 and then almost worked in their own purpose by churches 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.430
 it ends well and so cito chose alberts 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.280
 that both teams with a dead sparrow stand 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.610
 the dressing rooms and entered 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.210
 and here the second half 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.640
 with mere delleman chris the shot or a cross that is in any case 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.139
 dangerous 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:14.779
 but the ball on the roof of the goal 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:18.389
 And so it is always waiting for the first Ajax goal against Antwerp already 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:21.319
 three times with 7 0 I lost I have 9 0 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.489
 And here good work from Tessel Afternoon grabbed ballad police 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.310
 coupled with a good cross ns that parker just didn't get her foot right 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.759
 behind the ball 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.759
 but ajax for pressing on 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.399
 tenants that bakery 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:41.669
 space is on the right 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.239
 both mindy increased 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.540
 again a cross from the right side duel ajax now awake 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.269
 after she gets in with that chance of missing 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.979
 is it right now 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:54.869
 and therefore the equalizer 

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:56.359
 for ajax 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.899
 good cross off the last line 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:00.659
 from antwerpen 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.659
 and then it is for that baker only to walk in 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.469
 di rupo field 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.469
 hetero the overview tessel midday 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.669
 and she just left 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.229
 one minute after one 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:20.979
 and therefore a good phase for ajax 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:25.179
 another minute later finesse kaagman with a school our hands van der 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:26.969
 bridges 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:29.969
 and a free kick for ajax in a nice position 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:32.759
 sisters tessel afternoon 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.619
 if you will there once 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:37.529
 moreover, just srk at the ball for the catwalk 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:40.899
 ball for the line away money and that coalition 8 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:43.899
 slide laura 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.599
 and so ajax set the time in order in a few hours 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.930
 and what an excellent moment it is then I feel worried first 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.249
 competition goal for ajax 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:56.689
 ball still removed from the line 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:58.359
 and if your arms 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.469
 we do this it is also the winning one 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.399
 for ajax wins with hanging and strangling antwerp 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:06.399
 it is better than us in third place in the Benelux 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:08.569
 geert is also extremely difficult 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.579
 and who not only a 3D in the weekend and then 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.569
 in August the ball and I stand his name 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.469
 american title misery a number of distress signals 21 are usually not 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:21.659
 we can state a sint party 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.479
 what a tricky victory against the team 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.430
 the summer is going through 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.210
 they are rewarded for a few minutes so they get it 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.220
 ago we had bruges at anderlecht from the national debt 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:35.969
 and back in tonight 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.740
 it was tricky but then you have to listen to them inside tennis players 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.909
 luckily they did, we certainly don't want to teach anyone nearly a year 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.659
 can not accept to be a corpse in beach tent 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:50.309
 to people from that time at times sometimes to what do you want more information with 

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:53.919
 beyond that it is not certain in your life and the cup is paramount
