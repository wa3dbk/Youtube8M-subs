00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hi everybody if you need flash and you 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.440
 no money to buy 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.210
 original canon flash or nikon i 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.219
 just guessing that most people 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.980
 just the same canon cameras or 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.800
 nikon then i can recommend you 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.560
 good alternative for very good 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.560
 the price is interesting if you go 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.500
 there is 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.170
 I immediately confess this flash to me 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.060
 already half a year so unpacking will not 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.790
 completely natural but I will try 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.930
 restore everything as was the flash i 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:47.110
 ordered from ebay for 168 dollars 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.239
 Compared flashes canon and nikon it 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.400
 heaven and earth 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:56.140
 before that I was a flash, too, in 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:58.420
 bent 563 version I bought it without thinking 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.550
 she was manual and was not there 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.800
 autofocus lights and as it turned out 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:09.090
 autofocus light is the most necessary 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.090
 for me, let's unpack 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:19.570
 all that came out of such bags 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:22.229
 pimply so there was some kind of it 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.450
 waste paper english and chinese 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:31.320
 Of course I did not read this trash we all 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:34.860
 empty box leave it here so 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.500
 here is such a case 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.100
 as i know canon flashes are the same 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.560
 covers 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:48.690
 Well, in general, this flash is very strong 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:52.690
 similar to canon speedlite 580 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:58.210
 although they all differ in this 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.890
 the bags here still have a stand then 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.900
 have to flash can be q was somewhere 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.900
 put on 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.340
 flash itself of course when i bought it 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.370
 there are still film ghouls 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.520
 Well, since I have it for half a year, then they 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:29.790
 no, this is how it is installed 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:33.540
 wait unscrew this thing i 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.870
 You can set honestly I say this 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:44.610
 not used at all ever 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:47.400
 here so well everything is nothing here so this 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.700
 I have a version for canon as it has for 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.590
 Nikon, too, but different here 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.810
 contact so when choosing be 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:02.550
 Careful and buy for your cat about 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:05.670
 so here still aha but here here 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:09.209
 lay a powder against moisture and some 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.580
 thing is uninteresting and now the most 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.900
 the main thing when you buy a flash is not 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.920
 forget what else you need 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.230
 batteries and chargers for them i 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.310
 Immediately did not think about it spent all 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.370
 flash money 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:28.560
 she came to experience it 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:32.100
 spend about 40 more dollars i can 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:39.739
 I recommend you what I bought 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:42.510
 gp powerbank m520 charger 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.310
 I chose this particular charger 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.670
 because bundled with it were going 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:55.040
 2500 milliampere batteries 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:57.930
 although if you look closely here it is written 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.910
 2450 but can they really 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.489
 a little less but still it was 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.350
 the best option is not the easiest 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.959
 charger because sense 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.239
 buy idle i don't see because 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.290
 the batteries quickly deteriorate here 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.299
 there is still some 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.700
 microprocessor which regulates 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.570
 charging the battery and so I would give you 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.700
 also recommended to take this charger 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.010
 Still, the battery price is high 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.260
 and here they were going well and 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.850
 accordingly it turns out cheaper 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.850
 let's install batteries flash 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:45.510
 installation is very easy and 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:50.350
 just a cop and everything is ready to turn on 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:52.150
 inclusion is made by holding so 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.610
 what about this flash i can say myself 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.350
 but there is a synchronization system well 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.650
 that is, through these contacts 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.440
 it syncs with your camera and 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:07.150
 it can be controlled directly from the camera Well 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:09.810
 here, like autofocus lights 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:13.410
 that is, when photographing in the dark 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.410
 she will highlight 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.970
 autofocus 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.200
 Well, in the camera you can normally 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:27.190
 focus here is that there is still 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:29.380
 there is a business card here but with 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:35.470
 photographing don't know in clubs she 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:37.480
 I really need some for me here 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.280
 settings I basically nothing much 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:44.050
 I can use the right detailed flash 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.810
 so what else to tell you as for me 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.790
 This is perfect for beginners. 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.920
 photographers so for people who 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.560
 do it professionally yet 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.530
 spend big money on the original 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.200
 outbreaks are not entirely reasonable because she 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.480
 lets out very worthy things forgot you 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.300
 say about the swivel head that is 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:09.640
 it can be turned in all directions 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:16.330
 but it is fixed well, that is very 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:22.020
 convenient here so buy these 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:22.020
 flashes will be happy with everything for now 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:40.500
 and I also have a Fedorov rezinochka 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:45.590
 she is so cool with her video right away 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.590
 looks better probably stay with her
