this<00:00:15.610> condenser<00:00:16.240> right<00:00:16.449> here<00:00:16.869> and<00:00:17.440> a<00:00:17.560> fan<00:00:17.859> now

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.190 
this condenser right here and a fan now

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.160 
this condenser right here and a fan now
pushes<00:00:18.699> that<00:00:18.910> heat<00:00:19.150> up<00:00:19.359> and<00:00:19.869> away<00:00:20.109> to

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
pushes that heat up and away to

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.040 
pushes that heat up and away to
atmosphere<00:00:20.890> now<00:00:21.609> in<00:00:21.760> this<00:00:21.880> case<00:00:22.150> heat<00:00:22.630> is

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
atmosphere now in this case heat is

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.380 
atmosphere now in this case heat is
energy<00:00:23.380> that<00:00:23.830> is<00:00:23.980> wasted<00:00:24.340> today<00:00:25.210> we're

with a pool I love mine but what I love
about<00:00:39.940> yours<00:00:40.390> particularly<00:00:40.989> it's<00:00:41.590> a<00:00:41.710> perfect

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
about yours particularly it's a perfect

about yours particularly it's a perfect
candidate<00:00:42.610> for<00:00:42.640> a<00:00:42.850> system<00:00:43.149> that<00:00:43.239> can<00:00:43.360> take<00:00:43.570> the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
candidate for a system that can take the

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.630 
candidate for a system that can take the
heat<00:00:43.989> from<00:00:44.140> the<00:00:44.290> air<00:00:44.379> conditioner<00:00:44.890> and<00:00:45.039> put<00:00:45.550> it

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
heat from the air conditioner and put it

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.459 
heat from the air conditioner and put it
into<00:00:45.789> the<00:00:45.879> pool<00:00:46.000> water<00:00:46.270> well<00:00:47.020> that<00:00:47.260> would<00:00:47.440> be

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
into the pool water well that would be

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.440 
into the pool water well that would be
great<00:00:47.829> because<00:00:48.399> honestly<00:00:48.910> we've<00:00:49.090> had<00:00:49.239> a<00:00:49.270> hard

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
great because honestly we've had a hard

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.029 
great because honestly we've had a hard
time<00:00:49.539> keeping<00:00:49.899> this<00:00:50.110> pool<00:00:50.350> warm<00:00:50.620> enough

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
time keeping this pool warm enough

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.520 
time keeping this pool warm enough
it's<00:00:51.280> very<00:00:51.520> shady<00:00:51.850> back<00:00:52.149> here<00:00:52.480> we<00:00:53.140> don't<00:00:53.320> get<00:00:53.469> a

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
it's very shady back here we don't get a

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.410 
it's very shady back here we don't get a
lot<00:00:53.649> of<00:00:53.770> sunlight<00:00:54.039> I<00:00:54.430> researched<00:00:55.180> other

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
lot of sunlight I researched other

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.840 
lot of sunlight I researched other
systems<00:00:55.930> such<00:00:56.260> as<00:00:56.289> wood<00:00:56.530> boilers<00:00:57.070> and<00:00:57.399> frankly

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
systems such as wood boilers and frankly

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.520 
systems such as wood boilers and frankly
we<00:00:57.940> don't<00:00:58.030> have<00:00:58.180> south-facing<00:00:58.420> roof<00:00:58.930> so<00:00:59.410> we

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
we don't have south-facing roof so we

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.660 
we don't have south-facing roof so we
wouldn't<00:00:59.710> be<00:00:59.800> a<00:00:59.859> good<00:01:00.010> candidate<00:01:00.340> for<00:01:00.399> solar

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
wouldn't be a good candidate for solar

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.099 
wouldn't be a good candidate for solar
well<00:01:01.239> let<00:01:01.359> me<00:01:01.390> show<00:01:01.539> you<00:01:01.600> how<00:01:01.719> this<00:01:01.899> system

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
well let me show you how this system

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.219 
well let me show you how this system
works<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.850> showed<00:01:04.089> us<00:01:04.210> two<00:01:04.330> Lorenzo<00:01:04.780> Olsen

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
works that showed us two Lorenzo Olsen

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.140 
works that showed us two Lorenzo Olsen
right<00:01:05.379> so<00:01:05.560> here<00:01:05.770> is<00:01:05.799> your<00:01:06.070> pool<00:01:06.340> filter<00:01:06.790> system

we<00:01:34.600> want<00:01:34.780> to<00:01:34.869> get<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.170> heat<00:01:35.350> energy<00:01:35.530> from<00:01:35.740> that

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
we want to get the heat energy from that

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.160 
we want to get the heat energy from that
pipe<00:01:36.340> actually<00:01:36.850> into<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:37.600> water<00:01:37.869> and<00:01:38.020> it's

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
pipe actually into the water and it's

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.230 
pipe actually into the water and it's
down<00:01:38.350> inside<00:01:38.650> here<00:01:38.920> so<00:01:39.460> for<00:01:39.640> that<00:01:39.729> is<00:01:39.939> a<00:01:40.000> pretty

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
down inside here so for that is a pretty

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.940 
down inside here so for that is a pretty
ingenious<00:01:40.689> invention<00:01:41.439> that's<00:01:41.619> actually<00:01:41.920> a

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
ingenious invention that's actually a

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.859 
ingenious invention that's actually a
heat<00:01:42.100> exchanger<00:01:42.579> made<00:01:42.850> exactly<00:01:43.479> for<00:01:43.600> this

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.080 
water from the pool will come in through
a<00:01:47.890> pipe<00:01:48.130> right<00:01:48.399> here<00:01:48.579> that<00:01:48.700> will<00:01:48.790> go<00:01:48.880> down<00:01:49.060> to

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
a pipe right here that will go down to

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.120 
a pipe right here that will go down to
the<00:01:49.329> bottom<00:01:49.570> of<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.689> cannister<00:01:50.229> the<00:01:50.920> pool

the bottom of the cannister the pool

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.740 
the bottom of the cannister the pool
water<00:01:51.340> will<00:01:51.520> leave<00:01:51.759> through<00:01:52.149> this<00:01:52.270> pipe<00:01:52.540> and

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
water will leave through this pipe and

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.810 
water will leave through this pipe and
go<00:01:52.840> back<00:01:53.049> to<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.350> pool<00:01:53.500> itself<00:01:53.920> there's<00:01:54.729> a

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
go back to the pool itself there's a

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.069 
go back to the pool itself there's a
couple<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.149> refrigerant<00:01:55.600> lines<00:01:55.750> right<00:01:56.049> here

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
couple of refrigerant lines right here

water<00:02:06.640> now<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.119> does<00:02:07.509> a<00:02:07.540> couple<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:07.930> things

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
water now that does a couple of things

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.719 
water now that does a couple of things
one<00:02:08.770> is<00:02:08.800> going<00:02:09.039> to<00:02:09.099> heat<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.310> pool<00:02:09.489> water

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
one is going to heat the pool water

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.430 
one is going to heat the pool water
which<00:02:09.940> is<00:02:10.060> great<00:02:10.179> for<00:02:10.420> you<00:02:10.569> but<00:02:10.869> also<00:02:11.080> is<00:02:11.319> going

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
which is great for you but also is going

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.970 
which is great for you but also is going
to<00:02:11.530> make<00:02:11.709> the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
to make the

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.690

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
conditioner run more efficiently great

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.649 
conditioner run more efficiently great
all<00:02:15.700> right<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:15.940> our<00:02:15.970> plumbing<00:02:16.330> connections

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
all right so our plumbing connections

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.000 
all right so our plumbing connections
going<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.870> start<00:02:17.140> with<00:02:17.409> the<00:02:17.530> pool<00:02:17.769> water

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
going to start with the pool water

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.500 
going to start with the pool water
connections<00:02:18.549> to<00:02:18.670> our<00:02:18.700> eat<00:02:18.940> exchanger

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
connections to our eat exchanger

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.170 
connections to our eat exchanger
I've<00:02:19.780> cut<00:02:20.019> away<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.349> existing<00:02:20.769> PVC<00:02:21.340> now<00:02:22.000> this

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
I've cut away the existing PVC now this

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.119 
I've cut away the existing PVC now this
system<00:02:22.569> needs<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.900> be<00:02:22.959> able<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.379> monitor<00:02:23.650> the

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
system needs to be able to monitor the

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.470 
system needs to be able to monitor the
temperature<00:02:24.340> that's<00:02:24.760> in<00:02:24.909> the<00:02:25.000> pool

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
temperature that's in the pool

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.180 
temperature that's in the pool
so<00:02:25.930> our<00:02:26.019> first<00:02:26.230> fitting<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:26.709> going<00:02:26.739> to<00:02:26.920> be<00:02:27.040> this

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
so our first fitting is going to be this

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.680 
so our first fitting is going to be this
t<00:02:27.430> fitting<00:02:27.730> right<00:02:27.909> here<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.239> can<00:02:28.390> see<00:02:28.510> there's

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
t fitting right here you can see there's

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.729 
t fitting right here you can see there's

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.839 
this together so now you can see the
path<00:03:08.140> of<00:03:08.319> the<00:03:08.410> water<00:03:08.620> leaves<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.250> filter<00:03:09.670> goes

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
path of the water leaves the filter goes

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.479 
path of the water leaves the filter goes
by<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.120> sensor<00:03:10.810> goes<00:03:11.470> down<00:03:11.769> into<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:12.310> heat

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
by the sensor goes down into the heat

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.580 
by the sensor goes down into the heat
exchanger<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:13.150> heated<00:03:13.450> water<00:03:13.480> leaves<00:03:14.019> from

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
exchanger the heated water leaves from

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.949 
exchanger the heated water leaves from
here<00:03:14.650> it<00:03:15.160> goes<00:03:15.310> back<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.760> pool<00:03:15.940> so<00:03:16.750> now<00:03:16.900> we

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
here it goes back to the pool so now we

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.449 
here it goes back to the pool so now we
can<00:03:17.139> glue<00:03:17.349> up<00:03:17.470> these<00:03:17.620> fittings<00:03:20.190> I'll<00:03:21.190> put<00:03:21.430> a

can glue up these fittings I'll put a

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.940 
can glue up these fittings I'll put a

connections have been made the plumbing
connections<00:05:15.660> right<00:05:15.870> here

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
connections right here

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.860 
connections right here
relation<00:05:17.370> we've<00:05:17.490> got<00:05:17.669> it<00:05:17.760> water<00:05:18.030> is<00:05:18.510> a<00:05:18.540> really

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
relation we've got it water is a really

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.840 
relation we've got it water is a really
good<00:05:19.020> time<00:05:19.200> to<00:05:19.290> go<00:05:19.410> over<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:19.650> whole<00:05:19.770> system<00:05:20.250> so

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
good time to go over the whole system so

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.870 
good time to go over the whole system so
now<00:05:21.060> whenever<00:05:21.390> this<00:05:21.840> air<00:05:22.050> conditioner<00:05:22.560> calls

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
now whenever this air conditioner calls

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.400 
now whenever this air conditioner calls
its<00:05:23.880> going<00:05:24.030> to<00:05:24.120> check<00:05:24.360> first<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:24.990> temperature

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
its going to check first the temperature

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.510 
its going to check first the temperature
of<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:25.530> pool<00:05:25.740> to<00:05:25.919> see<00:05:26.070> if<00:05:26.160> it<00:05:26.220> needs<00:05:26.370> to<00:05:26.430> be

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
of the pool to see if it needs to be

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.000 
of the pool to see if it needs to be
heated<00:05:26.700> if<00:05:26.940> it<00:05:27.270> doesn't<00:05:27.810> then<00:05:28.470> what<00:05:28.620> happens

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
heated if it doesn't then what happens

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.710 
heated if it doesn't then what happens
is<00:05:29.130> the<00:05:29.250> basic<00:05:29.640> refrigeration<00:05:30.270> cycle<00:05:30.600> that's

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
is the basic refrigeration cycle that's

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.750 
is the basic refrigeration cycle that's
always<00:05:31.080> been<00:05:31.260> here<00:05:31.530> that<00:05:32.220> refrigerant<00:05:32.640> comes

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
always been here that refrigerant comes

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.610 
always been here that refrigerant comes
down<00:05:32.970> here<00:05:33.180> but<00:05:33.300> it<00:05:33.360> does<00:05:33.480> one<00:05:33.780> thing<00:05:34.140> it<00:05:34.410> takes

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
down here but it does one thing it takes

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.130 
down here but it does one thing it takes
a<00:05:34.740> little<00:05:34.890> detour<00:05:35.340> out<00:05:35.460> through<00:05:35.669> the<00:05:35.760> back<00:05:36.140> see

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
a little detour out through the back see

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.020 
a little detour out through the back see
it<00:05:37.260> comes<00:05:37.410> right<00:05:37.650> up<00:05:37.770> through<00:05:37.950> here<00:05:38.280> and<00:05:38.460> it

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
it comes right up through here and it

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.550 
it comes right up through here and it
goes<00:05:39.180> to<00:05:39.360> this<00:05:39.480> now<00:05:39.690> it's<00:05:39.870> a<00:05:39.960> three-way

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
goes to this now it's a three-way

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.650 
goes to this now it's a three-way
diverting<00:05:41.130> valve<00:05:41.340> and<00:05:41.580> in<00:05:42.180> this<00:05:42.330> mode<00:05:42.630> the

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
diverting valve and in this mode the

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.540 
diverting valve and in this mode the
refrigerant<00:05:43.320> comes<00:05:43.470> right<00:05:43.710> through<00:05:43.740> back<00:05:44.520> to

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
refrigerant comes right through back to

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.380 
refrigerant comes right through back to
the<00:05:44.820> condenser

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
the condenser

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.510 
the condenser
now<00:05:45.930> that<00:05:46.110> condenser<00:05:46.530> comes<00:05:46.740> on<00:05:46.950> the<00:05:47.340> fan

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
now that condenser comes on the fan

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.920 
now that condenser comes on the fan
comes<00:05:47.790> on<00:05:47.910> and<00:05:48.090> dumps<00:05:48.390> heat<00:05:48.540> all<00:05:48.690> it's<00:05:48.810> like

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
comes on and dumps heat all it's like

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.590 
comes on and dumps heat all it's like
just<00:05:49.110> like<00:05:49.169> it<00:05:49.320> always<00:05:49.470> did<00:05:49.740> but<00:05:50.610> if<00:05:51.120> the<00:05:51.330> pool

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
just like it always did but if the pool

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.020 
just like it always did but if the pool
says<00:05:51.990> item<00:05:52.650> temperature<00:05:53.130> it'll<00:05:53.400> send<00:05:53.880> a

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
says item temperature it'll send a

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.080 
says item temperature it'll send a
signal<00:05:54.060> over<00:05:54.600> here<00:05:55.020> and<00:05:55.400> this<00:05:56.400> valve<00:05:56.730> will

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
signal over here and this valve will

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.360 
signal over here and this valve will
close<00:05:57.300> this<00:05:57.750> port<00:05:58.050> and<00:05:58.260> instead<00:05:59.220> the

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
close this port and instead the

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
close this port and instead the
refrigerant<00:05:59.760> will<00:05:59.850> come<00:06:00.030> straight<00:06:00.150> through

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
refrigerant will come straight through

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.930 
refrigerant will come straight through
right<00:06:01.169> here

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
right here

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.730 
right here
it's<00:06:02.120> a<00:06:02.240> hot<00:06:02.450> gas<00:06:02.660> right<00:06:02.990> now<00:06:03.020> coming<00:06:03.560> through

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
it's a hot gas right now coming through

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.680 
it's a hot gas right now coming through
here<00:06:03.950> coming<00:06:04.280> through<00:06:04.400> here<00:06:04.670> down<00:06:05.300> through

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
here coming through here down through

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.450 
here coming through here down through
this<00:06:05.840> heat<00:06:06.020> exchanger<00:06:06.050> it's<00:06:07.040> going<00:06:07.250> to<00:06:07.310> heat

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
this heat exchanger it's going to heat

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.670 
this heat exchanger it's going to heat
up<00:06:07.490> the<00:06:07.730> pool<00:06:07.910> water<00:06:08.120> right<00:06:08.360> here<00:06:08.650> become<00:06:09.650> a

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
up the pool water right here become a

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.860 
up the pool water right here become a
little<00:06:09.980> bit<00:06:10.100> cooler<00:06:10.310> out<00:06:10.520> here<00:06:10.910> go<00:06:11.420> back<00:06:11.660> into

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
little bit cooler out here go back into

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.510 
little bit cooler out here go back into
the<00:06:11.990> house<00:06:12.170> picks<00:06:12.620> up<00:06:12.800> more<00:06:13.070> heat<00:06:13.280> in<00:06:13.430> the
