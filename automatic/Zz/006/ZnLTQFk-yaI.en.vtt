finally just coming out now but I

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:15.799 
finally just coming out now but I
thought<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.089> would<00:00:15.330> make<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.509> great

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
thought that would make a great

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.689 
thought that would make a great
Christmas<00:00:16.379> gift<00:00:16.440> or<00:00:16.770> even<00:00:17.340> just<00:00:17.490> for<00:00:17.550> your

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
self or home decor piece so I figured

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.349
