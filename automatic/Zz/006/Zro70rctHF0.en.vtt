00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.010
 good I'm warcraft stimulus for 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.280
 explain how to get this pet 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.679
 what is the spirit of the boar 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.690
 is a pet that is unique is not uncommon 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.369
 but it only comes out in one place with this 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.210
 model saas and half ghost with 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.210
 pretty cool armor and they're going to 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.660
 remove in the 6.0 patch comes out a 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.080
 dungeon 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.220
 in quality in the southern wastelands just 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.280
 here where I shined 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:39.809
 what are the coordinates more or less 41 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.809
 point 25 94 points 69 the entrance 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.660
 all right 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.380
 the path that goes down the wastelands is 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.440
 is here 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.590
 this cave with the roots is to the 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.520
 dungeon only has one difficulty 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:01.780
 level scripting 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:05.030
 20 Aug 30 under the pet can leave 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:09.170
 from the level of you 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.590
 from 24 28 to 19 24 you can get to pick it up 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.149
 if he helps someone 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.700
 well once inside the dungeon 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:18.960
 we have to go to this boss here who 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.960
 it is bad spine agent 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.310
 it is according to the first first path it 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.760
 for 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.840
 go to the right and 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.100
 in the background hardly 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.509
 and here as a commodore he keeps swimming or 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.509
 earning the same keeps killing 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.870
 it's right over here if you see it but 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.760
 I'm not going to hit the time because we're going to 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.920
 roll 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.860
 do not kill the boss 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.420
 I'm constantly afraid of removing the 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.430
 pet because lately he does what 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.299
 wants 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.299
 here 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.950
 we have followed the path below 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.819
 then let's go to the twig this is 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:16.079
 to the left for the booths quite 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.079
 it comes from the most complicated 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.290
 and it was already just behind is the forest 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.290
 is there right here 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.599
 now what they do 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.470
 by selecting you who the while 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.069
 it's very important for you to jump two 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.569
 pigs 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:51.010
 you have to hit a blow at least one 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.010
 so not to kill him 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.409
 the equipment to make it faster 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.810
 here nothing you have to leave us nothing 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.670
 anything and more of this face that 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.670
 they have a thousand pro that jump and you can kill 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:20.250
 once we are in perotti there with 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.070
 a lot of love and care 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.800
 we take off a blow is no longer invoked 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.630
 our boar we select it with 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.380
 lots of love 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.450
 and domesticated as you can see no 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.500
 happens na has 1000 life has left me 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.150
 25 we already have the boar spirit that 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.560
 is the pet that will remove the patch 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.210
 6.0 and those who have it are left and 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.570
 those who do not have it will not be able to 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.310
 that's why the video is bad because 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.030
 I said it now, the 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.880
 pet at that time I already have two 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.319
 and so for the people who had me 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.850
 asked in another video had explained 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.140
 that they were going to remove these pets and 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.470
 you know how you get 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.540
 to that bad thorn to remember right here 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.120
 where am I now the entrance doing 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.940
 this way and so if you get it before 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.050
 of the 6.0 patch you will have it 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.480
 pet that is no longer going to be able 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.730
 get with a few other things 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.769
 and nothing I hope that the video will serve you or 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.769
 like and tomorrow until tomorrow
