00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.150
 minerals vitamins that act as 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.489
 antioxidants and a lot of fatty acids 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.320

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.530
 low density that usually are those 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:47.160

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.829
 what then goes to bring you to risk 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.850

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.850
 it does very well 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.160
 to get about a liter of milk of 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:07.870
 coco we will need a coconut with 350 g of 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.800
 pulp dumped in about 750 ml of 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.320
 fresh water 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.840

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.210
 fault of the coconut in order to fatigue the 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.610
 less possible and the extractor with a 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.610
 extractor we are going to squeeze the milk 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.610
 from the coconut, gradually adding the water 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.070
 let's add the advanced water 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:50.070
 inside the pulp that came out of the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.920
 the extractor the beautiful morning e 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.380
 let's go for a second draw 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.170
 so we got a liter of milk 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.860
 coconut that is extremely good e 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.860
