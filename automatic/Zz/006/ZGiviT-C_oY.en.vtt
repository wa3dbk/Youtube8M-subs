working on this foot of my life and I'm
maybe<00:00:16.379> 63<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:19.039> have<00:00:20.039> an<00:00:20.250> engine<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.689> has<00:00:21.900> been

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
maybe 63 I have an engine that has been

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.120 
maybe 63 I have an engine that has been
invented<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.430> has<00:00:24.269> been<00:00:24.570> tightened<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.590> has

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
invented and has been tightened and has

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.679 
invented and has been tightened and has
been<00:00:26.429> painted<00:00:27.800> affordability

sustainability and solution to pollution

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.770 
sustainability and solution to pollution
I<00:00:34.160> think<00:00:35.160> these<00:00:35.460> are<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.850> three<00:00:36.330> most

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
I think these are the three most

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.730 
I think these are the three most
important<00:00:37.650> benefits<00:00:38.720> this<00:00:39.720> engine<00:00:40.320> she<00:00:40.560> has

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.740 
important benefits this engine she has

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.090 
important benefits this engine she has
been<00:00:41.100> designed<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:42.000> save<00:00:42.300> energy<00:00:42.680> we<00:00:43.680> could<00:00:43.920> be

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
been designed to save energy we could be

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.670 
been designed to save energy we could be
running<00:00:44.310> that<00:00:44.730> ancient<00:00:45.270> with<00:00:45.450> petrol<00:00:45.990> but<00:00:46.650> I

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
running that ancient with petrol but I

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.580 
running that ancient with petrol but I
choose<00:00:47.160> not<00:00:47.490> to<00:00:47.550> do<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.150> because<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.290> wanted

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
choose not to do that because I wanted

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.700 
choose not to do that because I wanted
to<00:00:49.800> do<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.670> environmental<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.870> wanted<00:00:52.500> to

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
to do the environmental I wanted to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.830 
to do the environmental I wanted to
concentrate<00:00:53.010> more<00:00:53.700> to<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.150> environmental

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
concentrate more to the environmental

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.920 
concentrate more to the environmental
side<00:00:55.080> off<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.340> think<00:00:56.700> it's<00:00:56.880> a<00:00:57.030> good<00:00:57.300> start

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
side off and I think it's a good start

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.400 
side off and I think it's a good start
let<00:00:58.650> the<00:00:58.920> heavy<00:00:59.190> vehicle<00:00:59.510> let<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.750> shape<00:01:01.050> let

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
let the heavy vehicle let this shape let

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.410 
let the heavy vehicle let this shape let
the<00:01:01.590> Aeroplan<00:01:02.160> continue<00:01:02.790> to<00:01:02.970> running<00:01:03.300> with

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the Aeroplan continue to running with

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.890 
the Aeroplan continue to running with
petrol<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.890> let<00:01:05.100> us<00:01:05.129> keep<00:01:05.850> discussing<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
petrol but let us keep discussing the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.830 
petrol but let us keep discussing the
city<00:01:07.200> without<00:01:07.920> polluting<00:01:08.400> these<00:01:08.910> wooden<00:01:09.360> arts

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
city without polluting these wooden arts

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.720 
city without polluting these wooden arts
we<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:10.290> all<00:01:10.500> these<00:01:10.710> things<00:01:12.350> it's<00:01:13.350> about<00:01:13.730> four

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
we do all these things it's about four

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.700 
we do all these things it's about four
times<00:01:15.030> more<00:01:15.240> efficient<00:01:15.900> than<00:01:16.110> existing

piston model and five times more

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.360 
piston model and five times more

efficient then by others rotary it's a
rotary<00:01:23.640> system<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.600> compact<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.240> has<00:01:27.240> very

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
rotary system it's compact and has very

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.870 
rotary system it's compact and has very
few<00:01:27.780> components<00:01:28.260> all<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.980> making<00:01:29.610> my

use much too much spice to park a car
that's<00:02:59.130> crazy

that's crazy

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
say we said so many parts when we only

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.190

you can call the other side of the world
the<00:04:14.100> path<00:04:14.370> it's<00:04:14.670> very<00:04:14.970> time<00:04:15.420> I<00:04:15.450> use<00:04:15.900> very<00:04:16.200> small

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
the path it's very time I use very small

the path it's very time I use very small
amount<00:04:16.980> of<00:04:17.100> energy<00:04:17.700> so<00:04:18.600> there<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:19.739> go<00:04:19.950> an

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
amount of energy so there you go an

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
you know so what I am saying to you is

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.460 
you know so what I am saying to you is
this<00:04:33.230> with<00:04:34.230> our<00:04:34.470> system<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:36.300> energy<00:04:36.960> we

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
this with our system the energy we

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.440 
this with our system the energy we
actually<00:04:38.460> use<00:04:38.640> today<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.180> power<00:04:39.750> one<00:04:40.140> couch<00:04:41.450> we

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
actually use today to power one couch we

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.200 
actually use today to power one couch we
can<00:04:42.780> actually<00:04:43.350> power<00:04:44.030> 100,000

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
can actually power 100,000

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.540 
can actually power 100,000
future<00:04:45.600> we<00:04:45.720> determined<00:04:46.289> of<00:04:46.410> energy<00:04:48.020> the<00:04:49.550> good

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
future we determined of energy the good

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.589 
future we determined of energy the good
part<00:04:51.090> about<00:04:51.389> petrol<00:04:52.400> which<00:04:53.400> Nations<00:04:54.060> even<00:04:54.240> to

part about petrol which Nations even to

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:58.570 
part about petrol which Nations even to
us<00:04:54.780> is<00:04:55.080> so<00:04:55.410> dense<00:04:55.740> in<00:04:56.009> energy<00:04:56.580> density<00:04:57.560> right

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
us is so dense in energy density right

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.700 
us is so dense in energy density right
but<00:04:59.580> it's<00:04:59.819> also<00:05:00.090> so<00:05:00.539> harmful<00:05:01.289> to<00:05:01.560> the

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
but it's also so harmful to the

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.270 
but it's also so harmful to the
environment<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:02.750> you<00:05:03.750> know<00:05:03.960> and<00:05:04.259> I<00:05:04.710> really

don't see the benefits I really don't
see<00:05:08.789> the<00:05:08.910> minute<00:05:09.449> to<00:05:09.690> move<00:05:09.930> away<00:05:10.110> from<00:05:10.319> that

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
see the minute to move away from that

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.529

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.230 
it's the solution I am 100% sure the
engine<00:05:28.050> is<00:05:28.199> part<00:05:28.530> of<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:29.009> solution<00:05:29.220> at<00:05:29.789> least

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
engine is part of the solution at least

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.620 
engine is part of the solution at least
part<00:05:30.570> of<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:30.960> solution
