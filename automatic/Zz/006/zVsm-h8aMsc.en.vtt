the on the bed of the truck now this is
a<00:00:36.090> three-piece<00:00:36.989> component<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.460> can

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
a three-piece component that you can

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.420 
a three-piece component that you can
mount<00:00:38.879> any<00:00:39.809> bracket<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.860> decide<00:00:41.250> to

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
mount any bracket that you decide to

mount any bracket that you decide to
mount<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.059> here<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.420> shows<00:00:42.629> mounting<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.350> ski

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
mount to it here it shows mounting a ski

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.700 
mount to it here it shows mounting a ski
rack<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.629> we'll<00:00:45.629> fast<00:00:45.930> forward<00:00:46.110> to

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
rack to it and we'll fast forward to

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.690 
rack to it and we'll fast forward to
actually<00:00:47.129> adjusting<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:49.190> bracket<00:00:50.190> moving<00:00:50.579> it

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
actually adjusting the bracket moving it

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.670 
actually adjusting the bracket moving it
forward<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.870> get<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.199> bindings

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
forward so that you can get the bindings

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.500 
forward so that you can get the bindings
close<00:00:53.039> enough<00:00:53.370> together<00:00:53.520> says<00:00:54.030> no<00:00:54.180> one<00:00:54.329> can

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
close enough together says no one can

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.930 
close enough together says no one can
slide<00:00:54.809> them<00:00:55.020> out<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> ski<00:00:55.739> rack<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.789> it's

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
slide them out of the ski rack so it's

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.310 
slide them out of the ski rack so it's
adjustable<00:00:57.420> forward<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.260> aft<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.170> can

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
adjustable forward and aft and you can

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.929 
adjustable forward and aft and you can
decide<00:01:04.619> how<00:01:04.650> big<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.189> rack<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.549> want<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.790> put

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
decide how big of a rack you want to put

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.880 
decide how big of a rack you want to put
on<00:01:06.090> here<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> small<00:01:07.080> old<00:01:07.350> one<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.680> I

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
on here this is a small old one that I

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.050 
on here this is a small old one that I
have<00:01:08.100> putting<00:01:09.000> one<00:01:09.180> set<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.659> fatties<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.560> it

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
have putting one set of fatties on it

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.850 
have putting one set of fatties on it
moving<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> other<00:01:12.479> side<00:01:12.869> going<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.710> show<00:01:13.830> a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
moving to the other side going to show a

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.280 
moving to the other side going to show a
little<00:01:14.070> different<00:01:14.549> version<00:01:15.060> here<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:16.140> can

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
little different version here you can

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.510 
little different version here you can
actually<00:01:16.590> mount<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.460> rear<00:01:18.150> mount<00:01:18.450> facing<00:01:19.049> aft

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
actually mount the rear mount facing aft

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.999 
actually mount the rear mount facing aft
so<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.060> extend<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.900> rack<00:01:22.110> toward

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
so that you can extend the rack toward

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.340 
so that you can extend the rack toward
the<00:01:23.159> rear<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.580> truck<00:01:23.970> for<00:01:24.900> putting<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.320> a
