butterfly knife here and what appears to

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.680 
butterfly knife here and what appears to
be<00:02:39.440> like<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.650> butterfly<00:02:40.130> sword<00:02:40.460> you<00:02:41.390> can<00:02:41.570> see

be like a butterfly sword you can see
the<00:02:41.780> handle<00:02:42.080> looks<00:02:42.260> very<00:02:42.950> similar<00:02:43.130> to<00:02:43.310> his

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
the handle looks very similar to his

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.420 
the handle looks very similar to his
butterfly<00:02:43.910> knife<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.980> I'm<00:02:46.100> wondering<00:02:46.370> if

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
butterfly knife and I'm wondering if

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.860

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
maybe this is his Street weapon that

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.600 
maybe this is his Street weapon that
then<00:02:48.020> mutates<00:02:48.380> into<00:02:48.560> this<00:02:48.830> as<00:02:49.130> part<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:49.460> his

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
then mutates into this as part of his

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.710 
then mutates into this as part of his
transformation<00:02:50.150> I<00:02:50.360> don't<00:02:50.480> know<00:02:50.540> why<00:02:50.660> the

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
transformation I don't know why the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.660 
transformation I don't know why the
sword<00:02:51.080> will<00:02:51.170> mutate<00:02:51.500> but<00:02:51.770> but<00:02:52.310> he<00:02:52.370> just<00:02:52.460> come

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
sword will mutate but but he just come
