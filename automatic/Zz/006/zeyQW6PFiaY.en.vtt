00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.140
 d 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.650
 after that halloween from the point of 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.270
 view of the confectionery is crazy and 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.430
 you have from the slope more gore in 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.400
 that people make good from hearts 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.010
 edible up behind all sweet 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.390
 until the cuca or more tender version 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.220
 that that I like to me that is a bit 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.989
 well and if with ghosts with 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.460
 chocolate brownies and that are 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.770
 implement I hope you are not at 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.420
 edge with blood out there and got 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.770
 enter so let's start melting 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.230
 the butter with the chocolate in a 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.910
 saucepan 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.710
 the best of these recipes that only 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.829
 you need a casserole to do anything 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.829
 plus 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.969
 i 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.220
 once melted we add the eggs and 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.220
 we beat very well 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.740
 we add the sugar 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.740
 finally we add the cocoa 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.740
 and the flour previously sieved 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.920
 Y 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.180
 We put the dough in the mold and bake 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.100
 about 25 minutes at 180 degrees while 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.920
 they reopen and we're going to prepare the mass of 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.000
 cookies for our tombs we mix 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.000
 butter with sugar 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.160
 we add an egg 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.090
 we add the flour 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.560
 we take half of the dough and the 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.560
 we throw between two oven papers 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.500
 We cooled half an hour or until 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.240
 It is very hard while we will cut it 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.770
 I already have the baked brownie chilling 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.540
 it's here inside the mold and what I'm going to 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.190
 to do is to prepare the desire 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.230
 Swiss meringue we started by winning 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.240
 let's heat the cream until 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.810
 boil when it boils we throw it on the 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.810
 hot chocolate 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.290
 while tempering a little the ganas 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.550
 let's prepare the ghosts 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.900
 We heat the egg whites with bain-marie 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.730
 the sugar until the 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.000
 sugar and then we assembled it on the verge of 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.000
 snow 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.060
 we only need to do the ghosts 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:54.630
 with a round mouthpiece and we bake them 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.630
 about 60 minutes at 90 degrees in the oven 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.650
 cut our cookies and bake them 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.819
 12 minutes at 180 degrees and what else I 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.620
 like halloween is when they come 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.599
 children to ask for sweets another afternoon because 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.040
 normally here I always have things 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.319
 So, well, I'm giving you 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.430
 cupcakes are'm giving candy 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.849
 what you have and the truth is that they do 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.849
 delusion 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.689
 to finish we are going to enlarge 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.790
 on the brownie and for over a 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.680
 sobriety crushed after only us 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.870
 lack to paint with black coloring the 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.269
 riff words and eyes in those 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.860
 ghosts and nothing when placing everything 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.730
 our brown and we already have a cemetery 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.730
 very delicious
