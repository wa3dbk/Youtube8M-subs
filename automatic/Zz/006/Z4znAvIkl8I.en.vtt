00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
you guys have done the cupcakes I have a

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:35.879 
you guys have done the cupcakes I have a
little<00:04:34.599> bit<00:04:34.809> more<00:04:34.929> icing<00:04:35.289> leftover<00:04:35.739> than<00:04:35.860> I

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
little bit more icing leftover than I

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.559 
little bit more icing leftover than I
thought<00:04:36.099> but<00:04:36.610> here<00:04:36.819> they<00:04:36.939> are<00:04:36.969> I<00:04:37.119> think<00:04:37.360> they

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:37.569 
thought but here they are I think they

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.509 
thought but here they are I think they
turned<00:04:37.779> out<00:04:37.959> pretty<00:04:38.199> well<00:04:38.379> other<00:04:38.860> than<00:04:39.009> than

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:39.519 
turned out pretty well other than than

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:42.239 
turned out pretty well other than than
being<00:04:39.729> a<00:04:39.849> little<00:04:40.059> messy<00:04:40.419> and<00:04:40.679> yellow<00:04:41.679> here's

00:04:42.239 --> 00:04:42.249 
being a little messy and yellow here's

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:43.619 
being a little messy and yellow here's
what<00:04:42.429> we're<00:04:42.550> gonna<00:04:42.610> do<00:04:42.849> the<00:04:42.939> taste<00:04:43.149> test<00:04:43.239> I

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:43.629 
what we're gonna do the taste test I

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:45.749 
what we're gonna do the taste test I
think<00:04:43.929> I<00:04:44.019> make<00:04:44.199> them<00:04:44.409> enough<00:04:44.649> actually<00:04:45.399> I'm

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
think I make them enough actually I'm

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:52.589 
think I make them enough actually I'm
pretty<00:04:45.939> sure<00:04:46.119> this<00:04:46.269> is<00:04:46.389> not<00:04:46.419> baked<00:04:51.419> all<00:04:52.419> right

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
pretty sure this is not baked all right

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:54.179 
pretty sure this is not baked all right
so<00:04:52.749> I<00:04:52.779> think<00:04:52.869> this<00:04:53.110> could<00:04:53.469> have<00:04:53.649> potentially

00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:54.189 
so I think this could have potentially

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:55.619 
so I think this could have potentially
been<00:04:54.219> baked<00:04:54.580> a<00:04:54.729> little<00:04:54.819> bit<00:04:55.059> longer<00:04:55.209> but<00:04:55.479> it's

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:55.629 
been baked a little bit longer but it's

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.540 
been baked a little bit longer but it's
actually<00:04:55.989> not<00:04:56.019> too<00:04:56.439> bad<00:04:56.469> so<00:04:56.949> I'm<00:04:57.099> gonna<00:04:57.219> finish

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
actually not too bad so I'm gonna finish

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.399 
actually not too bad so I'm gonna finish
