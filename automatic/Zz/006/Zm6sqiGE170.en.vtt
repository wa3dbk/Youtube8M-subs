00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:01.260 
we got another tutorial for you guys

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.880 
we got another tutorial for you guys
today<00:00:01.589> on<00:00:02.689> the<00:00:03.689> stereoscopic<00:00:04.170> effect<00:00:04.380> in

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
today on the stereoscopic effect in

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.379 
today on the stereoscopic effect in
cinema<00:00:05.430> 4d<00:00:05.460> r13<00:00:07.130> it's<00:00:08.130> pretty<00:00:08.429> cool<00:00:08.610> effect

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
cinema 4d r13 it's pretty cool effect

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.049 
cinema 4d r13 it's pretty cool effect
what<00:00:10.200> allows<00:00:10.469> you<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.800> do<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.040> create<00:00:11.429> 3d

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
what allows you to do is create 3d

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.550 
what allows you to do is create 3d
visuals<00:00:12.710> in<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.860> new<00:00:14.070> workflow<00:00:15.260> you<00:00:16.260> can<00:00:16.410> do

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
visuals in the new workflow you can do

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.590 
visuals in the new workflow you can do
with<00:00:16.770> old<00:00:16.920> projects<00:00:17.550> new<00:00:17.730> projects<00:00:18.300> like<00:00:18.449> this

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
with old projects new projects like this

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.260 
with old projects new projects like this
is<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.840> project<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.100> comes<00:00:20.400> with<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.789> cinema

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
is a project that comes with the cinema

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.500 
is a project that comes with the cinema
4d<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:21.930> it's<00:00:22.050> not<00:00:22.230> actually<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:23.510> stereoscopic

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
4d but it's not actually a stereoscopic

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.960 
4d but it's not actually a stereoscopic
project<00:00:25.220> so<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> guess<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.550> could<00:00:26.670> say<00:00:26.789> it's<00:00:26.849> an

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
project so I guess you could say it's an

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.990 
project so I guess you could say it's an
old<00:00:27.150> project<00:00:27.710> you<00:00:28.710> can<00:00:28.830> just<00:00:28.949> simply<00:00:29.369> just<00:00:29.789> add

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
old project you can just simply just add

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.370 
old project you can just simply just add
it<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.269> which<00:00:30.599> i'll<00:00:30.779> be<00:00:30.929> showing<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.230> how<00:00:31.349> to

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
it on which i'll be showing you how to

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.840 
it on which i'll be showing you how to
do<00:00:33.620> you<00:00:34.620> can<00:00:34.800> even<00:00:34.890> preview<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
do you can even preview it in the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.190 
do you can even preview it in the
viewport<00:00:36.059> which<00:00:36.450> i'll<00:00:36.600> be<00:00:36.750> showing<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.140> how

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
viewport which i'll be showing you how

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.780 
viewport which i'll be showing you how
to<00:00:37.320> do<00:00:39.590> which<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.620> basically<00:00:41.100> singing<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.610> real

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
to do which is basically singing in real

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.979 
to do which is basically singing in real
time<00:00:44.090> yeah<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.950> let's<00:00:46.950> go<00:00:47.100> straight<00:00:47.370> into<00:00:47.489> it

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
time yeah so let's go straight into it

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.779 
time yeah so let's go straight into it
we<00:00:48.989> want<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.260> do<00:00:49.379> first<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> run<00:00:50.610> into

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
we want to do first is going to run into

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.790 
we want to do first is going to run into
settings<00:00:51.120> make<00:00:51.449> sure<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.840> have<00:00:52.020> stereoscopic

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
settings make sure you have stereoscopic

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.330 
settings make sure you have stereoscopic
checked<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.210> allows<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.989> basically<00:00:55.500> so

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
checked what this allows is basically so

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.260 
checked what this allows is basically so
the<00:00:57.109> your<00:00:58.109> final<00:00:58.530> render<00:00:58.920> will<00:00:59.250> have<00:01:00.059> this

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
the your final render will have this

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.619 
the your final render will have this
effect<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.809> stereoscopic<00:01:01.260> effect<00:01:02.390> now<00:01:03.390> let's

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
effect the stereoscopic effect now let's

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.469 
effect the stereoscopic effect now let's
just<00:01:03.750> put<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.559> one<00:01:04.589> side<00:01:05.150> I'll<00:01:06.150> just

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
just put this to one side I'll just

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:14.260 
just put this to one side I'll just
minimize<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:10.369> now<00:01:12.470> most<00:01:13.470> important<00:01:14.010> thing

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
minimize it now most important thing

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.340 
minimize it now most important thing
when<00:01:15.270> you're<00:01:15.420> creating<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.840> stereoscopic

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
when you're creating a stereoscopic

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.010 
when you're creating a stereoscopic
project<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.670> make<00:01:17.820> sure<00:01:18.090> your<00:01:18.330> camera<00:01:18.869> is

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
project is to make sure your camera is

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.580 
project is to make sure your camera is
in<00:01:19.380> 3d<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.939> recording<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.570> 3d<00:01:21.990> space<00:01:24.590> so

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
in 3d that is recording in 3d space so

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.460 
in 3d that is recording in 3d space so
by<00:01:26.220> adding<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.490> new<00:01:26.670> camera<00:01:26.990> you'll<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.320> want

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
by adding a new camera you'll just want

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.749 
by adding a new camera you'll just want
to<00:01:28.560> go<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.860> new<00:01:29.100> option<00:01:29.310> here<00:01:29.729> called

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
to go to this new option here called

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.450 
to go to this new option here called
stereoscopic<00:01:30.689> which<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.409> added<00:01:31.770> with<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.130> new

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
stereoscopic which is added with the new

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.179 
stereoscopic which is added with the new
camera<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.119> wasn't<00:01:34.110> along<00:01:34.740> with<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.009> physical

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
camera I wasn't along with the physical

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.679 
camera I wasn't along with the physical
render<00:01:35.729> which<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.119> showed<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.630> last

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
render which I showed you in the last

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.600 
render which I showed you in the last
tutorial<00:01:38.540> and<00:01:39.540> these<00:01:39.720> are<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.610> different

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
tutorial and these are the different

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.210 
tutorial and these are the different
modes<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.150> can<00:01:42.180> use<00:01:42.479> symmetrical<00:01:43.290> means<00:01:43.320> that

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
modes you can use symmetrical means that

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.440 
modes you can use symmetrical means that
they'll<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.520> next<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.880> each<00:01:44.970> other<00:01:45.119> obviously

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
they'll be next to each other obviously

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.969 
they'll be next to each other obviously
you're<00:01:45.899> not<00:01:45.990> seeing<00:01:46.290> anything<00:01:46.530> yet<00:01:46.799> because

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
you're not seeing anything yet because

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.850 
you're not seeing anything yet because
we<00:01:47.250> haven't<00:01:47.280> enabled<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:49.170> actually<00:01:49.500> see<00:01:49.710> it

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
we haven't enabled to actually see it

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.490 
we haven't enabled to actually see it
yet<00:01:50.780> on<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:53.899> viewport<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
yet on the viewport but this is the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.620 
yet on the viewport but this is the
camera<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.820> see<00:01:57.030> at<00:01:57.180> once<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.479> did

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
camera and you can see at once you did

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.940 
camera and you can see at once you did
that<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:58.079> 3d<00:01:58.740> symbol<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.820> paired<00:02:00.149> on<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.360> camera

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
that a 3d symbol is paired on the camera

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.260 
that a 3d symbol is paired on the camera
this<00:02:01.950> means<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> camera<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:02.820> enabled

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
this means that the camera is enabled

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.580 
this means that the camera is enabled
for<00:02:03.479> our<00:02:03.600> 3d<00:02:03.899> recording<00:02:05.299> you<00:02:06.299> know<00:02:06.420> render<00:02:06.899> 3d

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
for our 3d recording you know render 3d

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.260 
for our 3d recording you know render 3d
rendering<00:02:08.069> basically<00:02:11.180> so

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
rendering basically so

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.610 
rendering basically so
I<00:02:13.590> think<00:02:14.590> he's<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.710> bit<00:02:14.950> too<00:02:15.160> high<00:02:16.560> let's<00:02:17.560> just

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
I think he's a bit too high let's just

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.470 
I think he's a bit too high let's just
put<00:02:17.890> twenty<00:02:18.840> ten<00:02:19.840> maybe<00:02:21.030> see<00:02:22.030> how<00:02:22.150> that<00:02:22.330> works

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
put twenty ten maybe see how that works

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:34.260 
put twenty ten maybe see how that works
out<00:02:22.890> oops<00:02:28.170> yeah<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:33.070> symmetrical<00:02:34.060> means

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
out oops yeah so the symmetrical means

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.510 
out oops yeah so the symmetrical means
that<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.780> pictures<00:02:35.260> will<00:02:35.380> appear<00:02:35.770> next<00:02:35.800> to

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
that the pictures will appear next to

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.160 
that the pictures will appear next to
each<00:02:36.670> other<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:37.090> two<00:02:37.300> separate<00:02:37.750> channels

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
each other the two separate channels

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.570 
each other the two separate channels
would<00:02:38.320> be<00:02:38.470> right<00:02:39.010> next<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.280> each<00:02:39.370> other

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
would be right next to each other

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.600 
would be right next to each other
obviously<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.780> can<00:02:40.960> have<00:02:41.200> left<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.400> right

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
obviously you can have left and right

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.440 
obviously you can have left and right
and<00:02:43.320> completely<00:02:44.320> separated<00:02:45.220> but<00:02:45.450> symmetrical

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
and completely separated but symmetrical

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.440 
and completely separated but symmetrical
is<00:02:46.540> usually<00:02:46.840> what<00:02:46.990> people<00:02:47.020> use<00:02:48.150> now<00:02:49.150> let's

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
is usually what people use now let's

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.400 
is usually what people use now let's
just<00:02:49.570> take<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:49.870> box<00:02:50.740> down<00:02:51.010> here<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:55.230> we<00:02:56.230> can

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
just take this box down here and we can

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.830 
just take this box down here and we can
you<00:02:56.950> can<00:02:57.130> choose<00:02:57.550> whatever<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:58.000> want<00:02:58.090> 70<00:02:58.750> or

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
you can choose whatever you want 70 or

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.460 
you can choose whatever you want 70 or
90<00:03:00.210> for<00:03:01.210> alter<00:03:01.480> planes<00:03:01.750> we're<00:03:02.200> just<00:03:02.320> going<00:03:02.440> to

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
90 for alter planes we're just going to

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.250 
90 for alter planes we're just going to
put<00:03:02.650> 70<00:03:03.070> so<00:03:03.220> we<00:03:03.310> don't<00:03:03.460> have<00:03:03.550> to<00:03:04.260> manually

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
put 70 so we don't have to manually

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.740 
put 70 so we don't have to manually
control<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:08.350> now<00:03:08.970> very<00:03:09.970> important<00:03:10.510> part

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
control it and now very important part

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.970 
control it and now very important part
it<00:03:12.630> we<00:03:13.630> thought<00:03:13.960> that's<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.320> very<00:03:14.560> important

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
it we thought that's the very important

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.300 
it we thought that's the very important
part<00:03:15.220> which<00:03:15.460> allows<00:03:16.240> you<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.750> actually<00:03:17.650> work

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
part which allows you to actually work

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.380 
part which allows you to actually work
with<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.760> 3d<00:03:19.380> now<00:03:20.380> a<00:03:20.740> little<00:03:21.400> bonus<00:03:21.940> what<00:03:22.209> they

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
with the 3d now a little bonus what they

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.050 
with the 3d now a little bonus what they
and<00:03:22.600> gave<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:23.110> is<00:03:23.290> that<00:03:24.070> but<00:03:24.730> if<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:24.880> go<00:03:25.000> to

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
and gave you is that but if you go to

you're in the veep or you can actually

you're in the veep or you can actually
instead<00:03:30.640> of<00:03:30.790> you<00:03:31.060> know<00:03:31.090> rendering<00:03:31.630> it<00:03:31.780> out<00:03:31.930> you

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
instead of you know rendering it out you

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.050 
instead of you know rendering it out you
can<00:03:32.920> actually<00:03:33.070> see<00:03:33.280> from<00:03:34.890> in<00:03:35.890> real<00:03:36.760> time

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
can actually see from in real time

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.550 
can actually see from in real time
what's<00:03:37.300> actually<00:03:37.480> happening<00:03:38.050> so<00:03:38.290> as<00:03:38.380> you<00:03:38.470> can

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
you like how it is in the vport make
