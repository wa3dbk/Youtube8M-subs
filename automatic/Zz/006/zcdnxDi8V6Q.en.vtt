tough question to answer I mean it's a

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.809 
tough question to answer I mean it's a
possibility<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:26.409> mean<00:02:26.739> if<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.519> Undertaker

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
possibility I mean if the Undertaker

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.300 
possibility I mean if the Undertaker
wants<00:02:28.269> to<00:02:28.569> he<00:02:28.810> can<00:02:28.840> retire<00:02:29.290> he<00:02:29.739> can<00:02:29.950> retire

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
wants to he can retire he can retire

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.059 
wants to he can retire he can retire
whenever<00:02:30.879> he<00:02:31.120> wants<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.450> on<00:02:31.870> his<00:02:32.530> own<00:02:32.709> terms

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
whenever he wants to on his own terms

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.270 
whenever he wants to on his own terms
but<00:02:34.060> certainly<00:02:34.480> WWE<00:02:35.200> is<00:02:35.349> not<00:02:35.590> going<00:02:35.859> to<00:02:36.040> force

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
but certainly WWE is not going to force

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.869 
but certainly WWE is not going to force
him<00:02:36.549> to<00:02:36.790> retire<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.510> mean<00:02:38.349> the<00:02:39.040> Undertaker<00:02:39.519> has

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
him to retire I mean the Undertaker has

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.140 
him to retire I mean the Undertaker has
been<00:02:40.180> with<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.719> the<00:02:41.379> WWE<00:02:42.010> for<00:02:42.250> over<00:02:42.549> 21<00:02:42.970> years

and has been wrestling all together for
28<00:02:47.260> years<00:02:47.939> so<00:02:48.939> you<00:02:49.810> know<00:02:49.930> he's<00:02:50.200> been<00:02:50.379> in<00:02:50.560> this

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
28 years so you know he's been in this

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.000 
28 years so you know he's been in this
business<00:02:50.950> for<00:02:51.189> a<00:02:51.400> long<00:02:51.489> time<00:02:52.560> I'm<00:02:53.560> sure<00:02:53.859> he

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
business for a long time I'm sure he

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.899 
business for a long time I'm sure he
certainly<00:02:54.430> made<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.819> fortune<00:02:55.180> over<00:02:55.569> it<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.909> he

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
certainly made a fortune over it and he

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.030 
certainly made a fortune over it and he
can<00:02:58.090> leave<00:02:58.329> whenever<00:02:58.659> he<00:02:58.959> wants<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.439> or<00:02:59.470> he<00:02:59.919> can

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
can leave whenever he wants to or he can

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.229 
can leave whenever he wants to or he can
stay<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:02.310> but<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:03.400> know<00:03:03.430> it's<00:03:03.700> really<00:03:03.819> hard<00:03:04.150> to

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
stay so but you know it's really hard to

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.379 
stay so but you know it's really hard to
say<00:03:04.560> one<00:03:05.560> of<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:05.829> things<00:03:06.129> that<00:03:06.669> I<00:03:06.700> thought

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
say one of the things that I thought

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.159 
say one of the things that I thought
about<00:03:07.569> WrestleMania<00:03:08.019> was<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:10.720> know<00:03:10.870> during

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:11.169 
about WrestleMania was you know during

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:13.890 
about WrestleMania was you know during
the<00:03:11.349> match<00:03:11.680> up<00:03:11.980> he<00:03:12.730> came<00:03:13.030> out<00:03:13.209> looking<00:03:13.540> strong

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
the match up he came out looking strong

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.680 
the match up he came out looking strong
like<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:15.250> know<00:03:15.430> maybe<00:03:16.180> that<00:03:16.449> isn't<00:03:16.659> it<00:03:17.669> but

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
like you know maybe that isn't it but

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.949 
like you know maybe that isn't it but
then<00:03:19.690> again<00:03:19.840> who<00:03:20.680> knows<00:03:21.359> you<00:03:22.359> know<00:03:22.479> it's<00:03:22.780> just

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
then again who knows you know it's just

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.319 
then again who knows you know it's just
really<00:03:23.650> hard<00:03:23.979> to<00:03:24.069> predict<00:03:24.430> because<00:03:24.639> you<00:03:25.209> know

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
really hard to predict because you know

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.170 
really hard to predict because you know
with<00:03:25.540> all<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:26.049> storylines<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.620> everything

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
with all the storylines and everything

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.969 
with all the storylines and everything
WWE<00:03:28.180> always<00:03:28.690> tries<00:03:29.079> to<00:03:29.109> make<00:03:29.470> it<00:03:29.590> look<00:03:29.739> like

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:29.979 
WWE always tries to make it look like

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.189 
WWE always tries to make it look like
that<00:03:30.669> that's<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.329> last<00:03:31.510> we'll<00:03:31.810> see<00:03:31.870> of<00:03:32.019> the

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
would be nice you know I thought we

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.610 
would be nice you know I thought we
might<00:04:57.940> see<00:04:58.570> some<00:04:58.600> of<00:04:58.840> that<00:04:59.020> coming<00:04:59.320> out<00:04:59.470> of

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.360 
might see some of that coming out of
Wrestlemania<00:05:00.479> because<00:05:01.560> he<00:05:02.560> did<00:05:02.740> come<00:05:03.250> out

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
Wrestlemania because he did come out

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.860 
Wrestlemania because he did come out
looking<00:05:03.729> you<00:05:04.690> know<00:05:04.720> strong<00:05:05.710> like<00:05:06.010> he<00:05:06.720> you<00:05:07.720> know

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
looking you know strong like he you know

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.350 
looking you know strong like he you know
not<00:05:08.229> like<00:05:08.440> at<00:05:08.650> wrestlemania<00:05:09.280> 27<00:05:09.790> where<00:05:10.150> he<00:05:10.210> was

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
not like at wrestlemania 27 where he was

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.330 
not like at wrestlemania 27 where he was
called<00:05:10.510> out<00:05:10.720> on<00:05:10.780> a<00:05:10.930> stretcher<00:05:11.169> you<00:05:11.710> know<00:05:11.830> he

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
called out on a stretcher you know he

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.870 
called out on a stretcher you know he
was<00:05:12.550> able<00:05:12.669> to<00:05:12.820> walk<00:05:13.000> out<00:05:13.240> he<00:05:13.510> even<00:05:13.690> helped

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
was able to walk out he even helped

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.270 
was able to walk out he even helped
triple<00:05:15.880> each<00:05:16.000> other's<00:05:16.360> arena<00:05:16.810> so<00:05:17.320> you<00:05:18.130> know<00:05:18.250> I

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
triple each other's arena so you know I

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.140 
triple each other's arena so you know I
thought<00:05:18.610> this<00:05:18.820> might<00:05:19.060> lead<00:05:19.360> to<00:05:20.550> him<00:05:21.550> being<00:05:21.580> on

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
thought this might lead to him being on

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.230 
thought this might lead to him being on
Raw<00:05:22.510> and<00:05:23.250> well<00:05:24.250> I<00:05:24.280> don't<00:05:24.580> really<00:05:24.790> think<00:05:24.970> he'd

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
Raw and well I don't really think he'd

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.590 
Raw and well I don't really think he'd
be<00:05:25.360> on<00:05:25.419> Smackdown<00:05:26.020> but<00:05:26.890> him<00:05:27.820> being<00:05:28.060> on<00:05:28.270> wrong

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
be on Smackdown but him being on wrong

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.710 
be on Smackdown but him being on wrong
more<00:05:29.110> often<00:05:29.320> and<00:05:29.820> not<00:05:30.820> just<00:05:31.150> competing<00:05:31.510> at

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
more often and not just competing at

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.900

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
WrestleMania even if he didn't compete

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.630 
WrestleMania even if he didn't compete
on<00:05:34.090> Raw<00:05:34.330> maybe<00:05:34.660> he<00:05:34.990> may<00:05:35.169> just<00:05:35.640> competed

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
on Raw maybe he may just competed

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.460

if I think he isn't but I certainly hope

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.689 
if I think he isn't but I certainly hope
he<00:06:45.809> does<00:06:45.990> not<00:06:46.199> because<00:06:46.770> it's<00:06:47.039> always<00:06:47.400> sad<00:06:47.669> to

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:47.699 
he does not because it's always sad to

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:51.469 
he does not because it's always sad to
lose<00:06:48.059> a<00:06:48.120> legend<00:06:48.659> and<00:06:48.900> the<00:06:49.289> WWE<00:06:50.330> it's<00:06:51.330> always

lose a legend and the WWE it's always

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:54.579 
lose a legend and the WWE it's always
sad<00:06:51.930> to<00:06:51.960> see<00:06:52.409> some<00:06:52.979> wrestler<00:06:53.460> have<00:06:53.879> to<00:06:54.059> retire

00:06:54.579 --> 00:06:54.589 
sad to see some wrestler have to retire

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:58.399
