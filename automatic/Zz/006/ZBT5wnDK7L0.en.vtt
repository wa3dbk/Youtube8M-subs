00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
but I just want to point out that I've

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.020 
but I just want to point out that I've
I've<00:01:27.570> read<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:29.159> basic<00:01:29.490> idea<00:01:29.579> would<00:01:30.000> be

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
I've read it and the basic idea would be

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.499 
I've read it and the basic idea would be
that<00:01:30.210> at<00:01:30.659> some<00:01:31.229> point<00:01:31.909> we<00:01:32.909> hold<00:01:33.680> Medicare<00:01:35.509> cost

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
per recipient constant as a way of

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.859 
per recipient constant as a way of
making<00:01:40.350> sure<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.950> doesn't<00:01:41.460> go<00:01:41.689> way<00:01:42.689> out

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
making sure that that doesn't go way out

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.780 
making sure that that doesn't go way out
of<00:01:43.049> way<00:01:43.500> out<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.740> whack<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.159> I'm<00:01:44.399> sure<00:01:44.579> there's

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
of way out of whack and I'm sure there's

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.530 
of way out of whack and I'm sure there's
some<00:01:44.939> details<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:46.009> a<00:01:47.009> blend<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.820> inflation

we here have in Congress that's the kind

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.250 
we here have in Congress that's the kind
of<00:02:06.750> reform<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.259> proposal<00:02:07.560> from

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.020 

as<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:12.440> said<00:02:12.650> before<00:02:12.800> this<00:02:13.340> is<00:02:13.400> an<00:02:13.670> entirely

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
as I said before this is an entirely

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.300 
as I said before this is an entirely
legitimate<00:02:14.680> proposal<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.940> problem<00:02:17.390> is

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
legitimate proposal the problem is

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.410 
legitimate proposal the problem is
twofold<00:02:19.310> one<00:02:20.300> is<00:02:21.129> that<00:02:22.129> depending<00:02:22.910> on<00:02:23.239> how

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
twofold one is that depending on how

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.369 
twofold one is that depending on how
it's<00:02:23.660> structured

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
it's structured

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.530 
it's structured
if<00:02:25.540> recipients<00:02:26.540> are<00:02:26.690> suddenly<00:02:27.650> getting<00:02:27.950> a

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
plan that has the reimbursement rates

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.960 
plan that has the reimbursement rates
going<00:02:32.120> like<00:02:32.599> this<00:02:32.950> but<00:02:33.950> health<00:02:34.370> care<00:02:34.580> costs

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
going like this but health care costs

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.479 
going like this but health care costs
are<00:02:35.120> still<00:02:35.390> going<00:02:35.599> up<00:02:35.780> like<00:02:35.900> that<00:02:36.190> then<00:02:37.190> over

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
are still going up like that then over

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.449 
are still going up like that then over
time<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:38.510> way<00:02:38.660> we're<00:02:38.959> saving<00:02:39.379> money<00:02:39.459> is

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
time the way we're saving money is

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.080 
time the way we're saving money is
essentially<00:02:41.349> by<00:02:42.349> capping<00:02:43.130> what<00:02:43.849> they're

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
essentially by capping what they're

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.860 
essentially by capping what they're
getting<00:02:44.540> relative<00:02:45.349> to<00:02:45.530> their<00:02:45.680> costs<00:02:46.450> now<00:02:47.450> I

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
getting relative to their costs now I

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.170 
getting relative to their costs now I
just<00:02:48.500> want<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:49.010> point<00:02:49.190> out<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.760> this<00:02:49.940> brings

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
just want to point out and this brings

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.900 
just want to point out and this brings
me<00:02:50.269> to<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.480> second<00:02:50.840> problem<00:02:51.160> when<00:02:52.160> we<00:02:52.340> made<00:02:52.610> a

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
me to the second problem when we made a

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.240

any proposal that Paul makes will be
