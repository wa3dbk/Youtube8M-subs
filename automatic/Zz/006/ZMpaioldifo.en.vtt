00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.569
 hi everyone today i will show how to do 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.269
 stand for costume jewelry do it yourself 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:16.650
 this is done very quickly very cheap 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:18.570
 the main thing it looks original and so 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.630
 for this we need a frame for 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.019
 photos paper for decoration scissors 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.090
 and stationery carnations for starters we 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.090
 separate the frame from the stand 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.989
 Well 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.290
 next we take our paper for 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:51.750
 registration and we will wrap you father 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:54.239
 stand can choose any paper i am i 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.729
 found in the department for gift decoration 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:03.479
 any that you like and more 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:07.140
 take our scissors and we will cut 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:10.340
 edges leave about centimeters 57 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.149
 because the edges we will tuck and 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.149
 just so it will be more convenient 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.380
 next we turn our edges 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.860
 and insert the frame itself these edges can be 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.820
 then also trim with scissors if they 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.700
 will interfere 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.670
 but when the matter is the first stand yach not 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.350
 cut the grain and hung it on the wall 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.470
 I still can not see what, in principle, without 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.470
 the differences 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.879
 here it looks so further that we will 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:19.950
 do this we take our stationery 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:24.680
 carnations and we will do ourselves for what our 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.680
 write jewelry of any accessories 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.380
 This part is very easy to say 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:35.430
 because it's hard to screw them in there 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.620
 but it takes minutes to give them and after 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.860
 that's how we screwed our studs 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.030
 we hang our jewelry or all that 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.090
 want accessories 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.890
 and so it turns out podvechka urea not 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.690
 final ones you can just substitute or 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.660
 hang on the wall like i did with 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.459
 first hope you enjoyed it 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.099
 try on make it very easy and 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.579
 cheap and i see you in the next video 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.579
