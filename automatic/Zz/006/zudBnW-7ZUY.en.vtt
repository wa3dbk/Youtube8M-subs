00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.030 
do video so i guess but are we playing
with<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.930> lot<00:03:18.269> so<00:03:19.269> it<00:03:19.569> don't<00:03:20.319> mean<00:03:20.500> i<00:03:20.680> have<00:03:20.919> you

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
with the lot so it don't mean i have you

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.000

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
think if we actually just strengthen

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.710 
think if we actually just strengthen
their<00:03:26.079> you<00:03:26.169> spit<00:03:26.530> on<00:03:27.030> just<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:28.150> we<00:03:28.239> just<00:03:28.359> just

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
their you spit on just so we just just
