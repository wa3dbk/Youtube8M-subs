00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
in a way to Turkey we didn't really know

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.290 
in a way to Turkey we didn't really know
what<00:00:37.780> to<00:00:37.809> expect<00:00:37.989> it<00:00:38.739> was<00:00:38.860> a<00:00:38.920> nice<00:00:39.699> goal<00:00:40.000> you

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
what to expect it was a nice goal you

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.030 
what to expect it was a nice goal you
know<00:00:40.420> to<00:00:40.480> score<00:00:40.870> from<00:00:41.079> there<00:00:41.320> that<00:00:41.530> that<00:00:41.829> kind

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
know to score from there that that kind

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:49.740 
know to score from there that that kind
of<00:00:42.100> distance<00:00:42.489> I<00:00:42.699> enjoyed<00:00:42.969> that<00:00:43.000> one

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.290 

my<00:00:50.260> second<00:00:50.710> favorite<00:00:50.770> goal<00:00:51.220> it's<00:00:52.000> probably

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
my second favorite goal it's probably

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.570 
my second favorite goal it's probably
the<00:00:52.630> best<00:00:52.870> sort<00:00:53.470> of<00:00:53.530> technique<00:00:54.010> of<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.310> three

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
the best sort of technique of the three

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.810 
the best sort of technique of the three
would<00:00:54.820> probably<00:00:55.090> be<00:00:55.180> the<00:00:55.300> goal<00:00:55.480> against<00:00:55.750> Wales

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
would probably be the goal against Wales

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.160 
would probably be the goal against Wales
where<00:00:57.820> I've<00:00:57.940> got<00:00:58.150> it<00:00:58.300> it's<00:00:58.480> bounced<00:00:58.870> over<00:00:59.080> the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
where I've got it it's bounced over the

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.510 
where I've got it it's bounced over the
defenders<00:00:59.620> head<00:00:59.800> and<00:00:59.980> I<00:01:00.010> sort<00:01:00.220> of<00:01:00.250> read<00:01:00.489> the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
defenders head and I sort of read the

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.880 
defenders head and I sort of read the
bounce<00:01:00.879> and<00:01:01.300> tested<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:02.440> followed<00:01:02.770> it

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
bounce and tested it and followed it

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.710 
bounce and tested it and followed it
into<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:03.280> top<00:01:03.670> top<00:01:03.879> roof<00:01:04.089> of<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.300> net<00:01:04.479> and

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
into the top top roof of the net and

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.090 
into the top top roof of the net and
again<00:01:05.019> it<00:01:05.140> was<00:01:05.229> you<00:01:05.379> know<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.530> different<00:01:05.770> goal

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
again it was you know a different goal

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:15.840 
again it was you know a different goal
to<00:01:06.310> what<00:01:06.430> I<00:01:06.460> typically<00:01:06.850> school

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.430

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
was but once it finishes in the box and

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.280 
was but once it finishes in the box and
put<00:01:21.370> in<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:21.580> fourth<00:01:21.760> last<00:01:22.030> time<00:01:22.300> so<00:01:22.630> to<00:01:23.110> see

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
put in the fourth last time so to see

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.840 
put in the fourth last time so to see
that's<00:01:23.590> what<00:01:23.800> we<00:01:23.979> create<00:01:24.280> itself<00:01:24.550> and<00:01:24.790> the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
that's what we create itself and the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.620 
that's what we create itself and the
going<00:01:25.120> was<00:01:25.240> quite<00:01:25.450> nice

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
going was quite nice

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.660 
going was quite nice
my<00:01:28.630> favorite<00:01:28.990> goal<00:01:29.140> would<00:01:29.290> have<00:01:29.440> to<00:01:29.590> be<00:01:29.710> my<00:01:29.979> the

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
my favorite goal would have to be my the

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.870 
my favorite goal would have to be my the
third<00:01:30.880> goal<00:01:31.119> up<00:01:31.420> I<00:01:32.080> scored<00:01:33.070> to<00:01:33.610> make<00:01:33.760> my

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
third goal up I scored to make my

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.120 
third goal up I scored to make my
hat-trick<00:01:34.240> against<00:01:34.540> Montenegro<00:01:34.960> and<00:01:35.410> that

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
hat-trick against Montenegro and that

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.530 
hat-trick against Montenegro and that
was<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.340> sort<00:01:36.550> of<00:01:36.580> last<00:01:36.759> obviously<00:01:37.360> last

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
was the sort of last obviously last

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.730 
was the sort of last obviously last
qualifying<00:01:38.110> game

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
qualifying game

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.310 
qualifying game
I<00:01:38.770> remember<00:01:39.420> having<00:01:40.420> scored<00:01:40.780> my<00:01:40.930> second

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
I remember having scored my second

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.570 
I remember having scored my second
thinking<00:01:41.680> I<00:01:41.770> could<00:01:42.130> really<00:01:42.310> score<00:01:42.520> a

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
thinking I could really score a

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.330 
thinking I could really score a
hat-trick<00:01:42.729> in<00:01:43.060> this<00:01:43.210> game<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.950> know<00:01:45.100> so<00:01:45.310> I

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
hat-trick in this game you know so I

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.880 
hat-trick in this game you know so I
sort<00:01:45.759> of<00:01:45.820> got<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.119> ball<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:47.200> sort<00:01:47.470> of<00:01:47.530> midway

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
sort of got the ball and sort of midway

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.920 
sort of got the ball and sort of midway
I<00:01:48.190> think<00:01:48.550> Tony<00:01:48.759> passed<00:01:49.090> it<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.390> me<00:01:49.509> and<00:01:49.660> I<00:01:49.720> sort

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
I think Tony passed it to me and I sort

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.810 
I think Tony passed it to me and I sort
of<00:01:49.990> came<00:01:50.050> off<00:01:50.410> the<00:01:50.530> back<00:01:50.680> for<00:01:50.950> those<00:01:51.550> four

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
of came off the back for those four

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.040 
of came off the back for those four
defenders<00:01:52.240> in<00:01:52.390> front<00:01:52.570> of<00:01:52.660> me<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:52.869> I<00:01:52.930> thought

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
defenders in front of me and I thought
