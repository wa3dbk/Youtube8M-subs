00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:34.329
 it will be a year ending in year when there is more justice 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.070
 by being done for climate change, politically as well as individually, of course 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.320

 Study to You Must Do Do You Know US by Touring Depending 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.320
 Denic and even here agree with Chris Barber he does not 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.680
 his Christ child but it is no small fool of Tim and of Pierer and 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.140
 if I look at this 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.350
 and a small person 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.520
 imagine 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.010
 and I think I am and something like an aunt and have responsibility for 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.940
 becomes more natural to this little person and for his sister 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.160
 It is clear how important the Greens are that it is not enough solemn 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.630
 Statements on climate change but that it is clear binding 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.700
 Minden needs reduction targets 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.780
 so that the ATA advertising does not go over two degrees 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.409
 that can not be that you just split this world between 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.179
 few who are always richer 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.540
 and many who are already the biggest victims of climate change 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.220
 that would not be accepted 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.240
 think small and to me that like a society in Dr 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.850

 big issues of the future let us enter together in very broad 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.459

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:25.759
 Child friendly is the zest for life 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:27.319

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.269
 Yapi gives common future and now
