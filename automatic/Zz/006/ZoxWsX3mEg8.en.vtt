00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
here's one of my next tips when you're

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.300 
here's one of my next tips when you're

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
wrapping your convertible dress bring

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.210 
wrapping your convertible dress bring
the<00:01:56.490> waist<00:01:56.730> band<00:01:57.030> up<00:01:57.330> as<00:01:57.540> high<00:01:57.780> as<00:01:57.960> possible

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
the waist band up as high as possible

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.740 
the waist band up as high as possible
it'll<00:01:59.220> make<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.580> a<00:01:59.670> lot<00:01:59.910> easier<00:02:00.120> for<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.720> to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
it'll make it a lot easier for you to

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.420 
it'll make it a lot easier for you to
wrap<00:02:01.020> because<00:02:01.260> you'll<00:02:01.410> have<00:02:01.560> less<00:02:01.890> skin<00:02:02.250> to

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
wrap because you'll have less skin to

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.730 
wrap because you'll have less skin to
cover<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:03.510> now<00:02:03.690> that<00:02:03.870> we're<00:02:04.020> on<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:04.140> back<00:02:04.500> on

cover so now that we're on the back on

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.370 
cover so now that we're on the back on
the<00:02:04.950> strapless<00:02:05.310> gown<00:02:05.760> again<00:02:06.690> we're<00:02:07.290> gonna
