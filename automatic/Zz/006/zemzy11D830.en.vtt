amazon right now this is a 46 90 k so
you<00:00:16.410> can<00:00:16.710> overclock<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.609> k<00:00:17.820> and

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
you can overclock it that k and

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.519 
you can overclock it that k and

not<00:00:37.170> all<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.530> well<00:00:38.100> compared<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.760> say<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.030> FX

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
not all that well compared to say in FX

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.139 
not all that well compared to say in FX
8350<00:00:40.170> that's<00:00:40.590> around<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.950> same<00:00:41.010> price<00:00:41.219> but<00:00:41.730> in

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
8350 that's around the same price but in

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.850 
8350 that's around the same price but in
gaming<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.750> thing's<00:00:42.989> an<00:00:43.110> absolute<00:00:43.590> monster

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860

gaming this thing's an absolute monster
especially<00:00:44.579> like<00:00:44.760> i<00:00:44.879> said<00:00:45.059> if<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.270> overclock

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
especially like i said if you overclock

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.660 
especially like i said if you overclock
it<00:00:45.809> oh<00:00:46.110> my<00:00:46.379> god<00:00:46.649> if<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.039> pair<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.399> with<00:00:47.460> a

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
it oh my god if you pair this with a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.810 
it oh my god if you pair this with a
good<00:00:47.910> GPU<00:00:48.590> rest<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.800> peace<00:00:50.010> any<00:00:50.280> game<00:00:50.610> you

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
throw at it it's just gonna be murdered

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.619 
throw at it it's just gonna be murdered
by<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.920> cpu<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.820> graphics<00:00:54.000> card<00:00:54.480> a

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
by the cpu and the graphics card a

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.420 
by the cpu and the graphics card a
really<00:00:55.230> good<00:00:55.379> cpu<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.829> my<00:00:55.949> opinion<00:00:56.129> if<00:00:56.309> you

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
really good cpu in my opinion if you

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.340 
really good cpu in my opinion if you
guys<00:00:56.550> want<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.879> get<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.030> cpu<00:00:57.660> cooler<00:00:57.960> go<00:00:58.170> ahead

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
guys want to get a cpu cooler go ahead

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.540 
guys want to get a cpu cooler go ahead
and<00:00:58.469> pick<00:00:58.620> up<00:00:58.770> something<00:00:59.010> cheap<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.520> a

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
and pick up something cheap like a

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.180 
and pick up something cheap like a
hybrid<00:00:59.760> 212<00:01:00.530> unless<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.680> want<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.920> do<00:01:02.010> some

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
hybrid 212 unless you want to do some

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.950 
hybrid 212 unless you want to do some
extreme<00:01:02.489> overclocking<00:01:03.090> then<00:01:03.390> you'll<00:01:03.600> get

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
extreme overclocking then you'll get

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.450 
extreme overclocking then you'll get
some<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.290> know<00:01:04.320> liquid<00:01:04.739> cooling<00:01:05.070> your<00:01:05.220> stuff

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
some you know liquid cooling your stuff

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.390 
some you know liquid cooling your stuff
like<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.670> um<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.900> just<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.590> hyper<00:01:07.770> 212<00:01:08.040> you

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
like that um but just the hyper 212 you

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.820 
like that um but just the hyper 212 you
can<00:01:08.549> take<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.939> 3.9<00:01:09.420> or<00:01:09.689> 4.1<00:01:10.170> gigahertz<00:01:10.560> and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
can take it to 3.9 or 4.1 gigahertz and

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.080 
can take it to 3.9 or 4.1 gigahertz and
at<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.070> point<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.729> gonna<00:01:11.850> be<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> pretty

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
at that point it's gonna be a pretty

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.960 
at that point it's gonna be a pretty
fast<00:01:12.540> cpu<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:13.799> i<00:01:13.920> said<00:01:14.159> even<00:01:14.460> if<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.640> do<00:01:14.790> want

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
fast cpu like i said even if you do want

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.609 
fast cpu like i said even if you do want
to<00:01:15.060> do<00:01:15.150> some<00:01:15.299> live<00:01:15.450> streaming<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.049> cpu<00:01:16.439> can

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
to do some live streaming the cpu can

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.120 
to do some live streaming the cpu can
still<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.310> myself<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:18.180> an<00:01:18.299> i5<00:01:18.600> 3570k

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
still do it I I myself have an i5 3570k

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.530 
still do it I I myself have an i5 3570k
and<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.369> live<00:01:20.490> stream<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.060> fine<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.450> I

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
and I can live stream just fine and I

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.820 
and I can live stream just fine and I
can<00:01:21.570> video<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.439> fine<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.799> don't

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
can video and it just fine so don't

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.580 
can video and it just fine so don't
worry<00:01:23.040> about<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.990> motherboard<00:01:25.470> the

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
eight gigabytes of RAM for gaming is

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.930 
eight gigabytes of RAM for gaming is
absolutely<00:03:04.530> perfectly<00:03:05.069> fine<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.670> current

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
absolutely perfectly fine the current

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.910 
absolutely perfectly fine the current
consoles<00:03:06.329> use<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.660> gigabytes<00:03:07.079> of<00:03:07.170> RAM<00:03:07.379> as<00:03:07.590> well

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
consoles use a gigabytes of RAM as well

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.130 
consoles use a gigabytes of RAM as well
but<00:03:08.700> most<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.209> majority<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.900> rim<00:03:10.110> is

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
but most of the majority of that rim is

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.140 
but most of the majority of that rim is
actually<00:03:10.560> taken<00:03:10.860> up<00:03:11.129> by<00:03:11.190> their<00:03:11.610> operating

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
actually taken up by their operating

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.300 
actually taken up by their operating
system<00:03:12.569> I<00:03:12.660> think<00:03:12.690> it's<00:03:13.019> actually<00:03:13.200> like<00:03:13.410> three

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
system I think it's actually like three

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.400 
system I think it's actually like three
gigs<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.879> it<00:03:15.000> on<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.299> ps4<00:03:15.569> something<00:03:16.110> crazy

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
gigs of it on the ps4 something crazy

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.650 
gigs of it on the ps4 something crazy
like<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.799> so<00:03:17.579> this<00:03:17.760> kid<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:18.060> RAM<00:03:18.209> is<00:03:18.359> gonna<00:03:18.540> be

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
like that so this kid of RAM is gonna be

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.000 
like that so this kid of RAM is gonna be
perfectly<00:03:19.019> fine<00:03:19.230> for<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.560> build<00:03:19.709> highly

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
perfectly fine for the build highly

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.530 
perfectly fine for the build highly
recommended<00:03:20.489> I<00:03:20.549> have<00:03:20.579> g.skill<00:03:21.150> ripjaws

myself<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.290> works<00:03:22.470> absolutely

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
myself and it works absolutely

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.009 
myself and it works absolutely
fantastically<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.180> like<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:24.750> said<00:03:24.810> the

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
fantastically and like I said the

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.629 
fantastically and like I said the
motherboard<00:03:25.410> does<00:03:25.530> have<00:03:25.739> four<00:03:25.920> ram<00:03:26.130> slots<00:03:26.430> so

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
motherboard does have four ram slots so

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.030 
motherboard does have four ram slots so
say<00:03:27.209> two<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.690> three<00:03:27.989> years<00:03:28.200> downline<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.769> want

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
say two to three years downline you want

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.890 
say two to three years downline you want
to<00:03:29.130> get<00:03:29.250> 12<00:03:29.519> or<00:03:29.730> 16<00:03:29.910> gigabytes<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.660> can<00:03:30.750> just

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
to get 12 or 16 gigabytes you can just

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.300 
to get 12 or 16 gigabytes you can just
buy<00:03:31.019> another<00:03:31.049> kid<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:31.799> rim<00:03:32.069> and<00:03:32.220> then

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
buy another kid of this rim and then

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.490 
buy another kid of this rim and then
boom<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:32.700> got<00:03:32.819> 16<00:03:33.239> gigabytes<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.780> RAM<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.380> one

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
boom you got 16 gigabytes and RAM is one

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.170 
boom you got 16 gigabytes and RAM is one
of<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.680> easiest<00:03:35.010> thing<00:03:35.130> to<00:03:35.370> upgrade<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:36.000> just

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
of the easiest thing to upgrade you just

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.960 
of the easiest thing to upgrade you just
literally<00:03:36.660> pop<00:03:36.959> it<00:03:37.139> into<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.530> ram<00:03:37.769> slot<00:03:38.099> much

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
literally pop it into the ram slot much

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.370 
literally pop it into the ram slot much
easier<00:03:39.359> than<00:03:39.480> say<00:03:39.690> replacing<00:03:40.260> your

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
easier than say replacing your

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.339 
easier than say replacing your
motherboard<00:03:40.920> or<00:03:41.099> even<00:03:41.489> upgrading<00:03:41.880> a<00:03:41.940> cpu<00:03:42.450> for

in<00:04:29.759> my<00:04:29.940> opinion<00:04:30.240> at<00:04:30.660> 750<00:04:31.259> watt<00:04:31.560> so<00:04:31.740> this<00:04:31.860> is

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
in my opinion at 750 watt so this is

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.279 
in my opinion at 750 watt so this is
gonna<00:04:32.009> power<00:04:32.280> to<00:04:32.400> build<00:04:32.610> no<00:04:32.880> problem<00:04:33.509> uh<00:04:33.660> you

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
power supplies and 750 watts is kind of

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.939 
power supplies and 750 watts is kind of
overkill<00:04:45.720> in<00:04:45.870> this<00:04:45.990> build<00:04:46.229> but<00:04:46.440> it's<00:04:46.500> gonna

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
overkill in this build but it's gonna

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.010 
overkill in this build but it's gonna
leave<00:04:47.610> you<00:04:47.789> the<00:04:47.940> option<00:04:48.240> of<00:04:48.330> sli<00:04:48.780> or<00:04:48.810> crossfire

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020

open<00:04:49.889> so<00:04:50.099> you<00:04:50.490> know<00:04:50.610> I<00:04:50.819> guess<00:04:51.150> go<00:04:51.449> for<00:04:51.690> and<00:04:51.900> it's

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
open so you know I guess go for and it's

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.510 
open so you know I guess go for and it's
only<00:04:52.139> sixty<00:04:52.500> dollars<00:04:52.800> so<00:04:52.919> in<00:04:53.009> this<00:04:53.099> build<00:04:53.370> it

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
only sixty dollars so in this build it

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.370 
only sixty dollars so in this build it
was<00:04:53.610> a<00:04:53.639> complete<00:04:54.180> good<00:04:54.449> option<00:04:54.870> for<00:04:55.020> the

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
was a complete good option for the

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.140 
was a complete good option for the

very good video card and this is from

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.600 
very good video card and this is from
nvidia<00:05:01.740> so<00:05:01.889> you're<00:05:02.039> going<00:05:02.130> to<00:05:02.190> get<00:05:02.340> all<00:05:02.490> their

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
nvidia so you're going to get all their

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.969 
nvidia so you're going to get all their
exclusive<00:05:03.210> features<00:05:03.479> like<00:05:03.660> shadow<00:05:04.500> play<00:05:04.770> and

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
exclusive features like shadow play and

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.920 
exclusive features like shadow play and
adaptive<00:05:05.430> vsync<00:05:05.580> which<00:05:06.090> in<00:05:06.240> my<00:05:06.360> opinion<00:05:06.509> those

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
adaptive vsync which in my opinion those

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.570 
adaptive vsync which in my opinion those
features<00:05:07.289> definitely<00:05:07.740> tip<00:05:07.919> the<00:05:08.070> scale<00:05:08.340> when

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
features definitely tip the scale when

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.430 
features definitely tip the scale when
you're<00:05:08.699> deciding<00:05:08.940> between<00:05:09.300> an<00:05:09.630> AMD<00:05:09.870> GPU<00:05:10.349> and

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
you're deciding between an AMD GPU and

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.460 
you're deciding between an AMD GPU and
nvidia<00:05:10.830> GPU<00:05:11.250> at<00:05:11.400> least<00:05:11.580> in<00:05:11.729> my<00:05:11.880> opinion<00:05:12.289> for<00:05:13.289> my

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
nvidia GPU at least in my opinion for my

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.770 
nvidia GPU at least in my opinion for my
preferences<00:05:14.250> i<00:05:14.310> think<00:05:14.789> the<00:05:15.000> nvidia<00:05:15.449> features

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
preferences i think the nvidia features

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.170 
preferences i think the nvidia features
are<00:05:15.930> way<00:05:16.080> better<00:05:16.229> than<00:05:16.380> the<00:05:17.370> AMD<00:05:17.759> features<00:05:18.060> but

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
are way better than the AMD features but

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.629 
are way better than the AMD features but
again<00:05:18.479> that's<00:05:18.690> just<00:05:18.900> my<00:05:19.039> preferences<00:05:20.039> but

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
again that's just my preferences but

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.129 
again that's just my preferences but
this<00:05:20.759> GP<00:05:21.060> is<00:05:21.120> fantastic<00:05:21.750> for<00:05:21.780> three<00:05:22.050> hundred

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
this GP is fantastic for three hundred

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:23.300

that's probably what this games gonna
end<00:05:53.789> up<00:05:53.940> being<00:05:54.150> because<00:05:54.449> it's<00:05:54.599> not<00:05:54.750> being

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
end up being because it's not being

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.140 
end up being because it's not being
developed<00:05:55.289> by<00:05:55.530> uh<00:05:55.560> i<00:05:55.979> believe<00:05:56.130> gearbox<00:05:56.849> did

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
developed by uh i believe gearbox did

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.850 
developed by uh i believe gearbox did
one<00:05:57.539> and<00:05:57.690> two<00:05:57.870> and<00:05:58.050> i<00:05:58.139> don't<00:05:58.320> think<00:05:58.380> your<00:05:58.650> box

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
one and two and i don't think your box

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.950 
one and two and i don't think your box
is<00:05:59.009> doing<00:05:59.280> number<00:05:59.400> three<00:05:59.820> or<00:06:00.030> the<00:06:00.539> pre-sequel

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
is doing number three or the pre-sequel

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.450 
is doing number three or the pre-sequel
they<00:06:01.259> probably<00:06:01.469> are<00:06:01.710> doing<00:06:01.949> number<00:06:02.219> three

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
they probably are doing number three

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.820 
they probably are doing number three
nobody<00:06:03.060> just<00:06:03.240> knows<00:06:03.449> about<00:06:03.690> it<00:06:03.750> yet<00:06:03.900> but<00:06:04.650> yeah
