suit blue in my stripes and it also has
the<00:01:47.220> padding<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.060> one<00:01:48.240> doesn't

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
the padding in it but this one doesn't

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.550 
the padding in it but this one doesn't
seem<00:01:49.049> as<00:01:49.200> bad<00:01:49.610> so<00:01:50.610> yeah<00:01:51.000> got<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.720> one<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.259> the

seem as bad so yeah got this one and the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.740 
seem as bad so yeah got this one and the
material<00:01:53.070> for<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.640> thicker<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:55.490> even

material for this is thicker and even

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.880 
material for this is thicker and even
you<00:01:57.750> probably<00:01:58.020> take<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.320> padding<00:01:58.619> out<00:01:58.710> of

you probably take the padding out of
this<00:01:59.009> one<00:01:59.219> because<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.640> material<00:02:00.240> is

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
this one because the material is

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.020 
this one because the material is
