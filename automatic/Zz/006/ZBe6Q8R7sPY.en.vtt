00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:08.340
 at the end of the winding we get close to that 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.120
 what we need to fix our and the end 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.120
 the elders 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:22.380
 coils in the wings we will also fix 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:25.199
 we look to the line as it ends 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.160
 fishing line they each other did not hold something 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.969
 there is one top 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.660
 fishing line she walked without intersecting with the bottom 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:43.860
 way out 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:45.420
 from the line with reel we insert the line 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.289
 fishing line ends in tray 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.890
 that is, the bottom and insert into one 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:57.719
 rule who is here and 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:01:01.350
 insert the top here for this 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:07.320
 so that they but you would not interfere with each other 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:11.210
 a friend should not try so that they 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.540
 suppressed that is the top was the top 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.540
 First, we push in the top in ps and then 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.909
 only lower ones otherwise there will be confusion and 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.979
 fishing line we will not go out at 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:32.479
 pressed 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:36.140
 start buttons well, show it like that 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:40.159
 give them all to show 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.630
 coasters and the final already assembled 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:51.119
 the coil that is we insert 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:54.930
 give the end of the line in the level with 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:59.820
 coil empty 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.540
 letting the spool insert one end of the line into 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.799
 bobbin 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.799
 and 2 insert 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.100
 like this 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.190
 set and again the principle will first be 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.150
 here something like this 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:55.460
 the end will be a bit like a sauna 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:57.290
 twisted then we are just stronger 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.040
 finger him for the ends 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.510
 they themselves from hard as it would come out 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:12.100
 from the slots to further when you click 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:12.100
 the trigger button is already fishing line but 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:26.870
 automatically and insert the button itself into 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:33.860
 second so that the teeth do not intersect was 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:38.570
 full stroke of the button then hold it 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:42.770
 button with your finger and put on the bottom 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:46.030
 bobbing up again trying 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.670
 the button does not let go because it can 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:56.390
 lead to the fact that it will be necessary for the new 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:04:00.290
 remove the cover and hang back and 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:09.410
 to look at our position fall 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:15.440
 latches we think further we pulled up 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:19.540
 a bit he's all and we can calmly 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:23.360
 work on all the build process and 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:27.340
 refueling the fishing line in the reel he was 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.340
 granted to commit
