00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
monoclonal antibody that attacks a

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.609 
monoclonal antibody that attacks a
protein<00:00:19.090> on<00:00:19.240> the<00:00:19.270> surface<00:00:19.360> of<00:00:19.930> certain<00:00:20.410> types

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
protein on the surface of certain types

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.730 
protein on the surface of certain types
of<00:00:20.740> lymphomas<00:00:21.310> called<00:00:21.520> cd30<00:00:22.210> and<00:00:22.540> this<00:00:23.380> is<00:00:23.560> in

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
of lymphomas called cd30 and this is in

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.710 
of lymphomas called cd30 and this is in
patients<00:00:24.160> that<00:00:24.279> have<00:00:24.460> hodgkin<00:00:24.970> lymphoma<00:00:25.090> and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
patients that have hodgkin lymphoma and

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.230 
patients that have hodgkin lymphoma and
certain<00:00:26.530> types<00:00:26.800> of<00:00:27.039> t-cell<00:00:27.520> non-hodgkins

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
certain types of t-cell non-hodgkins

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.750 
certain types of t-cell non-hodgkins
lymphoma<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.710> these<00:00:29.860> are<00:00:29.920> rare<00:00:30.369> types<00:00:30.610> of

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
lymphoma so these are rare types of

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.430 
lymphoma so these are rare types of
lymphomas<00:00:31.240> but<00:00:31.420> also<00:00:31.570> very<00:00:31.840> difficult<00:00:32.320> to

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:32.440 
lymphomas but also very difficult to

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.540 
lymphomas but also very difficult to
treat<00:00:32.650> and<00:00:32.830> we<00:00:32.890> didn't<00:00:33.100> have<00:00:33.190> a<00:00:33.250> lot<00:00:33.430> of<00:00:33.460> good

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
treat and we didn't have a lot of good

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.250 
treat and we didn't have a lot of good
treatments<00:00:34.180> for<00:00:34.330> patients<00:00:34.510> who<00:00:34.840> had<00:00:34.960> failed

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
treatments for patients who had failed

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.920 
treatments for patients who had failed
regular<00:00:36.220> treatments<00:00:37.000> previously<00:00:37.629> and<00:00:37.780> so

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
regular treatments previously and so

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.240 
regular treatments previously and so
this<00:00:38.110> is<00:00:38.230> really<00:00:38.410> a<00:00:38.530> breakthrough<00:00:38.800> and<00:00:39.129> that

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
this is really a breakthrough and that

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.920 
this is really a breakthrough and that
we<00:00:39.400> finally<00:00:40.120> have<00:00:40.269> something<00:00:40.449> to<00:00:40.630> treat<00:00:40.840> these

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
we finally have something to treat these

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.220 
we finally have something to treat these
really<00:00:41.200> difficult<00:00:41.590> to<00:00:41.710> treat<00:00:41.890> patients<00:00:43.230> so

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
really difficult to treat patients so

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.100 
really difficult to treat patients so
this<00:00:44.500> protein<00:00:45.360> attaches<00:00:46.360> to<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:46.719> day

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
this protein attaches to the day

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.290 
this protein attaches to the day
lymphoma<00:00:47.500> cell<00:00:47.800> and<00:00:48.100> then<00:00:48.730> attached<00:00:49.030> to<00:00:49.059> the

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
lymphoma cell and then attached to the

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.690 
lymphoma cell and then attached to the
protein<00:00:49.750> is<00:00:49.989> a<00:00:50.350> type<00:00:51.040> of<00:00:51.070> a<00:00:51.370> chemotherapy

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 
protein is a type of a chemotherapy

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.790 
protein is a type of a chemotherapy
directly<00:00:52.540> attached<00:00:53.020> to<00:00:53.260> it<00:00:53.350> so<00:00:53.469> it's<00:00:53.590> a<00:00:53.649> way<00:00:53.770> to

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
directly attached to it so it's a way to

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.530 
directly attached to it so it's a way to
directly<00:00:54.010> give<00:00:54.430> the<00:00:54.550> chemotherapy<00:00:55.180> to<00:00:55.420> the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
directly give the chemotherapy to the

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.930 
directly give the chemotherapy to the
cancer<00:00:55.989> cell<00:00:56.260> and<00:00:56.500> not<00:00:57.250> harm<00:00:57.520> the<00:00:57.640> normal

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
cancer cell and not harm the normal

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.340 
cancer cell and not harm the normal
cells<00:00:58.149> as<00:00:58.420> we<00:00:58.570> do<00:00:58.750> when<00:00:59.050> we<00:00:59.140> give<00:00:59.320> a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
cells as we do when we give a

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.590 
cells as we do when we give a
chemotherapy<00:00:59.890> today

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
chemotherapy today

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.090 
chemotherapy today
so<00:01:02.600> less<00:01:02.780> side<00:01:03.050> effects<00:01:03.350> for<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:03.590> patient

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
so less side effects for the patient

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.070 
so less side effects for the patient
able<00:01:04.760> to<00:01:04.850> tolerate<00:01:05.030> it<00:01:05.360> better<00:01:05.570> able<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:05.900> get

able to tolerate it better able to get
the<00:01:06.170> doses<00:01:06.590> in<00:01:06.800> its<00:01:07.580> given<00:01:07.910> through<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.660> vein

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
the doses in its given through the vein

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.560 
the doses in its given through the vein
once<00:01:09.140> every<00:01:09.410> three<00:01:09.710> weeks<00:01:09.740> so<00:01:10.310> very<00:01:10.640> easy<00:01:11.300> to

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
once every three weeks so very easy to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.719 
once every three weeks so very easy to
tolerate<00:01:11.990> and<00:01:12.229> convenient<00:01:12.800> and<00:01:13.190> doesn't<00:01:13.610> have

nearly those type of side effects some
other<00:01:15.440> chemotherapy

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.530 

unfortunate<00:01:19.070> that<00:01:19.190> a<00:01:19.250> cure<00:01:19.550> it's<00:01:19.910> a<00:01:20.090> way<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.240> be

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
unfortunate that a cure it's a way to be

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.300 
unfortunate that a cure it's a way to be
able<00:01:20.660> to<00:01:20.900> shrink<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:21.260> tumors<00:01:21.590> down<00:01:21.800> to<00:01:22.160> get

able to shrink the tumors down to get

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.800 
able to shrink the tumors down to get

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
some of their symptoms and in some cases

some of their symptoms and in some cases
to<00:01:26.480> be<00:01:26.510> able<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.900> get<00:01:27.050> the<00:01:27.170> patient's<00:01:27.590> ready<00:01:27.770> to

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
to be able to get the patient's ready to

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.130 
to be able to get the patient's ready to
go<00:01:28.640> under<00:01:29.090> go<00:01:29.120> with<00:01:29.330> stem<00:01:29.510> cell<00:01:29.690> transplant

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
go under go with stem cell transplant

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.440 
go under go with stem cell transplant
after<00:01:30.470> that<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:31.040> original<00:01:31.220> studies<00:01:31.820> the

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
after that the original studies the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.700 
after that the original studies the
types<00:01:32.690> of<00:01:32.810> patients<00:01:32.960> that<00:01:33.230> receive<00:01:33.560> this

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
types of patients that receive this

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.830 
types of patients that receive this
basically<00:01:34.100> had<00:01:34.370> very<00:01:34.670> few<00:01:34.730> other<00:01:35.000> options<00:01:35.240> and

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
basically had very few other options and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.090 
basically had very few other options and
so<00:01:36.050> this<00:01:36.260> has<00:01:36.440> given<00:01:36.560> them<00:01:36.770> an<00:01:36.920> additional

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
so this has given them an additional

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.240 
so this has given them an additional
option<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.030> look<00:01:38.540> for<00:01:38.750> potential<00:01:39.230> to<00:01:39.590> go

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
option and to look for potential to go

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.340 
option and to look for potential to go
on<00:01:40.370> to<00:01:40.550> other<00:01:40.940> treatments<00:01:41.480> in<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:41.660> future<00:01:41.990> or

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
on to other treatments in the future or

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.440 
on to other treatments in the future or
up<00:01:42.620> to<00:01:42.740> transplantation<00:01:43.310> in<00:01:43.580> some<00:01:43.790> cases<00:01:44.000> so

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
up to transplantation in some cases so

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.570 
up to transplantation in some cases so
it<00:01:45.020> has<00:01:45.050> helped<00:01:45.530> out<00:01:45.680> and<00:01:45.860> now<00:01:45.980> as<00:01:46.100> I<00:01:46.550> mentioned

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
it has helped out and now as I mentioned

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.580 
it has helped out and now as I mentioned
we're<00:01:47.030> moving<00:01:47.420> it<00:01:47.540> forward<00:01:47.750> earlier<00:01:48.380> in<00:01:48.500> the

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
we're moving it forward earlier in the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.500 
we're moving it forward earlier in the
course<00:01:48.800> of<00:01:48.950> disease<00:01:49.100> so<00:01:49.520> perhaps<00:01:50.060> we<00:01:50.390> can

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
course of disease so perhaps we can

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.380

prevent<00:01:50.870> patients<00:01:51.200> from<00:01:51.440> relapsing<00:01:55.000> so<00:01:56.000> we're

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
prevent patients from relapsing so we're

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.540 
prevent patients from relapsing so we're
very<00:01:56.540> fortunate<00:01:56.750> in<00:01:57.110> that<00:01:57.140> we<00:01:57.290> have<00:01:57.620> a<00:01:58.010> lot<00:01:58.520> of

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
very fortunate in that we have a lot of

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.180 
very fortunate in that we have a lot of
potential<00:01:59.300> to<00:01:59.660> access<00:02:00.230> research<00:02:00.710> clinical

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
trials to be able to get those

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.360 
trials to be able to get those
treatments<00:02:03.200> for<00:02:03.410> our<00:02:03.530> patients<00:02:03.710> years

earlier than they could other ways to

receive them and that it not only helps
the<00:02:08.450> you<00:02:08.720> know<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.899> research<00:02:09.230> but<00:02:09.440> also<00:02:09.470> the

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
the you know the research but also the

as<00:02:11.870> well<00:02:11.900> we<00:02:12.800> participated<00:02:13.400> in<00:02:13.760> some<00:02:14.000> of<00:02:14.090> the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
as well we participated in some of the

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.090 
as well we participated in some of the
clinical<00:02:14.300> trials<00:02:14.930> with<00:02:15.440> respect<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
clinical trials with respect to the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
treatment being given after the patients

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.740 
treatment being given after the patients
had<00:02:17.990> failed<00:02:18.230> other<00:02:18.500> treatments<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.750> that

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
had failed other treatments and that

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.780 
had failed other treatments and that
eventually<00:02:21.500> course<00:02:21.860> led<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.130> its<00:02:22.280> approval

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
eventually course led to its approval

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.490 
eventually course led to its approval
and<00:02:23.150> they<00:02:23.720> are<00:02:23.780> going<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:23.959> be<00:02:24.080> doing<00:02:24.170> further

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
and they are going to be doing further

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.080 
and they are going to be doing further
clinical<00:02:24.740> trials<00:02:25.250> where<00:02:25.400> they<00:02:25.520> add<00:02:25.670> this<00:02:25.910> new

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
clinical trials where they add this new

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.180 
clinical trials where they add this new
promising<00:02:26.540> medication<00:02:27.110> earlier<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:28.070> the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
promising medication earlier to the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.770 
promising medication earlier to the
inner<00:02:28.459> treatment<00:02:28.820> phases<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.150> patients<00:02:29.660> to

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
inner treatment phases of patients to

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.449 
inner treatment phases of patients to
see<00:02:29.930> if<00:02:30.020> it<00:02:30.110> can<00:02:30.200> improve<00:02:30.500> some<00:02:31.160> of<00:02:31.190> the

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
see if it can improve some of the

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.490 
see if it can improve some of the
upfront<00:02:32.000> treatments<00:02:32.660> for<00:02:32.780> these<00:02:32.900> patients<00:02:33.080> so

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
upfront treatments for these patients so

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.320 
upfront treatments for these patients so
that<00:02:33.530> they<00:02:33.739> don't<00:02:33.860> have<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.130> feel<00:02:34.459> so<00:02:34.970> we<00:02:35.120> have

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
that they don't have to feel so we have

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.030 
that they don't have to feel so we have
physicians<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.500> researchers<00:02:36.530> that

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
physicians and researchers that

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.860 
physicians and researchers that
specialize<00:02:37.459> in<00:02:37.489> all<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.209> different<00:02:38.510> diseases

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
specialize in all the different diseases

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.860 
specialize in all the different diseases
and<00:02:39.380> so<00:02:39.680> by<00:02:39.920> doing<00:02:39.980> that<00:02:40.459> we're<00:02:40.670> able<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:41.120> be

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
and so by doing that we're able to be

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.740 
and so by doing that we're able to be
able<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.230> have<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:43.209> cutting-edge<00:02:44.209> treatment

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
able to have the cutting-edge treatment

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.940 
able to have the cutting-edge treatment
for<00:02:44.900> all<00:02:45.020> of<00:02:45.140> those<00:02:45.200> different<00:02:45.380> types<00:02:45.770> of

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
for all of those different types of

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.199 
for all of those different types of
diseases<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.550> research<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.030> all<00:02:47.120> the

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
diseases and research and all the

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.360 
diseases and research and all the
different<00:02:47.510> types<00:02:47.690> of<00:02:47.959> cancers<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:49.160> that<00:02:49.310> we

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
different types of cancers so that we

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.120 
different types of cancers so that we
can<00:02:49.580> help<00:02:49.970> many<00:02:50.420> thousands<00:02:50.930> of<00:02:51.020> patients<00:02:51.200> our

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
can help many thousands of patients our

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.520 
can help many thousands of patients our
research<00:02:52.610> into<00:02:53.060> lymphoma<00:02:53.959> really<00:02:54.230> began<00:02:54.470> in

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
research into lymphoma really began in

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.390 
research into lymphoma really began in
the<00:02:54.650> mid<00:02:54.950> 1980s<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:56.860> what<00:02:57.860> happened<00:02:58.250> was<00:02:58.340> that

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
the mid 1980s and what happened was that

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.850 
the mid 1980s and what happened was that
dr.<00:02:58.910> James<00:02:59.510> armitage<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.200> dr.<00:03:00.500> Dennis

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
we gathered the information to be able

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.699 
we gathered the information to be able
to<00:03:19.730> later<00:03:20.390> on<00:03:20.510> use<00:03:20.840> some<00:03:21.050> of<00:03:21.140> those<00:03:21.230> specimens

to later on use some of those specimens

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.740 
to later on use some of those specimens
for<00:03:21.860> our<00:03:21.980> research<00:03:22.160> potential<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.390> that<00:03:23.660> was

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
for our research potential and that was

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.020 
for our research potential and that was
really<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.959> start<00:03:24.350> of<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:25.190> lymphoma<00:03:25.610> program

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
really the start of the lymphoma program

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.680 
really the start of the lymphoma program
here<00:03:26.209> in<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.329> midnight

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
here in the midnight

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.710 
here in the midnight
she<00:03:26.780> has<00:03:27.230> continued<00:03:27.740> to<00:03:27.770> grow<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.100> expand<00:03:28.720> so

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
she has continued to grow and expand so

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.860 
she has continued to grow and expand so
that<00:03:29.870> now<00:03:30.020> we<00:03:30.080> have<00:03:30.550> over<00:03:31.550> 30<00:03:31.790> researchers<00:03:32.420> and

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
that now we have over 30 researchers and

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.410 
that now we have over 30 researchers and
we<00:03:33.260> have<00:03:33.820> probably<00:03:34.820> 25<00:03:35.390> clinical<00:03:37.120> ftes<00:03:38.120> or

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
we have probably 25 clinical ftes or

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.870 
we have probably 25 clinical ftes or

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
new treatments is that we're trying to

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.510 
new treatments is that we're trying to
attack<00:04:10.660> just<00:04:10.960> the<00:04:11.110> tumor<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:11.680> not<00:04:12.250> so<00:04:12.400> much

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
attack just the tumor and not so much

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.830 
attack just the tumor and not so much
the<00:04:12.670> normal<00:04:12.940> tissue<00:04:13.150> so<00:04:13.480> that<00:04:13.510> we<00:04:13.690> can

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
the normal tissue so that we can

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.240 
the normal tissue so that we can
decrease<00:04:14.140> the<00:04:14.200> side<00:04:14.500> effects<00:04:14.830> and<00:04:15.040> have

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
decrease the side effects and have

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.460 
decrease the side effects and have
better<00:04:15.540> anti-cancer<00:04:16.540> effects<00:04:17.050> and<00:04:17.350> that's

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
better anti-cancer effects and that's

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.110 
better anti-cancer effects and that's
really<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.800> demon<00:04:18.190> of<00:04:18.400> all<00:04:18.760> of<00:04:18.880> our<00:04:18.970> new

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
really the demon of all of our new

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:28.200 
really the demon of all of our new
cancer

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210
