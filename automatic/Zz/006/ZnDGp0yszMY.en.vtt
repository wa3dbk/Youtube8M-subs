00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.270
 at 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.280
 hi everyone amazed 100 case I hope that 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.640
 you're fine anyway I'm fine 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.490
 nickel 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.619
 today a new video on gta 5 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.619
 online so an information what the 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.849
 fuck about gta 5 on pc so that's 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.650
 a leak that came out this morning 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.540
 look at the first image so like 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.140
 you know I was at 5 on pc sort 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.360
 shortly 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.070
 so he goes out on April 14 in a little 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.200
 less than a week and so the shops 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.149
 are therefore obliged to receive the games 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.260
 watch this picture haunts the games are 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.260
 arrived in stores 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.800
 here is the box of gta 5 on pc she is 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.719
 huge 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.160
 limit one could one could imagine 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.090
 that there is a gift inside wants 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.559
 that it's the third time he's 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.480
 does not open has bought the game but it is not 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.800
 not there for this video is actually so 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.690
 look at the second picture I have you 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.870
 put under the eyes a priori in this 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.730
 boot of gta 5 on pc there would be 7 dvd 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.649
 for the bath to install 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.210
 frankly it's really huge 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.440
 so I do not think these images are 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.020
 facts she angered anyway 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.670
 enough pretty true and in addition a person 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.260
 would have fun doing fake it 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.210
 would not have done 60 boxes as we could 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.860
 see on the first picture and 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.550
 frankly it's really a content 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.840
 huge 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.430
 we had already made a short video 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.189
 information previously for you 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.380
 so show the game would weigh about 65 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.600
 gas on pc is therefore not for 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.009
 install 65 giga it takes pretty much 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.670
 so 7 dvd as they put it in 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.229
 this box 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.100
 frankly it's really what the fuck 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.689
 I do not think they have games that 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.130
 have already gone out and there has been 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.509
 as much to give in the box 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.399
 I think it's a first and that 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.509
 beats all records grand theft auto 5 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.130
 frankly it's really a game that 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.030
 amazed us for over a year and 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.070
 It's not over 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.780
 the pc version just arrived she is 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.979
 not even out yet we start 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.789
 already speak frankly that's 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.649
 really huge 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.640
 do not hesitate to let go of 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.409
 blue thumbs if you agree with 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.509
 me it's frankly it's really a 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.369
 crazy thing 7 dvd in the same box 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.469
 to install a game I think it's 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.909
 really never seen before and here we are 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.960
 finish this day with some information 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.430
