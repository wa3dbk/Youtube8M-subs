00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.460
 hi all guys are needles from 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.620
 she is here today in a new video 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.580
 where I wanted to talk about a topic a 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.170
 a little delicate or cm 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.119
 in fact guys that the e-shop spears like 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.699
 well you know it's a pay to win game 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.619
 so it pays to win because after one 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.650
 certain level I'm talking about town hall 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.779
 10 mass almost takes you by 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.810
 example a lot of money to get the 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.850
 so there is virtually no walls 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.760
 gm at some point becomes impossible 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.950
 go ahead so it takes a moment 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.110
 discuss how I see it and 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.710
 especially how to best use the 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.600
 indeed gems boys without earning 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.910
 without paying however you can 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.430
 get gems and it is important not 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.620
 waste them before starting with i 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.050
 advice on the use of gems I wanted 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.540
 just to say that I have nothing against 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.430
 demons because although not personally 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.430
 I would never spend my money 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.560
 idea and so in a game to buy 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.560
 of the cm to make improvements but 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.630
 rather nerd or 24 hours a day 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.520
 so now I personally wouldn't do it 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.370
 never, however, I have nothing against 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.110
 so-called gemonio ciaffoni or otherwise 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.870
 all other names you give him because 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.340
 it is only they who send us that 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.560
 allow you to play clash of class 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.760
 because obviously this is the only source 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.980
 of income 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.580
 in the super sel and therefore thanks to 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.320
 gems 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.300
 let's see the money at the game and then the 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.520
 game and will develop even more in 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.230
 obviously everyone is free to 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.090
 do what he wants 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.420
 so guys it's not like you have to put yourself 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.370
 to insult a show poses because it says 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.560
 emma and you are jealous and all but 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.900
 simply maybe it's one that knows a lot 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.760
 economic availability and therefore if it is 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.790
 can allow then one says but give yourself 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.410
 spigno those 40 euros what they are for me 40 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.780
 euro that I do not 2 trillion 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.210
 per year and then maybe this one 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.729
 situation if instead it becomes let's say one 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.050
 what spends the tour his salary 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.179
 in jam then a little something 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.850
 problematic and it takes a psychologist in 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.160
 in this case many of you instead don't 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.720
 let's say some of you gave me 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.400
 of the show poses they gave me del 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.680
 germone because because they saw that 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.010
 I had 2 thousand and 500 gems 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.500
 now no 2387 but we still say that 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.420
 those are the boys then as well 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.060
 you know I made a video on the bounty suap 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.860
 a banti is an app that allows downloading 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.720
 other apps to get credits and with 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.230
 these credits we can take itunes 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.660
 card 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.269
 I have no link in the video if you click 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.880
 on that link you download the bounty dates 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.910
 Also some a bit of credit to me 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.590
 so let's say i these 25 oct one 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.180
 warms up I earned them only thanks to 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.010
 so thank you so much 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.709
 and anyway it's not me money so I don't 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.780
 there are only gems but still the 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.489
 obtained thanks to youtube and we say that 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.160
 I will use them for youtube 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.989
 maybe for now I don't know how to write here 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.180
 below for what I could use these 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.160
 2000 gems maybe I can take 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.580
 not even one 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.620
 another 1,200 because I'm still close 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.360
 I get to know another card infantry 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.270
 so maybe write me below what 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.530
 you want jamie or if I keep them and me 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.840
 I keep them for life 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.090
 ok guys I said my opinions 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.740
 general about players now almost a 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.080
 knead things a bit more practical 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.030
 in fact many boys that is all 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.880
 we know the most important thing about 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.900
 Free lance flashes are the masons 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.970
 get to three masons and practically 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.340
 easy let's say we get there without it 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.560
 problems but get to 4 players or 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.270
 having a really difficult moratorium 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.580
 because for example the fourth mason 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.280
 it costs 1000 gems and the fifth mason 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.140
 it costs two my gems you can 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.210
 do it by quietly setting it aside 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.280
 in one two gems a day and you succeed 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.320
 to accumulate that we call and gems e 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.620
 you can buy masons then 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.210
 according to me you need with gems 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.730
 definitely buy at least up to 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.590
 masons up to the fourth mason if then 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.510
 you want to spare others 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.430
 you can also take five then 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.860
 this is the first thing you need to do 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.860
 with gems without first throwing them into 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.840
 water let's say guys are there 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.120
 other ways to use gems 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.860
 in fact, for example, we can use them 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.730
 to finish the construction of a 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.609
 building 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.549
 or we can use them to buy the 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.380
 then personally these two resources 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.870
 things these two options don't me 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.270
 they convince a lot and I 've never used them 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.240
 so in let's say don't do them why not 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.440
 in fact absolutely agree 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.060
 resources that are really a quantity 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.550
 that is, they are too many gems for so few 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.120
 resources so in my opinion does not have much 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.590
 sense 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.360
 as for the timing of 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.370
 construction maybe when he gets up 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.740
 start and you have something for example that 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.180
 end the night the night before if you have 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.400
 enough resources to put another one 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.070
 scam another building for example 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.110
 you can sea ​​that building 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.240
 the other building will be able to do this 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.340
 so you will have earned say a day 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.440
 on your timetable 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.200
 another thing instead that I think is from 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.390
 do with gems and rare envelopes 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.790
 barracks what it means this means 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.620
 enhance barracks training 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.680
 in this way the troops put us 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.840
 exactly in quarters of time therefore a 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.240
 calculations made more or less you seek 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.130
 attacked she returned home with the troops 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.830
 already facing that is really a thing 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.540
 epic and this thing allows you to do 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.240
 allows you to and do when you have 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.060
 lots of resources to do more 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.960
 attack the line for example vate 234 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.120
 attacks 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.980
 always being online and therefore not there 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.270
 steal resources he managed to do again 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.610
 more money 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.340
 so guys you can also for example 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.740
 if you have spells you would climb 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.540
 you can mar the gemmed oils from this 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.790
 tool also here yesterday, however, it turns off 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.240
 really a lot or even here 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.480
 envelopes the production of the factory 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.130
 spells and the game will be done 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.260
 same thing applies to heroes here too 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.020
 I advise you to always do busts 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.810
 instead of taking instant care because 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.450
 however, it is not convenient if the heroes 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.370
 especially if you are climbing because 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.160
 the heroes in the end is not that they serve 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.110
 much in farming then recapping 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.390
 how should we use the gems then 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.980
 bought the masons at the beginning then 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.620
 arrive for example at four o 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.390
 even if you succeed 5 masons and then 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.280
 the gems that advance the gems that you 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.710
 you will make week between cases of gems 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.330
 obstacles and removed and goals you can 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.760
 quietly use them in the barracks 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.040
 you can do either rank instantly or 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.930
 increase the production of barracks 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.490
 in this way to be able to do more 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.760
 row attacks this way 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.890
 you will be able to make many more resources 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.110
 last thing to say there is also a last one 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.190
 method to use gems indeed 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.580
 in decorations 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.650
 so right to be precise 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.539
 I have indicated all the methods to use the 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.970
 gems in the defenses 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:56.550
 if in the elaborations excuse if we go 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.319
 in the end we find this state 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.990
 imposing and the pirate flag that 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:02.849
 cost 500 gems each, of course 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.800
 these are just decoration then 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:06.960
 if you really want to Verona state 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.300
 impressive in our village all of 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.759
 turns off at 500 gems but these look like 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.310
 concerned with regard to the elixir 

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:16.139
 black instead I don't think it makes sense gen 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.969
 marlowe has always been one 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:20.009
 right tactic and go up to her has some 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:22.199
 taller you will succeed in making it in spades 

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:23.969
 without problems and therefore many of you 

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:25.530
 I see that they are moaning for example the 

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:27.960
 rhubarb for when they have to do it 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:30.060
 at the beginning the town hall level 7 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.400
 and in my opinion this name did not 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.860
 he did it because he was in black anyway 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.259
 league I have an idea crystal 2 up to 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.690
 masse review really steals a lot 

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:41.909
 so maybe now I'll make a video on 

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:44.520
 how to keep elixir black and in my opinion not
