oh<00:00:15.089> one<00:00:15.599> layer<00:00:16.170> height<00:00:16.640> which<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:18.029> course<00:00:18.300> you

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
oh one layer height which of course you

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.029 
oh one layer height which of course you
can<00:00:18.539> do<00:00:18.689> most<00:00:19.050> people<00:00:19.140> end<00:00:19.560> up<00:00:19.619> going<00:00:19.890> very

slicer tends to give errors saying hey
you<00:01:38.820> know<00:01:38.909> double<00:01:39.180> check<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:40.580> model<00:01:41.580> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
you know double check the the model to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.370 
you know double check the the model to
make<00:01:41.850> or<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.120> G<00:01:42.330> code<00:01:42.510> make<00:01:42.750> sure<00:01:42.870> that<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
make or the G code make sure that the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.590 
make or the G code make sure that the
came<00:01:44.310> out<00:01:44.400> right<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.880> course<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.180> checked<00:01:45.210> every

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
came out right of course I checked every

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.870 
came out right of course I checked every
line<00:01:45.810> came<00:01:46.560> out<00:01:46.680> perfect<00:01:47.130> as<00:01:47.520> usual<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:49.880> yeah

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
line came out perfect as usual but yeah

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.790 
line came out perfect as usual but yeah
it<00:01:51.120> is

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:02.490 

easily<00:01:54.340> smooth<00:01:58.620> it's<00:01:59.620> actually<00:02:01.050> it<00:02:02.050> doesn't

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
easily smooth it's actually it doesn't

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.620 
easily smooth it's actually it doesn't
even<00:02:02.590> feel<00:02:02.950> like<00:02:03.010> you<00:02:03.700> use<00:02:03.790> deposit<00:02:04.270> method<00:02:04.390> it

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
even feel like you use deposit method it

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.230 
even feel like you use deposit method it
actually<00:02:04.960> feels<00:02:05.170> more<00:02:05.560> life<00:02:05.800> out<00:02:05.980> of<00:02:06.040> it<00:02:06.250> to

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
actually feels more life out of it to

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.130 
actually feels more life out of it to
the<00:02:07.360> touch<00:02:07.570> I<00:02:09.270> mean<00:02:10.270> it<00:02:10.420> has<00:02:10.570> that<00:02:10.720> rough

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
the touch I mean it has that rough

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.990 
the touch I mean it has that rough
feeling<00:02:11.650> but<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:11.830> really<00:02:12.310> you<00:02:12.490> can<00:02:12.700> feel

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
feeling but you really you can feel

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.110 
feeling but you really you can feel
almost<00:02:13.720> as<00:02:14.170> much<00:02:14.350> rich<00:02:15.010> almost<00:02:15.820> as<00:02:16.000> many

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
almost as much rich almost as many

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.720 
almost as much rich almost as many
ridges<00:02:16.390> this<00:02:16.720> way<00:02:16.900> as<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.140> can<00:02:17.380> that<00:02:17.530> way<00:02:17.730> so

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
ridges this way as you can that way so

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.380 
ridges this way as you can that way so
it<00:02:18.970> feels<00:02:19.450> completely<00:02:20.020> uniform<00:02:20.850> but<00:02:21.850> anyway<00:02:22.210> I

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
it feels completely uniform but anyway I

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.100 
it feels completely uniform but anyway I
wanted<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.320> share<00:02:23.470> have<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.950> good<00:02:24.040> day
