 update the exhale electro with 3.0 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.910
 we are in may 2013 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.160
 they say an update of the 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.860
 xbox system and you reject them you can not 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.890
 connect to xbox live we are going to 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.890
 update the xbox risking the lt 3.0 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.030
 let's see what dates to hours 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:38.880
 now it is higher lg of 2013 but the 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.870
 television and the really update the 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.699
 xbox 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.699
 let's select yes 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.129
 we are not going to wait for a moment 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.620
 and this said 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.489
 he said quiet 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.680
 to start loading and return with 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.830
 you waiting for not having to pay 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.570
 again the 50 dollars to update 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.010
 the xbox 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.170
 again if this happens something 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.550
 bojan has finished updating we are going to 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.050
 see what happens 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.050
 I think I'm already regretting 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.750
 let's see if I did not erase anything 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.750
 Cross your fingers to the music 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.520
 it tells me why I update it without and I have 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.940
 xbox live for the moment we have to 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.940
 to buy 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.990
 to see if he has not deleted anything because of 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.990
 true so much 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.570
 while the update is possible 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.750
 be necessary after the console 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.370
 it restarts 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.390
 I still need good return with you 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.440
 I think he was already in the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.440
 list update 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.200
 I have finished the update 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.749
 let's see what happened 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.980
 let's hope nothing is deleted 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.600
 I imagine it is updated 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.090
 There is the halo 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.090
 steele at 4 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:50.439
 newly updated 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.439
 and has the 3.0 lt 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.640
 the poetry 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.130
 they do not notice much difference 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.330
 yes 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.780
 Well I think that's all apparently if 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.780
 works well 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.770
 goodbye
