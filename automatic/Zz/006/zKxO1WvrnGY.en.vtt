00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.220
 offer us euro countries after he did this World Cup in his own country in Rotterdam 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.729
 for you the ambiance 

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:14.309
 yes it have yes i have never experienced tss such a in such a tournament 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.579
 a team competition and qualification 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:20.139
 and then usually richer and abroad, if so the qualifications are not very good 

00:00:20.139 --> 00:00:21.679
 interesting little audience 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.849
 and certainly not for you and it just had a lot of people there 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.710
 everyone health and juice an enthusiast and 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.579
 yes see also it is also just as a good friend does the resumed applause 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.110
 even if it went a little less extra brave and well that hung 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.570
 oh well had a good influence on designing in the early years directly on you 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.300
 favorite part how it sounds 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.510
 also it didn't go reasonably but not super 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.530
 yes yes if i look there after a few years few weeks ago was happy with it 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.270
 perhaps but the last few weeks just very well trained after that too 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.260
 heather yes the training for the match he was super 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.210
 and he still likes ing 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.910
 from the lead though in the spotlight plan thereby, diandra is three tenths lower 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.530
 then planned or adjusted a bit and you also just need cleanliness and not what 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.040
 I had expected it was actually not one for me 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.270
 very nice condition 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.780
 but yes it is time that pink snowfall for team estate r15 tdi to sail 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.060
 well so i will continue in one of the very best with you already 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.130
 yes the preses that it is business for the fasting month of ten games 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.720
 not even half of the qualifications was a bit of an estimate 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.110
 do you think you can place for the device final 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.280
 but it is possible they took the people second 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.610
 that says the ball looks good but yes you also know that there is still a lot 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.140
 for boys who can just aim above the site yes what 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.890
 is unfeasible and 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.030
 and that very exciting day come in short you want a little uncertain whole 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.630
 look around if you have a movie 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.180
 it's going to be very good after the competitors thorn 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.409
 after that I fall not so happy to, among other things, as a team that still drivers 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.240
 leak out of the map and also in the duel, half of which 

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:08.189
 good from externally open ordinary to a resit 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:12.739
 as a team we are now there is no one to join roj i think it is pretty recently that 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.799
 He has awarded many countries to come but I think you don't want to go 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.689
 had to make it sure to ride 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.849
 if france spend too little but forgot to put down was az 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.239
 too good and I have not watched other countries either 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.950
 I don't know exactly what to say but I am sure this is enough 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.229
 for out at 24 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:33.539
 this competition but due to all the commotion of the past weeks it is time 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:34.289
 come 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:38.089
 yes I think so but I think we have you would be just really good 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:39.810
 gone on slowly 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.430
 yes there are big changes just before there for a big tournament very simply every one 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.309
 training well utilized and eulex trained and 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:50.589
 and as a team he didn't tell me people these days with super super days 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:53.799
 done no longer the strong how come that maybe you should then 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.929
 home market wanted to follow in its footsteps 

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:57.480
 would drive afterwards 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.359
 there are quite a few with this and gives us head 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:01.809
 year 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:05.609
 because of the what is not really easy rob of course as the like something like that 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.939
 does not happen at all indeed with those with that distraction that it does not even agree with 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:10.689
 can have 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.729
 but precisely at that point and yes I actually see none there the fact that we 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:17.930
 just got a good workout and it got very good from a government so i have 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.379
 I'm glad we 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.650
 sanaa was a big stable team at the moment it is a pity 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.230
 that in the run-up to the tournament it's all about it 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.069
 otherwise it did not go for the beautiful event in yes the attention for you 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.180
 Of course it is a shame that from a negative they have not been measured about 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.469
 goes and well it is something nice in a world cup at home that is today at that hole 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:39.449
 feeling that it just doesn't fall back 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:43.429
 stas tournament is on the turn and yes a very happy one with today
