life book uh5 7 - this is definitely Ivy
Bridge<00:00:24.279> and<00:00:24.430> the<00:00:24.460> reason<00:00:24.789> I<00:00:24.850> know<00:00:24.910> that<00:00:25.150> it's

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
Bridge and the reason I know that it's

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.029 
Bridge and the reason I know that it's
Ivy<00:00:25.660> Bridge<00:00:25.930> is<00:00:26.199> number<00:00:26.680> one

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
Ivy Bridge is number one

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.410 
Ivy Bridge is number one
there's<00:00:27.519> the<00:00:27.609> 1.5<00:00:28.150> gig<00:00:28.480> nominal<00:00:29.640> CPU<00:00:30.640> there

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
there's the 1.5 gig nominal CPU there

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.500 
there's the 1.5 gig nominal CPU there
we've<00:00:32.110> got<00:00:32.410> HD<00:00:33.040> Graphics<00:00:33.430> 4000<00:00:34.180> here<00:00:34.330> that's

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
we've got HD Graphics 4000 here that's

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.950 
we've got HD Graphics 4000 here that's
in<00:00:34.660> Ivy<00:00:34.960> Bridge<00:00:35.199> and<00:00:35.500> the<00:00:36.250> 1.5<00:00:36.940> gigahertz<00:00:37.239> CPU

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
in Ivy Bridge and the 1.5 gigahertz CPU

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.430 
in Ivy Bridge and the 1.5 gigahertz CPU
there's<00:00:38.469> a<00:00:38.530> until<00:00:38.950> 7<00:00:39.399> Series<00:00:39.730> chipset<00:00:40.510> as<00:00:40.960> well

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
there's a until 7 Series chipset as well

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.860 
there's a until 7 Series chipset as well
so<00:00:41.829> definitely<00:00:42.129> Ivy<00:00:43.120> Bridge<00:00:43.420> let's<00:00:43.719> have<00:00:43.840> a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
so definitely Ivy Bridge let's have a

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.610 
so definitely Ivy Bridge let's have a
quick<00:00:44.290> look<00:00:44.559> around<00:00:45.070> the<00:00:45.370> device<00:00:45.670> though<00:00:46.000> it's

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
quick look around the device though it's

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.330 
quick look around the device though it's
definitely<00:00:47.620> a<00:00:47.649> bit<00:00:47.739> more<00:00:47.860> business-focused

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
definitely a bit more business-focused

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.540 
definitely a bit more business-focused
this<00:00:49.030> Fujitsu<00:00:49.690> and<00:00:50.020> just<00:00:50.440> slightly<00:00:50.860> heavy<00:00:51.309> I'm

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
this Fujitsu and just slightly heavy I'm

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.540 
this Fujitsu and just slightly heavy I'm
thinking<00:00:51.940> than<00:00:52.090> the<00:00:52.149> other<00:00:52.300> sort<00:00:52.539> of<00:00:52.570> 13<00:00:52.930> inch

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550

2 we've got a he's looking carefully to

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.929 
2 we've got a he's looking carefully to
see<00:01:14.380> what<00:01:14.409> that<00:01:14.650> is<00:01:14.710> it's<00:01:15.040> a<00:01:15.100> SIM<00:01:15.369> card<00:01:15.610> slot<00:01:15.909> so

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
see what that is it's a SIM card slot so

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.380 
see what that is it's a SIM card slot so
3G<00:01:16.890> capability<00:01:17.890> on<00:01:18.130> this<00:01:18.460> one<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:19.030> then<00:01:19.299> we've

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
3G capability on this one and then we've

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.320 
3G capability on this one and then we've
got<00:01:19.509> SD<00:01:19.960> card<00:01:20.740> slot<00:01:21.250> there<00:01:21.790> I'm<00:01:22.150> actually

integrated button into the actual pad

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.250 
integrated button into the actual pad
itself<00:01:38.710> feels<00:01:39.280> ok<00:01:39.820> nice<00:01:40.060> availability<00:01:40.600> touch

on<00:01:41.620> that<00:01:41.980> one<00:01:42.250> keyboard<00:01:42.940> looking<00:01:43.570> for

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
on that one keyboard looking for

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.110 
on that one keyboard looking for
backlight<00:01:44.380> on<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.950> key<00:01:45.220> but<00:01:45.400> I<00:01:45.430> don't<00:01:45.670> see

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
backlight on the key but I don't see

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.120 
backlight on the key but I don't see
that<00:01:46.440> here<00:01:47.440> I'm<00:01:47.560> looking<00:01:47.770> for<00:01:47.920> a<00:01:47.950> backlight

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
that here I'm looking for a backlight

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.520 
that here I'm looking for a backlight
button<00:01:48.610> no<00:01:49.270> there's<00:01:49.570> no<00:01:49.690> backlight<00:01:50.080> on<00:01:50.110> on

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
button no there's no backlight on on

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.410 
button no there's no backlight on on
this<00:01:51.070> keyboard<00:01:51.670> this<00:01:51.760> is<00:01:51.850> a<00:01:51.910> poor<00:01:52.210> eye

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
this keyboard this is a poor eye

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.600 
this keyboard this is a poor eye
it's<00:01:53.110> got<00:01:53.290> core<00:01:53.530> i3<00:01:53.710> written<00:01:54.280> on<00:01:54.340> there<00:01:54.490> so

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
it's got core i3 written on there so

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.160 
it's got core i3 written on there so
interesting<00:01:55.120> when<00:01:55.180> you<00:01:55.270> think<00:01:55.330> core<00:01:55.660> i3<00:01:55.840> and

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
interesting when you think core i3 and

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.540 
interesting when you think core i3 and
the<00:01:56.380> 1.5<00:01:57.070> gigahertz<00:01:57.930> CPU<00:01:58.930> nominal<00:01:59.800> CPU<00:02:00.280> up<00:02:00.400> to

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
the 1.5 gigahertz CPU nominal CPU up to

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.580 
the 1.5 gigahertz CPU nominal CPU up to
2<00:02:00.670> gigahertz<00:02:01.000> it's<00:02:01.690> kind<00:02:01.900> of<00:02:01.960> low-end<00:02:02.410> so

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
2 gigahertz it's kind of low-end so

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.320 
2 gigahertz it's kind of low-end so
although<00:02:03.070> I<00:02:03.190> said<00:02:03.310> this<00:02:03.610> is<00:02:03.700> business<00:02:03.910> flow

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
although I said this is business flow

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.970 
although I said this is business flow
because<00:02:04.540> it<00:02:04.570> looks<00:02:04.900> business<00:02:05.260> focused<00:02:05.710> it

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
because it looks business focused it

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.650 
because it looks business focused it
might<00:02:06.280> actually<00:02:06.400> come<00:02:06.730> in<00:02:06.910> at<00:02:07.030> a<00:02:07.120> reasonable

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
might actually come in at a reasonable

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.620 
might actually come in at a reasonable
price<00:02:08.410> as<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.610> back<00:02:09.760> of<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.119> there<00:02:10.300> it's<00:02:10.540> a

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
price as the back of it there it's a

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.230 
price as the back of it there it's a
metal<00:02:11.560> finish<00:02:11.980> they're<00:02:12.340> slightly<00:02:12.640> matte<00:02:13.030> with

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
metal finish they're slightly matte with

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.840 
metal finish they're slightly matte with
the<00:02:13.360> Fujitsu<00:02:13.990> logo<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.310> then<00:02:15.640> on<00:02:15.730> the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
the Fujitsu logo and then on the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.400 
the Fujitsu logo and then on the
underside<00:02:16.360> kind<00:02:16.690> of<00:02:16.780> interesting<00:02:17.290> you've

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
underside kind of interesting you've

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.930 
underside kind of interesting you've
actually<00:02:17.530> got<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:17.950> removable<00:02:18.370> panel<00:02:18.790> there

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
actually got that removable panel there

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.480 
actually got that removable panel there
so<00:02:19.440> this<00:02:20.440> I<00:02:20.800> don't<00:02:20.920> know<00:02:21.010> if<00:02:21.040> this<00:02:21.160> is<00:02:21.190> hard

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
so this I don't know if this is hard

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.770 
so this I don't know if this is hard

see what we've got in terms of storage

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.510 
see what we've got in terms of storage
on<00:02:35.680> this<00:02:35.980> one<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.280> see<00:02:36.430> whether<00:02:36.820> it's<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.270> SSD

on this one to see whether it's a SSD
yeah<00:02:39.520> well<00:02:39.940> it<00:02:40.090> could<00:02:40.300> be<00:02:40.420> an<00:02:40.510> SSD<00:02:40.840> it's<00:02:41.170> such

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
yeah well it could be an SSD it's such

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.900 
yeah well it could be an SSD it's such
difficult<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:42.010> tell<00:02:42.250> it's<00:02:42.459> not<00:02:42.580> a<00:02:42.610> quick<00:02:42.790> look

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910
