00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.060
 so our next felix singer 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.570
 went to the clinic near Moscow 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.890
 fath rub 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.890
 Pakhra old people from large its width 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.020
 rivers where more than 50 meters but 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.320
 pretty fish 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.610
 its water population kopecks jeweler 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.620
 sweet laurels 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.850
 university spheres klitschko rice for ice 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.350
 graduated priest bishop 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.659
 thus, according to the composition of the aesthetes, he 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.140
 buried clearly answers let's say 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.430
 Villa 1 goal 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.850
 of course there is no zander samara or 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.460
 sturgeon 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.550
 any anglers choice is big enough 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.719
 boxes will need quite large 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.549
 carp reaches if 10 12 kilograms 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.590
 come across and a good Klitschko 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.430
 to three and a half kilograms 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.240
 if politics is a big fee and weighing about 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.530
 four hundred to 600 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.310
 In general, anglers here have something 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.050
 to work hard 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.280
 the fact of the rub from the border of Moscow separates which 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.020
 some 25 kilometers 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.960
 the proximity of these cities sometimes 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.100
 in unexpected ways 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.299
 intense arba frontal load on 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.990
 the river limits the breeding there 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.640
 breed a special type of fish thoroughly 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.799
 familiar with almost all modern 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.799
 fishing tricks 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.529
 This video was provided to us by ours. 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:22.310
 colleagues from germany clinics which 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.919
 together with the firm Brinker 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:26.059
 make fishing programs 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:28.500
 about 10 agree comments 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.500
 does not need 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:35.249
 and as for the bream atom many fishermen 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:37.299
 I know that this fish is very careful 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.429
 therefore preparing for fishing should be very 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:41.929
 carefully 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.429
 as on any other actively visited 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:46.619
 fishing pond pay for the last 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:47.519
 three races 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.069
 means doom yourself to failure 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.819
 for fishing in the summer is not good 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.689
 any kind of cool 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:55.309
 useless 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:57.599
 so kind to our Russian anglers 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.539
 Shimicha but also get luggage 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:00.989
 and that's why 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.749
 summer glass 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.480
 feels diverse 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.409
 microorganisms and bacteria 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.959
 so the year thrown porridge through what 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:09.569
 some hour 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.399
 tire braga 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:13.869
 then it becomes a corner for the fish 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:15.529
 attracting fact 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.809
 in the summer to securely attract large 

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:18.689
 place 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:20.829
 it is better to use prikormki such 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.349
 other sports type 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.700
 they are of course somewhat more expensive than john caliber 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.719
 agility but then part 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.129
 the components are finely ground and therefore 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.529
 quickly eroded flow 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:34.029
 they do not spoil yes plus due to 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:35.520
 laxative content 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.280
 artificially raise about the fisherman 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.379
 dive 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:39.909
 one of the important additional 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:41.280
 components of bait 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.819
 is flavoring 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.899
 add and in the finished mixture with mixing 

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:47.019
 directly pond 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.180
 very important when mixing the inflow 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.900
 dry mix well sustained or 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.659
 viscosity 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.189
 which directly depends on the quantity 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:54.879
 adding water 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.090
 properly cooked 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.669
 prikorm as may seem chamber she 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:03:59.859
 great yo faces 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.599
 banks that are easy to throw 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.069
 required space 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.779
 check the correctness of kneading 

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:07.049
 bait easy as soon as she starts 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:07.940
 glow in the ball 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.620
 they are developing apart when 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.239
 palm toss 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.299
 adding water so that the mixture can 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:14.899
 stop 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:16.930
 throwing bait act 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.199
 its subtleties 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.819
 no need to rush to throw in the water 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:22.439
 cooked kamke first do 

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:24.180
 several control water samples 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.120
 to clarify whether nato together 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.710
 lure 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.330
 otherwise the device will help only some 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.900
 underwater bush or 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.169
 lying on the bottom 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.809
 in this market 

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:38.170
 last with more hunting for the month so far 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.460
 to a number in order to enjoy without interference 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.990
 fallen from the sky and you will be methodically 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.810
 beds one hook after another 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.810
 hint of horrors 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.660
 the ball is very well known to everyone 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.960
 cautious and therefore if I expect good 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.569
 biting will have to cut her 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:06.220
 take ozan and not some sort 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.950
 another big and strong jerk is better 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.170
 so as not to spoil the hunt to donate 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.770
 occasional prey and even vodka throwing 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.360
 her year to fend 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.430
 for them it will turn out hospitals 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.150
 but dear viewers if your 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.090
 potential mining is so costly that 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.110
 makes you sacrifice fishing rod 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.250
 then she can't 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.300
 do not command respect, so let's 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.950
 get to know the ball 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.409
 closer 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:32.979
 draw one of the most widely 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.369
 famous representatives 

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:36.769
 family of carp fish in the middle of the kindred 

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.800
 it stands out not only the form of a kind 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.160
 high ranking body assembly 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.610
 but relatively large in size 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.020
 nickname and contains three kinds of them all 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.199
 combines features such as high 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:50.379
 body one row pharyngeal teeth 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:53.460
 high but short backs very much the opposite 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.509
 long banal strawberries 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:58.900
 behind the abdominal fins is shaped 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.569
 at the edge of the noveatus uncovered with scales 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:02.659
 Kiev 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:04.839
 at the heart with a pointed front head 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:07.159
 reversed name reversal occurs 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:10.370
 from the bluish tint of the back coloring in this 

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:12.419
 the species is the longest of all members 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.509
 fin those places where was the main river and 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:17.949
 in lakes is rarely killed publicly 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:19.639
 on the contrary head front massive 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:21.349
 county mouth as ichthyologists say 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:23.339
 semi bottom characteristic 

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:24.919
 this species is very large and 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.050
 silver scented eyes so 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.759
 same as lead white-eyed rivers 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.599
 lakes who prefer fast 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:33.840
 current deep year only surpasses 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:35.929
 white-eyed lead fifty cases and 

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:38.319
 ipad maximum size apparently 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:41.800
 it is the largest only was caught in 1912 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.919
 year in one of the lakes of Finland he weighed 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:46.809
 one half kilograms 

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:48.679
 natural real things limited 

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:51.179
 Pyrenees in the West Alps for lovers 

00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:53.639
 Ural in the east here 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:56.019
 gospel and ireland as well as in the rest 

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:58.479
 white and barents seas 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:01.129
 about the same real gustera fish which 

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.639
 often confused yet 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:05.039
 the easiest way to distinguish between these types of comparing 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:07.960
 scales on different parts of the body 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.539
 ghoul piece of scales on the back behind the head 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:13.009
 noticeably smaller than yet 

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:14.349
 Iran is almost the same
