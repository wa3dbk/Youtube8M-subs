00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
watching in the background is a round of

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.600 
watching in the background is a round of
heist<00:00:07.410> in<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.680> hardline<00:00:08.010> beta<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.550> I'm

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
heist in the hardline beta and I'm

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.950 
heist in the hardline beta and I'm
playing<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.880> little<00:00:08.940> bit<00:00:09.120> of<00:00:09.179> defense<00:00:09.510> using<00:00:09.870> my

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
playing a little bit of defense using my

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.440 
playing a little bit of defense using my
akm<00:00:10.530> assault<00:00:10.920> rifle<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:11.969> really<00:00:12.179> dig<00:00:12.330> this

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
akm assault rifle and I really dig this

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.079 
akm assault rifle and I really dig this
gun<00:00:12.690> just<00:00:12.870> because<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.290> has<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.769> raw<00:00:14.549> feel<00:00:14.910> to

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
gun just because it has that raw feel to

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.180 
gun just because it has that raw feel to
it<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.420> little<00:00:15.630> bit<00:00:15.839> slower<00:00:16.230> rate<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.590> fire<00:00:16.800> some

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
it a little bit slower rate of fire some

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.160 
it a little bit slower rate of fire some
decent<00:00:17.640> recoil<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.270> personally<00:00:18.779> thought<00:00:18.960> that

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
decent recoil I personally thought that

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.990 
decent recoil I personally thought that
there<00:00:19.350> was<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.560> substantial<00:00:19.890> learning<00:00:20.760> curve

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
there was a substantial learning curve

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.900 
there was a substantial learning curve
in<00:00:21.150> terms<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.539> recoil<00:00:21.960> for<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.350> akm<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.189> thought

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
in terms of recoil for the akm I thought

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.820 
in terms of recoil for the akm I thought
it<00:00:24.029> kicked<00:00:24.269> like<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.449> sumbitch<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.019> start<00:00:25.619> but

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
it kicked like a sumbitch to start but

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.349 
it kicked like a sumbitch to start but
so<00:00:25.949> my<00:00:26.099> friends<00:00:26.400> disagree<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:26.910> said<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.300> it

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
so my friends disagree and said that it

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.000 
so my friends disagree and said that it
was<00:00:27.449> relatively<00:00:27.779> easy<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.199> learn<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.769> each

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
was relatively easy to learn so to each

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.919 
was relatively easy to learn so to each
their<00:00:29.250> own<00:00:29.300> now<00:00:30.300> what<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.480> want<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.689> talk<00:00:30.810> about

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
their own now what I want to talk about

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.840 
their own now what I want to talk about
in<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.170> episode<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.740> let's<00:00:32.009> talk<00:00:32.279> beef<00:00:32.610> is

in this episode of let's talk beef is

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.150 
in this episode of let's talk beef is
whether<00:00:33.780> or<00:00:33.870> not<00:00:33.960> hardline<00:00:34.469> really<00:00:34.739> fits<00:00:35.010> into

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
whether or not hardline really fits into

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.850 
whether or not hardline really fits into

might be resolved but it is my opinion

might be resolved but it is my opinion
right<00:01:00.840> now<00:01:00.870> having<00:01:01.559> played<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.399> beta<00:01:02.699> quite

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
right now having played this beta quite

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.690 
right now having played this beta quite
a<00:01:03.449> bit<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.989> having<00:01:04.350> rewatched<00:01:05.280> some<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
a bit and having rewatched some of the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.190 
a bit and having rewatched some of the
leaked<00:01:05.850> footage<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.479> trying<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.020> find

information<00:01:07.409> about<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.189> game<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.729> don't

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
information about this game I don't

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.539 
information about this game I don't
necessarily<00:01:10.260> think<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.590> hard<00:01:10.920> line<00:01:11.189> fits

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
necessarily think that hard line fits

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.969 
necessarily think that hard line fits
into<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> Battlefield<00:01:12.299> franchise<00:01:12.560> I've<00:01:13.560> said

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
into the Battlefield franchise I've said

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.679 
into the Battlefield franchise I've said
another<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.490> another<00:01:14.580> video<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.509> was

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
another in another video that this was

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.390 
another in another video that this was
probably<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.470> game<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.009> should<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.280> been<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
probably a game that should have been a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.730 
probably a game that should have been a
standalone<00:01:17.820> title<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:19.020> some<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.680> out

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
standalone title but some of you out

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.320 
standalone title but some of you out
there<00:01:19.830> may<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> different<00:01:20.580> opinion<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.299> I

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.960 
new modes it's a lot of fun it's
probably<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.710> game<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.340> will<00:01:41.460> pick<00:01:41.670> up<00:01:41.820> on

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
probably a game that I will pick up on

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the Battlefield franchise so let's just

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.760 
the Battlefield franchise so let's just
go<00:01:48.360> ahead<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.570> dig<00:01:48.810> into<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.229> little<00:01:49.439> bit

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
go ahead and dig into this a little bit

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.230 
go ahead and dig into this a little bit
and<00:01:49.950> let's<00:01:50.430> go<00:01:50.490> ahead<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.640> start<00:01:51.000> by<00:01:51.060> talking

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
and let's go ahead and start by talking

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.420 
and let's go ahead and start by talking
about<00:01:51.930> high<00:01:52.140> tension<00:01:52.649> which<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.070> map<00:01:53.250> we

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
about high tension which is the map we

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.950 
about high tension which is the map we
have<00:01:53.549> access<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.180> right<00:01:54.360> now<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> beta

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
have access to you right now on the beta

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.319 
have access to you right now on the beta
now<00:01:55.590> we<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.219> understand<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.030> is

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
now we have to understand that this is

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.870 
now we have to understand that this is
one<00:01:57.780> map<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.469> several<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> lot<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.640> them

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
one map out of several so a lot of them

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.910 
one map out of several so a lot of them
could<00:02:00.149> be<00:02:00.180> completely<00:02:00.630> different<00:02:00.930> remember

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
could be completely different remember

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.679 
could be completely different remember
when<00:02:02.040> we<00:02:02.130> had<00:02:02.280> access<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.850> siege<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.450> thought

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
when we had access to siege we thought

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.510 
when we had access to siege we thought
that<00:02:03.869> all<00:02:03.990> maps<00:02:04.229> might<00:02:04.560> be<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.280> now

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
that all maps might be like that now

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.130 
that all maps might be like that now
there's<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.850> ton<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.090> different<00:02:06.270> maps<00:02:06.630> and

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
there's a ton of different maps and

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.330 
there's a ton of different maps and
we're<00:02:07.259> probably<00:02:07.439> experienced<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.160> similar

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
we're probably experienced a similar

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.029 
we're probably experienced a similar
thing<00:02:08.700> upon<00:02:08.970> release<00:02:09.270> with<00:02:09.569> hardline<00:02:10.379> but<00:02:10.770> if

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
thing upon release with hardline but if

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.190 
thing upon release with hardline but if
this<00:02:11.580> map

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
hints at what future maps are going to

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.540 
hints at what future maps are going to
include<00:02:14.709> I'm<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.770> little<00:02:16.040> concerned<00:02:16.190> because

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
son let's go ahead and talk about the

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.339 
son let's go ahead and talk about the
classes<00:04:17.060> in<00:04:17.359> this<00:04:17.479> game<00:04:17.660> because<00:04:17.840> this<00:04:18.049> is<00:04:18.200> one

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
classes in this game because this is one

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:20.770 
classes in this game because this is one
of<00:04:18.380> my<00:04:18.530> biggest<00:04:18.769> concerns<00:04:19.419> there<00:04:20.419> needs<00:04:20.630> to<00:04:20.750> be

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
of my biggest concerns there needs to be

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.690 
of my biggest concerns there needs to be
some<00:04:21.079> rebalancing<00:04:21.769> of<00:04:21.859> these<00:04:22.039> classes<00:04:22.520> not

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
some rebalancing of these classes not

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.220 
some rebalancing of these classes not
because

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
because

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.220 
because
thing<00:04:23.350> 1<00:04:23.650> is<00:04:23.830> 0<00:04:23.980> P<00:04:24.780> necessarily<00:04:25.780> but<00:04:25.900> I<00:04:25.960> just

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
thing 1 is 0 P necessarily but I just

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.890 
thing 1 is 0 P necessarily but I just
see<00:04:26.380> that<00:04:26.590> there<00:04:27.060> really<00:04:28.060> isn't<00:04:28.420> a<00:04:28.450> point<00:04:28.720> to

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
see that there really isn't a point to

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.960 
see that there really isn't a point to
playing<00:04:29.140> an<00:04:29.320> engineer<00:04:29.770> I<00:04:29.980> mean<00:04:30.760> you<00:04:30.850> think

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
playing an engineer I mean you think

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.280 
playing an engineer I mean you think
about<00:04:31.210> it<00:04:31.300> guys<00:04:31.420> what<00:04:31.720> are<00:04:31.810> the<00:04:31.870> majority<00:04:32.260> of

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
about it guys what are the majority of

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.630 
about it guys what are the majority of
vehicles<00:04:32.710> being<00:04:32.890> used<00:04:33.160> right<00:04:33.250> now<00:04:33.370> in<00:04:33.550> the

our transport kilos perhaps the attack

our transport kilos perhaps the attack
kilo<00:05:05.620> it's<00:05:06.160> not<00:05:06.280> necessarily<00:05:06.700> an<00:05:06.760> attack<00:05:07.060> you

kilo it's not necessarily an attack you
know<00:05:07.390> it's<00:05:07.510> more<00:05:07.630> of<00:05:07.720> like<00:05:07.750> a<00:05:07.840> scout<00:05:08.260> kilo<00:05:08.590> with

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
know it's more of like a scout kilo with

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.030 
know it's more of like a scout kilo with
the<00:05:08.830> ability<00:05:09.040> to<00:05:09.250> shoot<00:05:09.550> a<00:05:09.610> few<00:05:09.790> weapons<00:05:11.040> so

the ability to shoot a few weapons so
what's<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.460> point<00:05:12.700> of<00:05:12.760> being<00:05:13.000> an<00:05:13.150> engineer

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
what's the point of being an engineer

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.780 
what's the point of being an engineer
you<00:05:13.720> only<00:05:13.840> have<00:05:14.050> a<00:05:14.080> few<00:05:14.440> vehicles<00:05:14.800> to<00:05:15.310> destroy

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
you only have a few vehicles to destroy

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.640 
you only have a few vehicles to destroy
and<00:05:16.060> in<00:05:16.150> my<00:05:16.270> opinion<00:05:16.390> the<00:05:16.870> only<00:05:16.930> vehicle<00:05:17.500> that

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
and in my opinion the only vehicle that

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.230 
and in my opinion the only vehicle that
an<00:05:17.740> engineer<00:05:18.190> is<00:05:18.340> going<00:05:18.520> to<00:05:18.580> be<00:05:18.670> effective<00:05:19.150> at

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
an engineer is going to be effective at

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.480 
an engineer is going to be effective at
destroying<00:05:19.690> versus<00:05:20.260> an<00:05:20.350> enforcer<00:05:20.920> is<00:05:21.100> the

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
destroying versus an enforcer is the

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.460 
destroying versus an enforcer is the
helicopter<00:05:22.120> but<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:22.660> helicopters<00:05:23.260> aren't

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
helicopter but the helicopters aren't

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.990 
helicopter but the helicopters aren't
even<00:05:23.620> really<00:05:23.740> any<00:05:24.010> threat<00:05:24.310> the<00:05:24.430> attack<00:05:24.730> one

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
even really any threat the attack one

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.700 
even really any threat the attack one
can<00:05:25.180> be<00:05:25.300> blown<00:05:25.540> up<00:05:25.570> by<00:05:25.870> shooting<00:05:26.110> at<00:05:26.380> it<00:05:26.500> enough

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
can be blown up by shooting at it enough

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.700 
can be blown up by shooting at it enough
with<00:05:26.920> your<00:05:27.010> weapons<00:05:27.460> a<00:05:28.140> little<00:05:29.140> concern<00:05:29.500> here

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
with your weapons a little concern here

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.350 
with your weapons a little concern here
about<00:05:29.890> the<00:05:30.010> class<00:05:30.250> balances<00:05:30.850> because<00:05:31.150> right

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
about the class balances because right

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.600 
about the class balances because right
now<00:05:31.390> we<00:05:31.900> have<00:05:32.050> a<00:05:32.080> ton<00:05:32.380> of<00:05:32.410> medics<00:05:32.800> and<00:05:32.980> snipers

now we have a ton of medics and snipers

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.700 
now we have a ton of medics and snipers
and<00:05:33.700> lobbies<00:05:34.120> very<00:05:34.690> few<00:05:34.930> engineers<00:05:35.230> because

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
and lobbies very few engineers because

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.680 
and lobbies very few engineers because
it<00:05:35.980> really<00:05:36.160> is<00:05:36.370> an<00:05:36.520> emphasis<00:05:37.030> on<00:05:37.240> the<00:05:37.450> vehicle

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
now last thing I want to talk about guys

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.040 
now last thing I want to talk about guys
before<00:06:12.539> I<00:06:12.810> shut<00:06:13.349> off<00:06:13.400> this<00:06:14.400> video<00:06:14.849> is<00:06:15.300> I<00:06:15.870> just

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
before I shut off this video is I just

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.689 
before I shut off this video is I just
want<00:06:16.199> to<00:06:16.319> reiterate<00:06:16.470> this<00:06:17.129> player<00:06:17.430> count

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 
want to reiterate this player count

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:20.330

thing we've only had access to 32

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.520 
thing we've only had access to 32
players<00:06:20.580> so<00:06:21.180> new<00:06:21.330> maps<00:06:21.599> might<00:06:22.080> be<00:06:22.289> able<00:06:22.379> to
