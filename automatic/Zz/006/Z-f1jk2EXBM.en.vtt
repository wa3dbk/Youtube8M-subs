00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.620 
see me get try and get the top speed on
this<00:01:21.330> do<00:01:22.170> note<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:23.490> car<00:01:23.820> was<00:01:24.030> not<00:01:24.240> built

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
this do note that this car was not built

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.990 
this do note that this car was not built
as<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.900> race<00:01:25.439> build<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.070> was<00:01:26.220> built<00:01:26.460> as<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> drift

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
as a race build it was built as a drift

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.149 
as a race build it was built as a drift
build<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.630> there's<00:01:28.290> not<00:01:28.439> gonna<00:01:28.619> me<00:01:28.770> too<00:01:29.040> much

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
build so there's not gonna me too much

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.600 
build so there's not gonna me too much
of<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.369> difference<00:01:29.729> but<00:01:29.939> there<00:01:30.360> will<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.869> a

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
of a difference but there will be a

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.090 
of a difference but there will be a
small<00:01:32.610> small<00:01:33.180> difference<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.350> anyway<00:01:34.680> here<00:01:35.009> we

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
small small difference so anyway here we

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.600 
small small difference so anyway here we
go<00:01:35.869> we<00:01:36.869> got<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.200> burnout<00:01:37.710> almost<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.400> on

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
go we got that burnout almost like on

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.670 
go we got that burnout almost like on
every<00:01:38.850> car<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.600> game

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
every car in this game

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.680 
every car in this game
and<00:01:41.770> let's<00:01:42.310> switch<00:01:42.550> up<00:01:42.730> a<00:01:42.790> couple<00:01:43.000> of<00:01:43.120> use<00:01:43.390> here

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
and let's switch up a couple of use here

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.730 
and let's switch up a couple of use here
the<00:01:44.320> Silvia<00:01:44.800> is<00:01:45.010> a<00:01:45.040> right-hand<00:01:45.790> drive<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:50.560> I'm

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
the Silvia is a right-hand drive if I'm

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.310 
the Silvia is a right-hand drive if I'm
mistaken<00:01:50.920> I<00:01:51.670> believe<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:52.420> last<00:01:52.660> time<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:53.020> tried

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
mistaken I believe the last time I tried

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.220 
mistaken I believe the last time I tried
this<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.770> car<00:01:53.980> talked<00:01:54.220> how<00:01:54.370> that<00:01:54.550> -<00:01:54.760> of<00:01:54.970> -<00:01:55.230> but

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
this the car talked how that - of - but

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.480 
this the car talked how that - of - but
maybe<00:01:56.590> I<00:01:56.740> was<00:01:56.920> wrong

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
maybe I was wrong

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.530 
maybe I was wrong

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
we'll see it might have been actually

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.150 
we'll see it might have been actually
one<00:02:01.780> of<00:02:01.870> my<00:02:01.960> other<00:02:02.140> cars<00:02:02.530> but<00:02:02.830> I'm<00:02:02.890> not

is<00:03:24.959> but<00:03:25.489> yeah<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.700> was<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:27.120> don't<00:03:28.049> know<00:03:28.109> it<00:03:28.230> was

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
is but yeah it was I don't know it was

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.920 
is but yeah it was I don't know it was
just<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.590> little<00:03:28.739> bit<00:03:28.889> difficult<00:03:29.160> for<00:03:29.549> me<00:03:29.849> and<00:03:30.209> I

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
just a little bit difficult for me and I

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.620 
just a little bit difficult for me and I
don't<00:03:31.440> know<00:03:31.680> like<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.519> said<00:03:32.579> I'm<00:03:33.030> not<00:03:33.180> sure<00:03:33.389> why

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
don't know like I said I'm not sure why

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.099 
don't know like I said I'm not sure why
because<00:03:34.819> it's<00:03:35.819> almost<00:03:36.090> like<00:03:36.299> for<00:03:36.599> me<00:03:36.750> whenever

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
because it's almost like for me whenever

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.960 
because it's almost like for me whenever
it<00:03:37.560> might<00:03:37.739> be<00:03:37.859> my<00:03:38.010> analog<00:03:38.400> stick<00:03:38.639> so<00:03:38.760> I'm<00:03:38.849> not

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
it might be my analog stick so I'm not

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.509 
it might be my analog stick so I'm not
sure<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.299> car<00:03:42.630> itself<00:03:43.200> actually<00:03:44.160> turns

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
sure the the car itself actually turns

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.620 
sure the the car itself actually turns
on<00:03:44.760> its<00:03:45.030> own<00:03:45.299> sometimes<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.819> I<00:03:47.819> have<00:03:47.970> no<00:03:48.299> clue

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
on its own sometimes and I have no clue

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.009 
on its own sometimes and I have no clue
why<00:03:49.019> but<00:03:49.769> ace<00:03:50.190> it<00:03:51.090> has<00:03:51.269> a<00:03:51.299> mind<00:03:51.569> of<00:03:51.630> its<00:03:51.720> own<00:03:51.870> I

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
why but ace it has a mind of its own I

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.839 
why but ace it has a mind of its own I
guess<00:03:52.079> that<00:03:52.950> was<00:03:53.220> gonna<00:03:53.370> be<00:03:53.549> a<00:03:53.579> tight<00:03:53.819> squeeze

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
guess that was gonna be a tight squeeze

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.659 
guess that was gonna be a tight squeeze
but<00:03:54.329> I<00:03:54.389> was<00:03:54.510> gonna<00:03:54.630> try<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:54.930> anyway<00:03:55.049> I<00:03:55.669> thought
