00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.820
 hello sesame souls welcome this lesson 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.709
 theoretical 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.450
 I promise you he will not have too much 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:15.789
 it is for the very beginning all that one 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.850
 never done music theory we will do a little 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.750
 notes preview on the sleeve of 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.699
 how to find them 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.500
 already on the guitar sleeve and then 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.140
 how to be in this jungle of 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.030
 range is improbable notes for 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.369
 start here normally will show up 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.149
 larosace which is available on my website 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.609
 internet you see the link under the video 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.930
 on one of the boxes including youtube 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:40.539
 so you can go download this is 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.739
 gratos you have to enjoy and then to 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.479
 wise and explain a little how that 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.609
 market 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:48.069
 we go during these blues are not follow at 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.839
 we will not take a note on the rosette 

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:52.089
 and we will apply it on the neck as 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.219
 that it will speak to you a little more than if I 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.010
 you make theories without saying anything 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:00.329
 to show you not so if we take by 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.699
 example on the rose window the note of loneliness 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.530
 in the outer circle in practice on 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.630
 my sleeve 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.450
 it will give the first rope the rope 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.690
 half serious at the level of the 3rd freight that 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.790
 it's a single 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.320
 if I go up a half tone to do this 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.320
 are there so that's the basic sum 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.700
 I will go up a semitone at the level 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.820
 rosette that means I'm going to 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.649
 move direction larosace but from the 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.740
 guitar this time so that's fine 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:37.289
 give a single diez if I want to go down 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.600
 half a tone that will give me a fa 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.119
 sharp that you can always follow live 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.549
 there is no problem only you see 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.140
 that there are two circles in the rosette and 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.729
 these two circles in fact it's 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.250
 simply that on one side and the sharps 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.149
 and the coast and irritates flat to say and that 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.050
 means we'll go up a half tone 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.990
 oh well yeah that means we're going 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.600
 go down a half tone is for the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.630
 start anyway you can consider 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:08.069
 that a F sharp is equal 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.440
 a single flat so in the same square of 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.970
 same pie chart triangle 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.170
 the notes are equal it sounds the same 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.209
 thing if I do one and then a fa 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.830
 sharp 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.530
 it's exactly the same thing 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:27.989
 sound that if it does one is a single 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.910
 only downside the way of the 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.650
 handcuff and different and in the 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.930
 harmonies we arrange for it to sound 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.510
 about for sas writes some 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.579
 way sites and beginners get on 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.010
 do not hurt the important thing is we 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.810
 understand that it sounds the same 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.459
 thing 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.489
 so you understood it a triangle of 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.459
 Camembert it's half a tone and if I 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.140
 want to mount for example the only aulas I 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.610
 must go back two half tone 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.940
 therefore freight only 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.210
 only yeahs 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.640
 the 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.990
 until then I think he'll follow you 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.350
 have seen that if you want to make the notes 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.780
 so golden mi fa soil la if do not there is no 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.700
 always 8 years against each note 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.260
 that's what makes a range actually if 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.170
 the majors or minors we will give the 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.420
 color enough range is the spaces 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.890
 who has between two notes but for 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.310
 the moment we would like to know 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.100
 it's learning because we would like 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.060
 to learn is the notes on our two 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.480
 first serious strings of frets one to 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.160
 12 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.240
 and it is important that after my 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.440
 faith by heart because there is no 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.320
 so many other ways to do it 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.450
 so you 're just going to try to take 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.310
 benchmarks that is to say that at the 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.020
 first freight on the little board that 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.020
 will show up i think the m packs 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:52.830
 than at the first freight of the first 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:55.410
 rope it's a fact at the third freight 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.050
 the first rope is only one so of 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.500
 continued until the twelfth string the 12th 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.710
 rope 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.440
 actually it's going to be a friend the same thing 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.980
 it is the same note that if you ring to 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.300
 empty so as if you barrel was oscillating 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.800
 but only an octave higher a 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:16.550
 octave that's the difference 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.550
 between these two notes 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.700
 what I propose is to learn already 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:28.650
 the first two bass strings of the 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:30.720
 fret open beyond fans lash is 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.340
 until the second party you have them 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.170
 take and I'll show you in two 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.090
 big as we apply that with departure 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:40.200
 cohade is to prove that it is useful 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.180
 still here we are for power 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.730
 chords so favors qods 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.460
 we're just going to need the note 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.080
 basic for example 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.440
 the note of lonely if I want to take a step 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.419
 off ropes of alone in fact I'm going 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.180
 count my fees to arrive with the 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.740
 first rope on the 3rd freight up 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.199
 get the soil note you can see it 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.020
 down there so third freight first 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:06.330
 strings and that's it going to give me the name if 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.160
 you want from my port that a good power corp 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.099
 so if I do my power corp with 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.560
 the index on the first third string 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:16.870
 fred it's going to be no soil yet 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.400
 it works also for bars and with 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.730
 base 2006 I want to make a deal of 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.830
 single bar and I will place my index 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.830
 at first rope third freight 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.080
 it also works with the strikethrough 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.000
 based on that but maybe you have them 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.379
 not yet learned but you know 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.639
 that's why we learn so 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:40.199
 want to make a bar and based on the at the 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.400
 second rope third freight 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.979
 so if you see on your little diagram 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.430
 it's the back note that will make a deal 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.430
 barredo 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.850
 here it is that it is a lot of blah 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.180
 it's to be heard again in two months by 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.730
 example 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.070
 so I simply offer you 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:06:00.200
 to learn these notes the to let 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.840
 pause guard room and print the 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.790
 little laggard page is above your tone 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.040
 to see me when you are preparing to go 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.630
 at work in the morning and then from time to 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.580
 others come back to this video 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.180
 and that will kindly teach you 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:16.220
 first knox of two cars cat two 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.420
 first strings and that's it's going to be 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.820
 very valuable for the future 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.020
 she is that good luck I hope you 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.420
 do not go to nightmares tonight 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.400
 and especially do not hesitate to ask questions 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.990
