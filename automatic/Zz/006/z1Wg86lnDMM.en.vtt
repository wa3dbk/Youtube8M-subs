00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
what I had to read it like 50 times

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.730 
what I had to read it like 50 times
that's<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.120> beautiful<00:03:21.350> like<00:03:22.350> I<00:03:22.440> think<00:03:22.500> it's

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
that's so beautiful like I think it's

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.780 
that's so beautiful like I think it's
the<00:03:22.860> most<00:03:22.950> beautiful<00:03:23.040> thing<00:03:23.400> that's<00:03:23.670> ever

Winter's<00:03:33.330> Tale<00:03:33.360> by<00:03:33.840> Mark<00:03:34.710> Helprin<00:03:35.630> so<00:03:37.550> this<00:03:38.550> is

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
Winter's Tale by Mark Helprin so this is

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.130 
Winter's Tale by Mark Helprin so this is
just<00:03:38.820> a<00:03:38.880> chapter<00:03:39.120> that's<00:03:39.450> in<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.660> or<00:03:39.900> like<00:03:40.110> a

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
just a chapter that's in it or like a

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.220 
just a chapter that's in it or like a
piece<00:03:40.380> from<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.590> chapter<00:03:41.690> so<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:42.720> think<00:03:42.930> that's<00:03:43.170> a

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
piece from a chapter so I think that's a

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.230 
piece from a chapter so I think that's a
great<00:03:43.440> way<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.590> start<00:03:43.860> your<00:03:43.980> morning<00:03:44.040> is<00:03:44.550> by

great way to start your morning is by

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.210 
great way to start your morning is by

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
realizing that time doesn't exist just

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.380 
realizing that time doesn't exist just
something<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.460> we've<00:03:47.640> created<00:03:47.850> so<00:03:48.210> that<00:03:48.330> we

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
something that we've created so that we

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.420 
something that we've created so that we
can<00:03:48.570> experience<00:03:48.990> all<00:03:49.410> this<00:03:49.560> beautifulness<00:03:50.040> in

a way that that I don't know makes sense

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.660 
a way that that I don't know makes sense
that's<00:03:54.000> comprehensible<00:03:55.670> comprehensible
