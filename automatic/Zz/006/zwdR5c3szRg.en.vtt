00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.219 
you're standing on it I just I sort of I
don't<00:03:30.449> know<00:03:30.599> if<00:03:30.690> I<00:03:30.720> want<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:30.930> say<00:03:31.019> it's<00:03:31.169> the

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:31.229 
don't know if I want to say it's the

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:34.009 
don't know if I want to say it's the
same<00:03:31.470> polygons<00:03:32.190> but<00:03:32.489> maybe<00:03:33.269> at<00:03:33.419> some<00:03:33.599> point<00:03:33.870> it

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
same polygons but maybe at some point it

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.439 
same polygons but maybe at some point it
does<00:03:34.049> change<00:03:34.530> form<00:03:34.979> as<00:03:35.190> you're<00:03:35.760> going<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.269> it

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449 
does change form as you're going to it

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.379 
does change form as you're going to it
but<00:03:36.690> as<00:03:37.199> far<00:03:37.229> as<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.590> can<00:03:37.650> tell<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.340> pretty<00:03:39.239> much

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
but as far as I can tell and pretty much

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.680 
but as far as I can tell and pretty much
that's<00:03:40.819> that's<00:03:41.819> just<00:03:41.970> an<00:03:42.209> extremely

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
that's that's just an extremely

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.800 
that's that's just an extremely
scaled-down<00:03:43.319> version<00:03:43.949> of<00:03:44.069> it<00:03:44.810> there's

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
scaled-down version of it there's

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.110 
scaled-down version of it there's
another<00:03:45.900> one<00:03:46.199> down<00:03:46.349> there<00:03:46.699> that's<00:03:47.699> actually<00:03:47.849> I

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
another one down there that's actually I

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.600 
another one down there that's actually I
think<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.540> tower<00:03:48.780> in<00:03:49.049> the<00:03:49.139> middle

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
think the tower in the middle

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.570 
think the tower in the middle
I'm<00:03:49.970> sure<00:03:50.470> they<00:03:51.470> still<00:03:51.530> love<00:03:51.830> sailing<00:03:52.100> by<00:03:52.400> that

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
I'm sure they still love sailing by that

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.940 
I'm sure they still love sailing by that
tower<00:03:52.930> every<00:03:53.930> time<00:03:54.050> I<00:03:54.110> look<00:03:54.320> at<00:03:54.470> it<00:03:54.530> sometimes

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
tower every time I look at it sometimes

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.620 
tower every time I look at it sometimes
from<00:03:55.520> certain<00:03:55.850> angles<00:03:56.060> it<00:03:56.390> would<00:03:56.420> look<00:03:56.570> like

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
from certain angles it would look like

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.370 
from certain angles it would look like
it<00:03:56.870> was<00:03:56.960> leaning<00:03:57.260> which<00:03:58.100> is<00:03:58.280> cool<00:03:59.140> what<00:04:00.140> can<00:04:00.320> we

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
it was leaning which is cool what can we

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.580 
it was leaning which is cool what can we
see<00:04:00.560> from<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.830> other<00:04:00.860> side<00:04:02.290> here's<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.410> pigs

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
see from the other side here's the pigs

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.730 
see from the other side here's the pigs
here<00:04:03.890> yeah<00:04:04.660> yeah<00:04:05.660> there's<00:04:05.840> more<00:04:06.050> towers<00:04:06.380> and

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
here yeah yeah there's more towers and

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.760 
here yeah yeah there's more towers and
stuff<00:04:06.890> over<00:04:07.070> here

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
stuff over here

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.080 
stuff over here
I<00:04:08.980> think<00:04:09.400> that's<00:04:09.550> the<00:04:09.640> same<00:04:09.790> one<00:04:09.880> I<00:04:09.940> was<00:04:10.060> just

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
I think that's the same one I was just

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.790 
I think that's the same one I was just
looking<00:04:10.420> at<00:04:10.540> there's<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:10.960> something<00:04:11.500> right

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
looking at there's a something right

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.890 
looking at there's a something right
there<00:04:11.980> that's<00:04:12.160> not<00:04:12.370> too<00:04:12.490> far<00:04:12.700> off<00:04:12.900> there's

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
there that's not too far off there's

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.140 
there that's not too far off there's
something<00:04:14.410> way<00:04:14.590> back<00:04:14.800> there<00:04:15.030> Statue<00:04:16.030> of

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
something way back there Statue of

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.390 
something way back there Statue of
Liberty<00:04:16.540> well<00:04:16.900> there's<00:04:17.080> the<00:04:17.260> tower<00:04:17.470> yeah<00:04:18.010> okay

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
Liberty well there's the tower yeah okay

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.040 
Liberty well there's the tower yeah okay
here<00:04:18.670> we<00:04:18.760> go<00:04:18.850> yeah<00:04:19.720> something's<00:04:20.170> huge

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 
here we go yeah something's huge

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.970 
here we go yeah something's huge
actually<00:04:23.050> that<00:04:23.350> might<00:04:23.470> not<00:04:23.590> be<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:23.800> tower

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
actually that might not be the tower

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.080 
actually that might not be the tower
that<00:04:24.160> might<00:04:24.340> just<00:04:24.520> be<00:04:24.550> something<00:04:24.910> that's

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
that might just be something that's

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.830 
that might just be something that's
closer<00:04:26.880> I<00:04:27.880> don't<00:04:28.210> really<00:04:28.360> know<00:04:28.480> my<00:04:28.630> way<00:04:28.690> around
