Android platform for about two years now

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.940 
Android platform for about two years now
and<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.300> been<00:00:42.329> spoiled<00:00:42.960> by<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.410> Google

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
and I have been spoiled by the Google

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.549 
and I have been spoiled by the Google
integration<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:45.180> native<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
integration that is just native to the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.470 
integration that is just native to the
phone<00:00:46.770> things<00:00:47.039> like<00:00:47.309> Google<00:00:47.730> Voice<00:00:47.910> Google

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
phone things like Google Voice Google

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900 
phone things like Google Voice Google
Talk<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.050> Gmail<00:00:49.590> app<00:00:49.770> all<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.670> so

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
Talk the Gmail app all of it is so

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.850 
Talk the Gmail app all of it is so
integrated<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.719> seamless<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.620> just

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
integrated and seamless that it just

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.650 
integrated and seamless that it just
work<00:00:53.190> together<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.910> harmony

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
work together in harmony

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.510 
work together in harmony
whereas<00:00:55.050> an<00:00:55.170> iPhone<00:00:55.770> they<00:00:56.039> tend<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.370> be

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
whereas an iPhone they tend to be

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.950 
whereas an iPhone they tend to be
separate<00:00:56.910> apps<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.510> exception<00:00:57.930> of

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
separate apps with the exception of

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.920 
separate apps with the exception of
Gmail<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:59.309> just<00:00:59.850> didn't<00:01:00.239> like<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.899> much

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
Gmail and I just didn't like it as much

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.689 
Gmail and I just didn't like it as much
now<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.620> course<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.980> saw<00:01:02.190> something<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.609> I

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
now of course I saw something that I

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.549 
now of course I saw something that I
could<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.030> jailbroken<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.690> iPhone<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.379> got

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
could have jailbroken the iPhone and got

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.260 
could have jailbroken the iPhone and got
a<00:01:04.589> native<00:01:05.040> Google<00:01:05.250> Voice<00:01:05.640> app<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.210> example

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
a native Google Voice app for example

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.359 
a native Google Voice app for example
but<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.140> just<00:01:07.560> didn't<00:01:07.740> want<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.920> do<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
but I just didn't want to do that to the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.640 
but I just didn't want to do that to the
phone<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.760> means<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.060> stay<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.479> jail<00:01:09.750> why<00:01:10.439> say

phone it means to stay in jail why say
that<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.220> example<00:01:11.640> while<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.790> mail<00:01:12.180> app

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
that so for example while the mail app

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.840 
that so for example while the mail app
is<00:01:12.750> really<00:01:12.990> good<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.979> iPhone<00:01:14.460> have<00:01:14.640> no

into<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.850> Android<00:01:24.390> experience<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.049> just

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
into the Android experience that it just

works better for what I do now there

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.730 
works better for what I do now there
were<00:01:27.360> other<00:01:27.390> minor<00:01:27.900> quirks<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.439> had<00:01:28.590> while

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
were other minor quirks that I had while

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.140 
were other minor quirks that I had while
playing<00:01:28.979> with<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.159> device<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.640> again<00:01:29.939> it's

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
playing with the device and again it's

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.999 
playing with the device and again it's
not<00:01:30.240> about<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.840> device<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.439> about<00:01:31.710> my

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
not about the device is about my

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.010 
not about the device is about my
experience<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.299> guess<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.630> main<00:01:33.810> one

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
experience with it I guess the main one

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.600

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
that was really hard to justify was

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.719 
that was really hard to justify was
using<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.299> iPhone<00:01:37.049> after<00:01:37.350> using<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.130> iPad

using the iPhone after using the iPad

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.569 
using the iPhone after using the iPad
because<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.600> turned<00:01:40.049> out<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:41.250> as

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
because that turned out to not be as

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.670 
because that turned out to not be as
nice<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.850> an<00:01:42.119> experience<00:01:42.600> see<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.020> iPad<00:01:43.470> you

that's not the case for everybody but I

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.380 
that's not the case for everybody but I
suspect<00:02:08.369> that's<00:02:08.520> why<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.729> lot<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:08.940> people<00:02:09.239> don't
