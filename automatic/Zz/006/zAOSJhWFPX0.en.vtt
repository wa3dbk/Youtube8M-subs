for us to stir we got to stir the ice to
make<00:00:59.260> sure<00:00:59.499> that<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.920> culture<00:01:00.190> distributed

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
make sure that the culture distributed

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:10.170 
make sure that the culture distributed
throughout<00:01:01.679> evenly<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.990> chill<00:01:08.439> out<00:01:08.469> for<00:01:09.180> 15

minutes<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:13.479> stage<00:01:13.810> is<00:01:14.170> called<00:01:14.710> ripening

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
minutes this stage is called ripening

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.940 
minutes this stage is called ripening
our<00:01:16.750> 15<00:01:17.170> minutes<00:01:17.200> is<00:01:17.710> up

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
our 15 minutes is up

that's time for us to add our run it we
are<00:01:21.159> gonna<00:01:21.310> add<00:01:21.579> our<00:01:21.880> organic<00:01:22.630> GMO<00:01:23.079> free

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
are gonna add our organic GMO free

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:26.249 
are gonna add our organic GMO free
vegetable<00:01:24.969> rennet<00:01:25.180> and<00:01:25.659> it's<00:01:25.810> a<00:01:25.899> double

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
vegetable rennet and it's a double

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.300 
vegetable rennet and it's a double
strike<00:01:26.560> so<00:01:26.799> we<00:01:26.920> just<00:01:27.189> need<00:01:27.460> 1/3<00:01:28.420> of<00:01:28.979> 1/4<00:01:29.979> of<00:01:30.219> a

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
strike so we just need 1/3 of 1/4 of a

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.480 
strike so we just need 1/3 of 1/4 of a
teaspoon<00:01:30.520> of<00:01:31.090> rennet<00:01:31.840> we're<00:01:32.649> gonna<00:01:32.740> put<00:01:33.070> it<00:01:33.159> in

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
teaspoon of rennet we're gonna put it in

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:41.480 
teaspoon of rennet we're gonna put it in
a<00:01:33.789> fourth<00:01:34.299> of<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.539> cup<00:01:34.570> of<00:01:35.429> cold<00:01:36.429> water

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.980 

and<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.150> turn<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.990> pour<00:01:43.260> it<00:01:43.320> into<00:01:43.470> their<00:01:43.770> milk

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.230 

we<00:01:48.990> didn't<00:01:49.350> give<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.740> light<00:01:50.100> stirring<00:01:50.909> just

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
we didn't give it a light stirring just

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.540 
we didn't give it a light stirring just
to<00:01:51.479> make<00:01:51.630> sure<00:01:51.810> we<00:01:51.960> get<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.320> rennet<00:01:52.860> mix

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
to make sure we get the rennet mix

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.380 
to make sure we get the rennet mix
throughout<00:01:54.680> now<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:56.159> look<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.460> milk<00:01:56.729> set<00:01:57.030> for

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
throughout now we look the milk set for

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.730 
throughout now we look the milk set for
25<00:01:57.960> minutes<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:59.250> is<00:02:00.000> turning<00:02:00.300> into<00:02:00.659> curds<00:02:01.530> and

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
25 minutes it is turning into curds and

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.070 
25 minutes it is turning into curds and
whey<00:02:03.979> our<00:02:04.979> 25<00:02:05.460> minutes<00:02:05.850> are<00:02:06.000> up<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.509> now<00:02:06.930> we're

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
whey our 25 minutes are up so now we're

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:38.570 
whey our 25 minutes are up so now we're
going<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.290> cut<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.740> curds<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:38.190> is<00:02:38.400> what<00:02:38.550> our

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
going to cut the curds this is what our

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.940 
going to cut the curds this is what our
Kurtz<00:02:39.000> look<00:02:39.239> like<00:02:39.900> after<00:02:40.319> we<00:02:40.440> cut<00:02:40.680> them<00:02:40.800> into

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
Kurtz look like after we cut them into

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.080 
Kurtz look like after we cut them into
pieces

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
pieces

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.920 
pieces
shapes<00:02:43.459> we<00:02:44.459> don't<00:02:44.610> want<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:44.940> disturb<00:02:45.450> our

shapes we don't want to disturb our

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.130 
shapes we don't want to disturb our
cheese<00:02:46.410> because<00:02:46.709> you're<00:02:46.829> about<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.100> strain

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
cheese because you're about to strain

00:02:48.140 --> 00:03:15.899 
cheese because you're about to strain
25%<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.380> way<00:02:49.500> off

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.280 

now<00:03:16.909> we're<00:03:17.090> going<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.239> take<00:03:17.569> the<00:03:17.720> water<00:03:17.959> that

now we're going to take the water that

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.440 
now we're going to take the water that
we<00:03:18.409> heated<00:03:18.680> up<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.370> hundred<00:03:19.909> and<00:03:20.120> forty

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
we heated up to a hundred and forty

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.300 
we heated up to a hundred and forty
degrees<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.409> first<00:03:21.590> time<00:03:21.769> we<00:03:21.890> mentioned<00:03:22.220> this

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
degrees the first time we mentioned this

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.800 
degrees the first time we mentioned this
water<00:03:22.519> but<00:03:22.730> we've<00:03:22.909> been<00:03:23.090> heating<00:03:23.480> up<00:03:23.569> some

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
water but we've been heating up some

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.319 
water but we've been heating up some
water<00:03:24.019> on<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:24.349> stove<00:03:24.590> now<00:03:25.549> we're<00:03:25.700> gonna<00:03:25.819> pour

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
water on the stove now we're gonna pour

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.619 
water on the stove now we're gonna pour
a<00:03:27.069> little<00:03:28.069> bit<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.489> water<00:03:28.730> up<00:03:29.030> until<00:03:29.540> we

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
a little bit of the water up until we

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.259 
a little bit of the water up until we
get<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:29.870> until<00:03:30.799> we<00:03:30.859> get<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.159> Kurtz<00:03:31.459> to<00:03:31.700> 90

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269
