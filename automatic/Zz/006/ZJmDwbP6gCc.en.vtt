00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
buttons and it that's it your spin is

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:58.469 
buttons and it that's it your spin is
done<00:01:51.220> that's<00:01:51.729> it<00:01:56.729> choppers<00:01:57.729> are<00:01:58.000> more

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
done that's it choppers are more

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.039 
done that's it choppers are more
demanding<00:01:59.099> nowadays<00:02:00.099> and<00:02:00.520> I<00:02:01.060> think<00:02:01.420> static

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
demanding nowadays and I think static

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.249 
demanding nowadays and I think static
images<00:02:02.530> are<00:02:02.799> kind<00:02:03.189> of<00:02:03.280> going<00:02:03.579> away<00:02:04.259> because

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
images are kind of going away because

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.469 
images are kind of going away because
it's<00:02:05.470> so<00:02:05.679> easy<00:02:06.039> I<00:02:06.220> think<00:02:06.369> everybody<00:02:07.119> should<00:02:07.179> be

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
it's so easy I think everybody should be

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.209 
it's so easy I think everybody should be
doing<00:02:07.769> this<00:02:08.769> kind<00:02:09.160> of<00:02:09.250> photography<00:02:09.399> I<00:02:09.849> really
