00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Water is something she's always cherished.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
She grew up as the youngest of five children: all top swimmers!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
A motorcycle accident in 1991 changed Kirsten's life.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.000
Diagnosis: paraplegia. However, her passion for the water remained!

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.000
Kirsten Bruhn simply loves the feeling of weightlessness far too much,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.000
and so she began to return to competitive swimming in 2002

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
"This sport gives me an incredible quality of life

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.750
and a great boost to my ego from the successes

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.280
I've now managed to achieve,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.750
and that does me a lot of good!"

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.500
It simply feels good, too, to finish first...!

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Athens 2004: At the Paralympic Games she won 4 medals

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.000
including gold in the 100 metres breaststroke

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.500
her top discipline.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.500
The most emotional moment of her career, however

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.000
came a short while later...

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.750
"...and then everyone was standing up

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.000
and the anthem began and I thought to myself:

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.000
they're all standing for you

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.250
and cheering in your delight.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.000
You've achieved here what you never thought

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.750
you'd be able to do in all your life.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And I cerntainly had to fight to maintain my composure."

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The past is something she's accepted.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.500
She thus lives in the here and now,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
achieving the incredible:

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.500
like jumping from the starting block

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.500
despite paraplegia!

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.500
After six months of hard work came the reward -

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
a life changing moment!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.100
"And then when the whistle came

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.500
I jumped and I noticed that it really was a jump!

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.500
A really dynamic jump

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.500
that made me really glide through the water

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.950
I realized right away:

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.950
that will give you at least a second!

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.000
At which point I said to myself:

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.000
that's it, you're back to your old self,

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.500
you can do it again

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and there's nothing that isn't possible somehow."

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Everything is possible,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.000
and so she trains day after day:

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.250
dry training at home,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.100
for at least 2 hours.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
With enormous concentration and self-discipline

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.500
she's pursuing her major target:

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
the Paralympic Games in Beijing.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
She, after all,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.000
does not dream her life away -

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.000
she lives her dream!
