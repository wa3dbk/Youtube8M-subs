00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.390
 Hello 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.480
 to behave today we are going to 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.160
 make a tac that is called was front not 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.689
 we wanted to show it to the names 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.759
 but it is very annoying and good that 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.279
 She is also a mother or sister 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:35.290
 dog whatever and that is to say that it is very 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:39.070
 good at least they have a partner that I say 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.020
 Hi, I'm Juan Martínez and I'm helping 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.210
 to Juan because he is our dog in 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.860
 whole this is with some questions what 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.540
 I feel on the phone in my hand is that the 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.590
 world dog is much more asked if 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.590
 let's go to the questions 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.070
 well we work is called or how 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.070
 your name is 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:05.750
 it's called because that call is a dog 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.399
 obviously 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.970
 follow all the Pyrenees although still 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.970
 it's not giant 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.130
 want 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.930
 [Music] 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.030
 or 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.580
 he has four months two months 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.150
 well the strangest thing that has I think that 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.140
 I suppose that is that if it is very 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.140
 restless and so 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.290
 and I know that not all the time 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.880
 I like very much 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:25.100
 and that 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.610
 is sitting and we have it twice 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.290
 but the truth is that he learned to 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.090
 sit there is very little time like the 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:42.490
 first week really something else about 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.390
 the possibility although the personality is 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.390
 a little bit 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.820
 as well as good the thanks that I have with 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:00.690
 my pets is very significant to 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:04.990
 me but it's weird because it 's my brother and 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:13.810
 is that we were his brothers or 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:16.330
 we all have some but then to me 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.640
 son loves to bite and loves 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:23.830
 make holes in the garden which is very 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.750
 bad very very bad inside that stuff has 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.860
 shattered 10,000 pipes and then to 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.060
 his bed a joke what 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.060
 and good 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.220
 everything that I started when the part of the 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.220
 weather 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:52.650
 is already in front 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.100
 it really is very very restless but 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.100
 we are restless 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:03.640
 why 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:06.100
 because it's like that because you do not buy me 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.750
 the last course of forest when what 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.190
 we were and arrived at the house it was very 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.190
 quiet and calm and still 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:32.190
 and we 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.580
 thank you very much for participating 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.430
 [Music] 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.560
 well before falling of video I want 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.289
 tell them something supremely important 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.580
 for me 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.499
 good a few days ago I received a mention 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.279
 and I realized that I am nominated to the 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:14.830
 mtv networks awards and is not lit 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:16.899
 as digital of the year in the chorus 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.610
 that makes me very happy and really the 

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:20.649
 I'm really very, very happy, but 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.869
 obviously I could only win if you 

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:25.629
 they help me I'm very happy seriously 

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:27.099
 I'm really happy and also 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:29.139
 crazy I realized that I'm nominated 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:30.699
 also frank a Colombian twitter 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.349
 of the year and this also does too much 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.330
 happy to study two categories the 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.399
 true the truth is very difficult to win 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.229
 this is because the competition is very strong 

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:40.749
 strong more in one category than the other 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:43.119
 but that's why I do not feel only support and all 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:44.679
 your energy for that image that analysis 

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:46.779
 not while seeing all your support and everything 

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:48.399
 is that everything was to leave my health so that 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.819
