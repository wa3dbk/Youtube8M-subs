um<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:19.350> honestly<00:00:20.010> think<00:00:20.130> it's<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> little

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
um I honestly think it's a little

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.090 
um I honestly think it's a little
surprising<00:00:20.970> because<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.779> screamed<00:00:22.529> we<00:00:22.830> are

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
surprising because I screamed we are

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.830 
surprising because I screamed we are
teeth<00:00:23.369> walking<00:00:23.939> said<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.150> screened<00:00:24.510> against

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
teeth walking said I screened against

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.250 
teeth walking said I screened against
both<00:00:25.019> EG<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.800> tita<00:00:26.640> peed<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.720> determine<00:00:28.140> now

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
both EG and tita peed to determine now

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.650 
both EG and tita peed to determine now
determine<00:00:28.710> gaming<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.460> honestly<00:00:30.390> thought

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
determine gaming and I honestly thought

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.100 
determine gaming and I honestly thought
they<00:00:31.230> would<00:00:31.560> destroy<00:00:32.099> EG<00:00:32.610> i<00:00:32.820> was<00:00:33.660> very

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
they would destroy EG i was very

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.920 
they would destroy EG i was very
unimpressed<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.160> little<00:00:35.370> bit<00:00:35.630> if<00:00:36.630> you'd<00:00:36.780> have

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
unimpressed a little bit if you'd have

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.330 
unimpressed a little bit if you'd have
to<00:00:37.079> pick<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> certain<00:00:37.620> lane<00:00:37.770> matchup<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.280> you

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
to pick a certain lane matchup that you

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.680 
to pick a certain lane matchup that you
thought<00:00:38.579> would<00:00:38.730> go<00:00:38.910> very<00:00:39.059> much<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.390> favor<00:00:39.540> of

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
thought would go very much in favor of

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.420 
thought would go very much in favor of
the<00:00:39.899> other<00:00:40.020> what<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> surprise<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.010> moes<00:00:41.160> i

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
the other what a surprise you to moes i

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.880 
the other what a surprise you to moes i
guess<00:00:41.790> uh<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.660> guess<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.170> would<00:00:43.290> be<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.500> little

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
guess uh I guess it would be a little

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.979 
guess uh I guess it would be a little
surprising<00:00:44.280> what<00:00:44.730> mid<00:00:45.059> lane<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.570> mean<00:00:45.750> I'm

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
surprising what mid lane I mean I'm

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:46.970 
surprising what mid lane I mean I'm
obvious<00:00:46.379> Arsenal<00:00:46.620> Indonesian<00:00:46.950> government

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
obvious Arsenal Indonesian government

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.690 
obvious Arsenal Indonesian government
and<00:00:47.960> honestly<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.050> thought<00:00:49.410> when<00:00:49.950> our<00:00:50.520> son

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
and honestly I thought when our son

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.580 
and honestly I thought when our son
might<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.090> just<00:00:51.270> gone<00:00:51.449> window<00:00:51.809> mid<00:00:52.020> cuz<00:00:52.320> he

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
might have just gone window mid cuz he

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.090 
might have just gone window mid cuz he
does<00:00:52.829> some<00:00:53.070> crazy<00:00:53.250> stuff<00:00:53.610> right<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:55.100> think

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
does some crazy stuff right but I think

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.369 
does some crazy stuff right but I think
I<00:00:56.399> think<00:00:56.789> West<00:00:56.940> rice<00:00:57.180> could<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:57.629> even

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
I think West rice could have even

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.490 
I think West rice could have even
destroyed<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.789> takes<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.420> little<00:01:00.539> harder<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.109> was

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
destroyed it takes a little harder I was

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.490 
destroyed it takes a little harder I was
kind<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.010> sad<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.850> see<00:01:02.879> them<00:01:03.570> well<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.409> get

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
kind of sad to see them well just get

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.830 
kind of sad to see them well just get
pressure<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:04.979> hard<00:01:05.220> how<00:01:06.000> much<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.330> think<00:01:06.420> that

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
pressure so hard how much you think that

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.750 
pressure so hard how much you think that
it's<00:01:07.380> an<00:01:07.680> influence<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> play<00:01:08.610> of

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
it's an influence on the play of

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.670 
it's an influence on the play of
determined<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.330> Westar<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.630> seem<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.990> want<00:01:10.590> to

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
determined that Westar I seem to want to

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.700 
determined that Westar I seem to want to
keep<00:01:10.860> playing<00:01:10.920> those<00:01:11.310> assassins<00:01:11.610> Oh

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
keep playing those assassins Oh

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.679 
keep playing those assassins Oh
obviously<00:01:13.710> right<00:01:14.520> now<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.939> really<00:01:15.210> tanky

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
obviously right now it's a really tanky

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.200 
obviously right now it's a really tanky
top<00:01:15.900> meta<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.610> guess<00:01:17.610> they<00:01:17.790> could<00:01:17.939> kind<00:01:18.180> of

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
top meta I guess they could kind of

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.789 
top meta I guess they could kind of
covered<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.570> with<00:01:18.659> mundo<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.320> feel<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.650> this

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
covered that with mundo I feel like this

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.830 
covered that with mundo I feel like this
having<00:01:19.979> no<00:01:20.250> magic<00:01:20.820> damage<00:01:20.939> really<00:01:21.330> hurt<00:01:21.630> them

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
having no magic damage really hurt them

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.590 
having no magic damage really hurt them
and<00:01:22.159> it's<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.369> little<00:01:23.670> bit<00:01:23.939> tolling<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
and it's a little bit tolling to the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.780 
and it's a little bit tolling to the
team<00:01:24.780> by<00:01:25.170> not<00:01:25.320> going<00:01:25.560> those<00:01:25.770> uh<00:01:25.799> champions

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
know it's like my friends creating a

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.310 
know it's like my friends creating a
team<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.330> just<00:02:54.390> being<00:02:54.690> here<00:02:54.840> right<00:02:54.990> now<00:02:55.110> and

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
team and just being here right now and

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.320 
team and just being here right now and
having<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.830> chance<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.130> become<00:02:56.490> an<00:02:56.790> LG<00:02:57.090> Esteem

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
having a chance to become an LG Esteem

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.570 
having a chance to become an LG Esteem
absolutely<00:02:58.170> because<00:02:58.290> only<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.830> month<00:02:59.070> old<00:02:59.310> and

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
absolutely because only a month old and

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.760 
absolutely because only a month old and
then<00:02:59.760> we<00:03:00.420> kind<00:03:00.600> of<00:03:00.750> saw<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:00.960> Quantic<00:03:01.680> were

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
then we kind of saw that Quantic were

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.620 
then we kind of saw that Quantic were
very<00:03:01.980> favorite<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.790> be<00:03:03.240> here<00:03:03.450> maybe

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
very favorite to be here maybe

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.570 
very favorite to be here maybe
complexity<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.260> little<00:03:04.500> bit<00:03:04.590> earlier<00:03:04.920> on<00:03:04.980> why

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
complexity a little bit earlier on why

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.650 
complexity a little bit earlier on why
do<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.730> think<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:05.940> is<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.240> it<00:03:06.300> was<00:03:06.420> kind<00:03:06.600> of

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
do you think that is that it was kind of

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.300 
do you think that is that it was kind of
a<00:03:06.750> changing<00:03:07.140> in<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.260> gut<00:03:07.500> of<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.830> guard<00:03:08.070> in

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
a changing in the gut of the guard in

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.850 
a changing in the gut of the guard in
that<00:03:08.430> challenger<00:03:08.820> scene<00:03:09.030> uh<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:10.020> was<00:03:10.320> really

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
that challenger scene uh it was really

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.160 
that challenger scene uh it was really
unfortunate<00:03:11.400> for<00:03:11.520> contact<00:03:12.030> because<00:03:12.240> they

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
unfortunate for contact because they

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.830 
unfortunate for contact because they
were<00:03:13.290> by<00:03:14.100> far<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.790> strongest<00:03:14.970> amateur<00:03:15.600> team

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
were by far the strongest amateur team

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.710 
were by far the strongest amateur team
that<00:03:16.260> na<00:03:16.500> has<00:03:16.680> had<00:03:16.860> so<00:03:17.160> far<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:18.480> just<00:03:18.660> shows

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
that na has had so far and it just shows
