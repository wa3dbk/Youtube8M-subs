the whole background is to give it a

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.689 
the whole background is to give it a
background<00:00:26.720> second<00:00:27.720> layer<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> scoop

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
background second layer is a scoop

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.669 
background second layer is a scoop
you're<00:00:29.699> going<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.880> use<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.119> for<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.390> year<00:00:30.720> or

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
you're going to use that for the year or

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:32.870 
you're going to use that for the year or
make<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.980> black<00:00:32.189> you're<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.640> make<00:00:32.850> one

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
make it black you're going to make one

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.139 
make it black you're going to make one
copy<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.840> paste<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:35.040> three<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.760> flip<00:00:36.120> it

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
copy and paste it to three and flip it

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.150 
copy and paste it to three and flip it
so<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.469> reverse<00:00:37.620> image<00:00:40.010> so<00:00:41.010> then

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
so you have the reverse image so then

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.520 
so you have the reverse image so then
you<00:00:41.280> got<00:00:41.370> your<00:00:41.399> half<00:00:41.640> circle<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.120> layer<00:00:42.300> 4<00:00:42.719> it's

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
you got your half circle on layer 4 it's

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.889 
you got your half circle on layer 4 it's
going<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.710> be<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.950> head<00:00:44.420> for<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.480> top<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
going to be the head for the top of the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.119 
going to be the head for the top of the
head<00:00:46.460> layer<00:00:47.460> 5<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> full<00:00:48.329> circle<00:00:49.010> which<00:00:50.010> is

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
head layer 5 is a full circle which is

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.040 
head layer 5 is a full circle which is
going<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.309> be<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.730> face<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.390> base<00:00:51.600> face

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
going to be the face the base face

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.490 
going to be the face the base face
basically<00:00:53.420> this<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.570> going<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.960> black<00:00:55.260> and

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
basically this is going to be black and

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.660 
basically this is going to be black and
it's<00:00:55.649> going<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:56.100> toggled<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.000> outline<00:00:57.390> fill

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
it's going to be toggled to outline fill

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.700 
it's going to be toggled to outline fill
so<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.760> get<00:00:59.910> just<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> line<00:01:02.960> then<00:01:03.960> layer<00:01:04.170> 6<00:01:04.589> is

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
so you get just the line then layer 6 is

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.399 
so you get just the line then layer 6 is
going<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.920> be<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.580> left<00:01:05.820> eye<00:01:06.170> it's<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.320> a

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
going to be the left eye it's just a

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.010 
going to be the left eye it's just a
full<00:01:07.619> circle<00:01:08.040> you're<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.540> make<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.720> kind

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
full circle you're going to make it kind

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.469 
full circle you're going to make it kind
of<00:01:10.110> oblong<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.510> tilt<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.640> flag<00:01:14.909> no<00:01:15.240> end

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
of oblong and tilt it so the flag no end

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.469 
of oblong and tilt it so the flag no end
is<00:01:15.659> going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.869> be<00:01:15.960> layer<00:01:16.380> 7<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.850> got<00:01:18.000> one<00:01:18.270> on

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the other side as you can see layer 12

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.069 
the other side as you can see layer 12
is<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.829> full<00:01:44.040> circle<00:01:44.250> for<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.610> nose<00:01:45.079> and

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
is just a full circle for the nose and

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.060 
is just a full circle for the nose and
layer<00:01:46.979> 13<00:01:47.600> 14<00:01:48.600> are<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.899> eyes<00:01:49.079> again<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:49.710> just

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
layer 13 14 are the eyes again but just

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.889 
layer 13 14 are the eyes again but just
the<00:01:50.220> outlines<00:01:51.649> layer<00:01:52.649> 15<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:54.210> smile

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.780 
the outlines layer 15 is the the smile
so<00:01:57.899> fifteen<00:01:58.590> through<00:01:58.770> eighteen<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.520> same

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
so fifteen through eighteen is the same

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.719 
so fifteen through eighteen is the same
I<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.479> made<00:02:00.689> them<00:02:00.869> each<00:02:01.799> one<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> little<00:02:02.430> more
