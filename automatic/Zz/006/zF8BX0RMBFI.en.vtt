still<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.160> touch<00:01:29.250> with<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.490> car<00:01:29.780> you've<00:01:30.780> got

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
still in touch with the car you've got

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.360

mapping<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.340> guess<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.550> vehicle<00:01:35.880> dynamics<00:01:36.000> is

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
mapping I guess the vehicle dynamics is

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.420 
mapping I guess the vehicle dynamics is
probably<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.810> best<00:01:36.960> way<00:01:37.080> to<00:01:37.110> put<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.430> because

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
probably the best way to put it because

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.560 
probably the best way to put it because
it<00:01:38.550> changes<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.910> bunch<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.270> different<00:01:39.540> things

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
it changes a bunch of different things

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.710 
it changes a bunch of different things
on<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.870> car<00:01:40.370> but<00:01:41.370> we<00:01:41.460> got<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.820> convertible

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
on the car but we got the convertible
