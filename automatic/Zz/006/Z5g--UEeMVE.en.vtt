00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.700
 stop thinking only about you 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.790
 day to the took 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.890

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.230
 yes 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.700
 m 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:02.130
 it went well 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.130
 action stars 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:15.570
 I'm fine 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.570
 people 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.930
 do not tell me 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.149
 who gave him kisses 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.280
 guys some things 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:17.360
 s 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.360
 there are men can can happen 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.489
 the micro is yours 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.830
 What does it mean 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.900
 it can not be 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.610
 I think yesterday was more than clear 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.160
 of what 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.130
 that I was going to prove that you can go back 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.670
 to trust me 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.670
 Y 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.710
 I thought that if you had lowered my 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.630
 moon so I could download these 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.380
 stars so beautiful that today 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.380
 has brought for you 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.659
 and really do this and a thousand other things 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.780
 to be able to recover that trust 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:03.030
 again 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.030
 the trust that was lost 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.060
 good 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.440
 excuse the word but for being silly 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.880
 for being a fool truth 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.500
 and nothing in truth I hope that I have 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.720
 liked this surprise 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.250
 nervous because never in my life said 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.250
 this but I hope you liked it 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.420
 I want 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.460
 the girl 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.830
 is saying things that michelle 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.530
 share with us your emotion because 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.780
 if it was really a boy then not go out 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.030
 and sing and lower the stars I do not think 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.340
 make it easy for him too 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.459
 let's do a little bit too he is 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.090
 by exile and is not doing 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.090
 pretty Things 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.620
 I feel very excited at that moment 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:04.900
 it's really amazing he has danced 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.830
 even that the book is linked to 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.170
 dance 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:15.430
 if he has danced enchanted he has prepared 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:15.430
 all this makes me very happy and happy 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.770
 today we have not talked much we had the 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.990
 singing class and I felt a little 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.630
 bad for what I said yesterday no but I said it 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.690
 really because it was what I thought and what 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:35.560
 that I really feel but I think 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.120
 all people do do things that 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.380
 they reach your heart 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.220
 they touch your heart 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.220
 again yes 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:50.389
 because if you do not call 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.580
 in large not so big or so and we 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:56.030
 Excite I swear that even your little eyes 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:05:00.410
 they put glasses or why 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.410
 today not what he reads 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:07.120
 I think so 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.520
 at first to think about giving away 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.320
 the tulips but you have already lost us 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.360

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.639

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.100
 I only did it 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.060

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.330
 that I really wanted to do it 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:44.440
