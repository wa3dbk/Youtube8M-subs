00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
guys won't know I had a kawasaki Mojave

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.459 
guys won't know I had a kawasaki Mojave
250<00:00:37.280> and<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.760> needed<00:00:39.329> swing<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.719> bearings<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
250 and I needed swing on bearings and

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.139 
250 and I needed swing on bearings and
as<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.950> could<00:00:41.100> see<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.760> swing<00:00:41.969> arm

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
as you could see this is the swing arm

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.729 
as you could see this is the swing arm
and<00:00:42.329> shock<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.899> everything<00:00:42.960> off<00:00:43.320> my<00:00:43.469> Yamaha

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
and shock and everything off my Yamaha

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.680 
and shock and everything off my Yamaha
blast<00:00:44.070> here<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.149> do<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> swing<00:00:45.570> on

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
blast here and to do the swing on

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.299 
blast here and to do the swing on
bearings<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.230> did<00:00:46.440> exactly<00:00:46.739> what<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.160> see

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
bearings I did exactly what you see

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.670 
bearings I did exactly what you see
there<00:00:47.520> got<00:00:48.420> my<00:00:48.570> dad's<00:00:48.750> engine<00:00:49.079> hoist<00:00:49.260> lifted

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
there got my dad's engine hoist lifted

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.029 
there got my dad's engine hoist lifted
it<00:00:49.800> up<00:00:49.920> took<00:00:50.879> off<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.180> rear<00:00:51.360> end<00:00:51.920> replaced<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
it up took off the rear end replaced the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.459 
it up took off the rear end replaced the
bearings<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.640> put<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.969> back<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:55.230> sold

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
bearings and put it back on and I sold

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.799 
bearings and put it back on and I sold
it<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.579> therefore<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:57.180> blaster<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
it so therefore this blaster the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.630 
it so therefore this blaster the
swinging<00:00:58.050> arm<00:00:58.140> bearings<00:00:58.410> are<00:00:58.530> fine<00:00:58.829> all<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
swinging arm bearings are fine all the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.150 
swinging arm bearings are fine all the
bearings<00:00:59.969> are<00:01:00.149> fine<00:01:00.359> but<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.350> very<00:01:01.620> dirty<00:01:02.039> on

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
bearings are fine but it's very dirty on

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.920 
bearings are fine but it's very dirty on
the<00:01:02.340> swing<00:01:02.550> arm<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.210> since<00:01:03.449> I'm<00:01:03.570> planning<00:01:03.719> on

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the swing arm and since I'm planning on

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.050 
the swing arm and since I'm planning on
holding<00:01:04.110> onto<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> bike<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:05.100> wanted<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.880> make

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
holding onto the bike I wanted to make

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.359 
holding onto the bike I wanted to make
it<00:01:06.180> look<00:01:06.390> good<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.900> therefore<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.830> strip<00:01:08.220> this

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
it look good so therefore I strip this

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.000 
it look good so therefore I strip this
stripped<00:01:09.180> us<00:01:09.270> off<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.600> bike<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.140> guys

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
stripped us off the bike and you guys

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.560 
stripped us off the bike and you guys
think<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.430> lot<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.729> work<00:01:11.909> but<00:01:12.210> really<00:01:12.330> it's

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
think it's a lot of work but really it's

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.130 
think it's a lot of work but really it's
not<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:13.650> one<00:01:13.950> bolt<00:01:14.220> for<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.460> swing<00:01:14.640> arm<00:01:14.790> bolt

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
not it's one bolt for the swing arm bolt

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.070 
not it's one bolt for the swing arm bolt
it's<00:01:16.140> one<00:01:16.740> bolt<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.220> shock<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:18.080> then

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
it's one bolt for the shock and then

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.649 
it's one bolt for the shock and then
just<00:01:20.040> take<00:01:20.759> off<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.060> chain<00:01:21.270> off<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.540> rear

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
just take off the chain off the rear

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.210 
just take off the chain off the rear
sprocket<00:01:22.140> then<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.439> slip<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.799> off<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.040> front

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
sprocket then just slip it off the front

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.469 
sprocket then just slip it off the front
sprocket<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:23.970> don't<00:01:24.090> want<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.270> take<00:01:24.360> it

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
sprocket if you don't want to take it

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.270 
sprocket if you don't want to take it
off<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:25.080> two<00:01:25.259> bolts<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.650> caliper<00:01:26.070> and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
off then two bolts for the caliper and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.539 
off then two bolts for the caliper and
it<00:01:26.790> comes<00:01:26.970> off<00:01:27.150> easy<00:01:27.930> very<00:01:28.530> easy<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.040> then

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
it comes off easy very easy and then

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.039 
it comes off easy very easy and then
lifting<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.000> up<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.420> did<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.630> like<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.869> to

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
lifting it up I just did it like that to

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.340 
lifting it up I just did it like that to
make<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.470> lot<00:01:31.770> easier<00:01:32.210> so<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.240> took<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.110> off

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
make it a lot easier so I took this off

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.770 
make it a lot easier so I took this off
because<00:01:34.650> I'm<00:01:35.100> gonna<00:01:35.390> clean<00:01:36.390> up<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.689> whole

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
because I'm gonna clean up the whole

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.850 
because I'm gonna clean up the whole
swing<00:01:37.020> arm<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.290> can<00:01:37.380> see<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:37.619> dirty

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
swing arm you can see it's dirty

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
that because these are 22 by 11 eights

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.210 
that because these are 22 by 11 eights
and<00:03:11.510> they're<00:03:11.660> way<00:03:11.870> too<00:03:11.900> tall<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.410> then<00:03:13.069> these
