another origins video for you guys on
how<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.500> get<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.920> ultimate<00:00:05.430> I<00:00:05.730> staff<00:00:06.210> it's

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
how to get the ultimate I staff it's

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.930 
how to get the ultimate I staff it's
also<00:00:06.839> called<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.410> ules<00:00:08.010> arrow<00:00:08.340> or<00:00:08.670> something

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
also called the ules arrow or something

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.220 
also called the ules arrow or something
like<00:00:09.030> that<00:00:09.090> i<00:00:09.269> believe<00:00:09.599> it's<00:00:09.719> pronounced<00:00:10.110> and

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
like that i believe it's pronounced and

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.020 
like that i believe it's pronounced and
so<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.950> first<00:00:11.130> step<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.759> to

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
so the first step to this is to

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.640 
so the first step to this is to
obviously<00:00:12.150> get<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.750> staff<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.380> once<00:00:13.559> you

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
obviously get the I staff and once you

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.749 
obviously get the I staff and once you
have<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:13.889> you're<00:00:14.219> going<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.429> want<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.610> come

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
right there and you have to try and

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.800 
right there and you have to try and
correspond<00:00:29.160> which<00:00:29.580> one<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.060> above<00:00:30.599> you

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
and to try and shoot them I don't have

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.840 
and to try and shoot them I don't have
them<00:00:32.399> all<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:34.340> for<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> most<00:00:35.579> part<00:00:35.700> I

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
them all here and for the most part I

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.760 
them all here and for the most part I
believe<00:00:36.059> these<00:00:36.210> are<00:00:36.270> all<00:00:36.600> correct<00:00:36.989> but<00:00:37.380> uh<00:00:37.410> I

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
believe these are all correct but uh I

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.260 
believe these are all correct but uh I
don't<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.340> them<00:00:38.520> all<00:00:38.700> here<00:00:38.969> but<00:00:39.180> basically

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
don't have them all here but basically

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.569 
don't have them all here but basically
you<00:00:39.660> can<00:00:39.809> use<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.140> sheet<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:41.040> guide<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.399> guys

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you can use this sheet to guide you guys

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.360 
you can use this sheet to guide you guys
but<00:00:41.969> basically<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.649> order<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.040> do<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.309> you

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
but basically in order to do this you

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.760 
but basically in order to do this you
have<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.670> look<00:00:45.000> at<00:00:45.149> what<00:00:45.450> up<00:00:45.750> at<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.530> little

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
have to look at what up at that little

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.440 
have to look at what up at that little
like<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.129> know<00:00:47.250> symbol<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> wall<00:00:48.149> there

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
like you know symbol on the wall there

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.369 
like you know symbol on the wall there
and<00:00:48.750> then<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.050> try<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.559> guess<00:00:49.950> which<00:00:50.879> wich<00:00:51.809> one

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
and then to try and guess which wich one

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.920 
and then to try and guess which wich one
on<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.649> ceiling<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:54.090> uh<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.360> map

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
on the ceiling it is this uh this map

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.869 
on the ceiling it is this uh this map
will<00:00:55.170> pretty<00:00:55.860> much<00:00:55.949> helped<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.460> out<00:00:56.489> um

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
will pretty much helped you out um

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.479 
will pretty much helped you out um
basically<00:00:57.870> since<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.770> don't<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:59.070> all<00:00:59.280> them

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
basically since I don't have all them

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.010 
basically since I don't have all them
you<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.789> try<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.270> like<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.660> know<00:01:00.690> use

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
you can try and like you know use

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.930 
you can try and like you know use
process<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.559> elimination<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.219> see<00:01:02.399> which<00:01:02.670> ones

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
process of elimination to see which ones

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.870 
process of elimination to see which ones
aren't<00:01:03.239> there<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.930> which<00:01:04.019> ones<00:01:04.229> are<00:01:04.500> um<00:01:04.880> I

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
aren't there and which ones are um I

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.240 
aren't there and which ones are um I
think<00:01:06.780> those<00:01:07.229> are<00:01:07.260> all<00:01:07.500> correct<00:01:07.740> maybe<00:01:08.070> one<00:01:08.220> of

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
think those are all correct maybe one of

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.800 
think those are all correct maybe one of
them<00:01:08.400> might<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.790> wrong<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.299> basically<00:01:09.630> is

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
them might be wrong but basically is

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.899 
them might be wrong but basically is
what<00:01:09.869> you're<00:01:10.080> gonna<00:01:10.470> want<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.770> do<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:11.790> to

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
what you're gonna want to do you have to

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.789 
what you're gonna want to do you have to
use<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.240> ice<00:01:12.390> staff<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.439> uh<00:01:13.560> it's

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
use the ice staff for this it's uh it's

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.910 
use the ice staff for this it's uh it's
not<00:01:14.070> too<00:01:14.369> hard<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:16.080> first<00:01:16.229> step<00:01:16.500> for<00:01:16.830> it

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
not too hard it's the first step for it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.539 
not too hard it's the first step for it
it's<00:01:17.040> pretty<00:01:17.250> easy<00:01:18.470> doesn't<00:01:19.470> take<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:20.430> not

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
it's pretty easy doesn't take it's not

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.640 
it's pretty easy doesn't take it's not
that<00:01:20.729> hard<00:01:20.939> but<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.509> would<00:01:21.810> say<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.320> maybe

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
that hard but I would say this is maybe

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.270 
that hard but I would say this is maybe
either<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.549> might<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.720> hardest<00:01:25.280> hardest

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
either like might be the hardest hardest

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.249 
either like might be the hardest hardest
ultimate<00:01:26.790> staff<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.210> obtain<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.930> as<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.200> can

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
ultimate staff to obtain so as you can

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.569 
ultimate staff to obtain so as you can
see<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.439> was<00:01:28.619> having<00:01:28.650> some<00:01:28.979> trouble<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:29.310> was

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
taking me kind of a long time to do it

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
will give you an audio cue that's when

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.289 
will give you an audio cue that's when
you<00:01:36.869> know<00:01:37.079> you've<00:01:37.979> done<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.310> then<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.150> next

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
you know you've done it then the next

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.539 
you know you've done it then the next
step<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.840> leave<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> crazy<00:01:40.979> place<00:01:41.310> here

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
step is to leave the crazy place here

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.740 
step is to leave the crazy place here
and<00:01:41.670> you're<00:01:41.759> gonna<00:01:41.850> want<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.060> go<00:01:42.180> back<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
and you're gonna want to go back to the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.749 
and you're gonna want to go back to the
the<00:01:43.290> normal<00:01:43.590> map<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.070> what<00:01:44.369> you're<00:01:44.460> gonna<00:01:44.549> see

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
the normal map and what you're gonna see

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.280 
the normal map and what you're gonna see
is<00:01:44.790> these<00:01:45.000> tombstones<00:01:45.360> with<00:01:45.840> running<00:01:46.259> water

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
is these tombstones with running water

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.770 
is these tombstones with running water
on<00:01:46.740> them<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.100> obviously<00:01:47.729> when<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.360> shoot<00:01:48.600> i

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
on them and obviously when you shoot i

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.810 
on them and obviously when you shoot i
SAT<00:01:49.110> water<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:49.860> gonna<00:01:50.009> freeze<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.399> water<00:01:50.430> so

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
SAT water it's gonna freeze the water so

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.010 
SAT water it's gonna freeze the water so
basically<00:01:51.149> what<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.329> do<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.540> we<00:01:51.720> want<00:01:51.960> to

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
basically what you do is we want to

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.480 
basically what you do is we want to
shoot<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.229> at<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.560> you'll<00:01:53.040> see<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.369> it's

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
shoot it at that you'll see that it's

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.630 
shoot it at that you'll see that it's
gonna<00:01:53.579> freeze<00:01:53.880> up<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:55.140> then<00:01:55.409> right<00:01:55.890> after<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.340> I

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
gonna freeze up and then right after I I

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.370 
gonna freeze up and then right after I I
didn't<00:01:57.240> realize<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.899> do<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.110> after

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380

but right immediately after you freeze
it<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.329> could<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:00.540> shoot

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
it you could just shoot

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
create location is next an mp40 and the

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.619 
create location is next an mp40 and the
next<00:02:11.590> one<00:02:11.739> is<00:02:11.769> by<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.040> second<00:02:12.610> tank<00:02:12.879> location

next one is by the second tank location

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.380 
next one is by the second tank location

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
like circles there line them all up with

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.039 
like circles there line them all up with
blue<00:02:30.340> then<00:02:31.060> once<00:02:31.239> you've<00:02:31.360> done<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:31.569> just

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
blue then once you've done that just

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.110 
blue then once you've done that just

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
blue orb that's right there it'll go up

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.080 
blue orb that's right there it'll go up
through<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.890> through<00:02:38.890> there<00:02:39.160> then<00:02:39.910> once

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
through the through there then once

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.970 
through the through there then once
