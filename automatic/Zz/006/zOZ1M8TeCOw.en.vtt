00:00:01.924 --> 00:00:04.119
FF sports final selection battle.

00:00:04.119 --> 00:00:06.772
The Mini starts from the pole position.

00:00:07.422 --> 00:00:09.504
The driver of Mini is Kinoshita Takayuki.

00:00:09.768 --> 00:00:15.797
This is probably going to be battle
between Civic Type R and Megane R.

00:00:15.797 --> 00:00:22.935
Let's just see how it's going to go
with this Mini, let's see the results.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.435
Megan is driven by Hacchyan.

00:00:26.213 --> 00:00:28.779
This is the Megane R26R.

00:00:30.224 --> 00:00:31.517
I thinks it's fast.

00:00:32.343 --> 00:00:35.827
It's capable to lap the
Nurburgring in 8min 17 seconds.

00:00:36.295 --> 00:00:40.892
I can't even imagine how it
would translate to this track.

00:00:41.794 --> 00:00:43.835
Civic R is driven by DoriDori.

00:00:43.854 --> 00:00:47.217
So at last the 1st Best
Motoring issue in this year.

00:00:47.376 --> 00:00:48.604
Year 2010.

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.312
The final battle of world fastest FF's.

00:00:51.794 --> 00:00:58.246
Works Mini Cooper is just for show here,
the real battle is going to be between the

00:00:58.272 --> 00:01:05.013
Renault Megane and Civic Type R. Please have a
good look at the difference between those cars.

00:01:14.503 --> 00:01:18.557
Hattori's Megane comes off with a perfect
start, ahead of Tsuchiya's Civic.

00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:22.551
Not a good situation for the Civic, as
it's supposed to defend its throne.

00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:26.304
Kinoshita's Mini start advantage has
already vanished at first corner.

00:01:26.304 --> 00:01:29.637
Let's see the replay from
Hacchyan's perspective.

00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:33.613
I'm quick.

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:41.169
He's fast.

00:01:49.023 --> 00:01:50.656
Aah, the acceleration...

00:01:51.283 --> 00:01:52.099
No traction...

00:01:53.077 --> 00:01:53.689
at tires.

00:01:58.215 --> 00:02:00.082
His turbo works nicely.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.029
The Mini seems to be fast on straight too.

00:02:07.076 --> 00:02:09.797
How about cornering on Kinoshita's Mini?

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:11.982
There's no grip at all.

00:02:14.792 --> 00:02:17.445
But it goes just fine in tight corners.

00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:24.512
Mini-San, Mini-San looks a bit wobbly.

00:02:27.067 --> 00:02:29.917
But the Mini is pretty fast on straights.

00:02:29.917 --> 00:02:30.529
How come.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.868
Megane's corner exit acceleration
is fast thanks to a LSD.

00:02:46.498 --> 00:02:46.998
Go!

00:02:47.238 --> 00:02:47.738
Go!

00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:53.421
They're closely matched.

00:02:53.421 --> 00:02:57.407
Civic R's acceleration is slightly
better than Mini's at lower speeds.

00:02:57.407 --> 00:03:00.177
DoriDori is attacking
Kinoshita's Mini in order to

00:03:00.203 --> 00:03:03.027
keep up with Hattori's Megane.
Kinchyan is pinched.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.717
Damn!

00:03:10.717 --> 00:03:12.763
I've been pushed away.

00:03:13.463 --> 00:03:14.551
Aah, the grip...

00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:16.012
What's this.

00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:17.982
Anyway.

00:03:18.786 --> 00:03:25.410
This time, I have a feeling to be
having the upper hand over the Civic.

00:03:26.046 --> 00:03:28.289
I won't give up easily!

00:03:29.627 --> 00:03:31.872
It won't turn in, too fast entry.

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.071
I wish I had S tires in these spots.

00:03:44.923 --> 00:03:46.662
This is a race against S tires.

00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:52.406
DoriDori tries to compete in corners
by using the hand brake. He's serious.

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:56.709
Look.

00:03:58.874 --> 00:04:01.489
Bye bye~~.

00:04:01.561 --> 00:04:02.061
You!

00:04:02.393 --> 00:04:04.974
Don't wave the hand at
me, don't be a fool!

00:04:08.948 --> 00:04:12.136
DoriDori is pursuing Hacchyan
in "serious mode", pushing

00:04:12.162 --> 00:04:14.846
the car's cornering abilities
to its very limit.

00:04:15.202 --> 00:04:15.746
Awesome.

00:04:17.073 --> 00:04:18.025
Damn you.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.830
Making a fool of me.

00:04:22.658 --> 00:04:26.127
Civic comes closer to Megane
at first corner entry.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.141
There's 1 lap left to go.

00:04:31.212 --> 00:04:35.018
I can shake off the Civic
thanks to faster acceleration.

00:04:35.018 --> 00:04:37.435
That car is very fast
in corners though.

00:04:44.347 --> 00:04:45.912
But this acceleration..

00:04:48.124 --> 00:04:51.760
it is a strong point of Megane.

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.030
Here He's got advantage thanks to S tires.

00:05:07.957 --> 00:05:09.930
He's so fast on the straight.

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:14.526
His straight speed is fast.

00:05:15.672 --> 00:05:16.826
Daaamn it.

00:05:19.514 --> 00:05:21.661
Hattori's Megane managed
to shake off Civic R

00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:23.972
even though Tsuchiya tried
very hard to the end.

00:05:24.062 --> 00:05:29.047
This marks the first lose of unrivaled
Honda Type R in FF class at Tsukuba ever.

00:05:29.274 --> 00:05:31.995
Mini John Cooper Works finished in 3rd.

00:05:32.363 --> 00:05:37.551
This proves that the Civic R can be
defeated if contenders use high grip tires.

00:05:37.806 --> 00:05:41.684
This is the first time ever, defeating
a Type R in a FF class.

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:46.320
With the same engine volume,
although my car has a turbo.

00:05:46.462 --> 00:05:54.616
There are many reasons for defeating the Civic
R, as the S tires, acrylic glass, etc..

00:05:54.642 --> 00:06:01.670
things that Japanese makers arenâ€™t' allowed to do.
Nonetheless it's awesome.

00:06:03.158 --> 00:06:04.606
This must be said.

00:06:05.514 --> 00:06:10.775
Although my straight speed and corner speed is
fast, it was only good for staying at his tail.

00:06:10.801 --> 00:06:16.035
Anyway the next time if we have this battle
again, I'd put on the same tires. The same tires.

00:06:16.035 --> 00:06:19.779
With current tires though, I'm
able to follow closely, but

00:06:19.805 --> 00:06:23.358
for a serious battle, there's
need for the same S tires.

00:06:23.586 --> 00:06:26.103
I'd like to race with the same tires.

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:26.752
Right?

00:06:27.188 --> 00:06:31.128
With the same S tires as Renault.

00:06:31.177 --> 00:06:35.383
There is a crucial difference, therefore
I'd race again with the same tires.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.676
The battle car of the year is
FF sports class Megane R26R.
