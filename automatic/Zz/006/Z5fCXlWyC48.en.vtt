00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.720
 or they like welcome my face 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.660
 makeup and good today I bring you a 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.590
 review of these two mascara tabs 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:14.830
 that I bought in a mile and I bought them from 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.050
 done on Saturday today is Tuesday and 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.369
 they only like it once but I 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.710
 I feel that the mascaras of eyelashes are 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.960
 things that you know the first time you know 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.269
 you like the note to like because there 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.310
 masks eyelashes that you simply 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.570
 they do wonders at once because you 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.020
 you put and to the president what generates you 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.030
 then I will try to talk more 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.890
 space because I believe that in all 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.260
 videos have told me that I speak super 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.000
 fast and I know it is where it is 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.790
 I live most people to fast 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.590
 and when I talk about space so 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.110
 less now I'm laughing 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.440
 because I'm imagining it as hello 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.310
 how are they outfits like that like 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.200
 I try to be a cheerleader but nothing 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.440
 companies have to have 20 I speak 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.240
 fast then good let's start 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.740
 with the video what do you know I'm going to 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.260
 do it direct if you want to know how 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.330
 do this look and how to use the 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.830
 platense doctor ideas I will leave you the 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.300
 link below this video that has just 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.220
 record by the way why I have in 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.110
 ferro for hair makeup and everything 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:20.110
 and good this will do them a 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.090
 and here you can see me more or less in case 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.230
 they want to know this tutorial and good 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.230
 first I am going to show you 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.870
 this is the first art that comes in 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.390
 this point cited white 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:38.420
 says mile 200 I think that 2 100 70 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.729
 they have the lid like pink gold and 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.500
 good is this the first of the reason why 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.780
 which wants to buy the first one is 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.010
 because it has fibers then you can 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.300
 see here by the ones you 're looking for 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.300
 if you can notice there 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.490
 but it has no fibers and fibers what 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.770
 they do is that the fibers adhere to 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.880
 your tabs and they do as an extension 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.870
 you know that the extension of 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.700
 tabs 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.890
 practically a synthetic tab that 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.690
 It puts on top of your natural eyelash and 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.130
 makes it have longer good is 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.350
 exactly the same thing that this 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.810
 mascara only this one 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.820
 the difference is that the extensions of 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.920
 positions are dangerous because the glue 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.260
 they have is so strong that when you 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.760
 the false eyelash of the 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.380
 extension you can keep your tab 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.700
 natural then that's why I 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.210
 there are beings of eyelashes and I am afraid 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.040
 because you know my eyelashes are not even very 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.480
 bushy and very long so I feel that 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.240
 My specials are very standard be it not 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.550
 they are neither too dense nor very encouraging 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.920
 are not very long and very 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.540
 short but now they are going to see the 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.160
 result first I'm going to make you a 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.720
 sheet and I'm going to show you this is the 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.850
 Take time to see the difference 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.450
 three things what will be first is 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.450
 curl my eyelashes 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:01.580
 I do not know how to make first apply 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.580
 a stage of this prime in a single eye 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.939
 although I do not know if I already have the camera 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.939
 first mask 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:22.819
 the first layer of first to swallow 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:25.250
 white stockings tabs let them 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.469
 I'm going to take the mascara that 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.390
 it's black I bought the pure water and 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:31.609
 it comes in the same line as miguelÃ­n 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.200
 applies to water and the reason why 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.300
 which one to buy the mask to proof of 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.760
 water is because 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:43.290
 the pure mask of water makes the the 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.640
 curl lasts longer you do not fall and well I 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.780
 I know some do not like you because 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.690
 they feel like it 's like harder to 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.580
 remove with some makeup before 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.440
 based on xavi easy things that they have in 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.120
 the part of oil the normal part is 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.220
 remove super fast then this mask 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.230
 of eyelashes also has fibers it 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.569
 imagine that they appear with fibers at 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.469
 it's true that they look super long 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.469
 I will pass 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.169
 who played klaus or to notice here 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.880
 I do not have any mascara 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.030
 they can give by watching my lashes are like this 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.990
 as it overrides me then and here I do have 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.990
 the mask pretty 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.809
 and not behind transformers I'm going 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.580
 to leave pictures of how it is lacking and 

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:42.800
 Masquerade some pictures and complete for 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.119
 to see how it looks and well I'm going to 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.430
 explain the mask the first of 

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:48.759
 another side and then I come to give you a 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.759
 a little more 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:54.699
 good yourself apply the mask of 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:58.190
 tabs on both eyes and eyelashes 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:01.100
 superior in the and in the below 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.190
 and in the lower ones then this 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.890
 you can go about these masks 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.200
 first I love it because it has 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:12.670
 fibers and I feel that it makes me see the 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.840
 super long eyelashes and I know that for 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.150
 you this is going to be a bit difficult 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.550
 because I have quite thick eyeliner 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.230
 is there the thick eyeliner makes the 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.280
 lashes are so long because 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:26.290
 You know obviously how dark it is 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.930
 I feel like I cover a little bit the 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.360
 base of the house then I do not know to me but 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.490
 however I feel that it shows and those 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.250
 eyelashes are not that kind of pressures 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.390
 to be noticed because that I feel that 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.400
 as I have the eyelid of the eye 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.140
 I already have the heavy eyebrow 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.510
 then yes that issues such as 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.430
 let me get off and yet I feel 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.020
 it looks super big and super nice 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.880
 and good that you can go the first 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.430
 first gel as optional, that is if 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.350
 you want to give it one more step 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.410
 but this is how you have been people 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.960
 that you know how that lip mask went 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.490
 you know with enough start but of 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.870
 I really like it a lot I like it 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.380
 water test I like that it is to test 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:11.670
 of water because it keeps giving me the the 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:13.350
 expensive the curl and what I like is that 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.450
 they look at the brushes and they can see it 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.700
 brush has long bristles in the part 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.980
 from above and you have bristles cuts in the 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.110
 down then with the long bristles you 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.390
 You can comb the lashes 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.580
 superiors and with the short ones 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.530
 lower and so you do not have problems of 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.390
 that gets stained under your eyes like that 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.070
 Composed with mascara and 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.440
 well I'm going to do the prices is 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.020
 the first one cost me I think they were 90 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.729
 bolivars in the mission I think all 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.610
 the miles have appreciation but 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:42.590
 this 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.879
 I recommend them I think I am 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.400
 too cute because I got the 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:47.750
 huge eyelashes and I feel like it's 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.000
 this type of mascara like 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.110
 how good today I want to put these 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.129
 false 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.770
 but I do not want me for the one they're 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:56.509
 exhibitions wants to have you want to have 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.949
 the look of false eyelashes and deny 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:59.449
 that for random art I like a lot 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:02.240
 because it has fibers then between 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:03.319
 super long crystals and well this is 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.389
 my review 

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:07.759
 You already know that I love these 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:09.319
 mascara and good if you want 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:11.479
 after being interested they can 

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:13.819
 buy me I will simply be 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:16.460
