just with you know arms and legs think

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.270 
just with you know arms and legs think
Gundam<00:01:30.210> think<00:01:30.840> Matt<00:01:31.259> cross<00:01:31.560> or<00:01:31.770> robotech

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
Gundam think Matt cross or robotech

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.940 
Gundam think Matt cross or robotech
although<00:01:33.150> G<00:01:33.420> Gundam<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:34.079> really<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> super

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
although G Gundam is really a super

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.289 
although G Gundam is really a super
robot<00:01:35.310> show<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:35.820> still<00:01:38.090> usually<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.180> see

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
robot show but still usually you see

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.819 
robot show but still usually you see
there's<00:01:39.630> real<00:01:39.840> robot<00:01:40.140> shows<00:01:40.350> with<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> mecha

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
there's real robot shows with a mecha

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.109 
there's real robot shows with a mecha
are<00:01:41.070> really<00:01:41.520> just<00:01:41.759> more<00:01:43.820> vehicles<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
are really just more vehicles on the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.749 
are really just more vehicles on the
battlefield<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:46.470> that's<00:01:47.100> that's<00:01:47.399> sort<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.700> the

real robot genre up until that point it

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.699 
real robot genre up until that point it
had<00:02:49.440> been<00:02:49.650> really<00:02:49.980> super<00:02:50.190> robots<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:51.709> Gundams

had been really super robots and Gundams
were<00:02:52.830> just<00:02:53.010> war<00:02:53.190> machines<00:02:53.519> so<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.780> had<00:02:54.959> that

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
were just war machines so you had that

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.590 
were just war machines so you had that
and<00:02:55.650> then<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.370> couple<00:02:56.670> years<00:02:56.790> later<00:02:57.000> macross

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
and then a couple years later macross

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.479 
and then a couple years later macross
came<00:02:57.900> out<00:02:58.080> which<00:02:58.470> would<00:02:58.650> then<00:02:58.950> become<00:02:59.130> part<00:02:59.459> of

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
came out which would then become part of

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.120 
came out which would then become part of
robotech<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.650> mecha<00:03:01.830> are<00:03:01.980> more

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
robotech and in that the mecha are more

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.800 
robotech and in that the mecha are more
flashy<00:03:02.489> they're<00:03:02.940> definitely<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.720> know

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
flashy they're definitely you know

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.720

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.880 
pretty to look at but there's still more
war<00:03:05.940> machines<00:03:06.239> they're<00:03:06.630> basically<00:03:06.930> f-14<00:03:07.680> jet

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
war machines they're basically f-14 jet

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.850 
war machines they're basically f-14 jet
fighters<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.340> turn<00:03:08.519> into<00:03:08.550> giant<00:03:09.120> robots<00:03:09.860> and

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
fighters that turn into giant robots and

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.050 
fighters that turn into giant robots and
that's<00:03:10.980> really<00:03:11.069> what<00:03:11.190> macross<00:03:11.459> did<00:03:11.730> was

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
that's really what macross did was

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.000 
that's really what macross did was
established<00:03:12.600> that<00:03:12.750> Mecca<00:03:13.410> could<00:03:14.069> look<00:03:14.250> good

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
established that Mecca could look good

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.259

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
and then really that was that

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.810 
and then really that was that
established<00:03:18.959> things<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.530> mecha<00:03:20.010> what<00:03:20.610> was

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
established things and mecha what was

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.340

Gundam or the more flashy war machines
of<00:03:25.530> macros<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.880> then<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.480> course<00:03:27.510> even

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
of macros and then of course even

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.069 
of macros and then of course even
yelling<00:03:28.049> came<00:03:28.290> along<00:03:28.560> now<00:03:29.120> even<00:03:30.120> galleons<00:03:30.720> are

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
yelling came along now even galleons are

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.490 
yelling came along now even galleons are
actually<00:03:31.940> biological<00:03:32.940> machines<00:03:33.900> but<00:03:34.380> there

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
actually biological machines but there

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.750 
actually biological machines but there
had<00:03:34.590> been<00:03:34.709> biological<00:03:35.190> machines<00:03:35.400> before<00:03:35.579> that

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
had been biological machines before that

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.460 
had been biological machines before that
point<00:03:35.880> in<00:03:36.000> anime<00:03:36.360> with<00:03:36.810> what<00:03:36.959> even<00:03:37.170> galleon

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
point in anime with what even galleon

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.080 
point in anime with what even galleon
did<00:03:37.590> was<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.799> popularize<00:03:38.070> that<00:03:38.579> and<00:03:38.850> make<00:03:38.970> that

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
did was to popularize that and make that

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.789 
did was to popularize that and make that
more<00:03:39.269> of<00:03:39.360> an<00:03:39.420> option<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:39.959> introduced<00:03:40.560> sort<00:03:40.739> of

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
more of an option and introduced sort of

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.000 
more of an option and introduced sort of
a<00:03:40.829> more<00:03:40.980> psychological<00:03:41.549> stuff<00:03:41.760> in<00:03:42.030> in<00:03:42.269> mecca

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
a more psychological stuff in in mecca

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.690 
a more psychological stuff in in mecca

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
not that there had been a technological

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.300 
not that there had been a technological
stuff<00:03:45.120> but<00:03:45.269> that<00:03:45.840> more<00:03:45.989> weird<00:03:46.350> introspective

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
stuff but that more weird introspective

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.789
