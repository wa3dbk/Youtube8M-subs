 a game called cocodrila sacamuelas 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.880
 which is based on a game this is from 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.500
 toy a long time ago and good 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.900
 is that it is created by sim and traca that 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.580
 it's a mamey think denim play and what's seen 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.560
 long ago and well let's play it and 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.029
 before I'll tell you a few things that 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.280
 at best they interest you and I was pretty 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.440
 cool and it's good that I go like this to talk 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.600
 with you so like that, stuck or my god 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.970
 I wanted to tell you that I would like 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.410
 I would send your maps that you already have 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.300
 created or if you want to create a new one and 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.630
 send me what I would like to play them 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.730
 to go up to the channel, then yes, 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.200
 you want to send me I have an email in 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.610
 the description is worth everything is the 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.860
 description where you can send me the 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.540
 maps if you can send me photos before 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.280
 to have an eye like that on top 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.050
 because I know there are going to be some that 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.230
 they are going to send maps like that in a plan 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.539
 in 15 minutes and that's not a map if 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.610
 you can I'm not asking for something 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:09.220
 exaggerated but at least something a little 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.710
 Well, decent, do not send any 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.780
 thing because I would like to play something 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.399
 fun and that is ezzati you can do 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.710
 a mini game if you want to do some 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.980
 then some adventures whatever you want 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.590
 with jokes 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.270
 controlled with lava with tnt by all 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.610
 sides but make it entertaining so 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.130
 you can play in 20 minutes or less and 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.720
 Well, I'll go see to see what 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.420
 do and know what you command if you want 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.560
 Of course, it is not any obligation, and it is 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.090
 that this more than anything else because another day 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.890
 I'm asking for some maps on twitter 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.810
 because I would like to play 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.400
 some of your maps and better ones 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.410
 how many are pretty cool then yes 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.120
 If you want to send me, I could leave 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.130
 in short let's play this map let's 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.050
 go here we go to now we go first 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.300
 to the information description we are going to 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.250
 read not this my game is based on the 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.600
 classic board game where you have 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.280
 to choose a crocodile tooth and 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.020
 break it but be careful since a 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.810
 tooth is a trap and you will lose the minigame 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.400
 this is one of the defects that there was the 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.040
 map of paul I will comment and there are 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.110
 here let's see the rules is not breaking 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.020
 no block only the quartz blocks 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.270
 play in peaceful mode and disable the 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.610
 clouds option to the map created by zoom and 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.140
 traca that is one of the creators of the 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.300
 mac makers of mmm play 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.920
 Well let's put it into pitbull let 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.410
 well let's start my game we have 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.030
 to break the crocodile's teeth like this 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.860
 what to see what happens 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.330
 but the sound is good, well, here 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.340
 we are going to put the sound a bit 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.200
 higher so that it is there perfect 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.410
 let's break it the only problem that 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.030
 I see this minigame is one that will happen 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.950
 shortly and it is that you lose or not 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.140
 it's like saying it's a matter of luck 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.209
 this gives me a little bad gate 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.239
 like but this is first you want to say 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.430
 there is no any advantage plus and 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.190
 you lose 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.260
 it is simply because luck is worth it because 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.290
 they are not marked then it is a bit 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.370
 troll eada but good what matters 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.989
 this video game the truth is that it is 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.360
 very well done to me I'm really cool how 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.430
 is done is very cool and it gives me a lot 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.200
 fear right now peak this to the best 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.650
 I lose is that I do not know that's why it's like 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.090
 very randomly is the only defect that 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.820
 you see the minigame from the east is 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.950
 pretty cool 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.330
 I lost maya because I lost not us 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.640
 are counting the teeth we 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.680
 We are counting our teeth in order 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.780
 and all this I wanted to tell you the subject of 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.270
 the mini maps if you want me 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.710
 send someone, how good can you 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.660
 send me one to play with colo or 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.000
 something like that I will be happy to receive 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.230
 your maps and jesse and floating that of 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.500
 hobbies 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.120
 and well you know if you want to put 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.409
 sunny nonsense whatever you want and that 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.159
 you leave the pot a little I know that you 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.040
 like 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.390
 and well, it's no obligation anymore 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.190
 I tell him now because he was going to see people who 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.810
 he said then you're asking your 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.000
 subscribers that send you maps and such 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.920
 it's nothing of that simply because I 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.450
 I would like the truth and I already played many 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.310
 your maps but I would like to play 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.140
 some map of yours and record it if it is 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.670
 possible and if you have me then I know 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.400
 pacheco stories or stories of 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.890
 hunters lines stories of things that 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.349
 see and if I wanted to make mini games for 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.610
 send me what you want that I do 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:13.440
 I ask for certain I demand certain type of 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.940
 curiosity is worth trying to make 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.979
 it's good that it looks nice 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.870
 I teach many things in the channel 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.419
 go to apply them do not be mobs 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.710
 strangers and that is etc. what 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.229
 want as if you want to make a mini 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.090
 ctm mini mini is worth that already is thing 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.740
 your and well then the mini game of the 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.630
 inscription prove it is very cool the 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.729
 same defect that I see is that which is 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.050
 very random and I have thought about 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.449
 condominiums more games to record that 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.919
 They are very cool so keep taping 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.880
 over time because now I have 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.710
