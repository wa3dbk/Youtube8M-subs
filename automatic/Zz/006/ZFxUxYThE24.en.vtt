one we added our button menu we gave it

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.029 
one we added our button menu we gave it
a<00:00:20.520> layer<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.170> its<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.289> its<00:00:22.380> own<00:00:22.560> movie<00:00:22.859> clip

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
a layer and its in its own movie clip

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.290 
a layer and its in its own movie clip
and<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:24.029> made<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.510> pages<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.490> layer<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.789> it's

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
and we made a pages a layer and it's

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.210 
and we made a pages a layer and it's
empty<00:00:27.480> right<00:00:27.660> now<00:00:27.840> but<00:00:28.800> I'm<00:00:28.920> going<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.099> go

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
empty right now but I'm going to go

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.519 
empty right now but I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.429> make<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> movie<00:00:30.150> clip<00:00:30.349> it's<00:00:31.349> going

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.850 
ahead and make a movie clip it's going
to<00:00:31.590> be<00:00:31.679> my<00:00:31.859> pages<00:00:33.710> so<00:00:34.710> make<00:00:35.340> another<00:00:35.640> rectangle

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
to be my pages so make another rectangle

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.540 
to be my pages so make another rectangle
let's<00:00:37.860> go<00:00:38.010> right<00:00:38.250> here<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:40.219> draw<00:00:41.219> out<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
let's go right here and draw out the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.959 
let's go right here and draw out the
rectangle<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.360> stage<00:00:43.430> make<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> little<00:00:44.789> bit

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
rectangle on stage make it a little bit

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.430 
rectangle on stage make it a little bit
higher<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.210> fit<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:45.690> there<00:00:45.870> nice<00:00:48.079> there<00:00:49.079> we<00:00:49.260> go

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
higher to fit in there nice there we go

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.040 
higher to fit in there nice there we go
and<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:50.489> will<00:00:50.670> give<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:52.730> bill<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:54.629> match<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
and we will give it a bill to match the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.500 
and we will give it a bill to match the
buttons<00:00:55.379> sort<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.910> looks<00:00:57.149> good<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:58.010> then

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
buttons sort of that looks good and then

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.160 
buttons sort of that looks good and then
let's<00:01:00.510> see<00:01:00.809> pages<00:01:02.149> make<00:01:03.149> another<00:01:03.420> layer<00:01:03.690> let's

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
let's see pages make another layer let's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.640 
let's see pages make another layer let's
call<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.500> logo<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.189> header<00:01:06.170> logo<00:01:07.170> and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
call this logo and header logo and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:16.160 
call this logo and header logo and
header<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:11.659> then<00:01:12.659> we<00:01:13.229> will<00:01:13.380> bring<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:15.170> let's

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
header and then we will bring in let's

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.149 
header and then we will bring in let's
import<00:01:16.680> let's<00:01:17.009> go<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.189> file<00:01:17.520> import<00:01:17.790> import
