00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:13.809
 today I'm going to prepare some broken eggs with 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:19.560
 gulas for this I need some teeth 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:21.510
 garlic a chilli cayena some potatoes 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.640
 eels 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.980
 olive oil and eggs 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.810
 we have peeled the potatoes we have 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.100
 washing and we have cut them in sheets 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.350
 as if they were for potato omelette 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.980
 and now the abundant oil in one 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.350
 skillet 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.500
 We are going to fry them but they are not left 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.500
 Crunchy have to stay blah blah 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.840
 so the fire that is not stronger 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.320
 we will add them there and when they are 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.940
 we will remove them to a 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.490
 dish with absorbent paper so that 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.100
 drain in the excess oil 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.040
 to help antlers stay 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.220
 softer and done before we're going to 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.220
 put 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.110
 this stage that has holes for 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.759
 up so he breathes and with this 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.960
 we help to make the 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.780
 potatoes 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.570
 we have ready the potatoes so 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.640
 now we are going to take them out 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.380
 to prepare the cures the first thing that 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.200
 we do is in a pan put a 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.680
 little oil 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.439
 and the garlic cut into slices when 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.150
 are a little bit golden, we will add the 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.400
 balls 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.330
 we already have a little gold like that 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.810
 that now we add the ball and we go up 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.210
 be during some musician in a network 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.080
 sautÃ©ed mixed with the short ones 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.450
 we add the cayenne 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.510
 it could also have been added in the 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.860
 oil at the time of frying the garlic 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.810
 but since I do not like that much 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.110
 pique I put it now I give it some 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.080
 turns 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.490
 and with this the bulls are finished 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.620
 garlic 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.800
 Finally in another pan with plenty 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.220
 well warm oil let's follow the 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.220
 eggs 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.700
 together 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.739
 once we have fried the eggs, let's go 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.250
 to mount the dish the games have to 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.770
 stay with the blandita bud 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.940
 and this is our plate of broken eggs 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.220
 with gulas 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.250
 consists in putting in the background the 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.240
 potatoes then put the eggs on top 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.700
 potatoes break eggs 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.880
 so that the yolk extends over the 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.880
 potatoes and finally we put on top the 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.500
 balls you have to eat it immediately 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.500
 I do not expect anything more
