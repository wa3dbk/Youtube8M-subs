00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.630
 as the first instructional video I wanted 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.820
 start with something not too much 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.860
 complicated is quite simple but 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.570
 I wanted to show you how it developed 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.210
 personally like every every recipe 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.500
 kitchen we start from the ingredients 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.040
 our main ingredient is from the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:43.320
 measure the sixteenths and subdivide it 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:53.190
 in this way we make three io 35 plus 5 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:55.769
 and what we get we get this like 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.100
 you may have noticed we always say it with the 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.100
 right 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.470
 give it some color because the beauty 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.080
 of this it is really able to give a 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.180
 bit of personality touch passing on 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:20.670
 autonomous hi-hat second of ours 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:23.640
 taste and we get this another 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.380
 possible variant is to stay only on 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.380
 tones we get this other 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.270
 But so honestly a little 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.520
 moscetto what I wanted to give him 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.590
 I as a personalization is that of 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.420
 transform the sixteenths 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.540
 and our normal sixteenths 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.900
 give it a twist to do them in this 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.900
 way 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.160
 reasoning for the sixteenths in this 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.780
 so what we get was a 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.720
 much more much more luxurious gait 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:33.330
 of the movie and we get our own 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:33.330
 final result cooked and eaten
