kind<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.590> looks<00:01:16.770> funny<00:01:17.479> feels<00:01:18.479> weird<00:01:18.720> too<00:01:18.990> but

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
kind of looks funny feels weird too but

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.620 
kind of looks funny feels weird too but
anyway<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.280> kind<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.580> set<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.150> back<00:01:21.360> here

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
anyway can I kind of set that back here

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.190 
anyway can I kind of set that back here
the<00:01:22.619> eyes<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:23.189> think<00:01:23.250> are<00:01:23.700> really<00:01:23.939> cool<00:01:24.200> they're

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200

the eyes I think are really cool they're
kind<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.950> four<00:01:26.520> pieces<00:01:27.000> put<00:01:27.270> together
