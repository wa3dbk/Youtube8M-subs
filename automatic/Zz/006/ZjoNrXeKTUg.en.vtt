00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:02.790
 they want alcantud 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.790
 now it has gone up I want to review what to do 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.560
 an infant 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.359
 a viewer to work 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:13.799
 Per hundred of these cameras are very good and has a very good image 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.039
 for biden for photos but it has some disadvantages in terms of video because 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.029
 It is not 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.260
 is not a camera finally made for videos more than a couple of photos 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.289
 so 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.679
 one of the great advantages it has is that 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.679
 you can not use 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.660
 the test of vih fail 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.090
 when you are recording 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.980
 only then use the screen 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.130
 the program with this is that when you're shooting outdoors 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.500
 and there is a very strong light 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.290
 the sun is very strong 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.080
 battles a lot to see 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.070
 then I should even focus on roo is to dry 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.260
 you had opening and igueste 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.390
 all this because this is fought a lot because you do not see 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.150
 you speak lusa very strong 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.510
 Then what they sell 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.410
 Missolonghi Spain 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.450
 it is a sum of the find 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.210
 1 professional let's say then 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.790
 40 hours above 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.200
 so 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.630
 out there looking alternating I found a design to be a good number of 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.290
 followers that is done 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.600
 and here I am going to teach you to be the psyche 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.040
 Well, let's do it 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.040
 for more than five years 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.000
 very well the materials for your project is 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.980
 in big talc for him 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.190
 I found this comfortable 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.190
 between 100 pesos to the basic a little more than a dollar 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.340
 It is also important to note that it is important that it be rectangular in 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.340
 the bottom part and that above I have no but large 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.260
 This boat was about 22 ounces 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.200
 maybe no machicote can serve promised he does not deserve to remain committed 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.829
 nor what you have to do is obviously remove the decal from the 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:01:59.350
 boat 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.540
 so 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.950
 by the way that maybe beats and is a bit 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.009
 and what you can do is put together to read some oil 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.030
 d to cook or leave it for a while you put it in warm water and after about 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:13.749
 minutes 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.739
 can not be removed from the company 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.389
 easier not without so much problem 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.529
 because once yesterday he was attentive 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:25.019
 another thing that we are dealing with is a silicon gun 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.199
 very easy 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.209
 i a magnifying glass 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.919
 in this man I found there because they came two meters added 15 pesos 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.749
 but what we occupy is a small magnifying glass 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.489
 that fits inside the boat 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.409
 another thing is four leagues here nothing else appear but we already occupy 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:49.370
 four leagues more or less big 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.229
 i a sponge of some hearing aids 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:56.530
 Maybe in defense of France, do not use to take away the few if you do not have 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.120
 then buy that we leave cheap events 3 dollars they only cover 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.769
 sponge 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.669
 in tiger 1 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.929
 the best as well get some suns some old ones 

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:09.719
 and there are people who can 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:13.450
 The first thing we are going to do is cut wood from the edge of the 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:14.769
 down the boat 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.279
 ok after trimming as straight as you can alves you can 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:22.489
 put something sad to see them 3000 watching and 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.319
 the world warn you Swedish 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.429
 later we are going to use the magnifying glass here regent withdraw the entity I could not 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:31.919
 which says it was 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:36.279
 they bought weapons because it's never you can take off the lens of art the 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:37.489
 runners 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.170
 we are going to stick it with the silicone provisionally inside the boat because 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.399
 we need to review 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:47.569
 per cent the focal distance of our eye then what we are going to do is that 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.379
 once it is already investigated 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.229
 and they give a little rectangular shape in the boat 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:55.289
 will continue to review with little success seeing in 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:59.919
 at what distance of 100 meters you are not cutting to the station of your eye 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.199
 see well 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.489
 with the magnifying glass of the throne 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.679
 then we are going to remove the sponge albalá hearing aids 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.849
 if everything said did not accept sponge does not have or not gero vaagt means then the ones to have 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.899
 what to do with the nest he did not even have 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:16.949
 because there I was of no profit 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.019
 that's why we're going to paint with a black plastic spray that was born 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.590
 long ago they are suspended for plastic you paint well inside and 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.580
 outside and wait 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.539
 to dry well because afterwards there is no battle that I will be 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.979
 waiting for the painting coughs intervenes inside and out 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.800
 and let it dry well 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.259
 Once it has dried up like this we are going to beat it definitively 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.639
 the magnifying glass inside before painting the visitor goals and lopo because you should not 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.319
 the stain diego valley has resented because that's where you're going to see 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.919
 since only yesterday the winds will spread 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.870
 the magnifying glass inside the boat with the silicone 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.490
 now we are going to tie 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.680
 two followed two pairs of leagues 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.129
 the moorings so that as we have last night 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.409
 and that we're going to put one on the top and another on the part of 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:03.430
 down 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.460
 but before you have to put the leagues we are going to stick sponge of the hearing aids 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.409
 at the top 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.520
 then since it is already well stuck with the silicone because only then we place 

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:15.189
 the guides moored 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:17.620
 a thousand for in the top 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.270
 kirk and the other so that the bottom part this goes on like this they are not going to 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.520
 to hold 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.199
 the diw fánder 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.969
 the poet cashew 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:29.539
 a part rivero in the bottom 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:32.180
 ing good since he has is this 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.439
 now we are going to put the camera 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:37.389
 in the part above your camera 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:40.759
 the system an outraged one of the ideas 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:46.789
 and in the bottom part with the old detrick pertus apart and where it goes 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:47.979
 to hold 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:49.389
 the bottom 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.479
 the guide of the subject of the viewer at the bottom not so good there 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.189
 is there ubisort 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:56.569
 blond 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:00.909
 nothing more than fix after I saw it on the screen and that the north this 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:02.710
 we see it with buttons 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.710
 more or less that's how it looks 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:10.249
 It's not perfect, but it's good for you to bail out or 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:12.259
 investors and when you go 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:15.779
 on the street when they are unwinding outside hours to be able 

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:17.930
 see what you're doing 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.090
 Pass can focus and all question Barcelona 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.930
 you go home from a good hurry by tens tensor no 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:29.229
 well I hope this idea serves you for this descent 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:32.229
 lamas a comment is that 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.860
 the magnifying glass a month ago but when what with that liquor 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.680
 the next day he had already waited a bit then what was recorded 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.089
 this glue 

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:43.089
 it's like when bugle 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:46.960
 they are waiting for you then strong make it for plastic 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.960
 Another important issue is that your painting stops 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.430
 to paint the 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.830
 showcase as well as if it does not progress 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.949
 he was signed well 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:01.509
 so then only provisionally- even that, because 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:03.689
 I speak permanently 

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:06.689
 is going to get a good player but this is 

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:08.999
 if you do not have the viewer 

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:10.800
 between the concentrates 1 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.779
 invest 1 

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:13.509
 this section of the center 

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:14.539
 the professional 

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:17.879
 be by the force of his proposal 

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:20.860
 if you have any idea, something improved 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.000
 in that of services paschal watches over the interests of that money 

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:29.649
 i please if it is that bp because we will be going up more united of that type 

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:30.550
 for 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.680
 p build this 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.680
 tools to serve it maybe more for settlement 

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.969
 in a little more flexible 

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:40.499
 Mister George
