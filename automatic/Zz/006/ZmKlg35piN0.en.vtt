00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.680
 we are here in a nutrition studio 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.500
 human that Dr. Jia's title throw away 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.480
 in which to explain what the birbe exam is 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.580
 mentioned is an exam that allows 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.490
 establish the quantity of liquids 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.500
 present in a body a lean mass e 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.140
 the amount of fat mass 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.840
 what is it then used to understand if 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.270
 losing weight kg were able to 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.340
 lose those lean mass fat mass 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.430
 liquid and therefore it is essential 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:41.360
 a study of the clinic of all 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.220
 games how it works practically what 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.190
 we have selected which allows us to 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.560
 have three physical sizes 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.760
 basic rectangle resistance of 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.790
 phase in technical terms these terms 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.100
 practical and inter in a few words 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:02.180
 allow to establish conductivity 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.850
 exceeds the horn essentially a body 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.850
 more at a lean body mass less liquid 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.740
 it conducts electricity and therefore if we 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.880
 in letter we start the current while 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.350
 dogs in a body that we see the gift a 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.900
 return cruise in this signal 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.250
 electrical we can establish how much 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.530
 lean mass and how much massacre 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.500
 present in a body by inserting 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.869
 of course the data in weight height of the 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.990
 patient 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:32.330
 now we're going to check how to see 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.080
 how to do more physical examination 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.920
 attention we are using for this 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.390
 exam we have metric prevenzio with via 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.170
 kirby impedance at 101 years 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.330
 pour it point because it stops and it is it 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.520
 tool that is more studies available 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.670
 as regards the reliability of 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.470
 data the game potentiometer comes 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.540
 used in routine also in 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.409
 testable hemodialysis in the morning of liquids 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.119
 in the body how a patient works 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.380
 arrived in the studio without having done 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.729
 physical activity course in the last 24 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.619
 hours 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.830
 must have taken a quantity of liquids 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.000
 in the norm 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.000
 it must not have been feverish 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:25.220
 here is the doctor just cleansed the 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.950
 skin eliminated cells say death 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.310
 present on the skin is now applying 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.940
 of the electrodes the patient in question 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:39.709
 at the legs spread the hands resting 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.799
 on the couch the cot completely 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.239
 lying down to allow liquids to 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:49.250
 body to be distributed in a manner 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:51.019
 uniform is in fact a relaxed position 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.220
 to uniform liquids allows to have 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.049
 of reliable data 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.940
 what you do n't get for example with 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:02.390
 intellectual balances because 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.160
 electrodes are applied to the foot 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.970
 on the patient's hand the patient does not 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.579
 the current feels no discomfort 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.870
 low voltage electricity in which not 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:17.500
 warns no symptoms of the hard exam 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.500
 about two minutes 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.990
 I told myself that the electric current 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.450
 come to this level 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.480
 a hand a certain distance from him 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.520
 electrodes pass through the arm 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.210
 crosses the patient's body up 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:42.990
 get to the leg from here again to 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:47.200
 the detector that measures immediately 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:49.750
 the resistance in the dance area and the throat of 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.730
 phase and the environmental temperature that we 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.690
 must not be less than 20 degrees e 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.690
 greater than 26 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:03.520
 here's an exam it's over and now we can 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.700
 remove the electrodes switch off 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.700
 the appliance
