00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.499
 good morning little one is just going 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.390
 to see in this tutorial how to create a 

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:12.210
 offline map 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:16.289
 we have here I am with wifi in this 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.839
 phone and I want to download this map 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.820
 in this case in microsoft maps and 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:24.300
 you know that if you want to choose a map 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.020
 you just have to give it to open map here 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.870
 they leave a lot of 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.570
 from map sources many are 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.430
 Americans and here they do not have no 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.620
 no importance but good you have the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.830
 google earth google hybrid google maps 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.600
 well that in the online tab in the 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.330
 online tab that is what we 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.629
 we want now we have a series of 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.510
 maps that I have already done or 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.460
 maps that I have so it's fine 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.970
 we go online we select the one that 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.470
 I want, I'm not going to do it because 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.110
 I have it downloaded to not later 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.350
 so much and now the idea is that I want 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.880
 download on this map to not need 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.880
 data rate when I go hiking 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:15.630
 I spike in the world map menu and I go 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.000
 to map creator 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.409
 ok here explains me below what it is that 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.120
 is going to make you click on it first 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.620
 the first corner 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:29.910
 I spike the first point and I spike the 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:33.270
 second point all that area that is 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.300
 shaded is the one that will cover me 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.080
 that is going to download the orosmÃ¡n I give 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.930
 to the blue tick 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.420
 I get this window as you see above 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.150
 put the title let's the microsoft font 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.400
 and brit and it comes out a series of layers I'm going to 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.790
 select all to download the map 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.220
 everything as complete as it can be in 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.020
 some internet sites talks about that 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.900
 you do not have to download all of them 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.710
 good for memory reasons in this 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.690
 case does not occupy so much I put a name 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.679
 which will then be the name of the map 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.990
 that I'm going to see in horus map done and I'm going to 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.700
 mark not stop the download if there 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.310
 lost images because in case you 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.340
 lose one would stop and well if you 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.030
 lose some then we check if it is 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.010
 important and leaves us a gap in the middle 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.150
 or if it does not matter and now 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.569
 finally I'll download 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.230
 then start downloading as you see 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:36.379
 that rectangle that was the withdrawal with the 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.769
 5 the surrounding neighborhoods is composed 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:42.620
 by 970 different images some are 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.629
 of detail and others are the generic ones 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.670
 they are superimposed in the form of layers 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:51.460
 different so that it looks like you have in 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.730
 end that has zoom 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.070
 Well, here we are downloading it and 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.560
 I'm going to stop recording because I do not 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.110
 makes sense 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.550
 one last detail from which I was 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:08.550
 I'll keep it inside horus maps and 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:12.090
 in the tab that I taught earlier in what 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.030
 of maps and then offline there will be one 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.420
 that will be retirement and well then I can 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.890
 travel with going to retirement and doing my 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.500
 excursions without data 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:29.450
 in another tutorial I will show you how to pass 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:33.140
 to that map to another phone or to 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.150
 computer in fact now after I'm going 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.740
 to do to whoever wants or 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.130
 I will not even have to do this but 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.569
 that can be downloaded from the blog 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.620
 your 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.620
 good greetings
