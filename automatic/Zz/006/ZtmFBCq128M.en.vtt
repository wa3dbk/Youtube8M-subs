00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.509
 so we are again what we are going to water 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.460
 today 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.460
 chicken liver sambal chicken livers 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.359
 sambal goreng hati ayam 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.039
 sambal goreng hati ayam what do you have 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.669
 needed for that 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.669
 chicken livers 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.769
 and even more ingredients should we go 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.769
 then 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:35.980
 so first I was always had it 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.910
 a little flood rest 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.910
 chicken livers 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.800
 and then i did i wrote about the water 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.520
 that's how they can be cleaner 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.590
 in the meantime that the chicken is cooking , I will put it 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.700
 the other ingredients that we need 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:07.369
 for the sambal goreng hati ayam 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.700
 and that from i have madame set pepper 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.110
 garlic 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.580
 well as tomato puree and then goes later 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.800
 also one 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.430
 daun salam and chin 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.640
 of course, say so tasty that were 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.920
 you always have to cut you 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.920
 wash hands before leaving eyes free 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.580
 otherwise they are wrong to me so 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.620
 I also found the grace that 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.490
 we will also use but they have to 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:45.150
 eveline two weeks here water not one 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:50.960
 whole we still look forward to how many weeks 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.960
 then again use 2 cloves of garlic 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.630
 there are three 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.630
 I'm not being checked 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:08.050
 Liver is that we all finished cooking 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.650
 so that i get out of that we go in 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.650
 at least dead 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:23.080
 chicken liver and small small pieces 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.650
 remain a little hot until it comes 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.860
 naturally just from boiling water 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.680
 use once a day in total 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:36.300
 but then cut it more difficult and then 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.940
 sorry about the pan later 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.360
 so you can really top it up 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.300
 then 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.380
 then you have that uncomfortable i'm putting in 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.380
 a pan of krafla 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.370
 good foot a bit 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.370
 explain macbook air 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.760
 I now think I do with it briefly 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.360
 or is tomato 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.840
 so actually tomato puree 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.110
 such a can is always a nice one 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.110
 quantity 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:31.440
 can be a reason that it is such a quantity 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:31.440
 is such a jab I neatly hurts 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.780
 stir well stir well 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.730
 do you think the spicy will be 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:55.450
 looks nice it smells really bad 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.450
 sharp 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.239
 dried shrimp face away 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.160
 also was some water on 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.160
 is another shirt 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.480
 then I still have a piece of drawers too 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.600
 tasty for the taste 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:32.500
 do you know 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.500
 yes there anything too 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:40.589
 indeed it will be in a few minutes 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:43.050
 simmer like that 

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:44.399
 the flavors can be distributed over the with 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.770
 others indicate ready 

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:51.119
 also simmer I have tasted 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.740
 and I'm going to do some ketchup we do 

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:55.619
 species knows you 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.449
 the sweetness of that catcher that made 

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:59.069
 sharpness of delivery also a bit 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.669
 statue 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.669
 so that is then 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:08.119
 favorable because and I like the taste 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.119
 the drifted spiciness 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:15.649
 in too much because it has to be a bit 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:18.779
 with water plates almost ready 

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:20.339
 what i like is the truck everything is included 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:22.139
 each other I'm going to do you a bowl 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:25.050
 so it's a bit 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:29.539
 mark and fear what scaled you is 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.539
 that very nice dish 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.110
 there it is 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.110
