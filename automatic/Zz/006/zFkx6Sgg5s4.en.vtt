00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.200
 but today we are going to teach bertini f1 goal 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.080
 south 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.810
 in the f1 south goal is a cane that comes 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.849
 tight with all its yellow fuji and 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.330
 will contact the brochures thread 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:26.090
 our blue and rock character of 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:30.220
 invest in three shots we know that the 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.220
 Mobile part goes from top to bottom 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.320
 then he mounted a pointer and came 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.480
 I personally like it a lot too 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.059
 because it is a pointer that is not too 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.360
 soft pointer up follows 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.880
 silveiro but a little bit more 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.160
 stronger what will give us that 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.120
 Martin very well applied to large 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.070
 distances 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.579
 a good thing that this rod has 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.860
 unplug the nick plug that is called 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.719
 invented by your bertini and his 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.610
 characteristic is that it is a shock that 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.540
 go into wedge then that we 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.940
 provides the 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:12.470
 by aligning the rings quickly 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.880
 plugged in perfectly and it's 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.880
 very fast to align it 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.310
 as you see 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.520
 it's pretty nice an action of 100 200 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.479
 grams 4 meters 20 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.149
 my nation that so much to move forward for 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:38.009
 long distances distances for more 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.009
 that the fish 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.920
 I have here you have the new south metal f1 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.370
 finally say that these reeds 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.680
 we have the investment would go fuji and of 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.020
 investment with advertising rings 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.770
 these vowels you can find them on 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.770
