00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
gonna we're going to use the portals to

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.270 
gonna we're going to use the portals to
launch<00:00:32.660> across<00:00:32.960> and<00:00:33.410> grab<00:00:33.680> our<00:00:33.829> first<00:00:34.040> block

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
launch across and grab our first block

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.130 
launch across and grab our first block
which<00:00:34.520> is<00:00:34.670> right<00:00:34.850> here<00:00:34.880> and<00:00:35.239> then<00:00:35.930> we're<00:00:36.050> going

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
which is right here and then we're going

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.460 
which is right here and then we're going
to<00:00:36.200> portal<00:00:37.060> down<00:00:38.060> back<00:00:38.600> down<00:00:38.630> here<00:00:39.080> so<00:00:39.260> we<00:00:39.380> can

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
to portal down back down here so we can

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.830 
to portal down back down here so we can
actually<00:00:39.650> get<00:00:40.160> on<00:00:40.310> to<00:00:40.520> the<00:00:40.550> physical<00:00:41.390> launcher

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
actually get on to the physical launcher

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.450 
actually get on to the physical launcher
they<00:00:41.960> have<00:00:42.140> located<00:00:42.860> here<00:00:43.070> so<00:00:43.190> we're<00:00:43.280> going<00:00:43.370> to

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
launch up here and we got to block this

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.830 
launch up here and we got to block this
laser<00:00:45.350> to<00:00:45.560> drop<00:00:45.860> this<00:00:46.100> first<00:00:46.640> barrier<00:00:47.150> so

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
back down here to the physical launcher

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.340 
back down here to the physical launcher
and<00:00:54.970> launched<00:00:55.970> across<00:00:56.120> launch<00:00:56.690> back<00:00:56.989> then<00:00:57.260> we

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
and launched across launch back then we

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.720 
and launched across launch back then we
have<00:00:57.470> another<00:00:57.500> blocker<00:00:58.010> here<00:00:58.310> so<00:00:58.460> we<00:00:58.550> got<00:00:58.640> to

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
have another blocker here so we got to

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.010 
have another blocker here so we got to
get<00:00:58.790> rid<00:00:59.060> of<00:00:59.090> that<00:00:59.239> thing<00:00:59.329> so<00:00:59.720> we're<00:00:59.840> going<00:00:59.930> to

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
get rid of that thing so we're going to

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.530 
get rid of that thing so we're going to
drop<00:01:00.610> basically<00:01:01.610> another<00:01:01.760> block<00:01:02.120> which<00:01:02.360> is<00:01:02.390> a

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
drop basically another block which is a

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.359 
drop basically another block which is a
laser<00:01:02.989> redirection<00:01:03.590> block<00:01:03.829> and<00:01:04.129> we're<00:01:04.250> going

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
laser redirection block and we're going

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.090 
laser redirection block and we're going
to<00:01:04.399> prep<00:01:04.759> our<00:01:04.970> portals<00:01:05.509> here<00:01:05.810> for<00:01:06.649> this<00:01:06.770> blocks

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
to prep our portals here for this blocks

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.469 
to prep our portals here for this blocks
we're<00:01:07.340> going<00:01:07.460> to<00:01:07.520> grab<00:01:07.670> it<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.000> that<00:01:08.119> we<00:01:08.240> can

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
we're going to grab it so that we can

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.330 
we're going to grab it so that we can
redirect<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.409> laser<00:01:09.650> to<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:09.950> receptor

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
redirect the laser to the receptor

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.270 
redirect the laser to the receptor
that's<00:01:10.580> going<00:01:10.790> to<00:01:10.850> open<00:01:11.030> up<00:01:11.740> that<00:01:12.740> second

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
that's going to open up that second

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.440 
that's going to open up that second
blocker<00:01:13.580> so<00:01:13.850> we're<00:01:13.970> going<00:01:14.060> to<00:01:14.150> bring<00:01:14.270> this
