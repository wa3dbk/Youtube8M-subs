a little contradictory and I felt the

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.490 
a little contradictory and I felt the

insistent on just letting my hair dry

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.980 
insistent on just letting my hair dry
naturally<00:00:17.119> because<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.210> didn't<00:00:18.539> want<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.810> waste

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
naturally because I didn't want to waste

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.099 
naturally because I didn't want to waste
electricity<00:00:19.609> with<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> hair<00:00:20.850> dryer<00:00:20.880> until<00:00:21.510> I

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
electricity with a hair dryer until I

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.320 
electricity with a hair dryer until I
read<00:00:22.470> decided<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.189> my<00:00:23.430> hair<00:00:23.640> wasn't<00:00:23.970> looking

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
did some research and found a bunch of

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.680 
did some research and found a bunch of
different<00:00:31.619> hair<00:00:31.769> dryers<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.510> wasn't<00:00:33.510> really

different hair dryers and wasn't really
convinced<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.260> any<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.829> them<00:00:35.010> except<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:35.460> was

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
convinced on any of them except one was

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.090 
convinced on any of them except one was

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
after a day of blow-drying my hair about

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.880 
after a day of blow-drying my hair about
probably<00:00:56.719> 10<00:00:57.719> hours<00:00:58.050> ago<00:00:58.289> or<00:00:58.469> something<00:00:58.770> like

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
probably 10 hours ago or something like

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.529 
probably 10 hours ago or something like
that<00:00:59.100> by<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.640> no<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.059> think<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.449> actually

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
that by that no I think it's actually

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.510 
that by that no I think it's actually
close<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.899> 12<00:01:01.230> hours<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.160> looks<00:01:02.460> pretty

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
close to 12 hours so it looks pretty

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.939 
close to 12 hours so it looks pretty
good<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.059> love<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.899> even<00:01:04.290> though<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:04.680> eco

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
good I love it it's even though it's eco

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.560 
good I love it it's even though it's eco
friendly<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.489> would<00:01:05.640> never<00:01:05.880> know<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.360> dries

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
friendly you would never know it dries

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.170 
friendly you would never know it dries
just<00:01:06.960> like<00:01:07.110> any<00:01:07.350> other<00:01:07.560> hair<00:01:07.860> dryer<00:01:08.130> how<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.060> it

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
just like any other hair dryer how is it

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.580 
just like any other hair dryer how is it
environmentally<00:01:09.810> friendly<00:01:10.200> though<00:01:10.350> you're

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
environmentally friendly though you're

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.469 
environmentally friendly though you're
probably<00:01:10.830> wondering<00:01:11.460> well<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> difference

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
probably wondering well the difference

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.899 
probably wondering well the difference
is<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.750> uses<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.290> ceramic<00:01:14.130> heating<00:01:14.549> element

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
is it uses a ceramic heating element

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.840 
is it uses a ceramic heating element
versus<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.049> typical<00:01:16.229> coil<00:01:16.920> heating<00:01:17.400> element

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
versus the typical coil heating element

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.929 
versus the typical coil heating element
that<00:01:18.030> most<00:01:18.540> hair<00:01:18.810> dryers<00:01:19.080> use<00:01:19.430> and<00:01:20.430> because<00:01:20.790> of

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
that most hair dryers use and because of

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.330 
that most hair dryers use and because of
this<00:01:21.150> it's<00:01:21.810> actually<00:01:22.080> less<00:01:22.560> damaging<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> your

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
this it's actually less damaging to your

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.609 
this it's actually less damaging to your
hair<00:01:23.640> which<00:01:24.390> might<00:01:24.600> not<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:24.780> nasty<00:01:25.320> Co

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
hair which might not be nasty Co

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.050 
hair which might not be nasty Co
friendly<00:01:26.009> necessarily<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:26.729> it's<00:01:26.880> much

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
friendly necessarily but it's much

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.359 
friendly necessarily but it's much
better<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.350> lot<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.920> hair<00:01:29.189> gets

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
better for you a lot of hair gets

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.780 
better for you a lot of hair gets
damaged<00:01:29.850> by<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.210> strong<00:01:30.960> heat<00:01:31.430> intensity<00:01:32.430> of

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
damaged by the strong heat intensity of

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.060 
damaged by the strong heat intensity of
a<00:01:32.840> regular<00:01:33.840> hair<00:01:34.020> dryer<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.560> uses<00:01:34.860> less

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
a regular hair dryer so it uses less

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.469 
a regular hair dryer so it uses less
electricity<00:01:35.509> in<00:01:36.509> fact<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.049> actually<00:01:37.380> uses<00:01:37.560> 90%

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
electricity in fact it actually uses 90%

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.109 
electricity in fact it actually uses 90%
less<00:01:39.479> electricity<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.470> guy<00:01:41.100> right<00:01:41.549> here<00:01:41.880> I

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
less electricity this guy right here I

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.120 
less electricity this guy right here I
love<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.990> way<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.229> looks<00:01:43.409> -<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.890> very

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
love the way it looks - it's very

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.490 
love the way it looks - it's very
stylish<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.390> actually<00:01:45.840> longer-lasting

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
stylish and it's actually longer-lasting

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.039 
stylish and it's actually longer-lasting
the<00:01:46.920> coil<00:01:47.189> inside<00:01:47.610> lasts<00:01:48.030> much<00:01:48.270> longer<00:01:48.299> than<00:01:48.750> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the coil inside lasts much longer than a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.139 
the coil inside lasts much longer than a
typical<00:01:49.350> now<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.100> great<00:01:50.430> thing<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:51.000> you're

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
typical now the great thing is is you're

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.929 
typical now the great thing is is you're
not<00:01:51.329> losing<00:01:51.780> much<00:01:52.740> heat<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.369> actually<00:01:53.790> heats

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
not losing much heat this actually heats

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.060 
not losing much heat this actually heats
up<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.240> about<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.509> same<00:01:54.720> temperature<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.799> a

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070
