00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.930
 has people youtube session and sic sean 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.970
 welcome this in a new video in 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.759
 this time we are again in the magnet 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.710
 online masters here we live again 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:14.469
 here as you can see in the title it 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.660
 try another good new bot is not so 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:20.289
 new but it's still an alternative 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.570
 to the vote post previously published to 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.910
 this one is exclusively this nothing more 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.890
 for 64 bits as we can see here is 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.269
 the file of m 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:35.440
 v 2 64 bits nothing else is for 64 bits 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:37.750
 it does not work for 32 and it is not detected ok 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.170
 It is completely proven that it is not 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:45.309
 detected let's see what this is about 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.899
 boat is very, very simple as that 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.579
 only thing you have to do is have 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:53.109
 open the game to go to the file and other 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.050
 time to run it as administrator 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:58.460
 always run as administrator and 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.520
 then to do this just half 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.780
 rsf 5 to start bot ok 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.360
 before starting to run the bot 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.320
 you have to clarify the window always has 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:17.090
 to be open and focused not and you have 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.189
 to avoid changing the keys of 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.079
 for the default keys of the 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.079
 game for example here I 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.530
 this here what I have is in short 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.050
 cuts in what it is to have come to me 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.080
 I have it with the letter c since it was me 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.290
 makes it more comfortable to press to choose the 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.750
 next lemon and attack it ok here 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.570
 we can have many letters as 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.640
 they change them, but here it is 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.190
 strictly that they give him in default 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.130
 and nothing else ends up being changed into default 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.650
 and it's because if it does not select them 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.000
 the enemies are worth then we have to 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.400
 give it like this now if we open the the bot it 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.020
 we leave as administrator then 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.380
 Yes now 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.640
 Now another thing that should be clarified is that 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.160
 nothing more 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.629
 this bot serves for farmers for example 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.739
 again with the this the boxes of the is 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:23.340
 lemon yorito of the event serves very well 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:25.620
 since the boat is a bit slower and 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.670
 it does not select so fast that it's not 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:35.010
 It serves very well to make them like 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.450
 is called to form something else this month 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.160
 it's like coming back here you're already using 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.460
 the other thing is that it seems to me that in the 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.820
 slot 8 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:50.600
 it's recovery 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:53.750
 nothing else we tighten f5 and it appears that in 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.050
 one spot full of Demon's going to start 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.330
 knit alone in the same way 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.980
 all the lemons that are there if 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.510
 they want the next evolution is going to 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.040
 to be evolving and evolving 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.730
 so far I got all this is already 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.580
 automatic 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:14.950
 but it seems to me that they say he exploded 8 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:17.590
 as you see this one attacks slower and also 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.130
 take a little longer to collect the 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.430
 things 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.360
 Now that it's over, they're supposed to go to 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:30.090
 pick up the thread 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:31.720
 in this the gift to be like this takes a 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.300
 a little more 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.300
 but equally attacks all 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.459
 so I think that 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.459
 I think it 's in 8 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.349
 in the f8 then 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.900
 there it is like this it is in f8 it is where 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:57.099
 put the items to recover I think 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.830
 that f 7 date to recover the desire 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:02.400
 the food that but as you can see it follows 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.010
 working equally works very well 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.099
 so I hope I can take it back if they get it 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.050
 use that is useful to you then it is worth 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.760
 but nothing those who are in the 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.610
 description anything like 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.609
 use my facebook page that 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.950
 is the description too and if you 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:25.210
 liked denle likes share the sum 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.230
 the favorites are worth seeing and even the 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.730
 next 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:36.080
 how it works very easy to finish it 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:39.650
 just squeeze this one would appear this and the 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.140
 vote has automatically stopped that 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.820
 it's something that I was forgetting ok 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.820
 now we see you chao
