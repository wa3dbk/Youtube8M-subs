just<00:07:07.630> now<00:07:07.900> if<00:07:08.200> I<00:07:09.010> understood<00:07:09.520> the<00:07:09.580> display

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.090 
just now if I understood the display

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.660 
just now if I understood the display
correctly<00:07:10.630> I<00:07:10.930> think<00:07:11.470> we<00:07:11.770> sort<00:07:11.980> of<00:07:12.100> launched<00:07:12.550> a

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:12.670 
correctly I think we sort of launched a

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.790 
correctly I think we sort of launched a
homing<00:07:13.090> beacon<00:07:13.120> of<00:07:13.660> some<00:07:13.870> kind<00:07:14.170> down<00:07:14.500> to<00:07:14.680> the

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 
homing beacon of some kind down to the

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.090 
homing beacon of some kind down to the
surface<00:07:15.300> landed<00:07:16.300> just<00:07:16.480> outside<00:07:16.690> DC<00:07:17.500> I

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:18.100 
surface landed just outside DC I

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.400 
surface landed just outside DC I
wouldn't<00:07:19.060> mention<00:07:19.180> it<00:07:19.540> except<00:07:19.990> that<00:07:20.110> I<00:07:20.170> think

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.410 
wouldn't mention it except that I think

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.910 
wouldn't mention it except that I think
like<00:07:21.250> I<00:07:21.370> said<00:07:21.580> I'm<00:07:21.790> not<00:07:21.850> sure<00:07:22.060> I<00:07:22.530> think<00:07:23.530> it's<00:07:23.770> a

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:23.920 
like I said I'm not sure I think it's a

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.550 
like I said I'm not sure I think it's a
way<00:07:24.100> to<00:07:24.130> get<00:07:24.490> back<00:07:24.730> to<00:07:24.910> earth<00:07:25.350> seems<00:07:26.350> like

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 
way to get back to earth seems like

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.230 
way to get back to earth seems like
there's<00:07:26.800> a<00:07:26.860> teleporter<00:07:27.640> in<00:07:27.730> the<00:07:27.820> captains
