and<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.200> was<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.380> big<00:01:16.590> test<00:01:16.799> for<00:01:17.040> us<00:01:17.070> through<00:01:18.060> this

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
and I was a big test for us through this

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.899 
and I was a big test for us through this
summer<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.950> know<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.369> was<00:01:20.490> one<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
summer so you know that was one of the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.580 
summer so you know that was one of the
biggest<00:01:21.090> stages<00:01:21.360> for<00:01:21.630> us<00:01:21.750> as<00:01:21.960> far<00:01:22.229> as<00:01:22.259> summer

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
biggest stages for us as far as summer

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.649 
biggest stages for us as far as summer
and<00:01:23.070> then<00:01:23.430> as<00:01:23.670> far<00:01:23.820> as<00:01:23.880> conditioning<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.540> was

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
and then as far as conditioning that was

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.690 
and then as far as conditioning that was
another<00:01:24.810> big<00:01:25.020> part<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.100> know<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.610> we

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
another big part that you know that we

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.999 
another big part that you know that we
needed<00:01:26.880> anakin<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.930> come<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.229> for<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.590> season

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
needed anakin to come in for the season

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.020 
needed anakin to come in for the season
so<00:01:29.990> as<00:01:30.990> far<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.290> summer<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.520> was<00:01:32.640> really<00:01:32.880> big

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
so as far as summer it was really big

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.170 
so as far as summer it was really big
for<00:01:33.060> us<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:34.799> hope<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.430> we<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.820> you
