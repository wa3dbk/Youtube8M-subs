this<00:01:31.380> not<00:01:31.560> normally<00:01:32.100> going<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.280> work<00:01:32.490> under

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
this not normally going to work under

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.569 
this not normally going to work under
most<00:01:33.030> circumstances<00:01:33.409> so<00:01:34.409> it's<00:01:34.890> important<00:01:35.490> to

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
most circumstances so it's important to

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.149 
most circumstances so it's important to
be<00:01:35.700> aware<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:36.270> how<00:01:36.960> hard<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.590> fish<00:01:37.799> are<00:01:38.009> to

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
be aware of how hard the fish are to

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.819 
be aware of how hard the fish are to
keep<00:01:38.369> before<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.600> try<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.960> keep<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.350> fish<00:01:40.530> and

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
keep before you try to keep the fish and

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.289 
keep before you try to keep the fish and
then<00:01:41.070> if<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.310> do<00:01:41.520> want<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.790> keep<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.119> fish

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
then if you do want to keep the fish

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.270 
then if you do want to keep the fish
which<00:01:42.479> are<00:01:42.600> number<00:01:42.869> twos<00:01:43.079> or<00:01:43.259> threes<00:01:43.290> maybe

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
which are number twos or threes maybe

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.830 
which are number twos or threes maybe
have<00:01:44.520> some<00:01:44.759> sort<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.030> understanding<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.659> what

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
have some sort of understanding of what

putting the scavenging fish in at the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.690 
putting the scavenging fish in at the
start<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.290> good<00:01:58.530> idea<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:59.040> help<00:01:59.189> keep<00:01:59.520> down

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
start is a good idea to help keep down

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.459 
start is a good idea to help keep down
your<00:01:59.939> algae<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.509> make<00:02:00.990> sure<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
your algae and make sure that the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.280 
your algae and make sure that the
aquarium<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.159> relatively<00:02:02.670> clean<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.299> knowing

aquarium is relatively clean and knowing
that<00:02:04.439> if<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.710> put<00:02:04.950> angels<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.610> it's<00:02:06.090> best<00:02:06.360> to

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
that if you put angels in it's best to

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.300 
that if you put angels in it's best to
put<00:02:06.689> any<00:02:06.810> Angels<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.439> want<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.860> aquarium

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
put any Angels you want in the aquarium

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.529 
put any Angels you want in the aquarium
in<00:02:08.700> at<00:02:08.940> one<00:02:09.149> time

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
in at one time

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.229 
in at one time
so<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.679> Angels<00:02:11.009> go<00:02:11.129> in<00:02:11.280> at<00:02:11.370> one<00:02:11.520> time<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.060> they

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
so the Angels go in at one time so they

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.280 
so the Angels go in at one time so they
have<00:02:12.450> equalled

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
have equalled

danger one in at one time so they have

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.170

group of fish generally the various

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.759 
group of fish generally the various
families<00:02:27.450> are<00:02:27.659> better<00:02:27.810> off<00:02:28.049> introduced<00:02:28.590> in

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
families are better off introduced in

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.460 
families are better off introduced in
one<00:02:29.040> day<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:30.000> for<00:02:30.269> an<00:02:30.420> aquarium<00:02:30.930> might<00:02:31.230> say

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
one day so for an aquarium might say

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.990 
one day so for an aquarium might say
okay<00:02:31.829> we'll<00:02:32.010> start<00:02:32.250> off<00:02:32.340> with<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.579> clownfish

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
okay we'll start off with the clownfish

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.699 
okay we'll start off with the clownfish
we<00:02:33.180> put<00:02:33.329> the<00:02:33.420> clownfish<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:33.989> we<00:02:34.379> let<00:02:34.500> them

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
we put the clownfish in we let them

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.289 
we put the clownfish in we let them
establish<00:02:35.129> themselves<00:02:35.579> in<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.849> aquariums

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
establish themselves in the aquariums

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.990 
establish themselves in the aquariums
then<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.870> month<00:02:37.200> later<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:37.859> go<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.280> wrasses<00:02:38.730> we

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
then a month later in go the wrasses we

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.509 
then a month later in go the wrasses we
put<00:02:39.180> any<00:02:39.299> wrasse<00:02:39.540> as<00:02:39.750> we<00:02:39.900> want<00:02:40.109> then<00:02:40.889> in<00:02:41.189> go<00:02:41.370> the

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
put any wrasse as we want then in go the

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.839 
put any wrasse as we want then in go the
Angels<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.900> you'll<00:02:43.469> generally<00:02:43.980> have<00:02:44.129> less

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
Angels so you'll generally have less

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.330 
Angels so you'll generally have less
problems<00:02:45.739> introducing<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.859> fish<00:02:47.069> if<00:02:47.280> you

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
problems introducing the fish if you

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.449 
problems introducing the fish if you
introduce<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.329> families<00:02:48.870> in<00:02:49.109> groups<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:49.769> at

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
introduce the families in groups so at

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.030 
introduce the families in groups so at
an<00:02:50.730> now<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.269> then<00:02:51.389> attain<00:02:51.720> later<00:02:52.019> tends<00:02:52.859> to

an now and then attain later tends to

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.670 
an now and then attain later tends to
cause<00:02:53.250> more<00:02:53.519> problems<00:02:54.090> more<00:02:54.269> friction<00:02:54.930> more

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
cause more problems more friction more

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.309 
cause more problems more friction more

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
of the big fish is it will normally eat

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.890 
of the big fish is it will normally eat
the<00:03:14.489> little<00:03:14.669> fish<00:03:14.790> because<00:03:15.359> the<00:03:15.540> fish<00:03:15.569> are

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
the little fish because the fish are

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.949 
the little fish because the fish are
afterall<00:03:16.799> opportunists<00:03:17.729> and<00:03:17.879> if<00:03:18.419> the<00:03:18.599> big<00:03:18.780> one

into the downsell trap what the damaging
trap<00:04:37.050> is<00:04:37.260> is<00:04:37.620> basically<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.250> start<00:04:38.520> off<00:04:38.730> with

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
trap is is basically you start off with

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.880 
trap is is basically you start off with
some<00:04:39.060> Hardy<00:04:39.390> fish<00:04:39.570> like<00:04:39.780> damsels<00:04:40.260> they<00:04:40.680> get

some Hardy fish like damsels they get

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.250 
some Hardy fish like damsels they get
very<00:04:41.130> territorial<00:04:41.580> in<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.270> aquarium<00:04:42.600> then

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
very territorial in the aquarium then

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.990 
very territorial in the aquarium then
you<00:04:43.380> try<00:04:43.650> and<00:04:43.680> introduce<00:04:43.920> other<00:04:44.430> species

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
you try and introduce other species

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.760 
you try and introduce other species
later<00:04:45.210> on<00:04:45.480> and<00:04:45.720> find<00:04:46.140> that<00:04:46.260> they<00:04:46.380> don't<00:04:46.500> last

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
later on and find that they don't last

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.560 
later on and find that they don't last
for<00:04:47.040> very<00:04:47.220> long<00:04:47.460> and<00:04:47.820> that's<00:04:48.090> because<00:04:48.420> they're

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
for very long and that's because they're

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.930 
for very long and that's because they're
getting<00:04:48.690> bullied<00:04:49.140> harassed<00:04:49.770> or<00:04:50.190> even<00:04:50.490> purely

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
getting bullied harassed or even purely

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.330 
getting bullied harassed or even purely
killed<00:04:51.300> by<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:51.660> damsels<00:04:52.350> so<00:04:52.980> if<00:04:53.070> you<00:04:53.190> can

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
killed by the damsels so if you can

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.650 
killed by the damsels so if you can
imagine<00:04:53.430> a<00:04:53.790> new<00:04:53.940> fish<00:04:54.180> trying<00:04:54.390> to<00:04:54.510> get

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
imagine a new fish trying to get

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
becomes stressed it soon gets white spot

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.360

fish<00:05:20.550> soon<00:05:20.850> dies<00:05:21.120> then<00:05:21.990> you<00:05:22.020> try<00:05:22.350> another<00:05:22.500> fish

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
fish soon dies then you try another fish

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.230 
fish soon dies then you try another fish
and<00:05:23.160> then<00:05:23.280> you<00:05:23.310> end<00:05:23.520> up<00:05:23.670> being<00:05:23.910> under<00:05:24.120> the

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
and then you end up being under the

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.730 
and then you end up being under the
impression<00:05:24.660> that<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:24.900> only<00:05:25.170> fish<00:05:25.380> that<00:05:25.560> work

impression that the only fish that work

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.380 
impression that the only fish that work
in<00:05:25.920> the<00:05:26.010> aquarium<00:05:26.490> are<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:27.000> ones<00:05:27.180> that<00:05:27.330> you

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
in the aquarium are the ones that you

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.660 
in the aquarium are the ones that you
had<00:05:27.540> in<00:05:27.660> the<00:05:27.750> first<00:05:27.960> place<00:05:28.140> so<00:05:28.980> one<00:05:29.190> option<00:05:29.340> is

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 
had in the first place so one option is

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.950 
had in the first place so one option is
either<00:05:29.850> take<00:05:30.180> the<00:05:30.330> fish<00:05:30.510> back<00:05:30.720> to<00:05:30.870> the

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
either take the fish back to the

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.660 
either take the fish back to the
aquarium<00:05:31.200> shop<00:05:31.530> and<00:05:31.710> actually<00:05:31.800> trade<00:05:32.310> them<00:05:32.520> in

and disturbing the current territories

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.920 
and disturbing the current territories
is<00:05:38.040> enough<00:05:38.490> to<00:05:38.700> allow<00:05:38.970> the<00:05:39.030> new<00:05:39.360> fish<00:05:39.570> to<00:05:39.750> come

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
is enough to allow the new fish to come

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.810 
is enough to allow the new fish to come
into<00:05:40.080> the<00:05:40.260> aquarium<00:05:40.500> because<00:05:41.190> the<00:05:41.280> old<00:05:41.490> Fisher

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 
fish goes per bag because it's quite

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.379 
fish goes per bag because it's quite

before<00:07:28.530> you<00:07:28.620> get<00:07:28.770> home<00:07:28.980> also<00:07:29.520> insist<00:07:30.150> that<00:07:30.270> the

oxygen and the rest to cupped air
you<00:07:40.680> don't<00:07:40.919> need<00:07:41.100> anywhere<00:07:41.550> near<00:07:41.820> as<00:07:41.940> much

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.150
