00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
it looks kind of like this it's not

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.800 
it looks kind of like this it's not
really<00:01:32.310> appealing<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.850> look<00:01:33.030> at<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.479> mean<00:01:33.720> I

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
really appealing to look at but I mean I

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.210 
really appealing to look at but I mean I
just<00:01:33.990> keep<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.320> container<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.860> my<00:01:34.950> fridge

it's easy I can take with me on the go

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.649 
it's easy I can take with me on the go
to<00:01:37.460> smells<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.610> same<00:01:38.790> kind<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.180> peppermint

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
to smells the same kind of peppermint

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.899

like<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.290> really<00:01:40.829> didn't<00:01:41.130> measure<00:01:41.310> all<00:01:41.700> that

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
like so I really didn't measure all that
