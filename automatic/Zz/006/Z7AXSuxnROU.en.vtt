00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 very good to all friends leave is 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.620
 different yesterday I was with 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.290
 good friend watching a game about his 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.969
 genius to the board and well I would like 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.820
 share it with all of you so 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.330
 we go there the game between ale kim and 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.660
 nínkovic who won this first moves 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.199
 in 1931 in bradley let's see how it 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.359
 developed the game starts with the 4 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.039
 to the team that plays with white and 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.020
 responds to the French defense or within 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.250
 bits 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.040
 what are the following movements 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.440
 c3 horse by white and 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.260
 comes the wing hour variant of the 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.090
 French defense with bishop b 4 here 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.210
 normally he usually plays movements 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.540
 the type to type type advance of 5 or 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.640
 type to 3 but here the ekin decides 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.910
 innovate and play the horse of 2 which 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.680
 surprises his rival which in 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.449
 principle makes a wise decision that 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.150
 is to take the pawn and it is not the threat to 3 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:09.000
 just take the horse and the white 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.700
 recapture of new horse with what 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.600
 which Black at the moment seems that 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.869
 they are well located 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.670
 they have a bit more and good 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.759
 for now 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.290
 and to try to consolidate the position 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:28.149
 an appropriate movement would be for example 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.159
 12 6 to continue developing and 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:34.400
 attacking the pawn of 4 however kim 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.320
 infovic decides to play f5 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.030
 already the canons of chess say that 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.940
 this movement can not be good in 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.080
 defend the pawn from more than he has because 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.920
 Attention to the next movement of 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.740
 ekin 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.390
 efe 3 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.310
 he is still looking for development 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.490
 obviously the black has to capture and 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.009
 lady texture 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.899
 developing the lady and here the black 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.180
 go back to take another appointment pawn so 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:02.100
 which at the moment are two pawns 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.220
 in exchange for white's development 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.190
 fine play by white 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.250
 Lady G3 could also have played by 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.160
 example bishop f4 taking the pawn of 7 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.959
 but decides to make lady g3 to play 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.400
 also always where efe 7 and at the same time 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.090
 the point g 7 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.090
 all right 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.970
 now 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.630
 so Black decides to develop 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.520
 at the cost of costing the pawn of g7 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.190
 but they can not give more times of 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.320
 development and here first they decide to give a 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.380
 check against which the target is 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.200
 develops by covering himself with the bishop 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.020
 and after tower g8 nothing way to retreat 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.310
 and here maybe they could have resumed the 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.980
 pawn of g2 the pickers for example 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.550
 however decided in the movement 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.140
 tower g6 the lady retires again 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.140
 situates on a diagonal that can be very 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.120
 dangerous that we will see afterwards bishop 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.010
 of 7 of the development movement now 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.000
 yes and here will have the movement again 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.330
 bishop f4 but someone likes more the 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.640
 Bishop G5 movement always focusing 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.950
 on this diagonal the threat on the 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.900
 horse of festes and a possible castling 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.019
 long 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.640
 and this unit for my taste is a 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.049
 movement a little bit wrong by part 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.200
 of blacks since it would have been better 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.569
 C6 horse would have come to the next 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.709
 combination of movements which is not 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.849
 easy to see long castling long castling 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.310
 development of the tower threatening a 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:43.490
 discovered lady enters and this play well 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:47.960
 which is very difficult to see h6 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:50.180
 bishop by horse g4 have to have the 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.760
 horse of the dunk over the tower and 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.760
 see what difficult practice sequence 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.170
 to see bishop by discovered in a 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:03.410
 black lady tower by and now would come 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.480
 lady by followed by pawn by tower by and 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.950
 horse for the position is 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.420
 approximately even though the 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.030
 plan structure of the target is a 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.860
 a little bit better 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.740
 this sequence is very difficult to see 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.040
 before which infovic instead of doing 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.739
 c6 horse decided to make bishop c6 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.450
 touching for the moment the g20 pawn here 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.210
 in the position of black is worse 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.750
 because after castling 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.880
 I still had the possibility of good 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.710
 not look bad here he made alfil 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.940
 because it's the final mistake of the game 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.520
 but after green horse 7 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.260
 Real story game the lady of 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:46.350
 the dunk but tower for the genius 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:49.920
 followed by fillet 5 cow when the 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:53.400
 heading the white because sentence 5 bishop 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:56.790
 by pawn vor and damages 7 the lady is 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.060
 straining with devastating effects is not 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.280
 can defend the premium of g6 and also 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.390
 the entrance to the eighth row capturing 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.700
 tower 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.860
 but good here I have decided to take the 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:13.000
 Infovician pawn and this is a final mistake 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:16.030
 because tower 1 comes starting again 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.760
 the discovery decides to cover over 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.230
 bishop who in principle seems good idea 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.590
 because it is also defended by the 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:27.370
 horse the lady and the pawn but well in 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.990
 excellent movement h5 good bishop 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.260
 it seems that it can be with a horse 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.450
 but as always, look at the idea of 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.780
 diagonal and the entrance of the tower in 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:42.130
 octave that forces the black king to enter 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:44.910
 in f 7 and now 3 of both brache 5 the 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:48.150
 Black women decided to leave 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:51.630
 from out in 19 movements it 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:54.170
 says it's the shortest defeat by 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.940
 part of the hobbits inss and prevented it 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.730
 they would have the fifth player of very much 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.110
 talent improvisation and tactics like 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.820
 better a couple of variants to see by 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.460
 which abandoned any service here by 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.940
 example if the level plays reiche 7 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:12.080
 defending the h 7 pawn simply 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.080
 horse x 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:18.590
 but a couple 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:20.960
 and checkmate of the bishop what it causes is the 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.539
 loss of the lady 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.810
 city ​​the variants and another variant 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:29.660
 example instead of the king g7 would be majes 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:32.120
 7 defending again the entrance to the 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:36.500
 lady and the pawn of h 7 came again 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:38.660
 horse by efe per tower was 1 check and 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.780
 the king has no place to hide 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:44.040
 with the lady and now the entrance is 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.870
 devastating 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.780
 does not have any hope the black ones 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:52.310
 they have to cover themselves with the tower and come 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:56.320
 tower by king 17 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:07:00.350
 and one of the possible mates is this 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:02.300
 f8 tower giving mate with the bishop since 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.249
 the tower can not capture what is 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.819
 nailed 

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:10.179
 about a spectacular position we are going to 

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:11.949
 end watching the last move of the 

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:14.319
 departure ladies brache 5 and here the 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:17.109
 white abandoned as I say and 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:19.629
 directing the shortest defeat alice 

00:07:17.109 --> 00:07:21.999
 ovitz a spectacular game on the part 

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:25.230
 de ale kim where they do not hesitate to give 

00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:28.530
 pawns in exchange for initiative and attack 

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:30.630
 I hope you liked and well let
