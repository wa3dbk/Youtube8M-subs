the small blade like this chopping of
course<00:00:24.000> takes<00:00:24.270> a<00:00:24.540> bit<00:00:25.080> more<00:00:25.110> effort<00:00:30.410> you<00:00:31.410> can

of my hand yeah it was quite a bit of
work<00:00:58.890> well<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.640> should<00:00:59.820> come<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.180> no<00:01:00.300> surprise

that what are you doing anyway he should

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.560 
that what are you doing anyway he should
take<00:01:07.410> an<00:01:07.590> ax<00:01:07.770> or<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.009> hatchet<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.300> some

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570

in<00:01:20.640> terms<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.000> chopping<00:01:21.570> would<00:01:21.780> be<00:01:21.930> more<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.470> an

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
in terms of chopping would be more of an

ideal one thing that I noticed which
probably<00:01:31.409> has<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.830> do<00:01:32.040> with<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:33.030> handle<00:01:33.420> scale

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
probably has to do with the handle scale

of<00:01:40.740> hand<00:01:40.950> shock<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:42.540> particular<00:01:43.130> my

of hand shock and in particular my

of hand shock and in particular my
little<00:01:44.640> finger<00:01:45.030> got<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> bit<00:01:45.810> beat<00:01:46.110> up<00:01:46.320> when<00:01:47.070> I

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
little finger got a bit beat up when I

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.499 
little finger got a bit beat up when I
chopped<00:01:48.119> away<00:01:48.479> probably<00:01:49.409> because<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.189> was

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
chopped away probably because it was

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.910 
chopped away probably because it was
pounding<00:01:51.509> against<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.020> tang<00:01:52.320> right<00:01:52.650> there

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
pounding against the tang right there

pounding against the tang right there
that's<00:01:53.850> what<00:01:54.240> I'm<00:01:54.330> guessing<00:01:54.770> definitely

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
that's what I'm guessing definitely

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.280 
that's what I'm guessing definitely
filled<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.340> bone<00:01:56.520> there<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:58.110> would

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
filled in the bone there so that would

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.090 
filled in the bone there so that would
become<00:01:58.710> quite<00:01:59.369> uncomfortable<00:01:59.729> over<00:02:00.180> time<00:02:01.100> but

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
become quite uncomfortable over time but

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.140 
become quite uncomfortable over time but
again<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.509> not<00:02:03.720> really<00:02:04.530> what<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.920> is

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
again this is not really what this is

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.050 
again this is not really what this is
meant<00:02:06.150> for<00:02:06.500> it's<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.890> an<00:02:08.399> emergency

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060

meant for it's just an emergency
solution<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:10.229> should<00:02:10.290> be<00:02:10.769> a<00:02:10.799> lot<00:02:11.220> better<00:02:11.250> at

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
solution it should be a lot better at

it's<00:03:24.360> big<00:03:25.010> easier<00:03:26.010> by<00:03:26.580> the<00:03:27.120> thick<00:03:27.390> spine

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
it's big easier by the thick spine

it's big easier by the thick spine
because<00:03:28.320> it<00:03:28.410> acts<00:03:28.620> like<00:03:28.800> a<00:03:28.950> wedge<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:30.890> split

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890

because it acts like a wedge to split
the<00:03:32.100> logs<00:03:33.170> so<00:03:34.170> that's<00:03:34.350> quite<00:03:34.590> useful<00:03:34.770> and<00:03:35.310> of

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
throwing knives and by rights I should

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.110
