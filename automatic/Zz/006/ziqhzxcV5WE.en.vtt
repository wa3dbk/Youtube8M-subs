00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.820 

I<00:01:03.270> mean<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.690> guess<00:01:03.930> whenever<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> job

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.560 
I mean I guess whenever you have a job
when<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.100> work<00:01:05.309> with<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.880> public<00:01:06.210> it

when you work with the public it

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.530 
when you work with the public it
definitely<00:01:06.990> helps<00:01:07.290> create<00:01:08.360> characters<00:01:09.360> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
definitely helps create characters and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.929 
definitely helps create characters and
helps<00:01:09.689> with<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.900> writing<00:01:10.200> somehow<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.369> guess<00:01:11.580> I

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
helps with the writing somehow I guess I

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.570 
helps with the writing somehow I guess I

treats<00:03:10.519> are<00:03:10.670> bad<00:03:10.850> and<00:03:11.030> then<00:03:11.150> it<00:03:11.360> takes<00:03:11.690> her<00:03:11.840> a

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
treats are bad and then it takes her a

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.110 
treats are bad and then it takes her a
while<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.200> realize<00:03:12.890> that<00:03:12.920> it's<00:03:13.519> nicer<00:03:13.790> to<00:03:14.000> go

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
while to realize that it's nicer to go

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.069

with<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.299> nicer<00:03:14.450> guys<00:03:14.690> why<00:03:14.810> do<00:03:14.900> you<00:03:14.959> think

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
with the nicer guys why do you think

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.539 
with the nicer guys why do you think
that<00:03:15.260> women<00:03:15.380> go<00:03:15.620> for<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.829> bad<00:03:15.950> boys<00:03:15.980> initially

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
that women go for the bad boys initially

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.940 
that women go for the bad boys initially
it<00:03:16.640> takes<00:03:16.850> a<00:03:17.000> few<00:03:17.180> frogs<00:03:17.390> to<00:03:17.780> realize<00:03:18.769> I<00:03:18.920> think

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
it takes a few frogs to realize I think

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.210 
it takes a few frogs to realize I think
sometimes<00:03:19.820> women<00:03:20.120> like<00:03:20.420> to<00:03:20.570> think<00:03:20.750> they<00:03:20.900> can

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
sometimes women like to think they can

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.819 
sometimes women like to think they can
turn<00:03:22.220> a<00:03:22.670> man<00:03:22.730> like<00:03:23.360> if<00:03:23.810> you<00:03:24.230> go<00:03:24.320> on<00:03:24.440> a<00:03:24.500> date<00:03:24.650> with

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
into relationships or whatever I think

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.880 
into relationships or whatever I think
sometimes<00:03:28.670> we<00:03:28.760> think<00:03:28.790> well<00:03:29.180> if<00:03:29.840> I<00:03:30.140> really<00:03:30.470> try

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890
