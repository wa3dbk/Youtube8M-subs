00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.310 
and then back to bubble pulley they're
really<00:02:08.640> nothing<00:02:08.820> special<00:02:09.030> here<00:02:09.750> it's<00:02:10.050> just

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
really nothing special here it's just

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.340 
really nothing special here it's just
getting<00:02:10.650> the<00:02:10.770> belt<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.570> under<00:02:12.570> that's<00:02:12.780> big

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
getting the belt on under that's big

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:21.250 
getting the belt on under that's big
heavy<00:02:13.680> spring<00:02:14.130> over<00:02:14.400> there<00:02:15.980> see<00:02:18.320> but<00:02:19.320> just

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
heavy spring over there see but just

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260 
heavy spring over there see but just
give<00:02:22.260> them<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.500> spin<00:02:22.830> with<00:02:23.190> your<00:02:23.310> hand<00:02:23.550> careful

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270

you have a double pulley system here
it's<00:03:20.870> a<00:03:21.020> little<00:03:21.410> bit<00:03:21.650> dark<00:03:21.950> but<00:03:22.480> doing<00:03:23.480> the

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
it's a little bit dark but doing the

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.160 
it's a little bit dark but doing the
best<00:03:23.720> I<00:03:23.840> can

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.750 

it's<00:03:27.170> going<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.710> want<00:03:27.860> to<00:03:27.980> go<00:03:28.460> on<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:31.220> backside

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
it's going to want to go on the backside

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.020 
it's going to want to go on the backside
or<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.410> groove<00:03:33.410> or<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.190> V<00:03:34.340> part<00:03:34.640> is<00:03:34.790> going<00:03:34.940> to

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
go on the groove pulley here it's going

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.700 
go on the groove pulley here it's going
to<00:03:38.510> make<00:03:39.640> 90<00:03:40.640> it's<00:03:41.060> going<00:03:41.210> to<00:03:41.270> go<00:03:41.420> around<00:03:41.710> the

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
to make 90 it's going to go around the

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.330 
to make 90 it's going to go around the
backside<00:03:42.950> of<00:03:43.220> this<00:03:43.490> one<00:03:43.700> it's<00:03:44.600> going<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:44.810> go<00:03:45.020> on

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
backside of this one it's going to go on

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.210 
backside of this one it's going to go on
this<00:03:46.340> belt<00:03:46.550> got<00:03:46.790> here<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.300> then<00:03:47.720> back<00:03:47.960> to<00:03:48.290> this

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
this belt got here and then back to this

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.450 
this belt got here and then back to this
pulley<00:03:49.490> right<00:03:49.760> here<00:03:50.770> there's<00:03:51.770> a<00:03:51.860> decent<00:03:52.100> view

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
pulley right here there's a decent view

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.170 
pulley right here there's a decent view
of<00:03:52.580> that<00:03:52.810> right<00:03:53.810> there<00:03:54.700> once<00:03:55.700> you<00:03:55.850> get<00:03:56.030> it

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
of that right there once you get it

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.660 
of that right there once you get it
around<00:03:56.960> those<00:03:57.320> two<00:03:57.620> pulleys<00:03:57.920> come<00:03:58.430> around

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
around those two pulleys come around

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.880 
around those two pulleys come around
here<00:03:59.440> and<00:04:00.440> slip<00:04:00.890> it<00:04:01.070> on<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:02.150> double<00:04:02.360> pulley

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
here and slip it on the double pulley

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.020 
here and slip it on the double pulley
and<00:04:04.060> this<00:04:05.060> is<00:04:05.270> the<00:04:05.420> trick<00:04:06.610> whenever<00:04:07.610> you<00:04:07.790> go<00:04:08.000> to

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
and this is the trick whenever you go to

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.930 
and this is the trick whenever you go to
put<00:04:08.330> your<00:04:08.510> belt<00:04:08.690> guard<00:04:09.020> back<00:04:09.260> on<00:04:12.640> see<00:04:13.640> how<00:04:13.790> it's

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
put your belt guard back on see how it's

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.060 
put your belt guard back on see how it's
got<00:04:14.090> two<00:04:14.330> little<00:04:14.540> built-in<00:04:15.260> belt<00:04:15.470> gotcha

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
got two little built-in belt gotcha

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.680 
got two little built-in belt gotcha
one<00:04:16.340> here<00:04:16.700> and<00:04:16.880> one<00:04:17.260> here<00:04:18.470> you<00:04:18.590> have<00:04:18.709> a<00:04:18.770> chance

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
one here and one here you have a chance

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.410 
one here and one here you have a chance
getting<00:04:20.690> that<00:04:20.930> belt<00:04:21.230> guard<00:04:22.750> here<00:04:25.240> on<00:04:26.240> the

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
getting that belt guard here on the

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.530 
getting that belt guard here on the
inside<00:04:26.930> of<00:04:27.320> this<00:04:27.890> belt<00:04:28.190> and<00:04:28.550> if<00:04:29.030> you<00:04:29.180> do<00:04:29.330> that

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
inside of this belt and if you do that

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.050 
inside of this belt and if you do that
it<00:04:29.810> will<00:04:30.050> chew<00:04:30.500> that<00:04:30.740> belt<00:04:31.040> up<00:04:31.340> in<00:04:31.580> just<00:04:31.850> no

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
it will chew that belt up in just no

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.380 
it will chew that belt up in just no
time<00:04:32.380> so<00:04:33.380> what<00:04:33.680> I'd<00:04:33.800> like<00:04:34.010> to<00:04:34.070> do<00:04:34.310> is<00:04:34.580> engage<00:04:34.940> my

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
time so what I'd like to do is engage my

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.870 
time so what I'd like to do is engage my
blades<00:04:38.620> and<00:04:39.620> that<00:04:39.800> puts<00:04:40.040> tension<00:04:40.460> on<00:04:40.580> it

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
blades and that puts tension on it

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.340 
blades and that puts tension on it
everything's<00:04:42.880> tight<00:04:43.210> now<00:04:44.160> when<00:04:45.160> you<00:04:45.310> go<00:04:45.490> to
