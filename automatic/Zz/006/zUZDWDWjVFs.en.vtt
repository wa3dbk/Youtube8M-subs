getting into the carbon fiber stuff from

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.510 
getting into the carbon fiber stuff from
NRG<00:01:41.369> which<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:42.180> my<00:01:42.810> opinion<00:01:42.960> looks<00:01:43.409> very<00:01:44.220> very

NRG which in my opinion looks very very

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.270 
NRG which in my opinion looks very very
good<00:01:44.670> once<00:01:45.600> installed<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.950> there's<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> couple

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
slingshot series to match the SL so this

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.060 
slingshot series to match the SL so this
will<00:02:41.130> be<00:02:41.220> an<00:02:41.310> exact<00:02:41.700> color<00:02:42.060> match<00:02:42.920> like<00:02:43.920> our

will be an exact color match like our

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.610 
will be an exact color match like our

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
speaker rings to the SL paint so you can

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.090 
speaker rings to the SL paint so you can
keep<00:02:46.740> that<00:02:46.980> color<00:02:47.460> scheme<00:02:47.730> flowing<00:02:49.100> what's

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
keep that color scheme flowing what's

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.030 
keep that color scheme flowing what's
nice<00:02:50.340> about<00:02:50.370> running<00:02:51.230> with<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.380> assault<00:02:52.650> hub

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
nice about running with the assault hub

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.750 
nice about running with the assault hub
is<00:02:53.450> that<00:02:54.450> you're<00:02:55.410> keeping<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.890> wheel

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
is that you're keeping the wheel

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.960 
is that you're keeping the wheel
position<00:02:57.390> in<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.600> exact<00:02:58.140> same<00:02:58.970> driving

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
position in the exact same driving

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.880 
position in the exact same driving
position<00:03:00.480> as<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.750> have<00:03:00.930> with<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.230> OEM<00:03:01.530> wheel

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
position as you have with the OEM wheel

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.650 
position as you have with the OEM wheel
and<00:03:02.220> now<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.820> way<00:03:03.030> they<00:03:03.270> were<00:03:03.390> able<00:03:03.510> to

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
and now the way they were able to

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.240 
and now the way they were able to
accomplish<00:03:03.990> that<00:03:04.320> with<00:03:04.560> inserting<00:03:04.980> this

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
accomplish that with inserting this

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.650 
accomplish that with inserting this
because<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:05.670> looks<00:03:05.820> like<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.300> wheel<00:03:06.450> will<00:03:06.630> be

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
because it looks like the wheel will be

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.160 
because it looks like the wheel will be
pushed<00:03:06.960> closer<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:09.660> aftermarket

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
pushed closer is that the aftermarket

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.280 
pushed closer is that the aftermarket
wheels<00:03:10.560> are<00:03:10.860> flat<00:03:11.460> so<00:03:12.360> all<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.720> ones<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.140> we

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
wheels are flat so all the ones that we

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.310 
wheels are flat so all the ones that we
carry<00:03:13.590> are<00:03:13.740> flat<00:03:14.570> and<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.690> reason<00:03:16.050> we<00:03:16.140> did

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
carry are flat and the reason we did

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.370 
carry are flat and the reason we did
that<00:03:16.380> is<00:03:16.560> because<00:03:17.360> this<00:03:18.360> wheel<00:03:18.630> has<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.960> taper

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
that is because this wheel has a taper

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.700 
that is because this wheel has a taper
to<00:03:19.710> it<00:03:19.740> which<00:03:19.980> kicks<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.520> wheel<00:03:20.730> out<00:03:20.960> and<00:03:21.960> if

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
to it which kicks the wheel out and if

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.140 
to it which kicks the wheel out and if
you<00:03:22.800> go<00:03:22.890> with<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.100> flat<00:03:23.400> wheel<00:03:23.640> you're<00:03:23.910> able

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
you go with the flat wheel you're able

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.360 
you go with the flat wheel you're able
to<00:03:24.180> use<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.600> hub<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.080> then<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.620> flat<00:03:25.980> wheel<00:03:26.190> and

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
to use the hub and then a flat wheel and

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.090 
to use the hub and then a flat wheel and
keep<00:03:26.490> the<00:03:26.730> driving<00:03:27.270> position<00:03:27.980> exactly<00:03:28.980> the

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
keep the driving position exactly the

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.840 
keep the driving position exactly the
same<00:03:29.400> as<00:03:29.670> you<00:03:30.180> have<00:03:30.390> with<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.690> factory<00:03:31.170> wheel

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
same as you have with the factory wheel

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.420 
same as you have with the factory wheel
the<00:03:32.850> only<00:03:33.120> thing<00:03:33.330> that's<00:03:33.510> going<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.750> change

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
the only thing that's going to change

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.430 
the only thing that's going to change
the<00:03:35.430> factory<00:03:36.090> wheel<00:03:36.300> position<00:03:36.510> is<00:03:36.960> if<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.290> add

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
the factory wheel position is if you add

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.430 
the factory wheel position is if you add
