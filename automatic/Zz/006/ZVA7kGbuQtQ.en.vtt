00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.530
 Hello everyone and welcome to the channel as 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.029
 I do today we bring you a tip so that 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.029
 do not leave the aluminum foil 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:20.670
 plastic and so on by grabbing a piece already 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.530
 that as you can see it does not come with anything 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.960
 for this we are going to make some small 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.360
 cuts on the sides of the box just like 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.310
 is shown in the video we grab a 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.320
 razor or exact to make two cuts in 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.930
 triangle shape so that the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.460
 tip of this is always down 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.600
 do it very carefully so as not to 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.600
 cut or hurt 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.590
 since they made the cuts you will see 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.240
 this way we now push the cardboard 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.600
 inward to make sure 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.600
 the roll 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.580
 we flip the box and repeat the same 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.350
 process to ensure both sides and 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.720
 so there is no problem when it comes to taking 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.280
 the paper always remember to do it with 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.910
 very careful not to cut yourself or 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.910
 injure 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.940
 now we see that the roll is not 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.610
 come out and so I can use it with all 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.380
 trust as you can observe it is not 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.720
 it comes out and can pull it as hard as 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.340
 may be worth mentioning that many of 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.980
 these packages bring the marks for 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.160
 secure the roll so look and use 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.160
 the 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.060
 If you liked this video, give it a little hand
