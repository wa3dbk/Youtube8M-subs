00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hey together here is the kelvin and me 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.990
 have a little tutorial again 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.630
 or an insight for you 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.840
 in a recording I just here 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.580
 I've finished reducing and there I have 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.320
 I thought I'll make a brief stop 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.260
 video with a few 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.070
 background information like this picture 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.750
 first of all, where is it? 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.580
 It is in the night shift in 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.340
 heidelberg originated at my last 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.189
 bootcamp there we were just in this 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.680
 Locality and have different pictures 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.559
 created in the field of beauty and fashion 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.370
 and this is a final picture now 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.079
 that is already reduced and before me 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.079
 I want to bring you to light 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.890
 First of all the retouching explain what 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.350
 was made here 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.629
 it was not done too much just 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.730
 small corrections predominantly raw 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.219
 development there now catch all the time 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.739
 on the front as the pictures from the camera 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.680
 the picture comes so from the camera 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.470
 i have to say i still have here 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.990
 can illuminate a bit brighter 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.340
 however, it was very hard for one 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.049
 to report your skin correctly and to 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.850
 Enough light to the surrounding area 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.560
 So I had to get a few 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.479
 Compromise we have here with us 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.900
 permanently lit the same 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.060
 more 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.610
 and that made that easy 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.000
 the power was missing for or for 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.369
 the way of the reasons for the background 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.020
 and yes, but I was just aware 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.750
 that if i take the recording in tube 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.579
 Developers that star themselves easily 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.229
 still come to details that are now 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.610
 So here's just the raw 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.680
 development there one pulls a bit 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.110
 the deep high before you get there now 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.380
 Complex light setup builds up what often 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.820
 Eternal time costs so I thought so 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.710
 she is simply the deep regulator 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.310
 a little bit high, that's all 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.490
 this is basically the development 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.350
 then I have a little retouching 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.299
 The evil Calvin performed here 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.579
 also pushed a bit 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:04.590
 okay not that it was necessary 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:07.500
 but a little bit just deduction 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.200
 well that was already the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.610
 Retouching and her development with me 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.010
 I have come to light first 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.269
 once the upper light a bit 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.580
 I just emphasized that with one 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.319
 empty level in soft light mode here 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.870
 painted a bit yellow that is still 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.030
 shines a bit and then easy 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.920
 still a bit with German bern 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.709
 shine in the eye 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.370
 a little bit guided so I'll say so 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.690
 relatively easy that was all at the most 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.079
 five minutes now here with German 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.959
 bern then i have a cool look 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:43.079
 up table a look me once created that 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.110
 this one is a bit magenta in here 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:48.000
 the deep brings in there I could mine 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.910
 make extra tutorial on how to do it 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.190
 own color look ups are created there are 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.750
 yes already some prefabricated in here 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.129
 I have my own as I said here 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.720
 in it 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.879
 and yes, if you are always interested in how 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.670
 you can create such a color lookup then 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.799
 Let's have a video on it 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.660
 now I wanted the under the 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.670
 background must have rustic ones 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.329
 bit more graphic and there I have 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.239
 worked with topas clarity that's one 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.190
 Zusatztool a plug-in you would have here 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.870
 the recording again camera raw 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.430
 One could open with the deep one 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.250
 make bisserl what lights controller number 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.120
 So Thomas Clarity Pays 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.620
 and can do other things like now or 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.750
 which is now not quite in photoshop 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.220
 but that's what's possible 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.780
 you would have just seen here 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.970
 probably synonymous with photoshop 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.440
 can do the same if I can 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.440
 maybe even with the filter hd 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.750
 At the end of the day I'm good 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.000
 again went in camera raw and have 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.739
 there's a bit the black ones 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.739
 areas darkened that he still one 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.000
 a little more contrast comes in and 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.900
 As far as the plane is concerned, it should only be a copy 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.760
 you do not need it 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.919
 yes that was actually the complete one 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.709
 Retouching you see it is predominantly only 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.900
 raw development it is basically already 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.209
 great fornara comparison but if we 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.970
 Now from here, check it out 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.400
 the tube development is really about 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.549
 a little color adjustment and that 's it 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.590
 good for the first time the illumination 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:19.720
 camera settings you see your iris 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:21.970
 4 125 640 so I do not want to be here now 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.500
 take pictures with blender 18 but take a picture 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.360
 bit wide-angle and there I had 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.320
 only my 24 105 so dazzle 4 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.190
 and then I'm up with the iso 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:37.240
 640 that is so I have now the 5d 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.919
 mark 33 640 sees a green area here 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.410
 He again briefly the lamps 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.000
 Belgian used that are from the 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.010
 32 cinemas 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.710
 however, they were not so confessed 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.050
 as you can see in the picture here 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.610
 front lamp that is right here so yes 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.090
 the choice actually stood that way 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.500
 she is not on this bank either 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:02.050
 Here it is in principle on it 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.699
 and the back cinema fled that was 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.979
 here in the corner so in principle 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.410
 comes from the top left 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.560
 if you zoom closer you pull there 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.410
 he fled the corner of the cinema at the top 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.380
 I do not own reduced I see 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:20.520
 just there is only a small cable 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.410
 I could also reduce out so so 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.720
 That was the list from the movies flowed 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.520
 are such an art strip light assist 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.849
 Permanent light so you can see what you are 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.750
 and the kids have a lot 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:36.280
 power so you can just illuminate 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:39.190
 that these rear lamps are up there 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.080
 are were so real to the 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.560
 still everything correctly exposed 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.070
 So it is well so conditionally so close 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.470
 one ran 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.090
 and I put as I said with the aperture 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.610
 can go up a bit so 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.669
 open the aperture then it would be one more 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.250
 bit lighter but as I said 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:06:00.520
 it is relatively easy to arrive in Roda 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.680
 the bildinformation okay that was it 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.789
 a little insight like this picture 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.310
 I was liked very much 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:08.289
 I hope you like this picture too 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.580
 and if you should have to ask 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:10.490
 then write the comments if 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.370
 you wish 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.240
 please write to further films as well 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.060
 in the comments 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.060
 Thanks for watching and see you soon
