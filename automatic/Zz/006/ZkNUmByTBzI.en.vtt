00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 good 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:09.460
 [Music] 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.230
 in the youtube community in this video 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.270
 I will teach you how to hack our request 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.400
 speed to any good version 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.890
 let's start the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.630
 is to download the version that we want in 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.610
 download link will be in the 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.490
 description of this video once 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.160
 downloaded we will have an array file 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.200
 we just give it a right click 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.140
 it was that look for a folder like that 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.810
 between that folder do two other two 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.460
 more folders 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.460
 you're just taking them out 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.460
 and we simply connect our skin 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.219
 [Music] 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.810
 unesco mechanism that spears we go in the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.490
 steel folder 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.490
 then let's go to game 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.260
 and we passed those two files 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.320
 once past we can go in our 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.180
 foot feet 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.640
 good and once are our feet ping 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.680
 we always give the game box in 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.080
 stick memory those who will do these two 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.310
 files first we execute the fisher 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:23.709
 propulsion 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:23.709
 [Music] 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.330
 and once this does not appear 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.330
 we simply give it in x 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.380
 and again we are in equis 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.550
 and so it will be installed 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.130
 and now we just run the other 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:02:00.980
 archive 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:02:00.980
 [Music] 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.710
 and that 's how simple our project is 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.630
 will be satiated 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.250
