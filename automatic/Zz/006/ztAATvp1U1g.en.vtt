00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.650
 laid under explosives all over all 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.840

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.180
 springs in general we cut down the guard 1 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.500
 dress him up and immediately take your time 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.390
 dump it because here 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.410
 fits another one who is left noisy for 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.899
 his back turned out to be here at all just 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.190
 in a greyhound tray they crouch 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.020
 Podlazit at the very last moment 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.050
 enjoy instincts they are on you 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.180
 attention will turn so here visibility 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.910
 limited see for yourself yes advantage 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.120
 at least some need to use it 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.250
 so here on the edge on the wall here 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.200
 so here we go to this one 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.300
 the nightstand which is not clear what is here 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.890
 Is it worth it? 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.350
 hide tiger - we set parse 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.790
 We look and we have the devil because of this 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.640
 hoarding carry how huge 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.549
 Here waits while leaves from the guard and precisely 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.760
 also in a squat back straight literally 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.030
 this guard about lazim and these 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.349
 neatly tacking between mines 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.069
 we make our way to the room where we need to take 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.900
 key card 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.030
 you need to take the key card to pull out 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.810
 give me a mixture, in principle, you can not 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.400
 to train 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.659
 but then you won't get the maximum 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:08.069
 number of points like this boiler room 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:10.439
 something like that I do nâ€™t know 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.879
 here lies in general the key card here 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.470
 You can, if you do not want to take 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.739
 you can finish the evidence right here 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.730
 the mission there also breaks the castle and 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.299
 check here directly directly in 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.389
 extra 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:25.620
 but we all make it a little harder 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:29.129
 back in general back here 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.799
 climbs neatly in the same way 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.750
 back with these mines 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.819
 if you are from Cherkasy suddenly instinct you 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.689
 you can still use it 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.689
 see where 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.750
 In general, the radius of action will come exactly 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:48.099
 no accident neatly creeps 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.690
 men also own disappeared after him 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.060
 one amount of this guard is stacked 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.040
 pad we save just in case and wait 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.200
 while in the far corner 2 9 we actually 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.209
 pick up the evidence the guard leaves and danya 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.829
 near the opposite to us there are two one but 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.079
 constantly worth 2 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:06.140
 worth the reverse will cover here everything is hanging 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.849
 like he's gone and we quietly that 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.060
 a little bit like their instinct 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.950
 well that's what's needed 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.650
 We did not notice us with peripheral vision. 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.329
 when bald is scratching his bald head though 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.870
 you know that someone is looking at him and 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.970
 This guard here looked at us 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.240
 here you can take a hammer to give 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.680
 the snail itself is not superfluous 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.539
 it was immediately necessary for us to 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.389
 here just in case I also do on 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:34.430
 just in case distract the guards just 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.760
 2 often came up here you see he 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.389
 rises and they did not notice you because 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.020
 Mulan they 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.090
 Hammer enthusiastic times 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.349
 grab stand just in case I'm here 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.560
 also stand under the tile on the wall 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.300
 subordination would stress also had a couple of seconds 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.490
 wait a minute 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.069
 here I recommend to use you not steam 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.129
 there when you hear already characteristic 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:58.900
 hiss that you pay attention here 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:00.930
 it will be easier as well, that all the most 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:06.639
 difficult part of the mission completed 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:07.780
 neatly where did you go up 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.310
 on the stairs it itself is here 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.289
 neatly eat no waste these seeds 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:16.630
 here we need to jump over the boxes 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:17.349
 and on weight to get through in such here it 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:22.259
 will say 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:26.470
 mouse between two rows flow min 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:28.740
 ponadavili it is not a pity time was 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:32.910
 will spend 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:35.160
 you can see the coins on the way in general, so here 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.130
 we make our way to dexter here it is already there 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.389
 see victoria chord be careful 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.490
 so that he won't pay you back 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.940
 attention thorns and and drags try to 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.069
 you can crawl it all at once 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.319
 as soon as strangled him not 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.819
 keep away from melancholy pull the corpse off 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:53.819
 and would you drop it before the glasses score 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:54.300
 get see how I did it 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:57.770
 gave way 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.770
 that's all actually 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:03.610
 silent assassin rating 218 81 people 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.380
 there on my won more but I do not know 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.300
 in my opinion more people are gaining 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.890
 the fact that they fulfill the contract and 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.970
 minor ones you yourself know 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:14.890
 what contracts everyone else got 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.530
 as much as i don't know i am there 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.790
 I did not find myself in the rating in this 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.950
 because everyone has the same 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.900
 the number of points and all I think did 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.430
 in exactly the same way as me here 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.110
 Guys, she really all helped see you 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.130
 in the next part with you was a flight to all 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.130
 and new meetings and a great while
