00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.310 

let's<00:00:10.710> talk<00:00:10.860> about<00:00:10.980> spatial<00:00:11.690> isolation<00:00:12.690> now

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
let's talk about spatial isolation now

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.320 
let's talk about spatial isolation now
if<00:00:13.620> you're<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.830> dancer<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.549> may<00:00:14.730> understand

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
if you're a dancer you may understand

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.960 
if you're a dancer you may understand
isolation<00:00:16.020> as<00:00:16.199> moving<00:00:17.100> one<00:00:17.400> body<00:00:17.670> part

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
isolation as moving one body part

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.450 
isolation as moving one body part
without<00:00:18.630> moving<00:00:19.050> another<00:00:19.230> body<00:00:19.529> part<00:00:19.859> for

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
without moving another body part for

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.230 
without moving another body part for
example<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:21.449> would<00:00:21.720> move<00:00:22.170> your<00:00:22.560> torso

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
example you would move your torso

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.720 
example you would move your torso
without<00:00:24.240> moving<00:00:24.720> your<00:00:24.960> lower<00:00:25.650> body<00:00:25.920> or<00:00:26.279> your

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
without moving your lower body or your

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.029 
without moving your lower body or your
upper<00:00:26.910> body<00:00:27.300> your<00:00:27.570> arms<00:00:27.630> your<00:00:28.170> head<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.949> would

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
upper body your arms your head you would

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.240 
upper body your arms your head you would
just<00:00:29.279> move<00:00:29.460> your<00:00:29.640> torso<00:00:29.880> down<00:00:31.250> another

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
just move your torso down another

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.270 
just move your torso down another
example<00:00:32.790> would<00:00:32.910> be<00:00:33.090> just<00:00:33.390> moving<00:00:33.540> your<00:00:33.809> head

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
example would be just moving your head

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.830 
example would be just moving your head
without<00:00:35.280> moving<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.790> rest<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.120> your<00:00:36.270> body

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.110 

these<00:00:40.219> the<00:00:41.219> Flores<00:00:41.550> community<00:00:41.969> has<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
these the Flores community has a

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.000 
these the Flores community has a
different<00:00:42.540> take<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.840> isolation<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.710> think

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
different take on isolation that I think

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.670 
different take on isolation that I think
is<00:00:44.129> very<00:00:44.160> valuable<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.879> dancers<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.680> club

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
is very valuable to dancers a club

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.420 
is very valuable to dancers a club
manipulator

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
manipulator

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.490 
manipulator
would<00:00:47.640> pick<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> point<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.570> their<00:00:48.750> club<00:00:48.960> usually

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
would pick a point on their club usually

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.920 
would pick a point on their club usually
the<00:00:49.649> head<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.219> they<00:00:50.940> would<00:00:51.149> rotate<00:00:51.629> their

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the head and they would rotate their

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.520 
the head and they would rotate their
club<00:00:52.260> around<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.730> point<00:00:54.140> they<00:00:55.140> would<00:00:55.320> pick<00:00:55.469> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
club around that point they would pick a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.000 
club around that point they would pick a
point<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.100> space<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:57.120> lock<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.170> lock<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
point in space and lock the lock the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.869 
point in space and lock the lock the
head<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> club<00:00:59.699> to<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.300> point<00:01:01.760> so<00:01:02.760> they

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
head of the club to that point so they

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.000 
head of the club to that point so they
could<00:01:03.030> go<00:01:03.180> through<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.629> wallplate<00:01:04.010> go

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
could go through the wallplate go

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.429 
could go through the wallplate go
through<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.430> side<00:01:05.610> plane<00:01:06.080> go<00:01:07.080> through<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
through the side plane go through the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.730 
through the side plane go through the
floor<00:01:07.650> plane<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:09.080> the<00:01:10.080> head<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> club

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
floor plane and the head of the club

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.250 
floor plane and the head of the club
would<00:01:11.040> always<00:01:11.280> stay<00:01:11.760> locked<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> point<00:01:13.020> in

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
would always stay locked to a point in

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.010 
would always stay locked to a point in
space<00:01:13.470> now<00:01:14.430> let's<00:01:14.640> use<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:15.060> same<00:01:15.299> idea

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
space now let's use that same idea

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.640 
space now let's use that same idea
spatial<00:01:16.560> isolation<00:01:17.280> but<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.119> dance<00:01:18.650> instead

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
spatial isolation but in dance instead

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.840 
spatial isolation but in dance instead
of<00:01:19.799> running<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.400> wave<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.330> its<00:01:22.049> typical<00:01:22.439> way

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
of running a wave in its typical way

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.510 
of running a wave in its typical way
through<00:01:23.850> your<00:01:24.119> body<00:01:24.439> you<00:01:25.439> would<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:26.070> point

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
through your body you would have a point

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.149 
through your body you would have a point
that<00:01:26.909> essentially<00:01:27.540> moves<00:01:27.810> through<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.920> line

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
that essentially moves through in a line

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.550 
that essentially moves through in a line
now<00:01:29.970> we're<00:01:30.180> going<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.360> pick<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> point<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.320> space

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
now we're going to pick a point in space

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.710 
now we're going to pick a point in space
and<00:01:32.009> we're<00:01:32.400> going<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.579> move<00:01:32.729> our<00:01:32.970> body<00:01:33.270> through

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
and we're going to move our body through

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.460 
and we're going to move our body through
it<00:01:34.049> but<00:01:34.560> we're<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.890> isolate

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
it but we're going to isolate

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.740 
it but we're going to isolate
that<00:01:35.590> point<00:01:35.920> so<00:01:36.340> I'm<00:01:37.030> going<00:01:37.210> to<00:01:37.240> pick<00:01:37.420> a<00:01:37.480> point

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
that point so I'm going to pick a point

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.290 
that point so I'm going to pick a point
when<00:01:38.710> you<00:01:38.830> start<00:01:38.920> there<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:39.610> now<00:01:39.940> we're<00:01:40.150> going

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
when you start there and now we're going

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.230 
when you start there and now we're going
to<00:01:40.450> walk<00:01:40.840> through<00:01:40.900> it<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:41.860> now<00:01:42.640> we<00:01:42.700> have<00:01:43.090> this

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
to walk through it and now we have this

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.600 
to walk through it and now we have this
point<00:01:43.570> still<00:01:43.930> isolated<00:01:44.680> and<00:01:44.860> we're<00:01:45.460> gonna

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
point still isolated and we're gonna

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.600 
point still isolated and we're gonna
walk<00:01:45.910> back<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:46.870> now<00:01:47.530> this<00:01:47.740> point<00:01:48.040> is<00:01:48.250> still

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
walk back and now this point is still

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.390 
walk back and now this point is still
isolated<00:01:49.110> another<00:01:50.110> example<00:01:50.680> of<00:01:50.890> spacial

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
isolated another example of spacial

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.700 
isolated another example of spacial
isolation<00:01:51.910> and<00:01:52.060> dance<00:01:52.330> would<00:01:52.930> be<00:01:52.960> through<00:01:53.470> cut

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
isolation and dance would be through cut

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.600 
isolation and dance would be through cut
it<00:01:53.970> let's<00:01:54.970> pick<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.240> point<00:01:55.510> on<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:56.470> wrist<00:01:57.250> and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
it let's pick a point on the wrist and

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.870 
it let's pick a point on the wrist and
now<00:01:58.420> let's<00:01:58.690> cut<00:01:59.440> around<00:01:59.680> but<00:02:00.280> let's<00:02:00.460> keep<00:02:00.670> that

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
now let's cut around but let's keep that

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.750 
now let's cut around but let's keep that
spatially<00:02:01.480> isolated<00:02:02.050> so<00:02:02.560> we'll<00:02:03.190> move<00:02:03.490> our

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
spatially isolated so we'll move our

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.570 
spatially isolated so we'll move our
body<00:02:04.030> forward<00:02:04.630> but<00:02:05.320> our<00:02:05.470> wrist<00:02:06.100> is<00:02:06.340> still

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
body forward but our wrist is still

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.050 
body forward but our wrist is still
isolated<00:02:07.050> we<00:02:08.050> will<00:02:08.350> move<00:02:09.010> our<00:02:09.250> body<00:02:09.490> this<00:02:09.850> way

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
isolated we will move our body this way

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.170 
isolated we will move our body this way
wrist<00:02:10.780> is<00:02:11.020> still<00:02:11.290> isolated<00:02:11.700> we'll<00:02:12.700> go<00:02:12.880> back

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
wrist is still isolated we'll go back

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.650 
wrist is still isolated we'll go back
and<00:02:13.540> now<00:02:14.500> we'll<00:02:14.709> come<00:02:14.980> down<00:02:15.010> with<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:15.820> wrist

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
and now we'll come down with it wrist

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.150 
and now we'll come down with it wrist
still<00:02:17.620> isolated<00:02:18.400> in<00:02:18.610> that<00:02:18.820> same<00:02:19.150> point<00:02:20.160> this

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
still isolated in that same point this

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.910 
still isolated in that same point this
gives<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.640> illusion<00:02:21.910> of<00:02:22.380> spatial<00:02:23.380> isolation

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
gives the illusion of spatial isolation

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.830 
gives the illusion of spatial isolation
the<00:02:24.520> last<00:02:24.670> example<00:02:25.180> I'm<00:02:25.240> going<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.450> give<00:02:25.600> is

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
the last example I'm going to give is

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.160 
the last example I'm going to give is
with<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.440> basic<00:02:27.070> anti-spin<00:02:27.730> lever<00:02:28.170> traditional

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
with a basic anti-spin lever traditional

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.460 
with a basic anti-spin lever traditional
anti-spin<00:02:29.590> lever<00:02:29.800> would<00:02:30.370> look<00:02:30.580> like<00:02:30.730> this

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
anti-spin lever would look like this

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.620 
anti-spin lever would look like this
the<00:02:32.470> forearm<00:02:32.800> moving<00:02:33.370> in<00:02:33.550> one<00:02:34.150> direction<00:02:34.300> on

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
the forearm moving in one direction on

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.180 
the forearm moving in one direction on
the<00:02:34.750> clock<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.260> bicep<00:02:35.650> moving<00:02:35.950> in<00:02:36.010> another

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
the clock the bicep moving in another

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.060 
the clock the bicep moving in another
direction<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:37.480> wrist<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:37.990> tracing<00:02:38.920> a

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
direction and the wrist is tracing a

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.270 
direction and the wrist is tracing a
line<00:02:39.370> that's<00:02:39.760> horizontal<00:02:40.890> when<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:42.010> apply

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
line that's horizontal when you apply

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.009 
line that's horizontal when you apply
spatial<00:02:42.790> isolation<00:02:43.330> we're<00:02:43.540> going<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.750> pick<00:02:43.989> a

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
spatial isolation we're going to pick a

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.110 
spatial isolation we're going to pick a
point<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.890> we're<00:02:45.100> gonna<00:02:45.220> do<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.880> same

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
point and we're gonna do the same

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.000 
point and we're gonna do the same
anti-spin<00:02:46.720> lever<00:02:46.989> but<00:02:47.470> we're<00:02:47.680> going<00:02:47.800> to<00:02:47.860> move

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
anti-spin lever but we're going to move

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.800 
anti-spin lever but we're going to move
our<00:02:48.160> entire<00:02:48.280> body<00:02:48.910> around<00:02:49.330> with<00:02:49.480> it

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
our entire body around with it

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.670 
our entire body around with it
so<00:02:50.170> we're<00:02:50.380> gonna<00:02:50.500> act<00:02:50.890> as<00:02:51.160> if<00:02:51.340> this<00:02:51.880> fist<00:02:52.300> is

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
so we're gonna act as if this fist is

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.259 
so we're gonna act as if this fist is
unmovable<00:02:53.680> from<00:02:53.920> space<00:02:54.250> we're<00:02:54.850> going<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.090> push

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
unmovable from space we're going to push

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.820 
unmovable from space we're going to push
out<00:02:55.560> come<00:02:56.560> back<00:02:56.800> in<00:02:57.420> all<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.480> way<00:02:58.600> out<00:02:58.870> come<00:02:59.500> in

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
out come back in all the way out come in

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.670 
out come back in all the way out come in
and<00:03:00.130> we<00:03:00.910> can<00:03:01.060> keep<00:03:01.269> doing<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.720> same<00:03:01.750> motion

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
and we can keep doing the same motion

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.150 
and we can keep doing the same motion
that's<00:03:03.610> this<00:03:06.480> but<00:03:07.480> now<00:03:08.380> our<00:03:08.620> wrist<00:03:08.890> is

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
that's this but now our wrist is

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.450 
that's this but now our wrist is
spatially<00:03:09.760> isolated
