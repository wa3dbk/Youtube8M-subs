00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.690
 The lonely Kahoku field in northwestern Namibia belongs to one of the 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.179
 most untouched and inaccessible areas in southern Africa 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.640
 The Namibian capital Windhoek is the start of a motorcycle itself 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.800
 because as occurs and Herbert have planned exactly there 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.349
 careful preparation is a prerequisite of such 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.279
 undertaking 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.079
 Finally, the supply options are on the way 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.620
 extremely limited 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.710
 the bikes must be suitably equipped suitcase of petrol can 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.710
 and satellite navigation are essential 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.840
 after about 100 kilometers northwest of Windhoek is the end of asphalt from 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.640
 Now it will only give the best to the finish of the kun-the border river 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.640
 between Namibia and Angola 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.969
 Despite the hot dry desert climate, the landscape is varied 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:13.289
 Savannah Ortega towns alternate with brownish red hills and bizarre 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:14.860
 rock formations 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.560
 Meanwhile, Astrid and Herberts have their heavily laden 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.980
 Machines used 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.290
 with full payload, it is after all to the six hundredweight under control 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.500
 hold 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.210
 Shortly before Pallenberg stop for all vehicles is the so-called littering first 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.799
 The spreading of animal and plant diseases should harshly prevent diseases 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.850
 our bikers are immediately classified as harmless 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.850
 and allowed to continue their journey 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.220
 first foothills of the Coro Kurfeld Berger appear on the brownish red 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.220
 Mountain ranges are typical of this region of Namibia 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.530
 There is no sign of the prosperity Wind Works here 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.020
 the population lives under the poorest conditions of the enthusiasm of the kids 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.760
 for the alien vehicles, however, this does not break off the quirky ones 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.759
 Yang's storm is conquering our machines 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:16.559
 that does not surprise a trace of the apparent poverty 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:20.849
 Begging who is traveling more often in Africa knows something very much appreciated 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:27.569
 An important station on the trip is Okubo district capital of Kuoni in 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.669
 The region here is last resort food and gas too 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:32.559
 stash 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:34.980
 with canisters come out and Herbert 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.550
 to 42 liters of fuel and 20 liters of water per nose 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:44.620
 the ground is getting grander it's not that easy the hard 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:47.619
 keep loaded bikes under control 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.189
 Short and humorous, the two first notice 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:55.789
 the semi-nomads live until today traditionally 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:05.290
 this also looks very exotic for Europeans 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.340
 they show their hangover with a reddish paste of alumina and 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.059
 Goats fat is mixed in 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:14.729
 "This helps protect against dehydration, sunburn and mosquitoes 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:17.729
 the women are always there until 6 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:26.589
 the nightly sleeping place search is easy 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.509
 It is only important to avoid Klose Buyten because of the wildlife 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.989
 This evening unexpectedly turns to a two-legged visit 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.779
 the children came out of nowhere 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:44.779
 her timing is perfect Astrid has just made a bag soup without any shyness 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:47.779
 accept the invitation 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.239
 it is only a pity that communication is a shy one 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.239
 exchange of views limited 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:59.749
 while 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.249
 then next day Sibylle comes to a sudden end 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:09.889
 The infamous TV stars turn out to be a real nightmare 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.150

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:16.149
 Africa 

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:21.869
 Having fun with a light sport in major is with the heavy BMW 

00:04:21.869 --> 00:04:25.809
 a nerve robbing the egg dance in the back of the head knocks on top of that 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:30.159
 Awareness that in the event of a breakdown, the and never be counted on help 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:32.409
 can 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:34.060
 the pass is too steep 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.990
 that he is only passable in one direction, but even our own 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.719
 both their love distress 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:43.050
 5 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.330
 the merciless shocks are not without consequences Astrid has the 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.789
 Fastening the foot brake lost 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.580
 but the two are seasoned motto cyclists they had loads of 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.580
 Replacement materials for repairs 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.300
 the view on Tapet highest Marin river valley compensates for the 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.400
 strain 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.330
 Although there are still some difficult passages to overcome 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.330
 But that does not scare the two now 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.939
 the tormenting ideas Franz's pass down has the water consumption 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:25.360
 Astrid and Herbert are happy to finally reach a well 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.360
 to replenish their supplies 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:36.000
 Not every fountain in these widths for inevitably water yet many 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:39.800
 The life-giving March bubbles out after only a few points 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.479
 the cock 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.949
 the last kilometers of the journey are marked by one at the same time 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.949
 hostile and extremely fascinating desert landscape 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:56.439
 von Wind moved to the culmination point set and Herbert to 3400 kilometers 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.719
 traveled 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:03.800
 The hardships of the journey quickly fall into oblivion by the luxury of 

00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:07.229
 Civilization on the Zeller cafe man german 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:10.229
