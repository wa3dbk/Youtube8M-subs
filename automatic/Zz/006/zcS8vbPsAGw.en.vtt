00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.170 
yep I think that's it so oh no sticky
piston<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.909> most<00:02:03.180> important<00:02:03.659> thing

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.630 

probably<00:02:09.180> plat<00:02:09.450> past<00:02:09.990> them<00:02:10.290> there<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.890> go<00:02:11.040> all

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
probably plat past them there you go all

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.630 
probably plat past them there you go all
right<00:02:11.820> so<00:02:12.210> it<00:02:13.110> can<00:02:13.320> be<00:02:13.470> however<00:02:13.770> long<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.460> want

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
going to do is get your redstone

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.630 
going to do is get your redstone
repeaters<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.870> place<00:03:13.870> them<00:03:14.140> facing<00:03:15.010> the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
repeaters and place them facing the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.800 
repeaters and place them facing the
sticky<00:03:16.000> piston<00:03:17.099> and<00:03:18.099> I<00:03:18.609> want<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.480> note<00:03:19.689> that

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
sticky piston and I want to note that

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.860 
sticky piston and I want to note that
you<00:03:20.560> can<00:03:20.799> you<00:03:21.489> have<00:03:21.609> to<00:03:21.760> put<00:03:21.939> redstone<00:03:22.209> behind

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
you can you have to put redstone behind

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.369 
you can you have to put redstone behind
each<00:03:23.079> one<00:03:23.379> so<00:03:23.799> it<00:03:24.459> will<00:03:24.639> like<00:03:24.879> you<00:03:25.420> know<00:03:25.540> track

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
each one so it will like you know track

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.670 
each one so it will like you know track
each<00:03:26.590> one<00:03:26.889> and<00:03:27.959> if<00:03:28.959> you<00:03:29.109> want<00:03:29.260> to<00:03:29.319> make<00:03:29.439> a<00:03:29.470> house

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
each one and if you want to make a house

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.619 
each one and if you want to make a house
like<00:03:29.950> that<00:03:29.980> which<00:03:30.459> I<00:03:30.579> strongly<00:03:30.879> suggest<00:03:31.180> doing

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
like that which I strongly suggest doing

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.920 
like that which I strongly suggest doing
because<00:03:32.019> it<00:03:32.590> makes<00:03:32.769> it<00:03:32.889> look<00:03:32.980> good<00:03:33.930> you're

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
because it makes it look good you're

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.080 
because it makes it look good you're
going<00:03:35.049> to<00:03:35.109> want<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.319> dig<00:03:36.239> like<00:03:37.239> that<00:03:37.540> and<00:03:39.090> place

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
going to want to dig like that and place

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.319 
going to want to dig like that and place
a<00:03:40.120> redstone<00:03:40.329> along<00:03:41.250> along<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.400> line<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:44.290> then

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
a redstone along along the line and then

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.970 
a redstone along along the line and then
make<00:03:46.329> like<00:03:46.510> a<00:03:46.540> little<00:03:46.629> staircase<00:03:47.109> for<00:03:47.620> stuff

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
make like a little staircase for stuff

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:55.319 
make like a little staircase for stuff
and<00:03:50.819> then<00:03:51.819> you<00:03:52.030> can<00:03:53.519> place<00:03:54.519> place<00:03:55.030> a<00:03:55.060> little

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
and then you can place place a little

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.990 
and then you can place place a little
step<00:03:55.629> so<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:55.989> button<00:03:56.229> will<00:03:56.379> be<00:03:56.699> two<00:03:57.699> blocks

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
step so the button will be two blocks

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.599 
step so the button will be two blocks
high<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:58.900> what<00:03:59.109> you're<00:03:59.229> going<00:03:59.440> to<00:03:59.530> do<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.979> you

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
high and what you're going to do is you

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.899 
high and what you're going to do is you
can<00:04:00.790> refill<00:04:02.159> everything<00:04:03.159> except<00:04:03.609> for<00:04:03.760> those

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909 
can refill everything except for those

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.240 
can refill everything except for those
two<00:04:04.180> blocks<00:04:04.449> because<00:04:05.379> if<00:04:05.650> you<00:04:05.709> place<00:04:05.949> a<00:04:05.979> block

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
two blocks because if you place a block

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.920 
two blocks because if you place a block
here<00:04:06.310> that<00:04:06.940> will<00:04:07.060> get<00:04:07.180> rid<00:04:07.209> of<00:04:07.389> the<00:04:07.540> sticky

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
here that will get rid of the sticky

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.379 
here that will get rid of the sticky
piston<00:04:08.379> connection<00:04:08.949> to<00:04:09.069> their<00:04:09.280> or<00:04:09.819> the

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
piston connection to their or the

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.860 
piston connection to their or the
redstone<00:04:11.229> wiring<00:04:12.090> so<00:04:13.090> you<00:04:13.150> just<00:04:13.419> want<00:04:13.599> to<00:04:13.690> fill

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
redstone wiring so you just want to fill

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:22.810 
redstone wiring so you just want to fill
up<00:04:14.079> each<00:04:14.260> little<00:04:14.709> block<00:04:16.799> so<00:04:17.799> it<00:04:17.949> looks<00:04:18.010> nice

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
the video i wanted to see why I wasn't

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.190 
the video i wanted to see why I wasn't
working<00:06:02.490> now<00:06:02.850> stupid<00:06:03.210> idea<00:06:03.450> the<00:06:03.930> reason

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
working now stupid idea the reason

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.600 
working now stupid idea the reason
wasn't<00:06:04.350> working<00:06:04.800> it's<00:06:04.950> because<00:06:05.100> I<00:06:05.190> placed<00:06:05.460> a

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
wasn't working it's because I placed a

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.090 
wasn't working it's because I placed a
block<00:06:05.820> above<00:06:06.150> that<00:06:06.360> so<00:06:06.890> disconnected<00:06:07.890> the

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
block above that so disconnected the

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.850 
block above that so disconnected the
wiring<00:06:08.490> from<00:06:08.640> right<00:06:08.820> there<00:06:09.000> so<00:06:09.420> yeah<00:06:10.380> stupid

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
wiring from right there so yeah stupid

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
wiring from right there so yeah stupid
so<00:06:11.640> uh<00:06:11.840> yeah<00:06:12.840> place<00:06:13.530> the<00:06:13.680> button<00:06:14.010> like<00:06:14.700> i<00:06:14.850> was

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
so uh yeah place the button like i was

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.530 
so uh yeah place the button like i was
doing<00:06:16.430> wherever<00:06:17.430> it<00:06:17.610> has<00:06:17.760> to<00:06:17.910> be<00:06:18.000> on<00:06:18.150> the<00:06:18.300> wall

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
doing wherever it has to be on the wall
