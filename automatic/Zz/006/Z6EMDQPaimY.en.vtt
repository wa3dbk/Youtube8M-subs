00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.479
 bilal basacikoglu comes out fairly quickly 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.849
 how to change the dressing room at home bill 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.999
 oh yes it is 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.139
 yes we were a bit disappointed 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:14.190
 still get that goal while 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.190
 was a team 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.119
 very good and we had almost none 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.890
 possession 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.260
 where i donated that a barnet that he 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.390
 then falls so late in the game 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.680
 because of a lot besides the standard situation 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.270
 people is real and gets out of play 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.770
 see or hear at the end of the scrub 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.050
 yes i have probably heard that 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.640
 was at the game but it does and on 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.469
 this moment we no longer allow it 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.749
 just one or floor and 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.280
 have that right into it that 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:39.899
 seems to me because the European rules 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.699
 apply that which is no best 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.550
 starting position 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.749
 but that does n't matter what 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.699
 we come into the cockpit two inside 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:48.569
 but then off then walk ahead 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.489
 our team 

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:53.429
 yes the other side is that you are tonight too 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.710
 little off and yet with each other question mark 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.210
 well i found happiness with the other 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.609
 match that we as a team now well 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.309
 and we worked bart for car and 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.110
 this clean beginning and openly and because they 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.280
 just expand with goals 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.649
 yes but you get that rotten tonight 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.759
 few chances anyway yes but that is possible in the 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:10.619
 cockpit becomes different 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.880
 how was it for you in recent days 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.149
 You got burn because you got that ring 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.619
 excuse part in the basic yes this morning and 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:20.759
 yes it is of course ready for a long time 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.259
 also back in the basics so that must be 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.829
 have been a nice announcement or 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.439
 not 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:28.530
 yes of course you want as a player of course 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.350
 always start and today it was 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.020
 honest software if you are tense 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.850
 no no no i do n't have them but the neighborhood 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.750
 or so so I know what it feels like to be 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.130
 So you can play that trainer change 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.299
 thus new opportunities for you the one 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.740
 his death is another and you would eat bread 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.560
 say yes when about you 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.670
 Sure I'm just too had it not 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.439
 I'm used to the match selection 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.179
 always keep training in myself 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.100
 keep investing 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.840
 yes can say this at the moment 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.850
 paid 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.409
 how difficult what the past few weeks 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.659
 and months for you 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.130
 yes of course setback is never fun 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.439
 of if you as a footballer that we 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.070
 of course, every competition always comes along 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.859
 to do 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.300
 or at least invade and that was with me 

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:11.099
 not always the case 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.210
 only always just stayed in 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.950
 believe myself 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.210
 that I will always be there at the 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.280
 have had interviews it is 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.270
 half have to believe and then you see that 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.770
 just get in now 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.570
 you go off with a stretcher because of it 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.250
 cramp you saw through for a while 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.500
 the game yes occasionally for the me it 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.000
 if it had been zoological it might be then 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.640
 three months ago like that again 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.900
 once in a while handy we simulated 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.760
 to pick up or not 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.350

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.030
 now and then but 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.370
 but just let by footballer remains 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.050
 me team not abandon it as the 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.640
 currency for Sunday 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.640
 that I was the motto for without 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.020
 you must do without chasing them 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.460
 thinks the most important thing 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.580
