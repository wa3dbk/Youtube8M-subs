now<00:00:00.149> we're<00:00:00.269> checking<00:00:00.390> out<00:00:00.599> the<00:00:00.719> Netflix<00:00:01.199> app

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:01.380 
now we're checking out the Netflix app

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.649 
now we're checking out the Netflix app
on<00:00:01.650> the<00:00:01.860> Xbox<00:00:02.460> one<00:00:02.580> versus<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.149> PlayStation<00:00:03.629> 4

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
on the Xbox one versus the PlayStation 4

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.070 
on the Xbox one versus the PlayStation 4
and<00:00:04.190> honestly<00:00:05.190> I<00:00:05.540> don't<00:00:06.540> have<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.870> preference

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
and honestly I don't have a preference

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.169 
and honestly I don't have a preference
they're<00:00:07.620> both<00:00:07.799> very<00:00:08.099> good<00:00:08.250> they<00:00:08.760> just<00:00:09.030> have

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
they're both very good they just have

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.120 
they're both very good they just have
slightly<00:00:09.510> different<00:00:09.929> layouts<00:00:10.740> we're<00:00:10.920> looking

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
slightly different layouts we're looking

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.379 
slightly different layouts we're looking
at<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.309> Xbox<00:00:11.519> one<00:00:11.910> right<00:00:12.059> now

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
at the Xbox one right now

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.589 
at the Xbox one right now
the<00:00:12.960> only<00:00:13.290> advantage<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:15.030> Xbox<00:00:15.389> one<00:00:15.570> has

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
the only advantage that the Xbox one has

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.950 
the only advantage that the Xbox one has
is<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.350> Xbox<00:00:16.710> one<00:00:16.890> can<00:00:17.070> actually<00:00:17.250> snap

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
is that the Xbox one can actually snap

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.650 
is that the Xbox one can actually snap
to<00:00:18.980> the<00:00:19.980> side<00:00:20.220> screen<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.820> play<00:00:21.150> while<00:00:21.480> you're

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
to the side screen and play while you're

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.900 
to the side screen and play while you're
playing<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.869> game<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.590> let's<00:00:23.070> say<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.369> wanted

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
playing a game so let's say you wanted

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.790 
playing a game so let's say you wanted
to<00:00:25.189> listen<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.430> some<00:00:27.269> good<00:00:27.869> standup<00:00:28.560> while

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
to listen to some good standup while

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.769 
to listen to some good standup while
you're<00:00:29.310> playing<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.670> game<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:30.449> could<00:00:30.599> actually

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
you're playing a game you could actually

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.680 
you're playing a game you could actually
do<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.279> so<00:00:32.279> right<00:00:32.460> now<00:00:32.640> I'm<00:00:32.880> playing<00:00:33.420> Dead

Rising 3 and listening to Jim Gaffigan

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.850 
Rising 3 and listening to Jim Gaffigan
simultaneously<00:00:36.809> oh<00:00:37.700> ok<00:00:39.320> let's<00:00:40.320> check<00:00:40.440> out<00:00:40.590> the

simultaneously oh ok let's check out the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.150 
simultaneously oh ok let's check out the
police<00:00:41.160> station<00:00:41.520> for<00:00:41.760> Netflix<00:00:42.719> app<00:00:43.010> now<00:00:44.010> we're

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
police station for Netflix app now we're

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.369 
police station for Netflix app now we're
on<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.370> PlayStation<00:00:44.879> 4<00:00:44.910> Netflix<00:00:45.660> app<00:00:45.840> as<00:00:46.289> you

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
on the PlayStation 4 Netflix app as you

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.229 
on the PlayStation 4 Netflix app as you
can<00:00:46.559> see<00:00:46.710> slightly<00:00:47.190> different<00:00:47.579> user

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
can see slightly different user

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.959 
can see slightly different user
interface<00:00:48.690> but<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.320> don't<00:00:49.920> think<00:00:50.340> one

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
interface but I don't think one

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.400 
interface but I don't think one
interface<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.539> better<00:00:51.719> than<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.989> other<00:00:52.140> I

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
interface is better than the other I

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.299 
interface is better than the other I
think<00:00:53.219> they're<00:00:53.460> both<00:00:53.550> good<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:55.020> only<00:00:55.309> one

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
think they're both good the only one

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.500 
think they're both good the only one
other<00:00:56.460> difference<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.059> PlayStation

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
other difference is that the PlayStation

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.950 
other difference is that the PlayStation
4<00:00:57.539> has<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.199> play<00:00:58.620> max<00:00:59.010> thing<00:00:59.629> built<00:01:00.629> into<00:01:00.840> it

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
4 has this play max thing built into it

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.240 
4 has this play max thing built into it
which<00:01:00.989> has<00:01:01.260> never<00:01:01.440> actually<00:01:01.680> worked<00:01:01.949> for<00:01:02.129> me

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
which has never actually worked for me

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.700 
which has never actually worked for me
it<00:01:02.550> locks<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.149> every<00:01:03.449> time<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.780> use<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.140> so

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
it locks up every time that I use it so

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.620 
it locks up every time that I use it so
that's<00:01:05.280> not<00:01:05.489> really<00:01:05.640> an<00:01:05.820> advantage<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.420> in

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
that's not really an advantage but in

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.850 
that's not really an advantage but in
theory<00:01:06.900> if<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.380> worked

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
theory if it worked

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.380 
theory if it worked
it<00:01:08.220> could<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:08.790> better<00:01:08.909> but<00:01:09.210> yeah<00:01:10.049> they<00:01:10.350> both

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
it could be better but yeah they both

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.390 
it could be better but yeah they both
both<00:01:12.390> move<00:01:12.689> really<00:01:12.930> quick<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> verdict<00:01:14.280> is

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
both move really quick so the verdict is

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.060 
both move really quick so the verdict is
Netflix<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.450> awesome<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.530> Xbox<00:01:16.890> one<00:01:17.040> and
