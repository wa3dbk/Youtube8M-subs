us<00:02:28.020> into<00:02:28.200> heaven<00:02:28.470> or<00:02:28.980> wherever<00:02:29.100> because<00:02:29.940> we've

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
us into heaven or wherever because we've

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.360 
us into heaven or wherever because we've
earned<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.390> they<00:02:31.290> also<00:02:31.500> like<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.890> idea<00:02:32.070> that

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
earned it they also like the idea that

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.190 
earned it they also like the idea that
they<00:02:32.610> can<00:02:32.760> continue<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.570> sins<00:02:33.810> they<00:02:33.990> love
