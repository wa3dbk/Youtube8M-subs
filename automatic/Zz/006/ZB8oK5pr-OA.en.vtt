 You can be a big man and make a little one 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.039
 whatever big on the ipad is a 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.650
 bit of island pity that it is 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.390
 no special ipad version is available though 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.179
 you can live quite well the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.980
 screen and we look 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.200

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.220
 above 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:30.260
 otherwise the alphabetical order is 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:32.070
 the whole thing so unified there 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.570

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.489
 I try to sell myself then 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.670

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.670
 Player cure is okay too 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.889
 dribble cards 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.720
 That's a story in itself 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.579
 Let's go do not go though 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.609
 in the end, they just block 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.169
 such a place in the list 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:10.220
 You should watch that you do not 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:11.689

 Unfortunately, the coat of arms prices are quite nice 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:19.940
 gone down the vita coco like 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.199

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.300

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.490
 okay, what have we not assigned yet? 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:52.070
 there are the players you are blind in the times 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:56.150
 bought immediate purchase and forgetfulness 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:05:00.620
 keep track of some things 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.960
 bought here the jersey 650 the thing 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.800
 goes over 1000 away I just had to 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.009
 to strike 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.619
 then i also have a jersey 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:11.229
 450 bought will buy immediately 

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:13.150

 1000 was what we still have Brunswick 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:28.029
 not to be underestimated 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:30.009
 the jerseys can be partly cheap 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:33.430
 you can see you do the thing for 200 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:37.059
 won but you can quite 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:42.249
 sell high so is 800 to 1000 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:43.569
 not infrequently but that should not be here 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:45.430
