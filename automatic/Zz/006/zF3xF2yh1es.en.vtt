00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.540
 a personal video and does not sell from today 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.639
 we are here again with gta5 on 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.190
 It's really more to chat with 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.869
 you ignore nobody, minari, is not that right? 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.800
 does causing disorders and even so 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.539
 with online 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.910
 I think it puts you in the whole apartment. 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.350
 world changing clothes character 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.300
 almost a month I buy a clothes 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.760
 Here the cowboys use fucking cars. 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.450
 let's personally change invite you 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.210
 and answer why I'm recording 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.670
 just gta and no other games during 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.129
 this Easter and also because he had a 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.550
 videos fall until October when - 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.050
 videos now at personal Easter this 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.930
 Easter I had a little bit to 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.850
 rest is then when I recorded 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.840
 Resting hotel is not difficult either. 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.120
 record gta 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.539
 however it's a bit easier a bit 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.449
 more it is a little less complex to record the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.010
 than recording any of the other 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.439
 games I record here on the channel 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.350
 it is usually simply this reason 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.200
 I'm really tired, really tired. 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.860
 a lot going on at Easter was a 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.810
 and out of the ordinary and it is cable that 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.970
 so I cut a little bit and the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.979
 videos I spoke, I'm very tired 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.439
 Even save a break was to breathe 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.820
 an air of a lot of travel thing 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.830
 to fix for those who do not know this 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.009
 event not from the same time the new 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.570
 and faces less than two months 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.540
 This is already a lot to 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.890
 I'm out there, it's easter and 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.079
 old man is advancing but he is passing 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.490
 long time talked to our family and 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.650
 I know that many of you are 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.840
 traveling and such I was not going to leave the channel 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.119
 yes content obviously because I know 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.950
 that many of you were not traveling 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.960
 as I do then accompanying more 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.570
 again I'm practically not 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.729
 Playing video games I do not want, it's logical. 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.829
 leave you content and uninformed 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.780
 so I keep searching the content 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.180
 for a long time but I'm 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.710
 running away from the internet that 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.009
 follow up on twitter knows that ituano 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.659
 have two periods per day at most and 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.300
 who accompanies the instagram Saturday 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:13.710
 playing a lot of board games anyway I 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.260
 I'm giving you a rest even at Easter. 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.700
 everything returns to normal because in the 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.620
 Tuesday, the final part on Monday 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.440
 Because the second is still a holiday, then. 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.270
 So the guy is swear, would he run to 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.490
 fucking while the weekday I 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.170
 I can only dedicate to channel 11 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.640
 when it is a holiday when the end of 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.460
 week has some other obligations 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.340
 family in the galera here is a lot of us 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.260
 we have and I'm going to use some eu 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.270
 I will assemble such a kit and basicÃ£o 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.920
 assemble and beauty and check out people 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.190
 ride up is on 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.770
 take the hat there then the staff is 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.420
 briefly and that's all folks 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.940
 also on the run lately there 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.040
 especially on holiday in but 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.080
 channel did not die, not everyone was able to 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.780
 bring a content is a little less than 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.000
 obvious if exactly what this is going to 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.340
 end up causing the channel to fall 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.300
 yarn and a drop of interest from you 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.830
 but it's nothing that will affect I think 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.990
 that for a long time on Tuesday 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.060
 I believe that everything is already normalized 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.340
 but if you want to know how you are in the 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.050
 holiday will also be straight after a 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.720
 strong on twitter yesterday as 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.950
 some hours of the day I stop for tuitar 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.950
 I also wanted to wish you a happy 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.500
 Easter to you all is enough 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.360
 eggs to enjoy again with you today 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.010
 today is easter sunday however 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.860
 believes again that the staff of 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.690
 family lunch and go together do not know if 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.780
 I'm going to dinner with my family, I do not know. 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.940
 how does the terrible work with these 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.770
 But anyway , that's how we're going. 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.240
 to finish this day just wanted to explain 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.280
 for you because you had this 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.710
 video production but on Tuesday 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.860
 it's all normalized games that you guys 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:52.830
 both love will be there and really gta 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.990
 It was fortunately a little 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.570
 The easiness I have in recording today is 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:01.170
 very easy for me is to make the content 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.830
 is to publish and identify the content of 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.430
 Czech 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.930
 nothing that will not be normalized from here 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.270
 very little time the young woman's baby is 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.400
 This meant the support of all of you. 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.710
 viewing if you liked not 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.780
 sure to further evaluate in your youth is 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.060
 your favorite and have comments 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.010
 Of you, yes I 'm stopping big. 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.060
 part of the time more to read comments 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.270
 on twitter a few days until 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.010
 answer the comments and finally I ask 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.810
 apologies for production errors 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.880
 some crises 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.220
 but you really need to give 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.889
 rested and Tuesday will be everything 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.870
 normal again at least five videos 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.400
 at least 20 years because I believe 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.020
 that will be much more 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.780
 there are some nice news 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.780
 between the channel in general in the next two 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.070
 three weeks so stay calm 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.780
 personal beauty wanted to thank the support 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.940

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.639
 Easter messages and everything you've already 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.380
 They sent you, you fucking bastard. 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.210
 Enjoy the holiday a hug from 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.440

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.440
