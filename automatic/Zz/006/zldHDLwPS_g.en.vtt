brick for charmer by the way these guys

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.980 
brick for charmer by the way these guys
the<00:01:54.069> the<00:01:54.490> one<00:01:54.609> right<00:01:54.789> here<00:01:55.060> is<00:01:55.090> kind<00:01:55.869> of

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
the the one right here is kind of

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.139 
the the one right here is kind of
staring<00:01:56.560> in<00:01:56.859> shock<00:01:56.920> I'm<00:01:57.579> not<00:01:57.789> entirely<00:01:57.999> sure

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
staring in shock I'm not entirely sure

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.679 
staring in shock I'm not entirely sure
why<00:01:58.420> he<00:01:58.689> put<00:01:59.560> his<00:01:59.709> assault<00:02:00.189> rifle<00:02:00.429> on<00:02:00.520> his<00:02:00.549> back

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
why he put his assault rifle on his back

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.429 
why he put his assault rifle on his back
I<00:02:01.689> guess<00:02:02.619> he<00:02:02.770> was<00:02:02.889> just<00:02:02.920> sort<00:02:03.189> of<00:02:04.109> wanted<00:02:05.109> to

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
I guess he was just sort of wanted to

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:06.929 
I guess he was just sort of wanted to
not<00:02:05.649> have<00:02:05.799> a<00:02:05.829> gun<00:02:06.009> in<00:02:06.069> his<00:02:06.340> hands<00:02:06.579> when<00:02:06.700> he<00:02:06.729> died

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
not have a gun in his hands when he died

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.059 
not have a gun in his hands when he died
or<00:02:07.149> something<00:02:07.299> I<00:02:07.569> don't<00:02:07.630> know<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.050> then<00:02:08.860> the

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
or something I don't know and then the

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.529 
or something I don't know and then the
other<00:02:09.099> one<00:02:09.280> who<00:02:09.729> was<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:09.940> one<00:02:10.270> that<00:02:10.450> was

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
other one who was the one that was

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.300 
other one who was the one that was
running<00:02:11.080> backwards<00:02:11.560> in<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.709> previous<00:02:11.890> scene

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
running backwards in a previous scene

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.210 
running backwards in a previous scene
sort<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.760> tripped<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.330> he's<00:02:14.140> on<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.980> floor

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
sort of tripped and he's on the floor

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.580 
sort of tripped and he's on the floor
with<00:02:15.640> his<00:02:15.820> magnum<00:02:16.270> by<00:02:16.600> his<00:02:16.750> side<00:02:17.020> they're<00:02:17.470> both

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
with his magnum by his side they're both

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.360 
with his magnum by his side they're both
sort<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.010> I<00:02:18.100> guess

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
sort of I guess

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.990 
sort of I guess
in<00:02:18.670> shock<00:02:18.849> at<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.060> Spartan<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:20.849> even<00:02:21.849> though

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
in shock at the Spartan and even though

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.380 
in shock at the Spartan and even though
the<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:23.799> elites<00:02:24.159> proportions<00:02:24.670> aren't<00:02:24.879> that

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
the the elites proportions aren't that

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.690 
the the elites proportions aren't that
accurate<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.080> doing<00:02:26.590> game<00:02:26.769> I<00:02:27.069> think<00:02:27.670> that

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
accurate to the doing game I think that

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.000 
accurate to the doing game I think that
it's<00:02:27.909> still<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.450> decent<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.739> it<00:02:29.830> definitely

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
it's still a decent and it definitely

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.910 
it's still a decent and it definitely
helps<00:02:30.430> convey<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.819> sense<00:02:31.030> that<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:32.200> all

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
helps convey the sense that the all

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.680 
helps convey the sense that the all
pretty<00:02:33.250> much<00:02:33.280> all<00:02:33.489> humans<00:02:33.879> are<00:02:34.000> much<00:02:34.390> smaller

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
pretty much all humans are much smaller

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.069 
pretty much all humans are much smaller
than<00:02:34.870> both<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.790> San<00:02:36.790> Keeley<00:02:37.150> or<00:02:37.390> elites<00:02:37.870> and

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
than both the San Keeley or elites and

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.720 
than both the San Keeley or elites and
the<00:02:38.200> Jill<00:02:38.650> re<00:02:38.860> i<00:02:39.159> believe<00:02:39.430> I'm<00:02:39.549> pronouncing

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
the Jill re i believe I'm pronouncing

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.270 
the Jill re i believe I'm pronouncing
that<00:02:39.879> right<00:02:40.120> which<00:02:40.390> are<00:02:40.510> brutes<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:42.040> just

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
that right which are brutes and I just

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.649 
that right which are brutes and I just
think<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.519> gives<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.879> much<00:02:43.150> more<00:02:43.329> of<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.480> sense

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
think it gives it a much more of a sense

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.180 
think it gives it a much more of a sense
of<00:02:43.810> sort<00:02:44.049> of<00:02:45.209> heroic<00:02:46.209> miss<00:02:46.540> or<00:02:46.720> here<00:02:47.409> heroism

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
of sort of heroic miss or here heroism

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.780 
of sort of heroic miss or here heroism
heroism<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.329> just<00:02:50.319> it<00:02:50.620> makes<00:02:51.190> this<00:02:51.430> these

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
heroism and just it makes this these

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.819 
heroism and just it makes this these
Spartans<00:02:52.120> seem<00:02:52.599> a<00:02:52.690> lot<00:02:52.810> more<00:02:52.840> courageous<00:02:53.379> so

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
Spartans seem a lot more courageous so

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.270 
Spartans seem a lot more courageous so
yeah<00:02:54.790> basically<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.720> guy<00:02:55.900> sort<00:02:56.530> of<00:02:56.650> like<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.129> said

more of these they're fairly simple to

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.569 
more of these they're fairly simple to
me<00:03:01.750> for<00:03:02.019> me<00:03:02.109> to<00:03:02.170> make<00:03:02.349> I<00:03:02.620> don't<00:03:03.159> normally<00:03:03.250> keep

me for me to make I don't normally keep
these<00:03:03.790> mock<00:03:04.090> scenes<00:03:04.420> up<00:03:04.720> very<00:03:05.109> long<00:03:05.319> however

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
these mock scenes up very long however

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.050 
these mock scenes up very long however
probably<00:03:06.940> when<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:08.340> have<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.489> inspiration<00:03:09.940> to

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
probably when I have the inspiration to

probably when I have the inspiration to
I'll<00:03:10.239> probably<00:03:10.420> try<00:03:10.659> to<00:03:10.720> make<00:03:11.230> some

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
I'll probably try to make some

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.140 
I'll probably try to make some
continuations<00:03:12.099> these<00:03:12.519> tips<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:12.849> seeds<00:03:13.000> in<00:03:13.090> the

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
continuations these tips of seeds in the
