sweet sexy little babies out of these

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.500 
sweet sexy little babies out of these
guys<00:01:48.480> here<00:01:48.870> I<00:01:49.340> mean<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.910> should<00:01:51.150> be<00:01:51.180> pretty

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
guys here I mean it should be pretty

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.010 
guys here I mean it should be pretty
cool<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:52.050> read<00:01:52.920> about<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.550> a<00:01:54.330> couple<00:01:54.720> days

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
cool I read about it and a couple days

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.010 
cool I read about it and a couple days
from<00:01:55.470> now<00:01:55.650> they'll<00:01:56.040> drop<00:01:56.400> off<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.210> rock<00:01:57.750> and

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
from now they'll drop off that rock and

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.050 
from now they'll drop off that rock and
they'll<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.350> down<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.800> gravel<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.370> then<00:02:00.000> I

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
they'll be down in the gravel and then I

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.940 
they'll be down in the gravel and then I
think<00:02:00.300> it<00:02:00.450> takes<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.750> couple<00:02:01.080> more<00:02:01.290> days<00:02:01.560> for

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
think it takes a couple more days for

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.850 
think it takes a couple more days for
them<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.250> actually<00:02:02.430> become<00:02:03.000> fish<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.619> takes

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
them to actually become fish so it takes

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.219 
them to actually become fish so it takes
a<00:02:05.010> little<00:02:05.160> bit<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:05.790> it's<00:02:06.450> gonna<00:02:06.630> be<00:02:06.720> worth<00:02:07.050> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
a little bit but it's gonna be worth the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.230 
a little bit but it's gonna be worth the
wait<00:02:07.260> I'm<00:02:07.619> gonna<00:02:07.740> keep<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.100> guys<00:02:08.250> updated<00:02:08.580> on
