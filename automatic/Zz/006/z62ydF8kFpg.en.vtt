00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
mommy and a baby here and I used this

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.270 
mommy and a baby here and I used this
really<00:00:39.839> beautiful<00:00:40.019> paper<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.800> got<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.190> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
really beautiful paper that I got and I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.669 
really beautiful paper that I got and I
did<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> review<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.089> before<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:42.899> 19

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:43.679 
did a review on this before but it's 19

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:46.090 
did a review on this before but it's 19
x<00:00:43.800> 19<00:00:44.219> centimeters<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.179> so<00:00:45.449> then<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:45.780> is

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
x 19 centimeters and so then this is

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.130 
x 19 centimeters and so then this is
one-fourth<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.550> size<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.239> then<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.899> thought

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
one-fourth that size and then I thought

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.009 
one-fourth that size and then I thought
it'd<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.559> cool<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.070> take<00:00:50.609> some<00:00:50.999> of<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.179> um

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.959 

transparent<00:00:55.019> origami<00:00:55.559> paper<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.159> I<00:00:56.190> showed

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
transparent origami paper that I showed

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.450 
transparent origami paper that I showed
you<00:00:56.999> guys<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.300> review<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.109> layer<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.370> top

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
you guys a review of and layer it on top

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.070 
you guys a review of and layer it on top
of<00:00:59.819> it<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.390> create<00:01:00.749> kind<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.589> water<00:01:02.370> and

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
of it to create kind of like water and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.930 
of it to create kind of like water and
just<00:01:04.080> tack<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.409> not<00:01:04.860> glue<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.339> lot<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.700> tuck

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
just tack it not glue it a lot just tuck

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.420 
just tack it not glue it a lot just tuck
it<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.330> couple<00:01:06.630> places<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.130> first<00:01:08.340> thing

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
it in a couple places so the first thing

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
I thought I'd do is just start off with

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.730 
I thought I'd do is just start off with
putting<00:01:11.190> the<00:01:11.610> glue<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.899> turtle<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.560> keep

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
putting the glue of the turtle to keep

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.090 
putting the glue of the turtle to keep

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
little bit but the baby kind of behind

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.109 
little bit but the baby kind of behind
there<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.770> then<00:02:01.770> i<00:02:01.859> just<00:02:01.890> randomly<00:02:02.369> cut<00:02:02.909> this

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
there and then i just randomly cut this

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.239 
there and then i just randomly cut this
you<00:02:03.390> could<00:02:03.600> just<00:02:03.749> leave<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.439> way<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.799> to

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:05.249 
you could just leave it the way it is to

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:08.359 
you could just leave it the way it is to
sort<00:02:05.670> up<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.179> but<00:02:06.509> i<00:02:07.439> was<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.100> i<00:02:08.190> said<00:02:08.340> i

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
sort up to you but i was like i said i

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.010 
sort up to you but i was like i said i
was<00:02:08.520> just<00:02:08.640> going<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.789> put<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> tiny<00:02:09.360> bit<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.780> glue

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
was just going to put a tiny bit of glue

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.740 
was just going to put a tiny bit of glue
on<00:02:10.259> each<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:11.100> these<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.760> hopefully<00:02:12.600> it'll

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
on each of these and hopefully it'll

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.030 
on each of these and hopefully it'll
stick<00:02:13.080> let's<00:02:13.290> see<00:02:13.410> what<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.590> kind<00:02:13.740> of<00:02:13.860> does

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
stick let's see what it kind of does

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.880 
stick let's see what it kind of does
here<00:02:14.370> i'm<00:02:15.060> shooting<00:02:15.599> for<00:02:15.629> you<00:02:16.349> know<00:02:16.470> keeping

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
here i'm shooting for you know keeping

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.970 
here i'm shooting for you know keeping
this<00:02:17.069> as<00:02:17.310> flat<00:02:17.670> as<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:18.030> can<00:02:18.330> when<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.599> do<00:02:18.720> this

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.520 

and<00:02:23.980> I'm<00:02:24.099> actually<00:02:24.310> using<00:02:24.670> blue<00:02:25.329> and<00:02:25.840> then

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
and I'm actually using blue and then

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.160 
and I'm actually using blue and then
green<00:02:26.950> too<00:02:27.459> so<00:02:27.879> it's<00:02:27.969> going<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.269> do<00:02:28.450> two<00:02:28.750> layers

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
green too so it's going to do two layers

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.869 
green too so it's going to do two layers
here<00:02:29.709> with<00:02:29.859> this<00:02:29.980> blue<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.370> these<00:02:30.670> are<00:02:30.849> a

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
here with this blue and these are a

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.149 
here with this blue and these are a
little<00:02:31.000> thicker<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.900> then<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:32.829> was<00:02:32.950> going<00:02:33.099> to

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
little thicker and then I was going to

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.890 
little thicker and then I was going to
put<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.519> green<00:02:33.969> kind<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.599> right<00:02:34.719> in<00:02:34.750> the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
put the green kind of right in the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.740 
put the green kind of right in the
middle<00:02:35.730> just<00:02:36.730> because<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.150> pieces<00:02:37.599> and

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
middle just because the pieces and

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.080 
middle just because the pieces and
working<00:02:38.109> with<00:02:38.290> what<00:02:38.530> that<00:02:38.709> fat<00:02:39.099> now<00:02:39.819> if<00:02:39.939> you

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
working with what that fat now if you

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.259 
working with what that fat now if you
had<00:02:40.390> access<00:02:40.989> to<00:02:41.500> just<00:02:41.680> regular<00:02:42.269> transparent

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
had access to just regular transparent

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.990 
had access to just regular transparent
kind<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.569> paper<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:44.980> wanted<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.459> use<00:02:45.760> that

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
kind of paper and you wanted to use that

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.390 
kind of paper and you wanted to use that
and<00:02:46.299> cut<00:02:46.810> it<00:02:46.989> to<00:02:47.139> be<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.439> size<00:02:47.709> of<00:02:47.920> your<00:02:47.950> board

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
and cut it to be the size of your board

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.280 
and cut it to be the size of your board
then<00:02:48.639> you<00:02:48.730> could<00:02:48.909> do<00:02:49.060> that<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.510> create<00:02:50.019> a<00:02:50.049> much

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
then you could do that and create a much

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.160 
then you could do that and create a much
cooler<00:02:50.590> kind<00:02:51.069> of<00:02:51.239> totally<00:02:52.239> complete<00:02:52.900> piece

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
cooler kind of totally complete piece

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.399 
cooler kind of totally complete piece
but<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:54.489> kind<00:02:54.760> of<00:02:54.790> gives<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.629> illusion<00:02:55.810> that

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
but that kind of gives the illusion that

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.210 
but that kind of gives the illusion that
they're<00:02:56.739> underwater<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:58.180> kind<00:02:58.389> of<00:02:58.419> looks<00:02:58.599> cool

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
they're underwater it kind of looks cool

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.909 
they're underwater it kind of looks cool
and<00:03:00.239> then<00:03:01.239> of<00:03:01.359> course<00:03:01.389> if<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:02.049> you<00:03:02.470> know<00:03:02.500> sign

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:02.919 
and then of course if you you know sign

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.759 
and then of course if you you know sign
your<00:03:03.129> work<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.549> could<00:03:03.760> stamp<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.389> um<00:03:04.659> at<00:03:05.560> the

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
your work you could stamp it um at the

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:13.589 
your work you could stamp it um at the
top<00:03:06.010> here<00:03:10.139> and<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:12.430> will<00:03:12.459> create<00:03:12.879> just<00:03:13.269> a<00:03:13.389> sort

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
top here and it will create just a sort

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.099 
top here and it will create just a sort
of<00:03:13.629> a<00:03:13.750> finished<00:03:14.760> project<00:03:15.760> without<00:03:16.419> too<00:03:16.930> much

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
of a finished project without too much

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.110 
of a finished project without too much
effort<00:03:17.169> these<00:03:17.950> turtles<00:03:18.370> aren't<00:03:18.549> too<00:03:18.730> hard<00:03:18.970> to

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
effort these turtles aren't too hard to

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.460 
effort these turtles aren't too hard to
fold<00:03:19.329> and<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.569> can<00:03:19.750> really<00:03:19.900> use<00:03:19.989> some<00:03:20.260> pretty

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
fold and you can really use some pretty

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.159 
fold and you can really use some pretty
paper<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:21.099> just<00:03:21.909> having<00:03:22.389> some<00:03:22.659> fun<00:03:22.689> with<00:03:22.989> this

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
paper and just having some fun with this

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.349 
paper and just having some fun with this
with<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.680> layers<00:03:24.040> creates<00:03:24.579> for<00:03:24.909> a<00:03:24.940> really

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
with the layers creates for a really

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.349 
with the layers creates for a really
cool<00:03:25.569> kind<00:03:25.840> of<00:03:25.959> results<00:03:26.409> so<00:03:27.120> it's<00:03:28.120> just<00:03:28.239> a

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
cool kind of results so it's just a

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.030 
cool kind of results so it's just a
quick<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:28.930> simple<00:03:28.989> way<00:03:29.379> to<00:03:29.409> showcase<00:03:29.829> some

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
quick and simple way to showcase some

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.949 
quick and simple way to showcase some
