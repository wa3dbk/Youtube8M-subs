00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:17.539
 our range of mountain bikes what 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.390
 covers everything from hard climbs to 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.400
 intense declines in the xd categories 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.930
 and trail our goal was to offer a 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.449
 great fan to cover all the 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.640
 disciplines the sparti genius ranges 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.949
 they offer just that they are very models 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.899
 similar but very different at the same time 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.940
 suspension technology is one of 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.620
 its main similarities our 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.569
 philosophy is to develop the picture and the 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.870
 suspension together to optimize 

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:43.249
 the kinematics the farc and the lines are 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.350
 two models that use our technology 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:47.089
 of suspension patented its 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.930
 key feature is control 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.489
 remote twin lock 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.840
 with this lever you can adjust the 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.200
 Suspension of the fork and 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.780
 shock absorber at the same time one action two 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.000
 reactions already have a spark model or 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.670
 genius you will enjoy three options of 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.410
 suspension in lock mode the 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.540
 Fork and shock absorber are 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.280
 locked in traction mode the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.930
 compression and travel are adjusted in the 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.430
 fork and shock absorber for 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.220
 facilitate promotions 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.840
 in the descent mode the shock absorber and the 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.840
 fork have the maximum travel 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:32.390
 the start is the double bicycle 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.700
 Perfect suspension for competition 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.090
 It has become a model of much 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.009
 success for scott is available in 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.289
 29- inch wheels with 100 millimeters 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.740
 of travel or in 26 inch wheel 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:47.689
 with 120 mm of travel we wanted 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.579
 create the lightest suspension frame 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.890
 of its category thanks to our 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.530
 patented process of integral molding and 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.349
 mp we get the best weight in the market 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.540
 with 18 kilograms included box and 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:02.120
 shock absorber 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.900
 but for us the way is not enough 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.760
 if there is no rigidity 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.899
 our technology has made it possible 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.270
 create this conical direction balance 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.150
 oversized turning points has 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.150
 is mechanized and bushing systems and 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.970
 ssl of 12 millimeters compatible with 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.620
 main market standards the 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.990
 geometry has a top tube 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.000
 longer shorter pods and smaller 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.080
 height of bottom bracket they produce 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.080
 a more racing handling 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.240
 the geometry can be adjusted by actuating 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.370
 the traveling with which we will modify 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.640
 the height of the bottom bracket shaft in 10 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.640
 millimeters 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.610
 during the first tests with the 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.170
 prototype is pair that in 2010 we saw the 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.660
 potential of a mountain bike 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.180
 with more journey we decided to use the 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.450
 spar platform as a basis to create the 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.910
 new generation genius the genius will be 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.130
 available in two wheel sizes in 29 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.640
 inches with 130 millimeters of travel 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.549
 and another version of 27 5 with 150 mm of 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.200
 hallenius travel is a train bike 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.209
 great designed for all kinds of 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.459
 land from routes by large 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.340
 mountains to the descents for your single 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.930
 favorite track compared to the farc 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.970
 we have increased the route of the 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.760
 genius and we have adapted the geometry 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.150
 so that the increases are easier and 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.920
 the most aggressive descents this class 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.200
 of conditions need one more box 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.959
 rigid we have kept the address 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.910
 conical bushing and ssl and the 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.930
 oversized turning points of the 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.939
 space 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.370
 but we have improved the violet 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:43.730
 mechanized and reinforced the table in the 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.799
 Key points to increase stiffness 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.569
 optimize the design we have achieved a lot 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.349
 rigidity without it being assumed a great 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.349
 increase in weight 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.720
 in our engineers take pride in 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.510
 Design bicycles with the best relationship 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.670
 travel weight of the street market news no 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.530
 is an exception has a weight of 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.530
 23 kilos including the shock absorber 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.289
 and we knew that the genius should have 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.630
 two sizes of different wheel to be 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:22.320
 the most competitive in the market and in the 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.750
 mountain then what is the size of 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.280
 ideal wheel the bikes of 29 are great 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.860
 but they have certain limitations 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.660
 our engineers certified that 130 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.849
 millimeters of travel is the limit 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.800
 for bikes wheel 29 inch 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.720
 get more travel and keep some 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.360
 large wheels we have decided to create the 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.270
 new genius with 27.5- inch wheels 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.580
 with the space ranges we cover all 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.580
 the competition and asia needs
