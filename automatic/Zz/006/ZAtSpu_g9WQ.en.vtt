 when said flashing bastide light 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.149
 means that the time they still have to finish crossing the 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:44.900

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.699
 is about to end 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.699

 while it stays on 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.520
 vehicles must not pass the traffic light or the detention line 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.890
 previous one closest to it if there 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.479
 if the traffic light were inside 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.120
 or on the opposite side of an intersection 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.130
 vehicles should not go into this 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.789
 nor exceed the line of detention located before it if any 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.970
 a flashing red light 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.600
 or two red lights alternately flashing 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.850
 temporarily prohibit the passage 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.020

 means that vehicles must stop under the same conditions as 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.729
 if it were a fixed red light 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:25.639
 unless when the vehicle is turned on it is so close to the 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:30.389
 place of detention that can not be stopped before the detention 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.389
 enough security 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.180
 a yellow light flashing other yellow lights alternately 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.180
 intermittent forces drivers to exercise extreme caution 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.319
 and if necessary, give way 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.149
 they also do not exempt from compliance with other signals that force them to stop 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.870
 a green light on a turn signal means that the passage is allowed 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:02.700
 except still 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.040
 When enjoying priority of passage, no driver should penetrate with his

 may be stopped in a way that prevents his circulation 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:22.139
 cross 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.379
 a black arrow 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.839
 on a red light not flashing or on a yellow light 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:30.409
 does not change the meaning of said lights 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.459
 but limited exclusively to the movement indicated by the arrow 

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:42.389
 a green arrow that lights up on a black circular background means that 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.289
 vehicles can take the direction and direction indicated by the same 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.569

 so that this circulation has to use 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:15.779
 must move in that direction 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:18.779
 and sense 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:24.379
 the vehicles that advance following the indication of a green arrow 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:26.590
 they should do it with caution 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.400
 letting vehicles passing by in the lane 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.460

 these traffic lights are located 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.680
 and the meaning of their lights 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.680

 the need to be incorporated in safety conditions 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.139
 to the lane towards which the arrow points 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:26.770
 any time that the one it circulates through will be closed in a short space 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.150
