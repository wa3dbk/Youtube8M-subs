just stabbing that on and I'm gonna put
that<00:02:23.459> right<00:02:23.520> where<00:02:23.880> my<00:02:24.000> creases

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.380 

just<00:02:30.920> sawed<00:02:31.130> off<00:02:31.160> little<00:02:31.430> by<00:02:31.760> little<00:02:32.030> you

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
just sawed off little by little you

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.570 
just sawed off little by little you
don't<00:02:32.570> want<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.750> have<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.020> too<00:02:33.230> dark<00:02:33.580> because

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
don't want to have it too dark because

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.780 
don't want to have it too dark because
then<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:34.850> makes<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.180> harder<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.660> blend<00:02:35.810> it

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
then it makes it harder to blend it

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.090 
then it makes it harder to blend it
start<00:02:37.790> off<00:02:37.970> light<00:02:38.330> it's<00:02:39.200> always<00:02:39.560> easier<00:02:39.980> to

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
start off light it's always easier to

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:49.190 
start off light it's always easier to
add<00:02:40.340> more<00:02:40.910> shadow<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:42.410> to<00:02:44.470> take<00:02:45.470> them<00:02:45.710> off

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.670 

you<00:02:49.739> just<00:02:49.980> do<00:02:50.190> on
