off a little bit of the power but of

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.060 
off a little bit of the power but of
course<00:01:37.060> speed<00:01:37.359> is<00:01:37.570> power<00:01:37.899> he<00:01:38.680> looks<00:01:38.920> like<00:01:38.979> he's

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
course speed is power he looks like he's

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.920 
course speed is power he looks like he's
really<00:01:39.460> trying<00:01:39.759> to<00:01:39.939> go<00:01:40.090> for<00:01:40.299> speed<00:01:40.689> and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
really trying to go for speed and

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.779 
really trying to go for speed and
condition<00:01:41.320> on<00:01:41.469> this<00:01:41.619> one<00:01:41.890> he<00:01:42.219> looks<00:01:42.609> like<00:01:42.700> he's

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
condition on this one he looks like he's

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.819 
condition on this one he looks like he's
kind<00:01:43.060> of<00:01:43.149> backing<00:01:43.420> off<00:01:43.719> maybe<00:01:44.109> a<00:01:44.259> little<00:01:44.320> bit

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
kind of backing off maybe a little bit

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.620 
kind of backing off maybe a little bit
make<00:01:45.159> sure<00:01:45.189> it<00:01:45.430> doesn't<00:01:45.579> over<00:01:45.820> train<00:01:46.060> look<00:01:46.479> I

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
make sure it doesn't over train look I

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.480 
make sure it doesn't over train look I
think<00:01:46.719> that's<00:01:47.079> why<00:01:47.320> she<00:01:47.590> stood<00:01:47.799> he's<00:01:48.039> in<00:01:48.250> great

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
think that's why she stood he's in great

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.950 
think that's why she stood he's in great
shape<00:01:48.520> right<00:01:48.759> now<00:01:48.969> I<00:01:49.149> think<00:01:49.329> he's<00:01:49.600> in<00:01:49.750> very

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
shape right now I think he's in very

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.020 
shape right now I think he's in very
good<00:01:50.109> position<00:01:50.469> you<00:01:51.310> want<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:51.549> ease<00:01:51.729> off<00:01:51.909> the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
good position you want to ease off the

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.490 
good position you want to ease off the
throttle<00:01:52.060> a<00:01:52.509> little<00:01:52.539> bit<00:01:52.810> taper<00:01:53.049> a<00:01:53.170> little<00:01:53.380> bit

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
throttle a little bit taper a little bit

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.349
