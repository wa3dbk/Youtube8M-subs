00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 Y 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.440
 hello today I'm going to prepare a delicious 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.590
 strawberry jam with chia seeds 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.440
 this recipe is easy delicious and very 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.230
 nutritious this marmalade unlike the 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.630
 traditional jam takes little sugar 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.089
 and also the cam process of 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.310
 development is much simpler 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.230
 Chia is the ingredient that is going to 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.970
 help give it the consistency of 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.730
 gelatin to this recipe 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.250
 also chia seeds are super 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.910
 nutrients are rich in antioxidants in 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.330
 good calcium among other nutrients for 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.140
 this recipe I will use between 10 to 12 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.050
 in strawberries 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.879
 I have a spoonful of chia seeds 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.780
 half teaspoon extract 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.460
 vanilla 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.670
 this is optional and between 2 to 4 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.370
 spoonfuls of sweetener can be 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.829
 linear maple or maple syrup or the 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.350
 bees or another type of industry that 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.870
 you be good 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.309
 the first step we will pass the strawberries 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.309
 by other food states 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.700
 the next step is to put the strawberry in 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.700
 a pan 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.600
 and heat on the stove over medium heat 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.280
 let's mix constantly 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.229
 as for three to five minutes after 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.590
 the four minutes approximately I will 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.079
 add the half teaspoon of extract 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.430
 of vanilla and two tablespoons also of 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:44.390
 steam or maple honey 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.220
 we recreate the fire pot 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.220
 and add the chia seeds 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.509
 once all the ingredients have been 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.479
 mixed I'm going to stand the jam by 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.310
 about five minutes to thicken and has 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.580
 after five minutes he wants to show us 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.090
 the texture 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.910
 out of nowhere the next step is 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.060
 put it in a jar a container and 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.280
 taking to the fridge to deliver 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.980
 very well I know that they come to the fridge and 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.470
 would have as you can see has the 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.360
 jam consistency now as 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.610
 we can eat in safety here already 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.250
 I have a little bit of it for natural too 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.770
 They can use vanilla yogurt and I 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.770
 like to give a spoonful of this 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.800
 I am going to try 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.800
 one 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:53.680
 delicious, good, I will also 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.680
 try them on toast biscuits and a 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.680
 bit 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:07.659
 you like to say no 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.659
 remember like that and savor 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.660

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.060

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.890
