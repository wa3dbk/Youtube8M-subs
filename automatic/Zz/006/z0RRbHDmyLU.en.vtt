being better as we have five and we have

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.200 
being better as we have five and we have
11<00:00:16.039> people<00:00:16.219> on<00:00:16.369> the<00:00:16.490> team<00:00:16.640> i<00:00:16.850> would<00:00:17.029> say<00:00:17.150> that

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
11 people on the team i would say that

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.940 
11 people on the team i would say that
that's<00:00:17.480> one<00:00:17.990> of<00:00:18.080> the<00:00:18.170> big<00:00:18.349> things<00:00:18.380> we<00:00:18.740> already

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:18.950 
that's one of the big things we already

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.400 
that's one of the big things we already
know<00:00:19.070> what's<00:00:19.550> expected<00:00:19.670> and<00:00:20.180> I<00:00:20.600> think<00:00:21.289> our
