that we've seen leaked a couple times
now<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.490> think<00:00:29.810> you<00:00:30.810> know<00:00:30.900> Ice<00:00:31.080> Cream<00:00:31.380> Sandwich

now I think you know Ice Cream Sandwich
e<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.189> design<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.880> suppose<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:34.200> first<00:00:35.100> tab<00:00:35.309> we

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
e in design I suppose so first tab we

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.970 
e in design I suppose so first tab we
have<00:00:35.640> here<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.000> recent<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.660> here's<00:00:37.320> recent

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
have here is recent and here's recent

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.010 
have here is recent and here's recent
music<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:38.820> either<00:00:39.090> listen<00:00:39.510> two<00:00:39.660> or

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
music that I have either listen two or

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.830 
music that I have either listen two or
more<00:00:40.290> likely<00:00:41.059> uploaded<00:00:42.059> from<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.390> looks<00:00:42.719> of

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
more likely uploaded from the looks of

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.910 
more likely uploaded from the looks of
it<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.610> so<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.850> tab<00:00:45.059> over<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.770> scroll<00:00:46.770> by

it and so you can tab over and scroll by

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.110 
it and so you can tab over and scroll by
artists<00:00:48.320> buy<00:00:49.320> albums<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.309> you'll<00:00:50.579> see<00:00:50.760> if<00:00:51.000> you
