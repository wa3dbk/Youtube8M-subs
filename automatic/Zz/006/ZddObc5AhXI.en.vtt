Survival: how to light a Fire

00:00:03.798 --> 00:00:08.000
hi guys today I will show you how to light a fire during an emergency 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:15.427
  with the bow drill technique that was one of the most effective applications of friction fire  

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.348
 The tools you need are: a knife  

00:00:18.389 --> 00:00:34.101
 the bow that can be straight or curved, dry or green, as long as a forearm

00:00:35.143 --> 00:00:43.146
 a rope not too brim  

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:55.988
 a one inch thick spindle of any type of wood  

00:00:56.785 --> 00:01:00.000
 a handle to lock the spindle  

00:01:00.086 --> 00:01:06.840
 And a fireboard that is the most difficult part to find  

00:01:07.512 --> 00:01:20.932
 it must be of very soft wood like spruce pine oak willow and almost dry

00:01:22.273 --> 00:01:27.235
First of all you need to make a hole in the spindle 

00:01:28.374 --> 00:01:48.879
at a distance from the edge equal to the thickness of the spindle

00:01:50.894 --> 00:01:58.897
after this you have to make a cut from the center of the hole to the edge  

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:14.742
inside the notch will collect wood powder 

00:02:15.045 --> 00:02:28.131
 the powder at 200 degrees will begin to generate smoke

00:02:30.173 --> 00:02:38.841
after that you have to collect the powder on a leaf and put it into the tinder bundle

00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:47.270
made with dried leaves and bark 

00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:57.703
place a dry leaf under the fire board

00:02:57.807 --> 00:03:10.767
put the spindle into the arc

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:16.060
place the left foot over  the fireboard 

00:03:17.102 --> 00:03:30.062
lock the wrist on the ankle

00:03:31.104 --> 00:03:38.897
do not start spinning too fast

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:58.732
30 seconds…

00:04:04.774 --> 00:04:20.526
After you see a lot of smoke still have to wait a few seconds...

00:04:25,568 --&gt; 00:03:14,695
try to remove the powder with the knife

00:04:38.736 --> 00:04:47.738
Put the leaf into the tinder bundle

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.657
blow gently from the bottom

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.908
…and you have the fire
