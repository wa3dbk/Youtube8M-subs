00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
what's taking up the most space so as

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.679 
what's taking up the most space so as
you<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.340> see<00:01:20.520> here<00:01:20.850> you're<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> ones<00:01:21.360> taking

you can see here you're the ones taking

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.660 
you can see here you're the ones taking
up<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> most<00:01:22.020> space<00:01:22.310> we've<00:01:23.310> got<00:01:23.460> Google

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
up the most space we've got Google

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.149 
up the most space we've got Google
Reader<00:01:24.030> here<00:01:24.450> mainly<00:01:24.810> because<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.920> data

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
Reader here mainly because of the data

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.580 
Reader here mainly because of the data
of<00:01:26.630> downloading<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.810> different<00:01:28.170> feeds<00:01:28.380> that

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
of downloading the different feeds that

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.399 
of downloading the different feeds that
I<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:29.540> believe<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:30.689> one<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:30.960> probably

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
I have believe this one is probably

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.140 
I have believe this one is probably
maybe<00:01:34.409> TweetDeck

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
maybe TweetDeck

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.420 
maybe TweetDeck
but<00:01:36.570> anyways<00:01:37.320> little<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:38.040> will<00:01:38.220> just

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
but anyways little so this will just

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.890 
but anyways little so this will just
show<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.640> what's<00:01:39.090> taking<00:01:39.450> up<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.630> most<00:01:39.810> space

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
show you what's taking up the most space

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.880 
show you what's taking up the most space
so<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:41.240> take<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> glance<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.899> see<00:01:43.320> just

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
so you can take a glance and see just

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.010 
so you can take a glance and see just
what<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.850> might<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.210> able<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.509> delete<00:01:45.810> if

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
what you might be able to delete if

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.780 
what you might be able to delete if
you're<00:01:46.170> running<00:01:46.320> out<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.560> space

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
you're running out of space

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.270 
you're running out of space
you<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.869> go<00:01:49.020> back<00:01:49.170> here<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:52.530> it'll<00:01:52.799> shoot<00:01:53.009> if

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280

things<00:02:04.490> go<00:02:05.490> back<00:02:05.729> we<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.390> look<00:02:06.540> at<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
things go back we can look at the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.270 
things go back we can look at the
storage<00:02:07.110> card<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.710> something<00:02:08.129> that's

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
storage card this is something that's

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.350 
storage card this is something that's
probably<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.640> little<00:02:08.759> more<00:02:09.000> useful

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
probably a little more useful

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.720 
probably a little more useful
if<00:02:10.630> you<00:02:11.020> got<00:02:11.170> random<00:02:11.590> files<00:02:11.830> on<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.190> SD<00:02:12.220> card

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
if you got random files on the SD card

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.720 
if you got random files on the SD card
such<00:02:13.660> as<00:02:13.810> music<00:02:14.230> as<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.890> can<00:02:15.100> see<00:02:15.310> here<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.640> can

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
such as music as you can see here I can

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.820 
such as music as you can see here I can
see<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.300> my<00:02:16.450> backups<00:02:16.960> from<00:02:17.110> clockworkmod

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
see that my backups from clockworkmod

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.440 
see that my backups from clockworkmod
are<00:02:17.980> taking<00:02:18.310> up<00:02:18.430> quite<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.640> bit<00:02:18.820> of<00:02:18.940> space<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:19.420> I

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
are taking up quite a bit of space so I

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.870 
are taking up quite a bit of space so I
can<00:02:19.570> expand<00:02:20.080> that<00:02:20.170> if<00:02:20.380> I<00:02:20.500> want<00:02:20.710> to<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.280> we<00:02:21.640> see

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
can expand that if I want to and we see

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.330 
can expand that if I want to and we see
everything<00:02:22.150> that's<00:02:22.750> taken<00:02:23.080> up<00:02:23.200> here<00:02:23.500> here<00:02:24.220> we

everything that's taken up here here we

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.250 
everything that's taken up here here we

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
and I can zoom in a little further if I

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.060 
and I can zoom in a little further if I
want<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.570> do<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.810> so<00:02:29.320> I<00:02:29.380> can<00:02:29.560> delete<00:02:29.740> things

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070

fairly<00:02:37.840> simple<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.380> definitely<00:02:39.280> just<00:02:39.550> a

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
fairly simple and definitely just a

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.340 
fairly simple and definitely just a
quick<00:02:39.880> way<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.090> see<00:02:40.420> what's<00:02:40.720> taking<00:02:41.140> up<00:02:41.230> the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
quick way to see what's taking up the

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.350 
quick way to see what's taking up the
most<00:02:41.500> space<00:02:41.770> so<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:42.460> can<00:02:42.580> clear<00:02:42.850> up<00:02:42.880> clear

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
most space so you can clear up clear

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.300 
most space so you can clear up clear
things<00:02:43.660> up<00:02:43.870> if<00:02:44.080> you're<00:02:44.350> running<00:02:44.620> out<00:02:44.920> of<00:02:44.950> space

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
things up if you're running out of space

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.060 
things up if you're running out of space
and<00:02:45.580> want<00:02:46.270> to<00:02:46.330> put<00:02:46.480> something<00:02:46.690> else<00:02:46.960> on<00:02:47.290> again

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070
