00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
to add a windows live ID and click Add

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.189 
to add a windows live ID and click Add
and<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.550> will<00:00:44.640> ask<00:00:44.790> you<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.030> sign<00:00:45.269> in<00:00:45.480> with<00:00:45.660> your

windows live ID and and username and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.840 
windows live ID and and username and
password<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.320> once<00:00:53.160> that's<00:00:53.370> linked<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.940> okay

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
password so once that's linked it okay

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.989 
password so once that's linked it okay
the<00:00:56.850> next<00:00:57.120> step<00:00:57.239> we<00:00:57.390> need<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.600> do<00:00:57.749> is<00:00:58.019> get<00:00:58.320> our

00:00:58.989 --> 00:00:58.999 
the next step we need to do is get our

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:02.930 
the next step we need to do is get our
CID<00:00:59.999> of<00:01:00.390> Windows<00:01:00.809> Live<00:01:01.019> so<00:01:01.559> open<00:01:02.370> up<00:01:02.460> google

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
CID of Windows Live so open up google

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:12.190 
CID of Windows Live so open up google
chrome<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.500> head<00:01:04.500> over<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:05.810> skydrive.com<00:01:10.370> and

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
chrome and head over to skydrive.com and

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.680 
chrome and head over to skydrive.com and
then<00:01:13.200> just<00:01:13.500> sign<00:01:13.800> in<00:01:14.060> now<00:01:15.060> make<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.480> a<00:01:15.510> bit

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
then just sign in now make that a bit

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:24.109 
then just sign in now make that a bit
bigger<00:01:16.790> and<00:01:20.570> sign<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:22.220> okay<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.820> once<00:01:24.000> you've

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
bigger and sign in okay so once you've

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.639 
bigger and sign in okay so once you've
signed<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.780> SkyDrive<00:01:25.200> you'll<00:01:25.350> see<00:01:25.500> you

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
signed in to SkyDrive you'll see you

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.819 
signed in to SkyDrive you'll see you
your<00:01:26.520> folders<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.090> there<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.450> think<00:01:28.350> by<00:01:28.500> default

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
your folders in there I think by default

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.310 
your folders in there I think by default
you<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.219> documents<00:01:29.820> folder<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.960> if<00:01:31.200> you

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
you have a documents folder so if you

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.690 
you have a documents folder so if you
click<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.680> documents<00:01:32.130> folder<00:01:32.460> you'll

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
click on the documents folder you'll

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.190 
click on the documents folder you'll
notice<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.270> address<00:01:34.170> bar<00:01:34.590> changes<00:01:35.399> the

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
notice the address bar changes the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.020 
notice the address bar changes the
normally<00:01:37.200> you've<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.560> got<00:01:37.740> SkyDrive<00:01:38.670> live

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
normally you've just got SkyDrive live

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.700 
normally you've just got SkyDrive live
com<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:39.659> when<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.840> hit<00:01:39.960> documents<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.530> get

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
com but when you hit documents you get

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.830 
com but when you hit documents you get
and<00:01:41.250> all<00:01:41.399> this<00:01:41.520> other<00:01:41.670> extra<00:01:42.360> stuff<00:01:42.570> at<00:01:42.719> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
this window copy it now next thing we

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.900 
this window copy it now next thing we
need<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.340> do<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.700> open<00:02:05.969> up<00:02:07.009> Windows<00:02:08.009> Explorer

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
need to do is open up Windows Explorer

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.290 
need to do is open up Windows Explorer
right<00:02:09.570> to<00:02:09.869> my<00:02:10.020> power<00:02:10.200> network<00:02:10.470> drives<00:02:12.320> so

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
right to my power network drives so

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.700 
right to my power network drives so
on<00:02:14.900> our<00:02:15.140> windows<00:02:15.500> explorer<00:02:16.430> we<00:02:16.730> hit<00:02:16.910> network

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
on our windows explorer we hit network

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.490 
on our windows explorer we hit network
map<00:02:18.710> network<00:02:18.980> drive<00:02:20.110> okay<00:02:21.110> so<00:02:21.170> here's<00:02:21.440> a

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
map network drive okay so here's a

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.010 
map network drive okay so here's a
tricky<00:02:21.710> bit<00:02:21.920> so<00:02:22.520> what<00:02:22.760> you<00:02:22.880> need<00:02:23.030> put<00:02:23.510> in<00:02:23.750> there

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
tricky bit so what you need put in there

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.840 
tricky bit so what you need put in there
there's<00:02:24.380> two<00:02:24.650> possibilities<00:02:25.130> you<00:02:25.460> can<00:02:25.490> put<00:02:25.760> in

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
there's two possibilities you can put in

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.340 
there's two possibilities you can put in
there<00:02:25.970> one<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:26.300> them<00:02:26.420> what<00:02:26.660> for<00:02:26.870> me<00:02:27.020> works

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
there one of them what for me works

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.960 
there one of them what for me works
better<00:02:27.680> than<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:27.890> other<00:02:28.070> so<00:02:28.400> I'm<00:02:28.670> just<00:02:28.850> going

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
better than the other so I'm just going

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.740 
better than the other so I'm just going
