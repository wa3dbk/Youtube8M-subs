00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.399
 Philistines if I did wrong to them and it was 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.160

 every two tails after lighting the 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.940
 teas released the foxes in the fields 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.510
 of the Philistines and burned the corn 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.239
 stacked and standing vineyards and olive groves and 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.489
 said the Philistines who did this and 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.829
 They answered Sanson the son-in-law of the team 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.530
 atheist because he took his wife and gave it to 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.140
 his companion and the Philistines came and 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.809
 they burned her and her father then 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.149
 Sanson told them that you have done this 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.090
 I swear I will take revenge on you and 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.500
 after existing and hurt them hip and 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.780
 Thigh with great mortality 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.690
 and he went down and dwelt in the cave of the 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.730
 rock Etam the Philistines 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.370
 They went up and camped in Judas and 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.200
 they extended by law and males from 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.660
 Judah told them why you went up 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.940
 against us and they responded 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.790
 learn Sanson we have gone up to 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.740
 to do to him as he has done to us and they came 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.590
 three thousand men from Judah to the cave of 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.330
 the pe침a de tam and they told sans칩n not 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.300
 do you know that the Philistines dominate over 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.700
 us because you've done this to us and he 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.100
 he answered them I have done them like them 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.500
 they made me then they told him 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.229
 we have come to sell you and 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.780
 give you into the hand of the Philistines and 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.509
 Sanson replied he swears that you 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.509
 you will not kill me and they answered 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.550
 saying not only will we depend and you 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.280
 we will deliver in your hands more not you 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.200
 we will kill then you tied him with two 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.930
 new strings and they made him come from the 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.490
 pineapple and so came to this law the 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.560
 Philistines came out shouting at their 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.869
 encounter but the spirit of jehovah 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.580
 came on him and the ropes he was 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.220
 in their arms they became like linen 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.770
 burned with fire and the bonds fell 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.070
 his hands and finding a donkey jaw 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.590
 cool one reached out and took it and 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.470
 he killed a thousand men with her then 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.140
 Sanson said with the jaw of an ass a 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.050
 pile two mounds with the jaw of a 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.630
 ass I killed a thousand men and finishing 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.740
 talk threw his jaw out of his hand and 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.310
 He called that place 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.710
 ramat law and having great thirst cried out 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.290
 then to jehovah and said you have given this 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.570
 great salvation by the hand of your servant and 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.240
 I will die of thirst now and I will fall in my hand 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.880
 of the uncircumcised then opened 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.130
 God the account that is in law and came out of 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.100
 there water and the middle and regained its 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.980
 spirit and he was revived by this he called the 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.340
 name of that place in Nagore which 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.890
 is in law until today and judged Israel 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.890
 in the days of the Philistines 20 years
