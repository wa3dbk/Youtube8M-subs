just a standard vacuum pump and some

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.830 
just a standard vacuum pump and some
vacuum<00:00:29.890> line<00:00:30.100> that's<00:00:30.340> going<00:00:30.580> to<00:00:30.670> fit<00:00:31.539> on<00:00:31.570> to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
vacuum line that's going to fit on to

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.560 
vacuum line that's going to fit on to
the<00:00:31.960> vacuum<00:00:32.140> events<00:00:32.590> controller<00:00:33.180> now<00:00:34.180> first

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
the vacuum events controller now first

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.720 
the vacuum events controller now first
off<00:00:34.809> you<00:00:35.320> want<00:00:35.470> to<00:00:35.620> test<00:00:35.800> your<00:00:35.980> vacuum<00:00:36.309> pump<00:00:36.550> to

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
off you want to test your vacuum pump to

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.060 
off you want to test your vacuum pump to
see<00:00:37.030> if<00:00:37.120> it<00:00:37.270> will<00:00:37.390> hold<00:00:37.540> vacuum<00:00:38.050> so<00:00:38.920> you're

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
see if it will hold vacuum so you're

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.320 
see if it will hold vacuum so you're
just<00:00:39.250> going<00:00:39.430> to<00:00:39.460> plug<00:00:39.699> the<00:00:39.879> end<00:00:39.970> of<00:00:40.090> the<00:00:40.150> hose

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
just going to plug the end of the hose

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.090 
just going to plug the end of the hose
and<00:00:41.699> then<00:00:42.699> pump<00:00:43.180> it<00:00:43.300> up<00:00:43.449> to<00:00:44.020> 15<00:00:44.470> inch<00:00:44.680> pounds

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
and then pump it up to 15 inch pounds

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.360 
and then pump it up to 15 inch pounds
and<00:00:45.280> then<00:00:46.270> hold<00:00:46.450> it<00:00:46.570> there<00:00:46.780> and<00:00:47.020> if<00:00:47.950> the<00:00:48.100> needle

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
and then hold it there and if the needle

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.700 
and then hold it there and if the needle
stays<00:00:48.579> in<00:00:48.790> one<00:00:48.970> spot<00:00:49.300> you<00:00:49.570> have<00:00:50.260> a<00:00:50.290> good<00:00:50.500> vacuum

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
stays in one spot you have a good vacuum

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.430 
stays in one spot you have a good vacuum

we're<00:01:05.770> now<00:01:05.950> going<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.220> look<00:01:06.340> at<00:01:06.640> the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
we're now going to look at the

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.670 
we're now going to look at the
distributor<00:01:07.330> and<00:01:07.509> show<00:01:08.110> you<00:01:08.170> where<00:01:08.410> did<00:01:08.530> it

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
distributor and show you where did it

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.520 
distributor and show you where did it
where<00:01:09.149> what<00:01:10.149> the<00:01:10.300> vacuum<00:01:10.450> controller<00:01:11.080> is<00:01:11.289> and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
where what the vacuum controller is and

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.920 
where what the vacuum controller is and
what<00:01:12.310> to<00:01:12.490> watch<00:01:12.729> for<00:01:13.090> when<00:01:13.479> you're<00:01:13.660> applying

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
what to watch for when you're applying

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.490 
what to watch for when you're applying
this<00:01:14.170> test<00:01:15.210> here's<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.420> vacuum<00:01:16.810> advanced

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
this test here's the vacuum advanced

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.560 
this test here's the vacuum advanced
controller<00:01:17.940> located<00:01:18.940> on<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.150> front<00:01:19.360> of<00:01:19.420> the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
controller located on the front of the

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.000 
controller located on the front of the
distributor<00:01:20.140> pointing<00:01:20.560> towards<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.979> front

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
distributor pointing towards the front

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.460 
distributor pointing towards the front
of<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.310> motor<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.780> comes<00:01:22.990> in<00:01:23.140> here<00:01:23.320> and

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
of the motor and it comes in here and

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.039 
of the motor and it comes in here and
controls<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:24.010> igniter<00:01:24.750> inside<00:01:25.750> of<00:01:25.930> the

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
controls the igniter inside of the

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.170 
controls the igniter inside of the
distributor<00:01:26.650> and<00:01:26.860> this<00:01:27.729> is<00:01:27.880> what<00:01:28.030> you're

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
distributor and this is what you're

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.210 
distributor and this is what you're
going<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.330> want<00:01:28.540> to<00:01:28.630> watch<00:01:28.810> for<00:01:29.170> and<00:01:29.470> it<00:01:30.010> should

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
going to want to watch for and it should

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.340 
going to want to watch for and it should
move<00:01:30.400> 3/8<00:01:30.939> of<00:01:31.090> an<00:01:31.240> inch<00:01:31.360> when<00:01:31.930> do<00:01:32.049> you<00:01:32.140> apply

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
move 3/8 of an inch when do you apply

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.250 
move 3/8 of an inch when do you apply
vacuum<00:01:32.680> and<00:01:33.580> now<00:01:34.090> what's<00:01:34.360> so<00:01:34.570> important<00:01:35.140> about

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
vacuum and now what's so important about

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.399 
vacuum and now what's so important about
this<00:01:35.650> working<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:37.450> that<00:01:37.600> it<00:01:37.900> advances<00:01:38.380> the

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
this working is that it advances the

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.590 
this working is that it advances the
timing<00:01:38.860> just<00:01:39.040> a<00:01:39.159> little<00:01:39.490> bit<00:01:39.640> at<00:01:40.000> high<00:01:40.360> engine

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
timing just a little bit at high engine

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.320 
timing just a little bit at high engine
speeds<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.890> it<00:01:42.070> improves<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.700> performance<00:01:43.210> of

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
speeds so it improves the performance of

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.179 
speeds so it improves the performance of
the<00:01:43.420> vehicle<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:43.990> you<00:01:44.049> get<00:01:44.890> better<00:01:45.100> fuel

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
the vehicle and you get better fuel

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.480 
the vehicle and you get better fuel
economy<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:47.140> at<00:01:47.590> this<00:01:47.770> point<00:01:48.040> we're<00:01:48.280> not

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
economy and so at this point we're not

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.580 
economy and so at this point we're not
going<00:01:48.640> to<00:01:48.670> go<00:01:48.790> down<00:01:48.970> to<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.330> vehicle<00:01:49.540> and<00:01:49.930> show

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
going to go down to the vehicle and show

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.530 
going to go down to the vehicle and show
you<00:01:50.650> where<00:01:50.890> it's<00:01:51.009> at<00:01:51.159> on<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.610> vehicle<00:01:52.000> and<00:01:52.150> how

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
you where it's at on the vehicle and how

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.190 
you where it's at on the vehicle and how
the<00:01:52.600> testing<00:01:53.110> today<00:01:53.860> we<00:01:54.369> are<00:01:54.490> working<00:01:54.729> on<00:01:55.030> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
the testing today we are working on the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.950 
the testing today we are working on the
1987<00:01:56.220> Suzuki<00:01:57.220> Samurai<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:58.509> we're<00:01:58.630> first<00:01:58.780> going

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
1987 Suzuki Samurai so we're first going

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.649 
1987 Suzuki Samurai so we're first going
to<00:01:59.020> start<00:01:59.079> off<00:01:59.549> by<00:02:00.549> removing<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:01.060> distributor

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
to start off by removing the distributor

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.380 
to start off by removing the distributor

moving<00:02:09.920> it<00:02:10.010> out<00:02:10.130> of<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.340> way<00:02:10.990> and<00:02:11.990> then<00:02:12.110> this

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
moving it out of the way and then this

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.170 
moving it out of the way and then this
guy<00:02:12.560> here<00:02:12.590> on<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.010> side<00:02:13.220> is<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.790> vacuum

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
guy here on the side is the vacuum

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.230 
guy here on the side is the vacuum
advanced<00:02:14.810> controller<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.590> this<00:02:16.550> guy<00:02:16.730> in<00:02:16.880> here

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
advanced controller and this guy in here

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.900 
advanced controller and this guy in here
right<00:02:17.780> behind<00:02:17.960> it<00:02:18.320> is<00:02:18.470> DN<00:02:18.830> lighter<00:02:19.130> so<00:02:19.730> we're

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
right behind it is DN lighter so we're

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.430 
right behind it is DN lighter so we're
also<00:02:20.030> going<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.300> talk<00:02:20.480> about<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:20.960> you<00:02:21.230> want

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
also going to talk about that you want

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.860 
also going to talk about that you want
to<00:02:21.560> make<00:02:21.710> sure<00:02:21.880> that<00:02:22.880> when<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.210> apply<00:02:23.540> vacuum

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
to make sure that when you apply vacuum

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.830 
to make sure that when you apply vacuum
that<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:24.980> moves<00:02:25.280> three-eighths<00:02:26.150> of<00:02:26.270> an<00:02:26.420> inch

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
that it moves three-eighths of an inch

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.920 
that it moves three-eighths of an inch
should<00:02:27.230> move<00:02:27.410> slightly<00:02:27.860> up<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:29.420> first<00:02:29.690> we're

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
should move slightly up so first we're

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.110 
should move slightly up so first we're
going<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.080> start<00:02:30.200> off<00:02:30.470> by<00:02:30.940> removing<00:02:31.940> the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
going to start off by removing the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
going to start off by removing the
vacuum<00:02:32.450> hose<00:02:32.630> off<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.500> side<00:02:33.710> and<00:02:34.960> then<00:02:35.960> with

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
going to want to hold it for about seven

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.440 
going to want to hold it for about seven
seconds<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:18.610> at<00:03:19.610> that<00:03:19.820> time<00:03:20.060> you're<00:03:20.270> then

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
seconds and at that time you're then

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.479 
seconds and at that time you're then
going<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:20.690> want<00:03:20.780> to<00:03:20.900> release<00:03:21.230> it<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:21.650> watch

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
going to want to release it and watch

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:30.710 
going to want to release it and watch
the<00:03:22.760> uniter<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.300> see<00:03:23.720> if<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:23.959> moves<00:03:24.080> back<00:03:24.410> down

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.620 

so<00:03:31.720> it's<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:31.930> very<00:03:32.140> simple<00:03:32.710> test<00:03:33.090> but<00:03:34.090> if<00:03:34.240> a<00:03:34.390> your

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
so it's a very simple test but if a your

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.910 
so it's a very simple test but if a your
needle<00:03:35.020> dropped<00:03:35.260> at<00:03:35.440> all<00:03:35.560> while<00:03:35.740> you're

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
needle dropped at all while you're

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.550 
needle dropped at all while you're
holding<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:36.370> pressure<00:03:36.580> or<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.230> Nider<00:03:38.230> moved

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
holding the pressure or the Nider moved

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.860 
holding the pressure or the Nider moved
back<00:03:38.830> into<00:03:39.130> position<00:03:39.360> that<00:03:40.360> means<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:40.690> have<00:03:40.840> a

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
back into position that means you have a

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.260 
back into position that means you have a

we're<00:03:55.270> now<00:03:55.540> just<00:03:55.750> going<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.380> discuss<00:03:56.770> the

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
we're now just going to discuss the

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.160 
we're now just going to discuss the
other<00:03:57.130> way<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.340> do<00:03:57.550> it<00:03:57.700> with<00:03:58.450> just<00:03:58.480> a<00:03:58.810> vacuum

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
other way to do it with just a vacuum

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.000 
other way to do it with just a vacuum
hose<00:03:59.350> and<00:03:59.760> yourself<00:04:01.530> you're<00:04:02.530> just<00:04:02.650> going<00:04:02.950> to

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
hose and yourself you're just going to

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.530 
hose and yourself you're just going to
attach<00:04:03.130> it<00:04:03.340> just<00:04:03.700> like<00:04:04.150> you<00:04:04.270> would<00:04:04.420> your

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
attach it just like you would your

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.310 
attach it just like you would your
vacuum<00:04:04.900> pump<00:04:05.140> and<00:04:06.570> then<00:04:07.570> suck<00:04:07.870> through<00:04:08.200> the

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
vacuum pump and then suck through the

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.710 
vacuum pump and then suck through the
hose<00:04:08.500> and<00:04:08.830> draw<00:04:09.160> a<00:04:09.190> vacuum<00:04:09.640> from<00:04:09.790> vacuum<00:04:10.570> and

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
hose and draw a vacuum from vacuum and

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.480 
hose and draw a vacuum from vacuum and
then<00:04:11.320> you<00:04:11.440> should<00:04:11.500> be<00:04:11.740> able<00:04:11.830> to<00:04:11.980> test<00:04:12.190> it<00:04:12.370> the

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
then you should be able to test it the

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.250 
then you should be able to test it the
exact<00:04:12.730> same<00:04:12.910> way

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.890 

and<00:04:18.550> then<00:04:19.550> just<00:04:19.820> to<00:04:19.940> hold<00:04:20.090> it<00:04:20.239> to<00:04:20.390> see<00:04:20.600> if<00:04:20.720> it's

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
and then just to hold it to see if it's

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.780 
and then just to hold it to see if it's
going<00:04:21.080> to<00:04:21.200> work<00:04:21.380> if<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.980> vacuum<00:04:22.190> advanced

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
going to work if the vacuum advanced
