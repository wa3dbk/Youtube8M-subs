just pays the caretakers wage and all of

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.060 
just pays the caretakers wage and all of
the<00:00:55.829> timbi's<00:00:56.190> see<00:00:56.489> here<00:00:56.820> plus<00:00:57.829> what's<00:00:58.829> lying

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the timbi's see here plus what's lying

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.920 
the timbi's see here plus what's lying
on<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.340> ground<00:00:59.520> there<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.059> over<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
on the ground there and over on the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.000 
on the ground there and over on the
trailer<00:01:02.690> it's<00:01:03.690> cost<00:01:03.930> me<00:01:03.989> about<00:01:04.140> ten<00:01:04.439> bucks<00:01:04.830> I

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
trailer it's cost me about ten bucks I

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.730 
trailer it's cost me about ten bucks I
think<00:01:05.960> absolutely<00:01:06.960> nothing<00:01:07.439> wrong<00:01:07.560> with<00:01:07.710> it

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
think absolutely nothing wrong with it

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.219 
think absolutely nothing wrong with it
that's<00:01:08.700> just<00:01:08.909> all<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> stuff<00:01:09.540> off<00:01:09.720> cuts<00:01:09.990> that

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
that's just all the stuff off cuts that

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.310 
that's just all the stuff off cuts that
the<00:01:10.580> local<00:01:11.580> builders<00:01:11.939> don't<00:01:12.150> use<00:01:12.360> as<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:13.290> see

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the local builders don't use as you see

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.920 
the local builders don't use as you see
and<00:01:14.210> it's<00:01:15.210> basically<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.750> framing<00:01:16.409> pond<00:01:16.770> and

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
and it's basically just framing pond and

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.820 
and it's basically just framing pond and
absolutely<00:01:18.930> nothing<00:01:19.320> wrong<00:01:19.439> with<00:01:19.680> this

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
absolutely nothing wrong with this

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.429 
absolutely nothing wrong with this
number<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:24.540> most<00:01:24.720> part<00:01:25.020> straight<00:01:25.320> as<00:01:25.409> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
number and the most part straight as a

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.340 
number and the most part straight as a
die<00:01:25.530> too<00:01:25.979> yeah<00:01:26.930> that's<00:01:27.930> probably<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.259> bad

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
die too yeah that's probably a bad

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.899 
die too yeah that's probably a bad
example<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.950> one's<00:01:29.130> got<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> bit<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.579> bow<00:01:29.729> in

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
example that one's got a bit of a bow in

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.270 
example that one's got a bit of a bow in
it<00:01:30.020> but<00:01:31.020> nearly<00:01:31.500> all<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.740> them<00:01:31.950> are<00:01:32.070> straight

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
it but nearly all of them are straight

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.200 
it but nearly all of them are straight
as<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> die<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:35.460> I've<00:01:35.579> knocked<00:01:35.759> him<00:01:35.939> up<00:01:36.060> together

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
as a die so I've knocked him up together

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.249 
as a die so I've knocked him up together
just<00:01:37.170> glued<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.920> screwed<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.909> whole<00:01:39.000> lot<00:01:39.259> i

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
just glued and screwed the whole lot i

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.929 
just glued and screwed the whole lot i
figured<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.130> easy<00:01:41.310> i<00:01:41.490> don't<00:01:41.790> own<00:01:41.909> a

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
figured it's just easy i don't own a

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.289 
figured it's just easy i don't own a
nail<00:01:42.210> gun<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.520> figured<00:01:44.520> gluing<00:01:45.180> and

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
nail gun so I figured gluing and

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.700 
nail gun so I figured gluing and
screwing<00:01:45.329> probably<00:01:45.869> easier<00:01:46.170> than<00:01:46.229> hitting

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
screwing probably easier than hitting

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.399 
screwing probably easier than hitting
myself<00:01:46.950> with<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> hammer<00:01:48.799> so<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.670> plan<00:01:51.060> will<00:01:51.270> be

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
myself with a hammer so the plan will be

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.929 
myself with a hammer so the plan will be
this<00:01:52.409> section<00:01:52.829> over<00:01:52.950> here<00:01:53.130> where<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.579> see<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
this section over here where you see the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.600 
this section over here where you see the
bit<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.270> frame<00:01:55.200> built<00:01:55.500> up<00:01:55.680> there's<00:01:56.430> another

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
bit of a frame built up there's another

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.100 
bit of a frame built up there's another
member<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.000> go<00:01:57.180> across<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.570> back<00:01:57.719> there<00:01:57.990> and

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
member to go across the back there and

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.190 
member to go across the back there and
then<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.259> couple<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.619> cross<00:01:58.829> members<00:01:59.960> down<00:02:00.960> at

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
then a couple of cross members down at

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.139 
then a couple of cross members down at
this<00:02:02.070> height<00:02:02.310> here<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.990> I'll<00:02:03.990> go<00:02:04.229> crossing

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
this height here and I'll go crossing

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.960 
this height here and I'll go crossing
across<00:02:06.149> here<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.110> few<00:02:07.290> spots<00:02:07.789> which<00:02:08.789> will

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
across here in a few spots which will

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.390 
across here in a few spots which will
form<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.300> floor<00:02:09.860> there'll<00:02:10.860> be<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.979> cavity

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
form the floor there'll be a cavity

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.900 
form the floor there'll be a cavity
underneath<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.970> that's<00:02:12.180> about<00:02:12.450> four

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
underneath it that's about four

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.070 
underneath it that's about four
Mill<00:02:13.300> high<00:02:14.010> for<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.100> floor<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.870> then<00:02:16.870> we'll

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
Mill high for the floor and then we'll

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.630 
Mill high for the floor and then we'll
frame<00:02:17.320> around<00:02:17.500> all<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.980> sides<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.580> that

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
frame around all the sides of that

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.320 
frame around all the sides of that
section<00:02:19.180> there<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:19.720> basically<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:20.880> part<00:02:21.880> the

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
section there so basically that part the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.200 
section there so basically that part the
whole<00:02:22.510> width<00:02:22.690> will<00:02:23.620> be<00:02:23.650> in<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.550> indoor<00:02:24.910> coupe

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
whole width will be in the indoor coupe

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.080 
whole width will be in the indoor coupe
but<00:02:25.890> i'll<00:02:26.890> just<00:02:27.130> put<00:02:27.280> ply<00:02:27.520> around<00:02:27.910> that

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
but i'll just put ply around that

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.610 
but i'll just put ply around that
probably<00:02:28.420> also<00:02:28.570> from<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.870> dump<00:02:29.170> shop<00:02:29.410> and

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
probably also from the dump shop and

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.260 
probably also from the dump shop and
then<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.580> corrugated<00:02:31.480> iron<00:02:31.720> tin<00:02:32.590> roof<00:02:33.030> on<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.060> bit

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
then a corrugated iron tin roof on a bit

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.940 
then a corrugated iron tin roof on a bit
of<00:02:34.360> a<00:02:34.450> slope<00:02:34.720> is<00:02:34.930> only<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.230> real<00:02:35.440> slight<00:02:35.740> angle

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
of a slope is only a real slight angle

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.260 
of a slope is only a real slight angle
there<00:02:36.220> but<00:02:36.370> just<00:02:36.490> enough<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.850> make<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.120> water

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
there but just enough to make the water

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.170 
there but just enough to make the water
runoff<00:02:37.540> away<00:02:38.440> from<00:02:38.740> the<00:02:38.860> chicken<00:02:39.130> kit<00:02:39.280> and

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
runoff away from the chicken kit and

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.730 
runoff away from the chicken kit and
then<00:02:40.840> everything<00:02:41.050> else<00:02:41.200> will<00:02:41.320> be<00:02:41.410> chicken

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
then everything else will be chicken

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.510 
then everything else will be chicken
wire<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.600> we<00:02:43.600> have<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:44.230> fair<00:02:44.620> few<00:02:44.800> foxes<00:02:45.220> around

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
wire and we have a fair few foxes around

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.720 
wire and we have a fair few foxes around
here<00:02:45.730> so<00:02:46.320> what<00:02:47.320> I'll<00:02:47.440> do<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:47.680> put<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.370> chicken

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
here so what I'll do is put the chicken

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.100 
here so what I'll do is put the chicken
wire<00:02:48.910> over<00:02:49.360> it<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:51.220> then<00:02:52.030> I've<00:02:52.780> heard<00:02:52.930> of<00:02:53.050> an

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
wire over it and then I've heard of an

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.710 
wire over it and then I've heard of an
idea<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:53.620> bring<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:53.920> chicken<00:02:54.100> wire<00:02:54.370> out<00:02:54.720> from

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
idea you bring the chicken wire out from

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.040 
idea you bring the chicken wire out from
the<00:02:55.840> edge<00:02:57.090> just<00:02:58.090> leave<00:02:58.240> the<00:02:58.360> trailer<00:02:58.660> on<00:02:58.960> the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
the edge just leave the trailer on the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.450 
the edge just leave the trailer on the
sides<00:02:59.260> bringing<00:02:59.590> out<00:02:59.710> about<00:02:59.920> 30<00:03:00.220> centimeters

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
sides bringing out about 30 centimeters

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.290 
sides bringing out about 30 centimeters
and<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:02.190> means<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.430> Foxes<00:03:03.820> then<00:03:04.000> can't

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
and that means that the Foxes then can't

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.960 
and that means that the Foxes then can't
dig<00:03:04.540> down<00:03:05.250> at<00:03:06.250> least<00:03:06.400> we're<00:03:06.580> going<00:03:06.670> to<00:03:06.760> trial

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
dig down at least we're going to trial

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.730 
dig down at least we're going to trial
it<00:03:07.150> see<00:03:07.480> what<00:03:07.600> happens<00:03:07.900> that<00:03:08.320> way<00:03:08.410> they<00:03:08.530> can't

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
it see what happens that way they can't

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.830 
it see what happens that way they can't
get<00:03:08.920> in<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.190> they<00:03:09.250> can't<00:03:09.490> dig<00:03:09.670> under<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.690> get

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
get in and they can't dig under to get

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.080 
get in and they can't dig under to get
the<00:03:10.930> chickens<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:12.070> we'll<00:03:12.610> probably<00:03:12.790> put<00:03:13.030> a

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
the chickens and we'll probably put a

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.380 
the chickens and we'll probably put a
door<00:03:13.390> in<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:14.200> end<00:03:14.350> of<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.650> here<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:16.150> that<00:03:16.300> we

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
door in the end of it here so that we

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.290 
door in the end of it here so that we
can<00:03:16.570> get<00:03:16.720> in<00:03:17.430> haven't<00:03:18.430> decided<00:03:18.490> exactly<00:03:18.880> where

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
can get in haven't decided exactly where

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.190 
can get in haven't decided exactly where
I<00:03:19.330> put<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:19.690> yet<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:21.690> I'm<00:03:22.690> going<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:22.959> make<00:03:23.080> it

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
I put it yet and I'm going to make it

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.120 
I put it yet and I'm going to make it
mobile<00:03:23.760> be<00:03:24.760> able<00:03:24.910> to<00:03:24.970> lift<00:03:25.120> it<00:03:25.350> with<00:03:26.350> two<00:03:26.980> or

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
mobile be able to lift it with two or

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.470 
mobile be able to lift it with two or
three<00:03:27.310> blokes<00:03:27.690> but<00:03:28.690> my<00:03:28.870> intention<00:03:29.410> will<00:03:30.130> be<00:03:30.160> to

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
three blokes but my intention will be to

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.690 
three blokes but my intention will be to
put<00:03:31.480> some<00:03:31.660> sort<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:31.959> a<00:03:32.050> brackets<00:03:32.470> on<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.220> back

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
put some sort of a brackets on the back

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.750 
put some sort of a brackets on the back
on<00:03:33.940> either<00:03:34.090> side<00:03:34.420> here<00:03:34.780> on<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.320> bottom<00:03:35.590> and

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
on either side here on the bottom and

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.130 
on either side here on the bottom and
then<00:03:37.080> I'll<00:03:38.080> make<00:03:38.430> too<00:03:39.430> short<00:03:39.910> axel<00:03:40.810> steel

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
then I'll make too short axel steel

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.170 
then I'll make too short axel steel
axles<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:41.739> quit<00:03:41.950> just<00:03:42.160> wheelbarrow<00:03:42.940> wheels

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
axles and quit just wheelbarrow wheels

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.330 
axles and quit just wheelbarrow wheels
on<00:03:43.420> them<00:03:43.510> so<00:03:44.380> then<00:03:44.560> when<00:03:44.739> you<00:03:44.860> want<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.130> shift

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
on them so then when you want to shift

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.780 
on them so then when you want to shift
it<00:03:45.580> all<00:03:46.300> you'll<00:03:46.450> have<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.630> do<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:47.520> come<00:03:48.520> over

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
it all you'll have to do is come over

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.140 
it all you'll have to do is come over
and<00:03:49.570> lift<00:03:49.900> this<00:03:50.080> corner<00:03:50.470> here<00:03:50.880> enough<00:03:51.880> to<00:03:52.060> be

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
and lift this corner here enough to be

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.150 
and lift this corner here enough to be
able<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.360> slide<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.750> axle<00:03:53.170> into<00:03:53.830> the<00:03:53.950> little

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
able to slide the axle into the little

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.920 
able to slide the axle into the little
brackets<00:03:54.550> that'll<00:03:54.730> be<00:03:54.880> in<00:03:54.970> there<00:03:55.150> and<00:03:55.330> then

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
brackets that'll be in there and then

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.240 
brackets that'll be in there and then
you<00:03:56.050> will<00:03:56.230> will<00:03:56.530> sit<00:03:56.739> right<00:03:56.920> here<00:03:58.080> so<00:03:59.080> we'll<00:04:00.010> be

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
you will will sit right here so we'll be

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.670 
you will will sit right here so we'll be
there<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.670> then<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.330> idea<00:04:01.530> another<00:04:02.530> one<00:04:02.650> on

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
there and then the idea another one on

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.850 
there and then the idea another one on
the<00:04:02.800> other<00:04:02.860> side<00:04:03.190> and<00:04:03.550> then<00:04:04.680> you'll<00:04:05.680> be<00:04:05.770> able

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
the other side and then you'll be able

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.120 
the other side and then you'll be able
to<00:04:05.980> pick<00:04:06.070> it<00:04:06.190> up<00:04:06.250> from<00:04:06.430> this<00:04:06.580> side<00:04:06.850> and

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
to pick it up from this side and

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.440 
to pick it up from this side and
basically<00:04:09.130> just<00:04:09.400> drag<00:04:09.730> it<00:04:09.760> leave<00:04:10.330> the

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
basically just drag it leave the

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.740 
basically just drag it leave the
chickens<00:04:10.810> in<00:04:10.989> there<00:04:11.140> they'll<00:04:12.420> quite<00:04:13.420> happily

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
chickens in there they'll quite happily

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.810 
chickens in there they'll quite happily
move<00:04:14.410> along<00:04:14.650> when<00:04:14.860> they<00:04:14.980> discover<00:04:15.370> that<00:04:15.610> their

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
move along when they discover that their

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.890 
move along when they discover that their
home<00:04:15.940> is<00:04:16.000> moving<00:04:16.859> that<00:04:17.859> way<00:04:18.040> you<00:04:18.100> can<00:04:18.900> allow

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
home is moving that way you can allow

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.090 
home is moving that way you can allow
the<00:04:19.959> chickens<00:04:20.440> to<00:04:20.950> move<00:04:21.190> whenever<00:04:22.180> they<00:04:22.479> start

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
the chickens to move whenever they start

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.780 
the chickens to move whenever they start
getting<00:04:24.100> the<00:04:24.310> grass<00:04:24.550> down

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
getting the grass down

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.310 
getting the grass down
and<00:04:25.880> that<00:04:26.090> way<00:04:26.210> you're<00:04:26.540> spreading<00:04:26.870> mulch<00:04:27.080> as

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
and that way you're spreading mulch as

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.060 
and that way you're spreading mulch as
well<00:04:27.500> and<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:28.700> intention<00:04:29.120> being<00:04:29.330> that<00:04:30.070> the

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
well and the intention being that the

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.070 
well and the intention being that the
chickens<00:04:31.430> will<00:04:31.580> slowly<00:04:31.850> move<00:04:32.240> around<00:04:32.840> the

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
chickens will slowly move around the

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.150 
chickens will slowly move around the
entire<00:04:33.440> yard<00:04:34.750> they<00:04:35.750> will<00:04:35.990> be<00:04:36.170> leaving<00:04:36.710> manure

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
entire yard they will be leaving manure

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.570 
entire yard they will be leaving manure
behind<00:04:37.520> and<00:04:38.800> digging<00:04:39.800> out<00:04:39.950> all<00:04:40.130> of<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.340> grass

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
behind and digging out all of the grass

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.150 
behind and digging out all of the grass
and<00:04:40.910> all<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.720> weeds<00:04:41.930> for<00:04:42.230> us<00:04:42.380> then<00:04:42.620> as<00:04:42.800> we<00:04:42.950> move

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
and all the weeds for us then as we move

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.130 
and all the weeds for us then as we move
them<00:04:43.340> on<00:04:43.550> and<00:04:44.270> we'll<00:04:44.300> be<00:04:44.660> able<00:04:44.750> to<00:04:44.870> sheet

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
them on and we'll be able to sheet

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.640 
them on and we'll be able to sheet
underneath<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:47.020> where<00:04:48.020> the<00:04:48.110> chickens<00:04:48.440> were

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
underneath the where the chickens were

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.340 
underneath the where the chickens were
previously<00:04:49.250> I<00:04:49.570> lay<00:04:50.570> down<00:04:50.630> cardboard<00:04:51.230> on

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
previously I lay down cardboard on

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.730 
previously I lay down cardboard on
newspaper<00:04:51.770> and<00:04:52.180> slowly<00:04:53.180> will<00:04:53.510> turn<00:04:53.780> a<00:04:54.050> lot<00:04:54.620> of

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
newspaper and slowly will turn a lot of

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.220 
newspaper and slowly will turn a lot of
the<00:04:54.800> yard<00:04:55.040> into<00:04:55.490> a<00:04:55.520> food<00:04:55.790> forest<00:04:56.110> released<00:04:57.110> a

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
the yard into a food forest released a

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.700 
the yard into a food forest released a
mulch<00:04:57.440> tarea<00:04:57.890> ready<00:04:58.100> for<00:04:58.310> a<00:04:58.370> food<00:04:58.550> first<00:04:58.790> and

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
mulch tarea ready for a food first and

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.230 
mulch tarea ready for a food first and
then<00:05:00.710> we<00:05:00.890> will<00:05:00.920> have<00:05:01.220> a<00:05:01.250> smaller<00:05:01.640> area<00:05:01.940> where

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
then we will have a smaller area where

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.320 
then we will have a smaller area where
the<00:05:02.390> chickens<00:05:02.720> will<00:05:03.940> permanently<00:05:04.940> living

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
the chickens will permanently living

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.970 
the chickens will permanently living
will<00:05:05.540> just<00:05:05.720> move<00:05:05.900> them<00:05:06.050> around<00:05:06.200> inside<00:05:06.710> that

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
will just move them around inside that

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.100 
will just move them around inside that
area<00:05:07.990> that's<00:05:08.990> our<00:05:09.200> intention<00:05:10.900> it's<00:05:11.900> probably

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
area that's our intention it's probably

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.510 
area that's our intention it's probably
going<00:05:12.230> to<00:05:12.320> be<00:05:12.380> a<00:05:12.440> couple<00:05:12.740> of<00:05:12.800> weeks<00:05:12.890> now<00:05:13.160> before

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
going to be a couple of weeks now before
