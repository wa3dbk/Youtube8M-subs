free-for-all<00:02:09.670> leaderboards<00:02:10.360> of<00:02:10.569> everyone

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019

all<00:02:11.200> time<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:11.860> just<00:02:12.489> looking<00:02:12.909> through<00:02:13.120> there

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
all time and just looking through there

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.450 
all time and just looking through there
and<00:02:13.480> I<00:02:14.200> think<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.770> first<00:02:14.980> person<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.340> saw<00:02:15.550> was

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.730 
and I think the first person I saw was
sandy<00:02:17.240> ravaged<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:18.050> was<00:02:18.200> on<00:02:18.320> top<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:18.590> the

sandy ravaged it was on top of the
free-for-all<00:02:19.640> leaderboards<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.270> then<00:02:20.420> below

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
free-for-all leaderboards and then below

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.080 
free-for-all leaderboards and then below
