00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.990 
friends we pushed each other and kidded
each<00:05:09.940> other<00:05:11.100> and<00:05:12.100> I<00:05:12.190> think<00:05:12.280> the<00:05:12.490> biggest<00:05:12.760> thing

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
each other and I think the biggest thing

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.730 
each other and I think the biggest thing
of<00:05:13.120> all<00:05:13.240> we<00:05:13.480> were<00:05:13.570> unselfish<00:05:14.170> with<00:05:14.350> each<00:05:14.500> other

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
of all we were unselfish with each other

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.010 
of all we were unselfish with each other
you<00:05:15.400> know<00:05:15.490> he<00:05:15.670> didn't<00:05:15.910> care<00:05:16.090> if<00:05:16.120> I<00:05:16.330> scored<00:05:16.720> I

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
you know he didn't care if I scored I

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.170 
you know he didn't care if I scored I
know<00:05:17.560> I<00:05:17.740> didn't<00:05:18.100> care<00:05:18.280> if<00:05:18.310> he<00:05:18.400> scored<00:05:18.820> I<00:05:18.910> felt

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
know I didn't care if he scored I felt

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.360 
know I didn't care if he scored I felt
like<00:05:19.330> when<00:05:19.870> he<00:05:19.990> scored<00:05:20.290> I<00:05:20.410> was<00:05:20.590> born<00:05:20.890> and<00:05:21.190> I

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
like when he scored I was born and I

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.490 
like when he scored I was born and I
know<00:05:21.430> he<00:05:21.700> had<00:05:21.820> that<00:05:21.850> same<00:05:22.150> feeling<00:05:22.510> for<00:05:22.690> me<00:05:22.870> so

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
know he had that same feeling for me so

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.260 
know he had that same feeling for me so
I<00:05:23.530> think<00:05:23.650> our<00:05:23.920> unselfishness<00:05:24.490> towards<00:05:25.120> each

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
I think our unselfishness towards each

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.080 
I think our unselfishness towards each
other<00:05:25.450> was<00:05:25.690> a<00:05:25.720> huge<00:05:26.170> part<00:05:26.500> of<00:05:26.590> our<00:05:26.710> success<00:05:27.090> and

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
other was a huge part of our success and

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.870 
other was a huge part of our success and
I<00:05:28.720> think<00:05:29.320> we<00:05:29.680> love<00:05:29.860> to<00:05:30.040> win<00:05:30.220> we<00:05:30.460> can<00:05:30.640> forget

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
I think we love to win we can forget

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.520 
I think we love to win we can forget
