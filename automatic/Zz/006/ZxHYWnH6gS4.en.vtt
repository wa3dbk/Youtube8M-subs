today after prejudging when he walked
out<00:02:20.579> you<00:02:21.120> know<00:02:21.180> he<00:02:21.239> was<00:02:21.329> a<00:02:21.420> little<00:02:21.599> bit<00:02:21.689> light

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
out you know he was a little bit light

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
on color in oil i thought he could have

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:24.709 
on color in oil i thought he could have
been<00:02:23.939> a<00:02:23.969> little<00:02:24.120> bit<00:02:24.329> better<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.599> those

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:24.719 
been a little bit better in those

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:25.970 
been a little bit better in those
departments<00:02:24.930> but<00:02:25.349> when<00:02:25.469> he<00:02:25.560> walked<00:02:25.739> out<00:02:25.950> my

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
departments but when he walked out my

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.649 
departments but when he walked out my
first<00:02:26.459> thought<00:02:26.670> was<00:02:26.819> this<00:02:26.879> guy<00:02:27.120> is<00:02:27.180> off<00:02:27.420> he

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
first thought was this guy is off he

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.839 
first thought was this guy is off he
came<00:02:27.840> out<00:02:28.049> started<00:02:28.799> hitting<00:02:29.010> poses<00:02:29.430> as<00:02:29.579> soon

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
came out started hitting poses as soon

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.130 
came out started hitting poses as soon
as<00:02:29.970> he<00:02:30.090> started<00:02:30.359> hitting<00:02:30.480> pose<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.930> was<00:02:31.019> like<00:02:31.109> I

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
as he started hitting pose it was like I

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.259 
as he started hitting pose it was like I
never<00:02:31.439> mind<00:02:31.709> he's<00:02:31.950> not<00:02:31.980> off<00:02:32.340> now<00:02:32.879> I<00:02:32.909> don't

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
never mind he's not off now I don't

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.910 
never mind he's not off now I don't
think<00:02:33.599> he<00:02:33.720> was<00:02:33.810> at<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:33.989> hundred<00:02:34.230> percent<00:02:34.470> though

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
think he was at a hundred percent though

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.259 
think he was at a hundred percent though
you<00:02:35.189> know<00:02:35.280> he's<00:02:35.459> definitely<00:02:35.640> gonna<00:02:36.000> have<00:02:36.120> to

said did and I think that was close
enough<00:03:00.780> for<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.139> judges<00:03:01.290> may<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.769> made<00:03:01.889> a

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
enough for the judges may have made a

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.099

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
i think it was second year but an

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.270 
i think it was second year but an
impressive<00:03:43.229> fourth-place<00:03:43.650> finish<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.099> looks
