00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.190
 hi everybody i 'm making a video about the maincraft 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.820
 pi 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.900
 and today I will show you two mechanisms 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:19.350
 one year more precisely even we will show with my 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:26.849
 friend flush that's the usual mine 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:31.250
 imitated one mechanism now i will show 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:35.579
 camera side here flash came 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:40.920
 let him go on like the other trap here 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:46.200
 the second trap in the dew cane here such 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:01:01.949
 here's the edition we all go now to the army 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:01:04.559
 everything will usually show you can see everything here 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.970
 ordinary major leads dripping mine saw 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.820
 gold broke and it falls beneath it 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.600
 burns fly 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.280
 now we will show how they first he 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.850
 put out and we now show the second 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.850
 a spoon 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.200
 follow me flash 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.399
 here we come 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.359
 comes in now we also pretend you can 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.640
 was watching but the usual dude fell off 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:47.069
 so i could gladly collect 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:53.750
 reed well thats catch it falls sand 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:53.750
 and it begins to shed all words 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:06.450
 it takes off will do well and pass Unit 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:09.649
 sho you all now we will show you how 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.649
 make the first spoon 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.500
 look first we'll take this away 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:34.290
 it's a fairly easy trap for her 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:37.290
 little material is necessary because there 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:42.930
 is being spent on teacher plates here's why we 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:52.380
 it is necessary to dig a hole 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:56.069
 letters it can be done 4 here here 5 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:02.430
 blocks him here 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:06.480
 having thought five magi do the supreme here 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.450
 we make six blocks like this 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:20.130
 some act well here look this 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:23.310
 it turns out even without a lounge clock here 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.860
 leave the bottom of the pokeball because 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.910
 it turns out that if we put for example 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.120
 gravel 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:38.240
 and who does not disappear here he has already set 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:44.100
 This place where we do not take signs 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:50.420
 just across the length can still 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:58.680
 we can not everywhere he is more green 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:04:07.160
 feel the area ideal imitation 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:07.160
 it 's like 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:29.880
 now just take any bow for example 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:35.320
 the forest is more precisely its iron ores 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:45.790
 and I started like this right on top of me 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:51.430
 tablets that's all that's left so I do not 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:56.130
 this so as not to fall falls still thought 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:59.670
 all now we will show how to do the second 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:04.860
 trap and and show and clean 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:15.790
 will be because I got 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:18.780
 see let's open it this even 5 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.780
 bear cubes 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:35.380
 and for example at least how much height you can 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:35.380
 do striboga to take him that he 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:46.660
 begins we put some water gone grew 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:06:16.389
 mice 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:06:16.389
 reed so I write the letter so here as 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.530
 from any block we can do 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:07:17.100
 whether it is enough to be a top 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:23.680
 empty and the body is generally visible here no 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:29.490
 we break the same and everything fights well personal 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:32.979
 clicks all right all good luck all bye 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:36.510
 hi everybody i 'm making a video about the maincraft 

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:36.510
 I will show you today
