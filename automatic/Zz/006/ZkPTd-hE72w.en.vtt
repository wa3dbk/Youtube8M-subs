00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
transform right now see that's what it

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.840 
transform right now see that's what it
looks<00:00:39.090> like<00:00:39.270> he's<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> green<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.260> bluish<00:00:40.530> color

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
because of the green for the weapons it

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.850 
because of the green for the weapons it
was<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> X<00:00:48.090> 18<00:00:48.450> scrapped<00:00:48.809> maker<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:50.059> with<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
was the X 18 scrapped maker and with the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.189 
was the X 18 scrapped maker and with the
cyber<00:00:52.860> optics<00:00:53.309> which<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:54.000> really<00:00:54.449> useful<00:00:54.930> as

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
cyber optics which is really useful as

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.619 
cyber optics which is really useful as
the<00:00:55.590> xxx<00:00:56.370> grant<00:00:56.760> maker<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.180> not<00:00:57.390> very

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
the xxx grant maker it's not very

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.319 
the xxx grant maker it's not very
accurate<00:00:57.780> or<00:00:58.219> so<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.250> rocked<00:00:59.550> its<00:00:59.699> really<00:01:00.149> make

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
accurate or so I rocked its really make

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.229 
accurate or so I rocked its really make
it<00:01:00.480> really<00:01:00.989> good<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.219> really<00:01:02.489> good

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.200 
it really good so you can really good
good<00:01:03.390> accuracy<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.229> good<00:01:04.530> power<00:01:05.119> for<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
good accuracy and good power for the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.170 
good accuracy and good power for the
engine<00:01:06.450> hard<00:01:06.689> stuff<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:09.170> repot<00:01:10.170> cuz

engine hard stuff I have the repot cuz

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.000 
engine hard stuff I have the repot cuz
Titans<00:01:12.180> get<00:01:12.299> shot<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> lot<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.260> your<00:01:13.770> health

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
need some help so really use this next

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.600 
need some help so really use this next
type<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.380> flak<00:01:19.710> shield<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.159> used<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
type of flak shield I used to have the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.219 
type of flak shield I used to have the
well<00:01:20.820> wind<00:01:21.090> but<00:01:21.540> then<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:21.900> got<00:01:22.200> very

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
well wind but then it just got very

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:22.880 
well wind but then it just got very
useless

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
useless

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.410 
useless
so<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> flak<00:01:23.549> shell<00:01:23.790> was<00:01:23.909> really<00:01:24.119> better<00:01:24.299> to

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
so the flak shell was really better to

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.749 
so the flak shell was really better to
shield<00:01:24.960> Duncan<00:01:25.350> from<00:01:25.710> oncoming<00:01:26.070> fire<00:01:26.369> as<00:01:26.580> your

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
shield Duncan from oncoming fire as your

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.270 
shield Duncan from oncoming fire as your
are<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> massive<00:01:27.750> target<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:29.070> you're<00:01:29.189> the

are a massive target and you're the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.030 
are a massive target and you're the

I<00:02:04.990> really<00:02:05.990> like<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.229> perceptive

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
I really like the perceptive

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.249 
I really like the perceptive
transformation<00:02:07.479> really<00:02:08.479> really<00:02:08.959> is<00:02:09.050> really

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
transformation really really is really

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.320 
transformation really really is really
cool<00:02:09.560> wid<00:02:10.280> doesn't<00:02:10.550> only<00:02:10.670> tracks<00:02:10.970> well<00:02:11.209> that

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
cool wid doesn't only tracks well that

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.479
