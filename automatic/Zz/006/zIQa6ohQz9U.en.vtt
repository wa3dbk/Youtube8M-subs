mostly clean I'm not getting crazy I'm
not<00:03:58.590> polishing<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.190> case<00:03:59.400> but<00:04:00.180> i<00:04:00.300> am<00:04:00.390> going<00:04:00.510> to

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
not polishing the case but i am going to

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.800 
not polishing the case but i am going to
degrease<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:02.450> this<00:04:03.450> is<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:04.160> fill<00:04:05.160> cap<00:04:05.690> which<00:04:06.690> I

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
degrease it this is the fill cap which I

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.360 
degrease it this is the fill cap which I
have<00:04:06.959> no<00:04:07.080> idea<00:04:07.230> how<00:04:07.470> much<00:04:07.680> goes<00:04:07.890> in<00:04:08.070> there<00:04:08.190> but

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
have no idea how much goes in there but

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.100 
have no idea how much goes in there but
I'm<00:04:08.489> assuming<00:04:08.610> here's<00:04:09.390> what<00:04:09.570> I'm<00:04:09.660> assuming

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
I'm assuming here's what I'm assuming

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.530 
I'm assuming here's what I'm assuming
because<00:04:10.290> I<00:04:10.500> just<00:04:10.709> topped<00:04:10.920> it<00:04:11.070> off<00:04:11.390> that<00:04:12.390> when

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
because I just topped it off that when

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.539 
because I just topped it off that when
it's<00:04:12.690> in<00:04:12.810> its<00:04:12.959> normal<00:04:13.230> position<00:04:13.890> which<00:04:14.400> is

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
it's in its normal position which is

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.330 
it's in its normal position which is
like<00:04:14.670> this<00:04:15.290> but<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.440> girl<00:04:16.650> should<00:04:17.070> be<00:04:17.100> right

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
like this but the girl should be right

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.240 
like this but the girl should be right
about<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:17.790> edge<00:04:17.970> of<00:04:18.150> these<00:04:18.329> threads<00:04:19.250> which

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
about to the edge of these threads which

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.890

makes<00:04:20.579> it<00:04:20.729> kind<00:04:21.060> of<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.209> bottom<00:04:21.510> quarter

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
makes it kind of the bottom quarter
