00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
there's a little bit of a tilt basically

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.340 
there's a little bit of a tilt basically
and<00:01:32.970> tighten<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:34.369> okay<00:01:37.280> okay<00:01:39.110> now<00:01:40.110> what

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
and tighten this okay okay now what

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.830 
and tighten this okay okay now what
we're<00:01:40.470> gonna<00:01:40.560> do<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:41.460> we're<00:01:41.670> gonna<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.909> only

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
we're gonna do is we're gonna be only

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.260 
we're gonna do is we're gonna be only
adjusting<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.950> piece<00:01:44.220> right<00:01:44.460> here<00:01:44.790> and

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
adjusting this piece right here and

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.940 
adjusting this piece right here and
we're<00:01:45.390> going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.570> be<00:01:45.770> changing<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
we're going to be changing the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.190 
we're going to be changing the
relationship<00:01:47.310> between<00:01:47.970> these<00:01:48.479> parts<00:01:48.990> and

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
relationship between these parts and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.800 
relationship between these parts and
that's<00:01:49.799> how<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.670> determine<00:01:51.090> that's<00:01:51.570> how<00:01:51.720> you

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
that's how you determine that's how you

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.389 
that's how you determine that's how you
point<00:01:52.200> out<00:01:52.320> where<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.710> pedal<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.220> going<00:01:53.340> to

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
point out where the pedal is going to

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.370 
point out where the pedal is going to
bottom<00:01:53.700> out<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.030> make<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.600> make<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.229> bass

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
bottom out and make the make the bass

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.740 
bottom out and make the make the bass
drum<00:01:55.649> hit<00:01:55.829> okay<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:56.820> what<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.180> do<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.540> take

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
drum hit okay so what you do is you take

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.539 
drum hit okay so what you do is you take
your<00:01:57.840> hand<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.170> put<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:58.920> piece<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.399> it

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
your hand and put it on this piece so it

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.660 
your hand and put it on this piece so it
cannot<00:01:59.850> move<00:02:00.350> take<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.590> key<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.159> use<00:02:02.399> this

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
cannot move take the key and use this

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.130 
cannot move take the key and use this
piece<00:02:02.939> there<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.329> two<00:02:03.509> pieces<00:02:03.719> here<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.020> are

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
piece there is two pieces here that are

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.139 
piece there is two pieces here that are
confusing<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.829> still<00:02:05.219> do<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.460> I've<00:02:05.549> done<00:02:05.729> dozens

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
confusing I still do it I've done dozens

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.940 
confusing I still do it I've done dozens
and<00:02:06.270> dozens<00:02:06.329> for<00:02:06.689> these<00:02:06.810> pedals<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.560> not<00:02:07.710> do

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
and dozens for these pedals do not do

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.499 
and dozens for these pedals do not do
this<00:02:08.069> one<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:08.640> not<00:02:08.700> gonna<00:02:08.940> hurt<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.330> just

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
this one it's not gonna hurt it just

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
out when this rubber piece hits this

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.080 
out when this rubber piece hits this
metal<00:02:48.959> bar<00:02:49.140> that's<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.310> point<00:02:50.459> of<00:02:50.610> contact

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
metal bar that's the point of contact

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.790 
metal bar that's the point of contact
that<00:02:51.180> stops<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.959> pedal<00:02:52.230> from<00:02:52.320> going<00:02:52.650> down

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
that stops the pedal from going down

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.860 
that stops the pedal from going down
that's<00:02:53.040> where<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.280> pedal<00:02:53.580> bottoms<00:02:54.030> out<00:02:54.180> what

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
that's where the pedal bottoms out what

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.080 
that's where the pedal bottoms out what
we<00:02:55.140> want<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.500> do<00:02:55.800> is<00:02:56.280> we<00:02:56.640> want<00:02:56.820> to<00:02:56.880> make<00:02:57.030> sure

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
we want to do is we want to make sure

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.960 
we want to do is we want to make sure
the<00:02:57.420> pedal<00:02:57.810> hits<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.620> bass<00:02:58.860> drum<00:02:59.280> just<00:02:59.850> a

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
the pedal hits the bass drum just a

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.140 
the pedal hits the bass drum just a
split<00:03:00.800> second<00:03:01.800> before<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.550> rubber<00:03:02.880> piece

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
split second before that rubber piece

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.630 
split second before that rubber piece
hits<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.630> pet<00:03:03.930> metal<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.800> pedal<00:03:05.250> bottoms

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
hits the pet metal and the pedal bottoms

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.220 
hits the pet metal and the pedal bottoms
out<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:06.840> what<00:03:07.260> we<00:03:07.380> do<00:03:07.590> is<00:03:08.570> we<00:03:09.570> use<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:09.930> same

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
out so what we do is we use that same

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.690 
out so what we do is we use that same
adjustment<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.709> we<00:03:10.800> were<00:03:10.860> using<00:03:11.070> just<00:03:11.220> now<00:03:11.459> I

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
adjustment that we were using just now I

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.590 
adjustment that we were using just now I
know<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:11.910> can't<00:03:12.090> see<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.330> but<00:03:12.420> it's<00:03:12.540> the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
know you can't see that but it's the

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.090 
know you can't see that but it's the
same<00:03:12.780> one<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.050> one<00:03:13.140> closer<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.560> pedal<00:03:13.830> and

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
same one the one closer to the pedal and

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.920 
same one the one closer to the pedal and
we<00:03:14.370> guess<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.790> check<00:03:14.820> right<00:03:15.120> now<00:03:15.300> what's

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
we guess and check right now what's

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.120 
we guess and check right now what's
going<00:03:16.170> on<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:16.350> it's<00:03:16.500> hitting<00:03:16.650> way<00:03:16.860> too<00:03:16.920> early

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
going on is it's hitting way too early

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.520 
going on is it's hitting way too early
that<00:03:17.910> tells<00:03:18.239> me<00:03:18.450> I<00:03:18.480> want<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.900> move<00:03:19.080> this<00:03:19.290> up

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
that tells me I want to move this up

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.830 
that tells me I want to move this up
this<00:03:20.130> way<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:20.820> need<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.030> put<00:03:21.269> my<00:03:21.420> hand<00:03:21.690> on

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
this way so I need to put my hand on

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.449 
this way so I need to put my hand on
this<00:03:21.959> piece<00:03:22.200> again<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.799> doesn't<00:03:23.160> move<00:03:23.280> and

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
this piece again so it doesn't move and

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.880 
this piece again so it doesn't move and
I'm<00:03:23.610> changing<00:03:23.880> only<00:03:24.420> this<00:03:24.660> piece<00:03:24.989> put<00:03:25.560> my<00:03:25.680> hand

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
I'm changing only this piece put my hand

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.910 
I'm changing only this piece put my hand
on<00:03:26.010> this<00:03:26.130> piece<00:03:26.400> loosen<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.450> bolt<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.930> raise

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
on this piece loosen the bolt and raise

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.259 
on this piece loosen the bolt and raise
it<00:03:29.100> again<00:03:29.280> we're<00:03:29.430> going<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.580> do<00:03:29.670> another<00:03:29.970> guess

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
it again we're going to do another guess

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.539 
it again we're going to do another guess
and<00:03:30.450> check<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.690> just<00:03:30.840> see<00:03:31.049> where<00:03:31.200> we<00:03:31.290> are<00:03:31.549> okay

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
and check and just see where we are okay

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.430 
and check and just see where we are okay
we're<00:03:32.790> still<00:03:33.000> going<00:03:33.299> way<00:03:33.540> too<00:03:33.600> early<00:03:33.870> now<00:03:34.290> on

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
we're still going way too early now on

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.789 
we're still going way too early now on
the<00:03:34.560> side<00:03:34.769> what's<00:03:35.220> that<00:03:39.380> okay<00:03:40.380> so<00:03:40.590> we're<00:03:40.650> going

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
the side what's that okay so we're going

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:41.840 
the side what's that okay so we're going
to<00:03:40.860> do<00:03:40.950> that<00:03:41.100> one<00:03:41.220> time<00:03:41.370> we're<00:03:41.489> still<00:03:41.700> going

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
to do that one time we're still going

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.220 
to do that one time we're still going
way<00:03:42.030> too<00:03:42.090> early<00:03:42.239> somebody<00:03:42.660> guess<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.110> check

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
way too early somebody guess and check

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.900 
way too early somebody guess and check
again<00:03:43.470> I'm<00:03:43.560> going<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.769> loosen<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.430> I'm

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
again I'm going to loosen it and I'm

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:53.930 
again I'm going to loosen it and I'm
holding<00:03:45.150> this<00:03:45.390> don't<00:03:45.660> forget<00:03:52.730> we're<00:03:53.730> going<00:03:53.850> to

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
holding this don't forget we're going to

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.990 
holding this don't forget we're going to
guess<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.299> check<00:03:54.450> again<00:03:54.720> here

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
guess and check again here

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.699 
guess and check again here
okay<00:03:57.000> not<00:03:57.209> perfect<00:03:57.600> we<00:03:57.690> went<00:03:57.870> too<00:03:58.140> far<00:03:58.440> in<00:03:58.590> the

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
okay not perfect we went too far in the

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.440 
okay not perfect we went too far in the
other<00:03:58.739> direction<00:03:59.070> so<00:03:59.519> we<00:04:00.000> know<00:04:00.150> we're<00:04:00.299> on<00:04:00.330> the

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
other direction so we know we're on the

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.759 
other direction so we know we're on the
right<00:04:00.540> way<00:04:00.600> basically<00:04:01.049> what<00:04:01.200> happened<00:04:01.530> was<00:04:01.620> it

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
right way basically what happened was it

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.590 
right way basically what happened was it
hit<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.070> too<00:04:02.280> soon<00:04:02.580> before<00:04:02.790> so<00:04:03.209> we<00:04:03.330> knew<00:04:03.480> we<00:04:03.570> had

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
hit it too soon before so we knew we had

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.810 
hit it too soon before so we knew we had
to<00:04:03.750> go<00:04:03.900> that<00:04:04.170> way<00:04:04.380> now<00:04:04.830> we've<00:04:05.010> adjusted<00:04:05.130> and

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
to go that way now we've adjusted and

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.000 
to go that way now we've adjusted and
now<00:04:06.030> it's<00:04:06.209> bottoming<00:04:06.690> out<00:04:06.830> before<00:04:07.830> it's

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
now it's bottoming out before it's

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.229 
now it's bottoming out before it's
actually<00:04:08.160> hitting<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.670> sensor<00:04:08.880> so<00:04:09.090> now<00:04:09.180> we

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
actually hitting the sensor so now we

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.910 
actually hitting the sensor so now we
need<00:04:09.450> to<00:04:09.570> have<00:04:09.660> that<00:04:09.840> way<00:04:10.079> a<00:04:10.110> little<00:04:10.230> bit<00:04:10.380> so<00:04:10.590> we

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
need to have that way a little bit so we

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.380 
need to have that way a little bit so we
know<00:04:11.160> we're<00:04:11.340> in<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.670> range<00:04:11.910> we<00:04:12.150> know<00:04:12.239> we're

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
know we're in the range we know we're

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.610 
know we're in the range we know we're
kind<00:04:12.630> of<00:04:12.690> getting<00:04:12.870> close<00:04:13.019> to<00:04:13.140> eat<00:04:13.200> I'm<00:04:13.410> sorry

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
kind of getting close to eat I'm sorry

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.110 
kind of getting close to eat I'm sorry
I'm<00:04:13.709> doing<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:13.980> wrong<00:04:14.100> one<00:04:14.310> told<00:04:14.760> you

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
I'm doing the wrong one told you

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.750 
I'm doing the wrong one told you
so<00:04:15.690> you<00:04:15.780> loosen<00:04:16.140> this<00:04:16.169> up<00:04:16.290> and<00:04:16.650> just<00:04:16.739> lower<00:04:17.640> it

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
so you loosen this up and just lower it

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.770 
so you loosen this up and just lower it
a<00:04:17.850> very<00:04:18.269> little<00:04:18.540> bit<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:19.590> see<00:04:19.799> where<00:04:19.950> you<00:04:20.010> are

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
a very little bit and see where you are

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.240 
a very little bit and see where you are
once<00:04:21.780> again<00:04:21.900> we<00:04:22.200> did<00:04:22.320> go<00:04:22.470> down<00:04:22.500> quite<00:04:23.010> far

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
once again we did go down quite far

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.970 
once again we did go down quite far
enough<00:04:23.400> so<00:04:23.580> we're<00:04:23.669> going<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:23.820> loosen<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.210> again

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
enough so we're going to loosen it again

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.490 
enough so we're going to loosen it again
and<00:04:26.970> good<00:04:27.150> I<00:04:27.180> think<00:04:27.540> I<00:04:27.810> probably<00:04:27.930> did<00:04:28.170> it<00:04:28.290> too

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
and good I think I probably did it too

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.980 
and good I think I probably did it too
much<00:04:28.650> there<00:04:28.950> I<00:04:29.220> did<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:30.180> little<00:04:30.420> too<00:04:30.570> much<00:04:30.750> there

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.020 

boom<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.290> head<00:04:37.530> and<00:04:37.680> so<00:04:38.370> we<00:04:38.520> have<00:04:38.700> it<00:04:38.850> right

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
boom and head and so we have it right

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.070 
boom and head and so we have it right
now<00:04:39.270> it<00:04:39.840> is<00:04:40.310> hitting<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.520> bass<00:04:41.670> drum<00:04:42.080> sensor

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
now it is hitting the bass drum sensor

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.020 
now it is hitting the bass drum sensor
and<00:04:43.290> then<00:04:43.650> bottoming<00:04:44.130> out<00:04:44.220> which<00:04:44.400> is<00:04:44.490> exactly

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
and then bottoming out which is exactly

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.120 
and then bottoming out which is exactly
what<00:04:45.210> a<00:04:45.240> bit<00:04:45.450> what<00:04:45.660> we<00:04:45.750> want<00:04:45.930> to<00:04:45.990> do<00:04:46.110> okay<00:04:46.740> now

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
what a bit what we want to do okay now

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.670 
what a bit what we want to do okay now
you<00:04:47.790> have<00:04:47.820> it<00:04:48.090> adjusted<00:04:48.450> perfectly<00:04:48.660> that<00:04:49.440> way

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
you have it adjusted perfectly that way

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.310 
you have it adjusted perfectly that way
the<00:04:50.670> weight<00:04:50.850> what<00:04:51.120> we<00:04:51.240> did<00:04:51.390> is<00:04:51.570> we<00:04:51.600> changed<00:04:51.720> the

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
the weight what we did is we changed the

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.110 
the weight what we did is we changed the
relationship<00:04:52.590> of<00:04:53.100> these<00:04:53.280> parts<00:04:53.640> to<00:04:53.790> make<00:04:53.940> that

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
relationship of these parts to make that

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.970 
relationship of these parts to make that
habit<00:04:54.450> now<00:04:54.750> tighten<00:04:55.200> it<00:04:55.260> up<00:04:55.320> so<00:04:55.530> it<00:04:55.650> doesn't<00:04:55.680> go

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
habit now tighten it up so it doesn't go

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.950 
habit now tighten it up so it doesn't go
anywhere<00:04:56.190> and<00:04:56.490> now<00:04:56.820> based<00:04:57.150> on<00:04:57.300> your<00:04:57.480> comfort

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
anywhere and now based on your comfort
