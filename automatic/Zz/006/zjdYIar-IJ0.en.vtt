00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
accelerometer which works but I just

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.400 
accelerometer which works but I just
didn't<00:02:43.280> like<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.580> very<00:02:43.610> much<00:02:43.820> and<00:02:44.300> i<00:02:44.630> chose<00:02:45.170> the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
didn't like it very much and i chose the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.200
