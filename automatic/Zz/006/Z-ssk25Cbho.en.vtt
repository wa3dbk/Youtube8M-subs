army transport now let's take a look

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.969 
army transport now let's take a look
inside<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.229> fits<00:01:26.299> three<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.229> foam

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979

inside so it fits three of the foam
trays<00:01:29.430> wide<00:01:30.049> but<00:01:31.049> unfortunately<00:01:31.560> was<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
trays wide but unfortunately was a

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.090 
trays wide but unfortunately was a
little<00:01:31.950> bit<00:01:32.070> too<00:01:32.310> deep<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:32.880> i<00:01:32.939> had<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.210> create

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
little bit too deep so i had to create

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.920 
little bit too deep so i had to create
this<00:01:35.100> at<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> foam<00:01:35.790> core<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.390> kind<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.689> keep

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930
