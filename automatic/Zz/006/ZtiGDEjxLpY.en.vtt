in<00:00:01.589> this<00:00:01.829> video<00:00:02.159> we<00:00:02.669> will<00:00:02.850> apply<00:00:03.120> concepts

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
in this video we will apply concepts

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.869 
in this video we will apply concepts
from<00:00:03.990> computer<00:00:04.500> modeling<00:00:04.890> as<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.609> way<00:00:05.850> of

populations<00:00:18.090> change<00:00:18.449> over<00:00:18.750> time<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.320> this

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
populations change over time and this

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.120 
populations change over time and this

thinking about trend and wildlife

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.069 
thinking about trend and wildlife
populations<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.790> use<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.329> analogy<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
populations is to use the analogy of a

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.799 
populations is to use the analogy of a
bathtub<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:38.059> bathtub<00:00:39.059> can<00:00:39.300> be<00:00:39.450> filled<00:00:39.719> with

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
bathtub a bathtub can be filled with

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.530 
bathtub a bathtub can be filled with
water<00:00:40.200> from<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.469> tap<00:00:40.800> or<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.850> be<00:00:42.000> emptied<00:00:42.390> of

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
water from the tap or can be emptied of

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.229 
water from the tap or can be emptied of
water<00:00:42.780> through<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> drain<00:00:43.610> the<00:00:44.610> volume<00:00:45.030> of

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
water through a drain the volume of

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.930 
water through a drain the volume of
water<00:00:45.539> flowing<00:00:46.140> into<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.559> tub<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.070> controlled

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
water flowing into the tub is controlled

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.569 
water flowing into the tub is controlled
by<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.180> valve<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> tap<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.469> rate<00:00:50.370> at

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
by a valve on the tap and the rate at

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.939 
by a valve on the tap and the rate at
which<00:00:50.610> water<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.149> emptied<00:00:51.750> from<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> tub<00:00:52.289> is

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
which water is emptied from the tub is

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.020 
which water is emptied from the tub is
controlled<00:00:53.550> by<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.850> valve<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.660> drain<00:00:54.870> pipe

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
controlled by a valve on the drain pipe

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.330 
controlled by a valve on the drain pipe
so<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.210> analogy<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.870> wildlife<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.039> think

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
so the analogy to wildlife is to think

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.639 
so the analogy to wildlife is to think
of<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.760> amount<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.300> water<00:01:00.510> within<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.199> tub<00:01:01.440> as

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
of the amount of water within the tub as

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.359 
of the amount of water within the tub as
a<00:01:02.370> wildlife<00:01:02.850> population<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.650> context

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
a wildlife population so in this context

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.490 
a wildlife population so in this context
the<00:01:05.880> only<00:01:06.180> way<00:01:06.360> for<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> population<00:01:07.470> to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the only way for a population to

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
the only way for a population to
increase<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:08.340> through<00:01:09.210> births<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.930> babies<00:01:10.520> or

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
increase is through births of babies or

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.200 
increase is through births of babies or
through<00:01:12.090> immigration<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:13.049> an<00:01:13.320> inflow<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.210> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
through immigration as an inflow and the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.840 
through immigration as an inflow and the
only<00:01:15.390> way<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:15.720> population<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.830> decrease<00:01:17.369> is

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
only way for population to decrease is

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.359 
only way for population to decrease is
for<00:01:18.689> animals<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.320> leave<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.710> population

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
for animals to leave the population

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.640 
for animals to leave the population
because<00:01:20.759> they<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.030> died<00:01:21.360> or<00:01:21.990> they<00:01:22.530> have

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
because they have died or they have

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.190 
because they have died or they have
emigrated<00:01:23.280> out<00:01:23.460> shown<00:01:23.939> here<00:01:24.270> as<00:01:24.450> an<00:01:24.689> outflow

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
rate of inflows or births and emigration

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.649

and outflows deaths and emigration gives

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.749 
and outflows deaths and emigration gives
us<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.170> actual<00:01:37.650> number<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.950> animals<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.640> our

bathtub models as stock and flow models
where<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> stock<00:01:54.899> represents<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.649> group<00:01:55.829> of

new animals added or removed for this

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.969 
new animals added or removed for this
example<00:02:02.729> we<00:02:03.420> will<00:02:03.630> assume<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.710> number

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
example we will assume that the number

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.039 
example we will assume that the number
of<00:02:05.070> animals<00:02:05.520> immigrating<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.420> emigrating

of animals immigrating and emigrating

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.559 
of animals immigrating and emigrating
cancel<00:02:08.039> each<00:02:08.250> other<00:02:08.399> out<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:11.180> let's<00:02:12.180> apply<00:02:12.510> the

cancel each other out so let's apply the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.730 
cancel each other out so let's apply the
concept<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.440> stock

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
concept of a stock
