at<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:29.980> moment<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.610> now<00:02:31.000> I'm<00:02:31.150> gonna<00:02:31.270> move

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
at the moment and now I'm gonna move

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.240 
at the moment and now I'm gonna move
back<00:02:31.570> to<00:02:32.020> around<00:02:32.140> one<00:02:32.500> meter<00:02:32.770> away<00:02:32.890> from<00:02:33.160> the

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
back to around one meter away from the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.010 
back to around one meter away from the
microphone<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:33.970> see<00:02:34.510> if<00:02:34.570> you<00:02:34.660> guys<00:02:34.750> could

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.190 
microphone and see if you guys could
hear<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.410> difference<00:02:36.720> right<00:02:37.720> now<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.930> am

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
hear the difference right now I am

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.750 
hear the difference right now I am
around<00:02:38.440> one<00:02:38.770> meter<00:02:39.040> away<00:02:39.280> from<00:02:39.640> the

around one meter away from the

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
microphone and I think you guys can hear

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.110 
microphone and I think you guys can hear
that<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.040> quality<00:02:42.730> is<00:02:43.000> not<00:02:43.360> as<00:02:43.420> good<00:02:44.940> now<00:02:45.940> I'm

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
that the quality is not as good now I'm

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.000 
that the quality is not as good now I'm
back<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.360> around<00:02:46.720> five<00:02:47.020> centimeters<00:02:47.530> away

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010
