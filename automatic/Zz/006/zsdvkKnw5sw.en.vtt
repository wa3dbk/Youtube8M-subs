00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
pools in Revit architecture so the first

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.290 
pools in Revit architecture so the first
thing<00:00:07.680> that<00:00:07.890> you<00:00:08.280> want<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.550> do<00:00:08.730> is<00:00:08.910> figure<00:00:09.150> out

and<00:00:47.340> I'm<00:00:48.329> going<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> make<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.899> base

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
and I'm going to make the base

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.380 
and I'm going to make the base

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
to leave the top height at unconnected

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.860 
to leave the top height at unconnected
for<00:00:56.280> now<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:59.460> top<00:00:59.670> constraint<00:01:00.539> I'm<00:01:00.690> going

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
for now and the top constraint I'm going

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.830 
for now and the top constraint I'm going
to<00:01:00.930> put<00:01:01.079> at<00:01:01.199> first<00:01:01.530> floor<00:01:02.000> just<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:03.390> right

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
to put at first floor just so it's right

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.719 
to put at first floor just so it's right
at<00:01:04.080> ground<00:01:04.409> level<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.070> I'm<00:01:05.309> going<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> click

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
at ground level and I'm going to click

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.570 
at ground level and I'm going to click
apply<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.390> I'll<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:07.470> draw<00:01:07.740> my<00:01:07.950> pool<00:01:08.310> right

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
apply and I'll just draw my pool right

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.870 
apply and I'll just draw my pool right
here<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.439> I<00:01:10.439> know<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.860> my<00:01:11.010> pool<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.310> there<00:01:11.670> so

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
here and I know that my pool is there so

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.149 
here and I know that my pool is there so
I'm<00:01:11.970> going<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.210> click<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.570> X<00:01:12.720> then<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.680> click<00:01:13.979> on

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
I'm going to click the X then I click on

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.149 
I'm going to click the X then I click on
3d<00:01:14.610> here<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.060> now<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.479> can<00:01:15.750> see<00:01:15.960> my<00:01:16.110> pool<00:01:16.350> it's

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
3d here and now I can see my pool it's

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.100 
3d here and now I can see my pool it's
actually<00:01:17.490> quite<00:01:17.820> bigger<00:01:18.119> than<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.479> expected<00:01:19.049> so

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
actually quite bigger than I expected so

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.960 
actually quite bigger than I expected so
I'm<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.619> going<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.799> make<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.280> smaller<00:01:20.640> pool

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
I'm just going to make it a smaller pool

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.510 
I'm just going to make it a smaller pool
here<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:22.049> I'm<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:23.009> going<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.189> move<00:01:23.400> it

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
here and I'm just going to move it

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.690 
here and I'm just going to move it
around

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.929 

first<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.840> all<00:01:30.960> put<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.680> toposurface<00:01:32.159> if<00:01:32.790> you

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
first of all put in a toposurface if you

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.730 
first of all put in a toposurface if you
do<00:01:33.060> not<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.409> don't<00:01:34.619> know

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
how to do that you can watch my video on

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.859 
how to do that you can watch my video on
that<00:01:36.630> I'll<00:01:37.439> put<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> link<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> description

so<00:01:39.869> what<00:01:39.990> we're<00:01:40.140> going<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.290> do<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.710> split<00:01:41.100> out

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
so what we're going to do is split out

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.399 
so what we're going to do is split out
this<00:01:41.549> grass<00:01:41.880> around<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.540> pool<00:01:42.810> here<00:01:43.080> so<00:01:43.320> I'm

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
this grass around this pool here so I'm

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.020 
this grass around this pool here so I'm
going<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.619> come<00:01:43.830> here<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.100> massing<00:01:44.640> insight

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
going to come here to massing insight

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
deep pool now as you can see I have that

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.459 
deep pool now as you can see I have that
now<00:02:55.310> what<00:02:55.489> I<00:02:55.519> can<00:02:55.730> also<00:02:55.909> do<00:02:56.299> is<00:02:56.540> add<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.840> floor<00:02:57.260> to

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:57.469 
now what I can also do is add a floor to

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.020 
now what I can also do is add a floor to
the<00:02:57.590> pool<00:02:57.829> so<00:02:57.859> that<00:02:58.189> it's<00:02:58.370> just<00:02:58.609> the<00:02:58.760> same<00:02:58.790> as

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
the pool so that it's just the same as

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.030 
the pool so that it's just the same as
adding<00:02:59.329> a<00:02:59.540> floor<00:02:59.810> to<00:02:59.930> anything<00:03:00.260> else<00:03:00.439> I'm

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:12.919 
to put this a negative 20 offset just

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.440 
to put this a negative 20 offset just
like<00:03:13.159> I<00:03:13.189> did<00:03:13.489> with<00:03:13.639> the<00:03:13.760> walls<00:03:13.939> I'm<00:03:14.209> going<00:03:14.269> to
