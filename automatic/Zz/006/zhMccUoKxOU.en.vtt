00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.969
 Hello everyone, today I am here to give you a 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.680
 I recommend today the bought 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:20.730
 this one of 10 liters of the blue 5.7 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.340
 it is a very suitable aquarium for example for 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.300
 i betta splendens as you can see 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.730
 in fact I put a small betta but 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.759
 it is also very suitable for those for example 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.410
 wants to take off for example from 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.300
 groups or platì or dic sifo forum yes 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.960
 can put it right here in and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.309
 make more birth happen 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.660
 at the same time because precisely not a 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.090
 that of 10 liters therefore enough 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.670
 great for the fry which in some 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.250
 size because it is suitable for 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.440
 fry as you can see it does not have 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.300
 the filter placed on the side 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.940
 this is just the pump after that 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.320
 the connected to a plastic tube 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.680
 amateur in this part below is 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.900
 here is the real filter below I have 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.369
 put some glass wool on that 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.110
 still guarantees cleaning 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.210
 water and fry even though not 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.450
 try to infiltrate inside the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.820
 fabia lina of gravel , gravel 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.070
 however he must put this type here 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.710
 of gravel an area of ​​let's say coarse 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.689
 because in any case under a layer of 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.030
 plastic, however, drilled therefore for 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.520
 avoid gravel entering the filter 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.909
 still you need 20 gay 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.790
 but this object is coarse 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.759
 aquarium is also very suitable for those who 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.150
 example wants to have a small object 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.930
 let's say design at home that gives a little 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.520
 of movement because as you can see 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.460
 in conclusion 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.229
 it is not the usual completely dark aquarium 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.789
 all black there are various colors I chose 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.770
 just the gray because in short yes 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:03.869
 they sing goes to what else to say anything if 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.119
 you liked this advice 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.060
 leave some comments for 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.959
 improve subsequent videos though if 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.030
 I have the chance I can do it would 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.590
 see also set up precisely period 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.579
 nights even if the setting up anyway 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.660
 it does not change much because it is so 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:25.860
 I'll say let's cut it with the frylets 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.950
 thanks more and more on a video left 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.950
