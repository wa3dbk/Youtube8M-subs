00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.990 
that it's very easy especially for the
younger<00:04:39.590> kids<00:04:39.740> to<00:04:40.190> get<00:04:40.310> distracted<00:04:40.700> so

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
younger kids to get distracted so

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.690 
younger kids to get distracted so
something<00:04:41.540> like<00:04:41.690> this<00:04:41.930> would<00:04:42.560> be<00:04:42.590> perfect<00:04:42.740> for

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
something like this would be perfect for

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.000 
something like this would be perfect for
the<00:04:44.090> classroom<00:04:44.570> environment<00:04:44.870> they<00:04:45.710> could<00:04:45.890> go

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
the classroom environment they could go

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.680 
the classroom environment they could go
ahead<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:46.400> start<00:04:46.580> a<00:04:46.670> paper<00:04:46.880> on<00:04:47.180> this<00:04:47.330> device

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
ahead and start a paper on this device

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.480 
ahead and start a paper on this device
and<00:04:50.290> take<00:04:51.290> it<00:04:51.440> home<00:04:51.620> and<00:04:51.740> continue<00:04:52.190> it<00:04:52.340> and

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
and take it home and continue it and

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.910 
and take it home and continue it and
