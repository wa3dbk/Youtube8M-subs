00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.409 

the<00:00:18.289> bod<00:00:18.470> pod<00:00:18.499> is<00:00:18.949> a<00:00:18.980> body<00:00:19.970> composition

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:20.419 
the bod pod is a body composition

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.210 
the bod pod is a body composition
measuring<00:00:20.990> device<00:00:21.349> that<00:00:21.619> allows<00:00:21.890> us<00:00:21.919> to

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
measuring device that allows us to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.310 
measuring device that allows us to
measure<00:00:22.550> each<00:00:22.970> student-athletes<00:00:23.630> body<00:00:24.109> fat

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
measure each student-athletes body fat

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.169 
measure each student-athletes body fat
percentage<00:00:24.769> and<00:00:24.859> lean<00:00:25.009> muscle<00:00:25.339> mass<00:00:25.369> it's

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:26.179 
percentage and lean muscle mass it's

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:27.700 
percentage and lean muscle mass it's
actually<00:00:26.539> the<00:00:26.630> same<00:00:26.869> device<00:00:27.230> that<00:00:27.439> they<00:00:27.529> use

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
actually the same device that they use

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.589 
actually the same device that they use
at<00:00:27.859> the<00:00:27.890> NFL<00:00:28.369> Combine<00:00:28.849> so<00:00:29.119> it<00:00:29.239> is<00:00:29.329> very

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
at the NFL Combine so it is very

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.839 
at the NFL Combine so it is very
accurate<00:00:29.839> the<00:00:30.739> first<00:00:30.980> thing<00:00:31.249> that<00:00:31.279> student

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
accurate the first thing that student

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.850 
accurate the first thing that student
athlete<00:00:32.149> does<00:00:32.360> is<00:00:32.509> we<00:00:32.660> get<00:00:32.780> their<00:00:32.989> height<00:00:33.560> and

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
athlete does is we get their height and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.020 
athlete does is we get their height and
then<00:00:33.950> we<00:00:34.040> get<00:00:34.130> their<00:00:34.310> weight<00:00:34.520> and<00:00:34.700> by<00:00:34.790> getting

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
then we get their weight and by getting

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.390 
then we get their weight and by getting
their<00:00:35.150> weight<00:00:35.300> we<00:00:35.480> get<00:00:35.600> their<00:00:35.750> body<00:00:35.990> mass<00:00:36.400> once

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
their weight we get their body mass once

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.610 
their weight we get their body mass once
the<00:00:37.610> athlete<00:00:37.730> sits<00:00:38.330> within<00:00:38.630> the<00:00:38.750> chamber<00:00:39.230> the

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
the athlete sits within the chamber the

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.650 
the athlete sits within the chamber the
chamber<00:00:39.650> measures<00:00:40.430> their<00:00:40.640> body<00:00:40.850> volume<00:00:41.390> and

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
chamber measures their body volume and

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.240 
chamber measures their body volume and
when<00:00:41.810> you<00:00:41.930> have<00:00:42.110> mass<00:00:42.380> and<00:00:42.410> volume<00:00:42.800> you<00:00:43.100> can

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
when you have mass and volume you can

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.710 
when you have mass and volume you can
then<00:00:43.340> figure<00:00:43.670> out<00:00:43.700> their<00:00:43.970> density<00:00:44.390> and<00:00:44.540> body

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
then figure out their density and body

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.130 
then figure out their density and body
composition<00:00:45.230> so<00:00:46.190> what<00:00:46.430> we're<00:00:46.580> out<00:00:47.570> is<00:00:47.780> what

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
composition so what we're out is what

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.810 
composition so what we're out is what
percentage<00:00:48.530> of<00:00:48.650> their<00:00:48.860> weight<00:00:49.070> is<00:00:49.250> body<00:00:49.520> fat

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
percentage of their weight is body fat

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.190 
percentage of their weight is body fat
what<00:00:50.030> percentage<00:00:50.420> of<00:00:50.480> their<00:00:50.630> weight<00:00:50.780> is<00:00:50.960> lean

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
what percentage of their weight is lean

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.230 
what percentage of their weight is lean
tissue<00:00:51.440> this<00:00:52.340> is<00:00:52.520> very<00:00:52.820> important

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.240 
tissue this is very important

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.940 
tissue this is very important
information<00:00:53.810> because<00:00:53.960> it<00:00:54.260> allows<00:00:54.500> us<00:00:54.530> to

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
information because it allows us to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.740 
information because it allows us to
fine-tune<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.490> student-athletes<00:00:56.270> nutrition

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
fine-tune the student-athletes nutrition

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.660 
fine-tune the student-athletes nutrition
program<00:00:57.140> based<00:00:57.710> on<00:00:57.980> their<00:00:58.220> current

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
program based on their current

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.510 
program based on their current
composition<00:00:59.540> so<00:00:59.840> for<00:01:00.170> example<00:01:00.710> if<00:01:00.890> we<00:01:01.370> have<00:01:01.490> a

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
composition so for example if we have a

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.160 
composition so for example if we have a
student-athlete<00:01:02.240> who's<00:01:02.420> under<00:01:02.780> their<00:01:02.930> goal

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
student-athlete who's under their goal

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.530 
student-athlete who's under their goal
weight<00:01:03.380> and<00:01:03.680> they<00:01:04.610> also<00:01:04.820> happen<00:01:05.210> to<00:01:05.239> be<00:01:05.360> very

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
weight and they also happen to be very

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.630 
weight and they also happen to be very
very<00:01:05.750> lean<00:01:06.020> then<00:01:06.620> we<00:01:06.740> understand<00:01:07.190> that<00:01:07.340> we<00:01:07.490> can

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
very lean then we understand that we can

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.490 
very lean then we understand that we can
give<00:01:07.820> them<00:01:08.000> a<00:01:08.060> few<00:01:08.360> extra<00:01:08.630> calories<00:01:08.780> here<00:01:09.320> and

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
give them a few extra calories here and

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.710 
give them a few extra calories here and
there<00:01:09.590> to<00:01:09.680> help<00:01:09.800> them<00:01:10.010> gain<00:01:10.280> weight<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:11.270> reach

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
there to help them gain weight and reach

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.330 
there to help them gain weight and reach
their<00:01:11.930> goal<00:01:12.080> weight<00:01:12.230> for<00:01:12.409> Altima<00:01:12.680> performance

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
their goal weight for Altima performance

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.430 
their goal weight for Altima performance
on<00:01:13.550> the<00:01:14.150> other<00:01:14.300> hand<00:01:14.600> if<00:01:14.780> we<00:01:14.900> have<00:01:14.990> a<00:01:15.050> student

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
on the other hand if we have a student

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.840 
on the other hand if we have a student
athlete<00:01:15.560> who's<00:01:15.980> underneath<00:01:16.460> their<00:01:16.640> goal

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
athlete who's underneath their goal

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.520 
athlete who's underneath their goal
weight<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.240> they<00:01:17.720> actually<00:01:17.930> have<00:01:18.290> a<00:01:18.320> high

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
weight and they actually have a high

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.770 
weight and they actually have a high
body<00:01:18.770> fat<00:01:19.100> percentage<00:01:19.640> then<00:01:20.120> we<00:01:20.270> have<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:20.630> be<00:01:20.750> a

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
body fat percentage then we have to be a

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.210 
body fat percentage then we have to be a
little<00:01:20.930> more<00:01:21.170> strict<00:01:21.500> with<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:21.740> nutrition

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
little more strict with the nutrition

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.920 
little more strict with the nutrition
program<00:01:22.370> because<00:01:23.270> we<00:01:23.390> don't<00:01:23.570> want<00:01:23.690> them<00:01:23.840> to

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
program because we don't want them to

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.899 
program because we don't want them to
gain<00:01:24.050> any<00:01:24.260> more<00:01:24.350> body<00:01:24.950> fat<00:01:25.070> you<00:01:25.490> want<00:01:25.670> them<00:01:25.790> to

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
gain any more body fat you want them to

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.610 
gain any more body fat you want them to
gain<00:01:26.030> strictly<00:01:26.479> lean<00:01:26.659> tissue<00:01:26.900> so<00:01:27.290> we<00:01:27.380> have<00:01:27.500> to

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
gain strictly lean tissue so we have to

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.950 
gain strictly lean tissue so we have to
tell<00:01:27.830> it<00:01:27.950> or<00:01:28.040> diet<00:01:28.220> a<00:01:28.400> little<00:01:28.610> bit<00:01:28.760> more<00:01:28.970> the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
tell it or diet a little bit more the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.630 
tell it or diet a little bit more the
other<00:01:30.170> interesting<00:01:30.830> piece<00:01:31.490> of<00:01:31.520> information

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
other interesting piece of information

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.490 
other interesting piece of information
from<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:32.330> bod<00:01:32.479> pod<00:01:32.510> is<00:01:32.990> that<00:01:33.140> once<00:01:33.320> we<00:01:33.470> know

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
from the bod pod is that once we know

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.620 
from the bod pod is that once we know
someone's<00:01:34.040> lean<00:01:34.310> muscle<00:01:34.700> mass<00:01:34.850> we<00:01:35.450> can

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
someone's lean muscle mass we can

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.840 
someone's lean muscle mass we can
estimate<00:01:35.840> their<00:01:36.290> caloric<00:01:36.710> needs<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.580> we<00:01:37.700> can

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
estimate their caloric needs so we can

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.090 
estimate their caloric needs so we can
figure<00:01:38.030> out<00:01:38.180> exactly<00:01:39.170> how<00:01:39.350> many<00:01:39.440> calories<00:01:39.710> the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
figure out exactly how many calories the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.980 
figure out exactly how many calories the
student<00:01:40.430> athlete<00:01:40.729> needs<00:01:40.909> to<00:01:41.060> eat<00:01:41.180> each<00:01:41.450> day<00:01:41.750> in

student athlete needs to eat each day in

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.600 
student athlete needs to eat each day in
order<00:01:42.080> for<00:01:42.320> them<00:01:42.409> to<00:01:42.440> gain<00:01:42.650> weight<00:01:42.890> or<00:01:43.100> perhaps

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
order for them to gain weight or perhaps

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.310 
order for them to gain weight or perhaps
if<00:01:43.760> they<00:01:43.880> have<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.210> lose<00:01:44.330> weight<00:01:44.659> how<00:01:45.080> much<00:01:45.229> do

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
if they have to lose weight how much do

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.140 
if they have to lose weight how much do
they<00:01:45.440> have<00:01:45.470> to<00:01:45.740> reduce<00:01:45.890> their<00:01:46.220> calories<00:01:46.760> in

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
they have to reduce their calories in

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.550 
they have to reduce their calories in
order<00:01:47.390> for<00:01:47.479> them<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.600> reach<00:01:47.810> their<00:01:48.049> their<00:01:48.350> goal

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560

just for the health benefits but fruit
fruits<00:03:51.350> and<00:03:51.530> vegetables<00:03:51.920> have<00:03:52.130> a<00:03:52.160> lot<00:03:52.430> of

important nutrients and vitamins that

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.670 
important nutrients and vitamins that

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
help with recovery process that help

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.650 
help with recovery process that help
keep<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:57.980> athlete<00:03:58.340> healthy<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:58.940> to<00:03:59.480> help

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
keep the athlete healthy and to help

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.440 
keep the athlete healthy and to help
slow<00:04:00.470> down<00:04:00.560> inflammation<00:04:01.400> and<00:04:01.610> really<00:04:02.330> they

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
slow down inflammation and really they

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.120 
slow down inflammation and really they
have<00:04:02.870> a<00:04:02.900> lot<00:04:03.170> of<00:04:03.200> involvement<00:04:03.830> with<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.010> other

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
have a lot of involvement with the other

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.680 
have a lot of involvement with the other
processes<00:04:04.670> that<00:04:04.820> go<00:04:05.060> on<00:04:05.239> with<00:04:05.360> muscle

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
processes that go on with muscle

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.360 
processes that go on with muscle
development<00:04:05.810> so<00:04:06.560> it's<00:04:06.709> real<00:04:06.890> important<00:04:07.310> that

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
development so it's real important that

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.830 
development so it's real important that
they<00:04:07.519> include<00:04:07.850> fruits<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.269> vegetables<00:04:08.720> with

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
they include fruits and vegetables with

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.990 
they include fruits and vegetables with
each<00:04:08.959> meal<00:04:09.280> not<00:04:10.280> only<00:04:10.519> do<00:04:10.640> we<00:04:10.730> tell<00:04:10.970> our

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
each meal not only do we tell our

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.210 
each meal not only do we tell our
student<00:04:11.450> athletes<00:04:11.840> what<00:04:12.140> to<00:04:12.260> eat<00:04:12.410> but<00:04:12.950> we<00:04:13.070> also

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
student athletes what to eat but we also

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.729 
student athletes what to eat but we also
have<00:04:13.580> a<00:04:13.610> few<00:04:14.570> rules<00:04:14.840> of<00:04:15.019> things<00:04:15.200> we<00:04:15.320> don't<00:04:15.440> want

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
have a few rules of things we don't want

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.259 
have a few rules of things we don't want
them<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:16.010> eat<00:04:16.190> and<00:04:16.400> one<00:04:16.669> of<00:04:16.790> them<00:04:16.880> happens<00:04:17.209> to

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
them to eat and one of them happens to

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.060 
them to eat and one of them happens to
be<00:04:17.359> fatty<00:04:17.810> foods<00:04:18.230> things<00:04:18.530> that<00:04:18.680> are<00:04:18.799> fried

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
be fatty foods things that are fried

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.820 
be fatty foods things that are fried
heavy<00:04:19.519> creams<00:04:19.910> and<00:04:20.180> cheeses<00:04:20.660> and<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:21.380> reason

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
heavy creams and cheeses and the reason

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.890 
heavy creams and cheeses and the reason
isn't<00:04:22.100> just<00:04:22.310> because<00:04:22.669> of<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:22.910> health<00:04:23.150> aspects

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
isn't just because of the health aspects

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.200 
isn't just because of the health aspects
of<00:04:24.080> extra<00:04:24.470> fat<00:04:24.710> in<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.919> diet<00:04:24.950> is<00:04:25.340> that<00:04:25.910> fat

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
of extra fat in the diet is that fat

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.020 
of extra fat in the diet is that fat
really<00:04:26.690> slows<00:04:26.990> down<00:04:27.229> the<00:04:27.380> digestion<00:04:27.830> process

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
really slows down the digestion process

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.480 
really slows down the digestion process
so<00:04:29.120> for<00:04:29.330> example<00:04:29.810> if<00:04:30.140> a<00:04:30.350> student<00:04:30.860> athlete<00:04:31.100> has

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
so for example if a student athlete has

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.370 
so for example if a student athlete has
a<00:04:31.520> nice<00:04:31.820> high<00:04:32.030> carbohydrate<00:04:32.780> breakfast<00:04:33.200> full

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
a nice high carbohydrate breakfast full

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.380 
a nice high carbohydrate breakfast full
of<00:04:33.500> pancakes<00:04:33.950> and<00:04:34.130> syrup<00:04:34.280> in<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.640> morning<00:04:34.970> but

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
of pancakes and syrup in the morning but

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.030 
of pancakes and syrup in the morning but
then<00:04:35.540> they<00:04:35.630> actually<00:04:36.020> throw<00:04:36.260> on<00:04:36.410> five<00:04:36.680> or<00:04:36.710> six

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
then they actually throw on five or six

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.100 
then they actually throw on five or six
sausage<00:04:37.430> links<00:04:37.730> within<00:04:37.940> that<00:04:38.180> breakfast<00:04:38.720> the

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
sausage links within that breakfast the

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.870 
sausage links within that breakfast the
fat<00:04:39.350> within<00:04:39.590> that<00:04:39.800> sausage<00:04:40.310> will<00:04:40.490> actually

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
fat within that sausage will actually

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.150 
fat within that sausage will actually
slow<00:04:41.270> down<00:04:41.300> how<00:04:42.020> quickly<00:04:42.320> those<00:04:42.560> pancakes<00:04:42.800> are

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
slow down how quickly those pancakes are

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.010 
slow down how quickly those pancakes are
digested<00:04:43.760> and<00:04:43.910> it<00:04:44.240> almost<00:04:44.510> defeats<00:04:44.870> the

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
digested and it almost defeats the

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.990 
digested and it almost defeats the
purpose<00:04:45.200> of<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.680> refuel<00:04:46.460> part<00:04:46.730> of<00:04:46.880> the

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
purpose of the refuel part of the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.850 
purpose of the refuel part of the
program<00:04:47.420> so<00:04:47.870> we<00:04:47.990> really<00:04:48.260> want<00:04:48.410> our<00:04:48.500> student

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
program so we really want our student

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.950 
program so we really want our student
athletes<00:04:49.160> to<00:04:49.280> try<00:04:49.550> to<00:04:49.610> avoid<00:04:50.120> or<00:04:50.570> at<00:04:50.750> least

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
athletes to try to avoid or at least

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.810 
athletes to try to avoid or at least
limit<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:51.530> amount<00:04:51.770> of<00:04:51.860> high<00:04:52.040> fat<00:04:52.340> foods<00:04:52.640> they

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
limit the amount of high fat foods they

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.980 
limit the amount of high fat foods they
have<00:04:53.000> in<00:04:53.150> their<00:04:53.270> diet<00:04:53.480> so<00:04:53.870> they're

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
have in their diet so they're

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.720 
have in their diet so they're
consistently<00:04:54.620> digesting<00:04:55.310> and<00:04:55.400> getting<00:04:55.640> the

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
consistently digesting and getting the

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.400 
consistently digesting and getting the
fuel<00:04:55.940> they<00:04:56.030> need<00:04:56.060> to<00:04:56.330> perform<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:57.320> other

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
fuel they need to perform the other

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.410 
fuel they need to perform the other
important<00:04:57.920> parts<00:04:58.340> of<00:04:58.460> sports<00:04:58.790> nutrition<00:04:58.940> and

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
important parts of sports nutrition and

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.090 
important parts of sports nutrition and
the<00:04:59.480> program<00:05:00.050> for<00:05:00.200> our<00:05:00.230> student<00:05:00.650> athletes<00:05:00.980> is

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
the program for our student athletes is

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.520 
the program for our student athletes is
the<00:05:01.220> timing<00:05:01.490> of<00:05:01.760> their<00:05:01.880> meals<00:05:02.210> it's<00:05:02.990> really

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
the timing of their meals it's really

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.840 
the timing of their meals it's really
important<00:05:03.980> that<00:05:04.130> the<00:05:04.310> athletes<00:05:04.640> have

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
important that the athletes have

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.520 
important that the athletes have
something<00:05:05.270> within<00:05:05.450> two<00:05:05.810> hours<00:05:05.840> of<00:05:06.230> when

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
something within two hours of when

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.620

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.350 
through a hard workout the muscle is
screaming<00:05:21.920> for<00:05:21.950> nutrients<00:05:22.640> and<00:05:22.760> if<00:05:23.090> you<00:05:23.180> give

them the food immediately after their

workout<00:05:25.670> you're<00:05:26.090> convincing<00:05:26.720> the<00:05:26.840> muscle

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
workout you're convincing the muscle
