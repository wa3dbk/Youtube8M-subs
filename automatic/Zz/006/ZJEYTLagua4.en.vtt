explosion like I did for my 500
subscriber<00:00:39.420> special<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.960> was<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.530> this

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
subscriber special I was like this

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.100 
subscriber special I was like this
explosion<00:00:41.070> needs<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.579> much<00:00:41.910> bigger<00:00:42.270> but

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
explosion needs to be much bigger but

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.270 
explosion needs to be much bigger but
how<00:00:43.200> am<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.320> supposed<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.620> make<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.920> much<00:00:44.070> bigger

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
how am I supposed to make it much bigger

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.950 
how am I supposed to make it much bigger
all<00:00:44.520> mooing<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.940> adding<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.270> zero<00:00:45.300> that's<00:00:45.750> gone

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
all mooing is adding a zero that's gone

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.380 
all mooing is adding a zero that's gone
maybe<00:00:46.110> that's<00:00:46.440> not<00:00:46.530> gonna<00:00:46.649> be<00:00:46.710> much<00:00:46.920> bigger<00:00:47.390> so

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
maybe that's not gonna be much bigger so

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.139 
maybe that's not gonna be much bigger so
what<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.570> thought<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:49.020> start<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.800> 500<00:00:50.430> times

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
what I thought is start with 500 times

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.740 
what I thought is start with 500 times
10<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.890> 10<00:00:53.190> 500s<00:00:54.030> here<00:00:54.239> which<00:00:54.480> actually

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
10 so I have 10 500s here which actually

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.580 
10 so I have 10 500s here which actually
add<00:00:55.350> up<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.129> 5,000<00:00:57.030> I'll<00:00:57.270> prove<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.199> if<00:00:58.379> you

add up to 5,000 I'll prove it if you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.429 
add up to 5,000 I'll prove it if you
