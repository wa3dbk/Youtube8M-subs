shit that was out right now and uh the
technologies<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:06.659> come<00:02:06.840> such<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> long<00:02:07.259> way

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
technologies just come such a long way

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.080 
technologies just come such a long way
that<00:02:07.950> now<00:02:08.129> we're<00:02:08.310> up<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.520> s<00:02:08.849> 9<00:02:09.149> tv<00:02:09.330> s<00:02:10.400> 110v<00:02:11.400> stuff

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
that now we're up to s 9 tv s 110v stuff

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.110 
that now we're up to s 9 tv s 110v stuff
like<00:02:12.330> that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
like that

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.520 
like that
so<00:02:13.629> my<00:02:14.170> hopes<00:02:14.470> is<00:02:14.769> that<00:02:15.540> soon<00:02:16.540> this<00:02:16.840> won't<00:02:17.110> be<00:02:17.290> a

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
so my hopes is that soon this won't be a

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.740 
so my hopes is that soon this won't be a
sprint<00:02:17.920> seal<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.489> won't<00:02:18.670> be<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.819> super<00:02:19.150> steal<00:02:19.420> it

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
sprint seal it won't be a super steal it

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.860 
sprint seal it won't be a super steal it
will<00:02:19.930> be<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.950> new<00:02:21.099> standard<00:02:21.129> and<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.510> would

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
will be the new standard and that would

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.470 
will be the new standard and that would

grain than s9 TV I don't know what I'm
showing<00:03:38.470> you<00:03:38.680> i'm<00:03:39.040> just<00:03:39.220> concentrating<00:03:39.730> on

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.250 
what I'm saying more than what i'm

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.170

so<00:03:47.650> it<00:03:47.769> does<00:03:47.949> take<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.250> little<00:03:48.459> bit<00:03:48.579> sharper<00:03:49.090> of

here<00:05:08.800> with<00:05:09.040> this<00:05:09.160> I'm<00:05:09.730> not<00:05:10.000> bragging<00:05:10.390> i'm<00:05:10.480> just

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
here with this I'm not bragging i'm just

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.260 
here with this I'm not bragging i'm just
saying<00:05:10.900> it<00:05:11.020> takes<00:05:11.140> a<00:05:11.260> good<00:05:11.410> edge<00:05:11.880> so<00:05:12.880> i<00:05:12.910> really

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
saying it takes a good edge so i really

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.030 
saying it takes a good edge so i really
like<00:05:13.450> this<00:05:13.600> steel<00:05:13.900> and<00:05:14.230> from<00:05:14.740> what<00:05:14.890> I've<00:05:15.010> seen

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
like this steel and from what I've seen

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.010 
like this steel and from what I've seen
so<00:05:15.250> far<00:05:15.430> it<00:05:15.820> does<00:05:15.970> hold<00:05:16.210> its<00:05:16.390> edge<00:05:16.480> for<00:05:16.810> a<00:05:16.840> good

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
so far it does hold its edge for a good

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.080 
so far it does hold its edge for a good
long<00:05:17.140> while<00:05:17.250> but<00:05:18.250> it's<00:05:18.430> going<00:05:18.550> to<00:05:18.610> be<00:05:18.760> nothing

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
long while but it's going to be nothing

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.750 
long while but it's going to be nothing
compared<00:05:19.420> to<00:05:19.570> these<00:05:19.660> two<00:05:20.010> and<00:05:21.010> I<00:05:21.250> don't<00:05:21.610> want

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
compared to these two and I don't want

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.280 
compared to these two and I don't want
to<00:05:21.820> be<00:05:21.910> real<00:05:22.120> long-winded<00:05:22.510> about<00:05:22.900> it<00:05:23.110> I<00:05:23.230> just

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
to be real long-winded about it I just

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.400 
to be real long-winded about it I just
wanted<00:05:23.650> to<00:05:23.710> talk<00:05:23.860> about<00:05:24.780> my<00:05:25.780> three<00:05:26.080> favorite

of these knives I say jump on them

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:48.420 
of these knives I say jump on them
because<00:05:47.290> they're<00:05:47.470> all<00:05:47.650> three<00:05:47.980> great<00:05:48.220> knives

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
because they're all three great knives

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.540

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
and uh the new stills that are coming

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.960 
and uh the new stills that are coming
out<00:05:51.640> are<00:05:51.700> just<00:05:51.940> ridiculous<00:05:52.570> and<00:05:53.430> I'm<00:05:54.430> so<00:05:54.730> glad

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
out are just ridiculous and I'm so glad

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.659 
out are just ridiculous and I'm so glad
that<00:05:55.090> we<00:05:55.540> can<00:05:55.660> experience<00:05:56.110> it<00:05:56.470> because<00:05:56.950> just

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
that we can experience it because just

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.060 
that we can experience it because just
think<00:05:57.880> about<00:05:58.000> when<00:05:58.570> 440c<00:05:59.260> was<00:05:59.500> too<00:05:59.620> hot<00:05:59.800> shit

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
think about when 440c was too hot shit

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.350 
think about when 440c was too hot shit
'and<00:06:00.540> 440c<00:06:01.540> doesn't<00:06:01.930> even<00:06:02.110> compare<00:06:02.440> to<00:06:03.360> these

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
'and 440c doesn't even compare to these

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.830 
'and 440c doesn't even compare to these
listed<00:06:04.840> right<00:06:04.990> here<00:06:05.820> especially<00:06:06.820> these<00:06:07.540> two

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
listed right here especially these two

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.610 
listed right here especially these two
and<00:06:08.520> i<00:06:09.520> think<00:06:10.030> that<00:06:10.660> don't<00:06:11.110> quote<00:06:11.320> me<00:06:11.500> on<00:06:11.530> this

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
and i think that don't quote me on this

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.560 
and i think that don't quote me on this
because<00:06:11.980> it's<00:06:12.280> just<00:06:12.490> hearsay<00:06:12.700> right<00:06:13.150> now<00:06:13.330> but

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
because it's just hearsay right now but

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.860 
because it's just hearsay right now but
I<00:06:13.600> think<00:06:13.690> crucible<00:06:14.680> is<00:06:14.890> having<00:06:15.190> some<00:06:15.370> troubles

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
I think crucible is having some troubles

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.900 
I think crucible is having some troubles
so<00:06:16.870> spyderco<00:06:17.410> maybe<00:06:17.860> trying<00:06:18.580> to<00:06:18.640> move<00:06:18.820> away

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
so spyderco maybe trying to move away

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.900 
so spyderco maybe trying to move away
from<00:06:19.090> crucible<00:06:19.720> steel<00:06:19.840> again<00:06:20.560> I<00:06:20.830> have<00:06:21.340> no<00:06:21.610> clue

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
from crucible steel again I have no clue

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.480 
from crucible steel again I have no clue
if<00:06:22.360> the<00:06:22.960> statement<00:06:23.260> is<00:06:23.470> valid<00:06:23.860> or<00:06:23.950> not<00:06:24.040> so<00:06:24.460> I

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
if the statement is valid or not so I

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.030 
if the statement is valid or not so I
kind<00:06:25.030> of<00:06:25.060> don't<00:06:25.210> even<00:06:25.419> like<00:06:25.540> repeating<00:06:25.990> it<00:06:26.110> but

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
kind of don't even like repeating it but
