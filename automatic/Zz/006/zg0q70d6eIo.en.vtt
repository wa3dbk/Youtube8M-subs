00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.850
 say having one marker you can 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.950
 paint everything except this marker having 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.430
 Two markers can be drawn at all 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.260
 everything 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.480
 but the marker and today's release 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.670
 intended for another namely for 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.340
 drawing inscriptions and pictures on metal 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.670
 for the assembly we need a pair of tubes 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.480
 from the antenna the wire is a piece of nail which 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.300
 will be used as 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.610
 core and a piece having entered smaller 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.739
 tube diameter of about 10 millimeters 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.780
 for body guide which i 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.120
 pulled a small spring out of wood 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.190
 winding wire not necessary 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.900
 first set of tools and glue 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.670
 we estimate approximately the size of the coil and 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.410
 we install two stops to 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.269
 it was more convenient to wind for these purposes I 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.070
 used sewing bobbins and secured 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.530
 their tape reel I considered in 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.030
 shareware program coil 32 with 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.550
 I was guided by the principle 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.470
 so that through the coil flowed current about six 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.270
 the object ready coil should easily 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.130
 fit into the case as an extra 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.350
 isolation i used shortly after 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.540
 this I cut off the excess cereal for honest 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.610
 part and soldered one output coil to 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.040
 this part is now the end of the tube 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.740
 clipped right near the coil we need 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.600
 drown out a piece according to the statute fingers in 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.640
 it will rest on the spring that we 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.100
 we lay inside the thick tube further 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.710
 I put together a piece of thick nail and the most 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.170
 thin tube and at the point of their intersection i 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.120
 soldered flexible wire this wire we 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.370
 we beat off with a spring around a thin tube 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.690
 and the strength of this resulting structure we 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.430
 put inside the coil 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.560
 the second end of the flexible wire we 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.570
 we connect the same point where we connected 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.520
 first output coil now we 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.380
 glue the nose of our summer risky 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.930
 the marker that which I 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.240
 now we need to saw off the extra thin 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.060
 tube and solder there a piece of sewing needle 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.610
 or pin this will be the electrode 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.170
 of our electric spark marker given 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.390
 I applied the solution to 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.970
 spent stupid 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.770
 but there was a change to the second coil pins 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.319
 we singeing flexible wire and which 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.970
 will be output from the enclosure after 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.160
 how everything will be ready we will be able to collect 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.260
 our electric spark marker to the whole 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.840
 working principle of this electric spark 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.640
 the marker is the coil connected by one 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.830
 the end to the game and the second to the source 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.810
 supply on the surface 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.670
 need to connect another source pin 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.350
 power when we touch the needle 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.290
 process the surface circuit closes 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.850
 coil retracts needle core 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.110
 detaches from the surface 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.940
 at the same time on the surface 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.250
 a small nko cancer is formed 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.070
 which we see let's see how leads 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.450
 yourself electro risk marker in action 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.340
 best at processing 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.930
 soft shawl and non-ferrous metals 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.640
 steel is slightly worse processed 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.470
 instrumental well or that 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.230
 used in knives let's say this 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.970
 Chinese you are usually 400 40 steel as 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.950
 see the train guys guys 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.140
 copes and schmitz design 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.080
 This marker is significantly simplified due to 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.940
 This marker at work a little hot 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.820
 if it is not used on stream 24 by 7 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.510
 It is in principle not very critical thanks 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.519
 for your attention 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.860
 I hope you enjoyed this video if 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.170
 yes like this you will help the channel 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.180
 develop music in this video 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.190

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.190
 thanks for watching, see you soon
