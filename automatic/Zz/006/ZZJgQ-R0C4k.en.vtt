00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
the rear part of the Rosa's mechanism

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.510 
the rear part of the Rosa's mechanism
the<00:00:53.789> roll<00:00:53.969> ciskei<00:00:54.360> Buhl's<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> lining<00:00:56.190> on

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
the roll ciskei Buhl's have a lining on

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.209 
the roll ciskei Buhl's have a lining on
them<00:00:56.879> now<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.360> helium<00:00:58.140> helmet<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.980> that

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
them now on the helium helmet and that

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.680 
them now on the helium helmet and that
improves<00:00:59.670> how<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:02.000> roll<00:01:03.000> --ss<00:01:03.180> mechanism

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
improves how the roll --ss mechanism

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.450 
improves how the roll --ss mechanism
operates<00:01:04.080> as<00:01:04.229> far<00:01:04.379> as<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.589> smoothness<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
operates as far as the smoothness on the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.800 
operates as far as the smoothness on the
dial<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:08.090> finally<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> interior<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
dial and finally on the interior the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.700 
dial and finally on the interior the
helmet<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.100> be<00:01:11.159> coming<00:01:11.430> with<00:01:11.460> our

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
helmet it's going to be coming with our

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.810 
helmet it's going to be coming with our
aqua<00:01:13.710> pad<00:01:13.920> which<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> gel<00:01:15.299> pad<00:01:15.630> which<00:01:16.439> will

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
aqua pad which is a gel pad which will

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.420 
aqua pad which is a gel pad which will
help<00:01:17.820> eliminate<00:01:18.570> hot<00:01:19.259> spots<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.100> riders

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
help eliminate hot spots on the riders

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.429 
help eliminate hot spots on the riders
forehead<00:01:20.820> by<00:01:20.970> better<00:01:21.210> distributing<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.409> load

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
forehead by better distributing the load

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.910 
forehead by better distributing the load
of<00:01:22.860> retention<00:01:23.159> across<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.060> riders<00:01:24.390> forehead

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
of retention across the riders forehead

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.789 
of retention across the riders forehead
so<00:01:25.920> that's<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> aqua<00:01:26.580> pad<00:01:27.290> it's<00:01:28.290> not<00:01:28.560> gonna

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
so that's the aqua pad it's not gonna

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.640 
so that's the aqua pad it's not gonna
absorb<00:01:29.670> any<00:01:30.180> sweat<00:01:30.570> off<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.840> riders<00:01:31.290> forehead

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
absorb any sweat off the riders forehead

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.289 
absorb any sweat off the riders forehead
so<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.130> will<00:01:32.220> actually<00:01:32.340> force<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.820> sweat<00:01:33.150> to

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
so it will actually force the sweat to

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.359 
so it will actually force the sweat to
either<00:01:33.450> side<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.020> pad<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.500> then<00:01:34.650> escape

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
either side of the pad and then escape

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.940 
either side of the pad and then escape
through<00:01:35.720> drain<00:01:36.720> channels<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.560> that'll<00:01:37.799> help

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
through drain channels and that'll help

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.999 
through drain channels and that'll help
keep<00:01:38.070> sweat<00:01:38.520> out<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> riders<00:01:39.210> eye<00:01:39.890> out<00:01:40.890> of

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
keep sweat out of the riders eye out of

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.039 
keep sweat out of the riders eye out of
the<00:01:41.070> riders<00:01:41.340> eyes<00:01:41.490> excuse<00:01:42.090> me<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.810> then

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the riders eyes excuse me and then

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.359 
the riders eyes excuse me and then
finally<00:01:43.590> we're<00:01:43.950> adding<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.970> new<00:01:45.350> Moses<00:01:46.369> LED
