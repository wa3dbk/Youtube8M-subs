so<00:03:42.800> what<00:03:43.800> do<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:43.950> get<00:03:44.130> when<00:03:44.310> he<00:03:44.400> risk<00:03:44.640> your

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
so what do you get when he risk your

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.300 
so what do you get when he risk your
plane<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.240> knock<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.570> camera<00:03:45.930> over<00:03:46.160> you<00:03:47.160> get<00:03:47.250> a

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
plane to knock the camera over you get a

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.930 
plane to knock the camera over you get a
hat<00:03:47.550> with<00:03:47.760> somebody<00:03:48.090> else's<00:03:48.450> name<00:03:48.690> on<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:49.940> this
