00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello to everyone today i will explain to you 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.680
 how to find the coordinates of a point in 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.370
 three-dimensional space 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.490
 let's mark the point d ete I already 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:21.270
 prepared for the groom bedroom and started 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:26.310
 than his projection on agility and y xx game 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.230
 somewhere around here let it be now let's 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.390
 understand at least that all this means 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.570
 imagine your room hope u 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.610
 all she's like me with right angles 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.239
 his look is one wall is the second 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.200
 the wall is pop every corner here 90 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.600
 degrees i hope this is understandable 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.920
 well this point lies on the plane 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.050
 u but this one therefore to find her 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.870
 coordinates imagine that this 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.260
 two-dimensional space 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:02.940
 find her coordinates let's find in 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:10.619
 exactly here in this on this plane for 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:11.159
 This will extend the x and y axes to negative 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:19.920
 sides 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:24.150
 these axes are so good now 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.250
 it is necessary to lower the perpendicular to the axis 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.280
 draw a line 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.159
 parallel to the other axis that is if we 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:39.259
 how to draw a run at the eyepiece mowed 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:44.430
 and scream is he then you have to cut 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:47.670
 parallel to the x-axis is clearly explained as follows 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:54.900
 we drop beautiful how it turns out like this 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:02:00.410
 that's parallel to the x axis is about to 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:06.600
 it will be . xt is. 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:09.840
 igbt to find the coordinate exactly here in 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.500
 point d they are its projection and in three-dimensional 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.600
 image 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.340
 It is necessary to spend the sum of these two 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.700
 vectors if someone remembers that amount 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.910
 vectors you can go by the theorem 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.570
 parallelogram 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:29.660
 She will quickly arrange this one 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.660
 cut from here to the center 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.180
 coordinates. 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:41.100
 and we transfer this segment here 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:45.420
 there must be no projection 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:49.350
 points d on the xy plane and here are the minutes 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:53.880
 it turns out like this now 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:59.400
 find d coordinates can be calculated 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:02.430
 just the number of cells so first 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.510
 x is here we have two means of cells 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:10.860
 write here we have a secret four cells 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.370
 but negative means -4 and now 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.670
 goes z2 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.480
 2229 it turns out we have coordinates 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.920
 points d 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.470
 now like this we have a point e 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:30.140
 only now it is below 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:33.620
 planes here it should be like this 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:39.650
 let's well here everything seems to be 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:42.090
 try to lower the perpendicular to the y axis 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:47.720
 included so now the box office 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:51.540
 weeks it turns out on so now we spend 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:55.230
 because of the projection of the point i on the x plane to 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.820
 on that plane and how x to the center 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.980
 coordinates and draw something like that 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:07.840
 parallel line and 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.840
 Points I to the continuation of the z axis here 4 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:16.519
 it turns out like this and now we consider 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.229
 so x axis 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:26.930
 let's mark all the points so that we do not 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:27.830
 get confused x and y i and z and then i forgot 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.870
 note and cd 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:42.289
 good to you x i'm first we have a minus 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:46.300
 4 then and how I have it is 3328 and here 222 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:51.880
 creature again 9 again with signs bottom 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.880
 now let's find the vector d and 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.880
 using the well-known theorem 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.440
 Pythagoras 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:06.590
 vector d and does not remember at all 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:08.960
 register exactly like this should be found 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:14.840
 that's it but how we find it 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:23.750
 equal with just so remember with vector with 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:30.700
 equals c x plus c y + c not visible ok 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:34.700
 I'll write here with equals x plus y plus z 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:39.320
 everything is squared and under the root though 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:44.930
 lymph mountains like so now with x 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.820
 equal to x on the final ie x e minus 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.360
 x 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:55.930
 the initial one is xd is minus 4 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.930
 minus 2 equals minus 6 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:07.740
 iks it in the same way it turns out 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:10.770
 8 minus minus 4 12 z equals -9 minus 10 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:23.009
 minus 18 and you pass the present here in 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:32.000
 this formula with equals square 6 36 plus 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:32.000
 square 12 144 and plus square in 17 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:49.039
 I will take for this calculator 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:59.639
 because you can't count 324 and 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:07:06.590
 here we add 36 a4 sheets it turns out 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:12.510
 504 under the root is approximately equal to 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:16.099
 22 and 5 and this is the size of victor 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:20.870
 Well, the length of hectares for this all thanks to all 

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:20.870
 thank and then goodbye me
