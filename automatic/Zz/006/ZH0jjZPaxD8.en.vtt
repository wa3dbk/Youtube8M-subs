which i think is extremely worth the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.929 
which i think is extremely worth the
money<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.800> doesn't<00:00:20.220> cost<00:00:20.400> much<00:00:20.670> as<00:00:20.850> a

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939

of<00:00:27.119> my<00:00:27.269> thoughts<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.750> how<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.080> thought<00:00:28.410> about

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
of my thoughts on how I thought about

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:38.950 
of my thoughts on how I thought about
this<00:00:28.859> product<00:00:29.340> here<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.269> rheya<00:00:30.539> softbox

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.140 

so<00:00:39.950> why<00:00:40.010> did<00:00:40.160> this<00:00:40.250> really<00:00:40.550> stand<00:00:40.820> out<00:00:40.940> to<00:00:41.000> me

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
so why did this really stand out to me

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.300 
so why did this really stand out to me
and<00:00:41.450> in<00:00:41.600> fact<00:00:41.810> it<00:00:42.020> was<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:42.440> price<00:00:42.770> point<00:00:43.100> and

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
and in fact it was the price point and

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.010 
and in fact it was the price point and
basically<00:00:43.760> a<00:00:44.030> lot<00:00:44.180> of<00:00:44.270> the<00:00:44.360> reviews<00:00:44.720> I<00:00:44.870> was

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
basically a lot of the reviews I was

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.260 
basically a lot of the reviews I was
reading<00:00:45.350> and<00:00:45.770> I<00:00:45.860> never<00:00:46.100> heard<00:00:46.490> of<00:00:46.760> write-up

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
reading and I never heard of write-up

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.090 
reading and I never heard of write-up
before<00:00:47.630> but<00:00:48.140> what<00:00:48.350> is<00:00:48.470> it<00:00:48.650> right<00:00:48.830> it's

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
before but what is it right it's

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.650 
before but what is it right it's
essentially<00:00:49.550> just<00:00:49.610> another<00:00:50.210> kind<00:00:50.540> of

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
essentially just another kind of

essentially just another kind of

not sponsored by them which I was

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.100

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
very very simple

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.390 
very very simple
no<00:02:00.080> essentially<00:02:00.560> I<00:02:00.590> wanted<00:02:01.130> something

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
no essentially I wanted something

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.130 
no essentially I wanted something
instead<00:02:01.850> of<00:02:01.909> just<00:02:02.030> having<00:02:02.450> an<00:02:02.540> umbrella<00:02:02.689> I

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
instead of just having an umbrella I

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.810 
instead of just having an umbrella I
wanted<00:02:03.409> more<00:02:03.619> of<00:02:03.680> a<00:02:03.799> controlled<00:02:04.310> diffused

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
wanted more of a controlled diffused

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.880 
wanted more of a controlled diffused
light<00:02:05.090> something<00:02:05.750> give<00:02:05.960> me<00:02:06.080> something<00:02:06.409> softer

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
light something give me something softer

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.820 
light something give me something softer
better<00:02:07.759> for<00:02:08.269> my<00:02:08.509> headshots<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.350> portraits

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
better for my headshots and portraits

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.259 
better for my headshots and portraits
just<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.100> get<00:02:10.250> a<00:02:10.280> little<00:02:10.580> bit<00:02:10.759> more<00:02:11.000> length

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
just to get a little bit more length

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.210 
just to get a little bit more length
than<00:02:11.390> just<00:02:11.660> being<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.290> know<00:02:12.320> kind<00:02:12.410> of<00:02:12.739> here<00:02:13.070> I

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
than just being you know kind of here I

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.610 
than just being you know kind of here I
could<00:02:13.610> be<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.730> little<00:02:13.970> bit<00:02:14.299> more<00:02:14.630> in<00:02:14.870> left<00:02:15.140> so

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
could be a little bit more in left so

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.289 
could be a little bit more in left so
that's<00:02:15.799> why<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:15.980> really<00:02:16.280> wanted<00:02:16.489> an<00:02:17.090> actual

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
that's why I really wanted an actual

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.020 
that's why I really wanted an actual
softbox<00:02:18.080> not<00:02:18.380> just<00:02:18.620> my<00:02:19.040> octa<00:02:19.459> umbrella<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:20.000> I

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
softbox not just my octa umbrella that I

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.880 
softbox not just my octa umbrella that I
had<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.570> you've<00:02:20.690> seen<00:02:20.870> in<00:02:21.049> you<00:02:21.590> know<00:02:21.680> a<00:02:21.709> lot

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
had that you've seen in you know a lot

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.530 
had that you've seen in you know a lot
of<00:02:21.920> my<00:02:22.070> flash<00:02:22.340> videos<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:22.970> stuff<00:02:23.120> like<00:02:23.299> that

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
of my flash videos and stuff like that

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.300 
of my flash videos and stuff like that
so<00:02:23.900> this<00:02:24.049> is<00:02:24.110> what<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.410> came<00:02:24.620> out<00:02:24.680> with<00:02:25.010> once

so this is what I came out with once

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.220 
so this is what I came out with once
again<00:02:25.549> this<00:02:25.940> doesn't<00:02:26.299> come<00:02:26.420> with<00:02:26.570> a<00:02:26.600> flash<00:02:26.930> but

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
again this doesn't come with a flash but

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.340 
again this doesn't come with a flash but

out something in the instructions book
you<00:02:56.090> know<00:02:56.180> if<00:02:56.239> you<00:02:56.330> kind<00:02:56.450> of<00:02:56.540> look<00:02:56.630> at<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:56.870> on

you know if you kind of look at that on

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.630 
you know if you kind of look at that on
screen<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.290> think<00:02:57.650> it<00:02:57.800> says<00:02:58.069> that<00:02:58.280> you<00:02:58.459> should

screen I think it says that you should
watch<00:02:58.849> when<00:02:59.450> you're<00:02:59.569> opening<00:02:59.930> this<00:03:00.200> because

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
watch when you're opening this because

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.320 
watch when you're opening this because
you<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:01.040> will<00:03:01.190> open<00:03:01.489> it<00:03:01.550> away<00:03:01.730> from<00:03:02.000> you<00:03:02.120> so<00:03:02.270> you

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
you it will open it away from you so you

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.839 
you it will open it away from you so you

Dre so all joking aside um when you open
this<00:03:07.849> up<00:03:08.030> be<00:03:08.209> careful<00:03:08.420> it's<00:03:08.810> basically<00:03:09.080> like<00:03:09.230> a

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
this up be careful it's basically like a

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.140 
this up be careful it's basically like a
big<00:03:09.680> reflector<00:03:10.400> so<00:03:10.940> when<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.180> open<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.450> up

big reflector so when you open it up

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.490 
big reflector so when you open it up

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.630 
whole thing out and I'm just going to
undo<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:17.810> softly<00:03:18.380> and<00:03:18.620> there<00:03:19.160> you<00:03:19.220> go<00:03:19.370> so

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
undo it softly and there you go so

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.449 
undo it softly and there you go so
essentially<00:03:20.420> it's<00:03:20.630> this<00:03:20.959> big<00:03:21.230> so<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:22.280> there's

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
essentially it's this big so so there's

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:22.900 
essentially it's this big so so there's
me

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
me

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.140 
me
you<00:03:23.870> know<00:03:23.930> fits<00:03:24.170> right<00:03:24.290> into<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.530> camera<00:03:24.950> and

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
you know fits right into the camera and

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.470 
you know fits right into the camera and
essentially<00:03:26.350> this<00:03:27.350> is<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.739> inside<00:03:28.480> right

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
essentially this is the inside right

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.600 
essentially this is the inside right
here<00:03:29.900> so<00:03:30.380> this<00:03:30.860> is<00:03:31.040> what<00:03:31.190> it's<00:03:31.310> going<00:03:31.400> to<00:03:31.459> look

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
here so this is what it's going to look

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.090 
here so this is what it's going to look
like<00:03:32.080> you<00:03:33.080> know<00:03:33.200> that<00:03:33.470> is<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.739> length<00:03:33.890> of<00:03:34.040> that

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
like you know that is the length of that

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.940 
like you know that is the length of that
this<00:03:34.430> thing<00:03:34.640> is<00:03:34.790> freaking<00:03:35.269> huge<00:03:35.600> so<00:03:36.440> what<00:03:36.860> I'm

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
this thing is freaking huge so what I'm

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.110 
this thing is freaking huge so what I'm
going<00:03:37.069> to<00:03:37.100> do<00:03:37.250> is<00:03:37.400> I'm<00:03:37.519> going<00:03:37.610> to<00:03:37.670> attach<00:03:37.880> this

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
going to do is I'm going to attach this

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.210 
going to do is I'm going to attach this
in<00:03:38.299> a<00:03:38.360> second<00:03:38.810> maybe<00:03:39.530> show<00:03:39.769> you<00:03:39.830> a<00:03:39.950> brief<00:03:40.160> clip

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
in a second maybe show you a brief clip

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.949 
in a second maybe show you a brief clip
on<00:03:40.640> like<00:03:40.940> how<00:03:41.090> it<00:03:41.209> works<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.540> everything<00:03:41.569> like

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
on like how it works and everything like

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.449 
on like how it works and everything like
that<00:03:41.989> but<00:03:42.440> I<00:03:42.500> just<00:03:42.709> want<00:03:42.830> to<00:03:42.920> give<00:03:43.010> my<00:03:43.160> views

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
that but I just want to give my views

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:44.800 
that but I just want to give my views
but<00:03:43.670> as<00:03:43.760> I<00:03:43.880> said<00:03:44.090> I'm<00:03:44.180> going<00:03:44.299> to<00:03:44.330> kind<00:03:44.540> of<00:03:44.600> show

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
but as I said I'm going to kind of show

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.720 
but as I said I'm going to kind of show
you<00:03:44.870> what<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:45.769> comes<00:03:45.950> with<00:03:46.100> so<00:03:46.370> there's<00:03:46.549> some

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
you what it comes with so there's some

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.210 
you what it comes with so there's some
close-ups<00:03:47.209> you're<00:03:47.390> going<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:47.569> see<00:03:47.780> V<00:03:48.019> it<00:03:48.890> comes

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
close-ups you're going to see V it comes

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.610 
close-ups you're going to see V it comes
basically<00:03:49.430> with<00:03:49.819> its<00:03:49.970> own<00:03:50.290> light<00:03:51.290> stand

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
basically with its own light stand

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.640 
basically with its own light stand
adapter<00:03:52.160> so<00:03:52.610> that<00:03:52.640> way<00:03:52.790> you<00:03:52.850> literally<00:03:53.239> just

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
adapter so that way you literally just

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.840 
adapter so that way you literally just
you<00:03:54.650> could<00:03:54.830> just<00:03:54.980> screw<00:03:55.160> it<00:03:55.280> on<00:03:55.370> it<00:03:55.519> comes<00:03:55.640> with

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
you could just screw it on it comes with

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.180 
you could just screw it on it comes with
some<00:03:56.000> adapters<00:03:56.480> inside<00:03:56.900> then<00:03:57.739> you<00:03:57.890> unfold

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
some adapters inside then you unfold

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.069 
some adapters inside then you unfold
that<00:03:58.579> you<00:03:58.880> fold<00:03:59.150> that<00:03:59.269> out<00:03:59.329> and<00:03:59.600> then<00:03:59.750> you<00:03:59.780> come

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
that you fold that out and then you come

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.770 
that you fold that out and then you come
to<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:01.400> flash<00:04:01.700> so<00:04:02.269> that<00:04:02.329> way<00:04:02.540> you<00:04:02.630> can

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
to the the flash so that way you can

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.720 
to the the flash so that way you can
slide<00:04:02.959> your<00:04:02.989> flash<00:04:03.320> in<00:04:03.620> you<00:04:04.070> can<00:04:04.250> move<00:04:04.430> it<00:04:04.579> back

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
slide your flash in you can move it back

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.759 
slide your flash in you can move it back
and<00:04:04.910> forth<00:04:05.000> it's<00:04:05.359> very<00:04:05.540> versatile<00:04:06.109> so<00:04:06.650> it

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
and forth it's very versatile so it

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.140 
and forth it's very versatile so it
doesn't<00:04:06.920> matter<00:04:07.070> what<00:04:07.310> flash<00:04:07.609> or<00:04:07.880> what<00:04:08.000> light

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
doesn't matter what flash or what light

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.640 
doesn't matter what flash or what light
you're<00:04:08.299> using<00:04:08.510> it's<00:04:08.780> something<00:04:09.109> that<00:04:09.260> you<00:04:09.410> can

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
you're using it's something that you can

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.470 
you're using it's something that you can
use<00:04:09.890> and<00:04:10.100> it's<00:04:10.220> very<00:04:10.459> versatile<00:04:11.209> which<00:04:11.359> is

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
use and it's very versatile which is

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.360 
use and it's very versatile which is
really<00:04:11.750> key<00:04:11.989> and<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.650> cool<00:04:12.829> thing<00:04:12.859> is<00:04:13.160> no

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
really key and the cool thing is no

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.039 
really key and the cool thing is no
matter<00:04:13.400> how<00:04:13.730> tall<00:04:13.790> how<00:04:14.510> you<00:04:14.570> want<00:04:14.780> to<00:04:14.810> use<00:04:14.959> your

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
matter how tall how you want to use your

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.349 
matter how tall how you want to use your
flash<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.859> speed<00:04:16.190> ring<00:04:16.400> here<00:04:16.729> will<00:04:16.910> also<00:04:17.180> move

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
flash the speed ring here will also move

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.210 
flash the speed ring here will also move
up<00:04:17.600> and<00:04:17.780> down<00:04:18.049> so<00:04:18.620> that<00:04:18.680> way<00:04:18.890> it<00:04:19.100> can

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
up and down so that way it can

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.979 
up and down so that way it can
accommodate<00:04:19.519> whatever<00:04:20.000> you're<00:04:20.269> using<00:04:20.299> and

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
accommodate whatever you're using and

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.500 
accommodate whatever you're using and
then<00:04:21.470> you<00:04:21.620> get<00:04:21.829> to<00:04:22.070> installing<00:04:22.820> which<00:04:23.360> I

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
then you get to installing which I

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.940 
then you get to installing which I
haven't<00:04:23.690> done<00:04:23.930> yet<00:04:24.080> so<00:04:24.140> I'm<00:04:24.289> going<00:04:24.440> to<00:04:24.500> do<00:04:24.680> and

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
haven't done yet so I'm going to do and

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.520 
haven't done yet so I'm going to do and
then<00:04:25.340> let<00:04:25.370> you<00:04:25.640> know<00:04:25.789> to<00:04:26.360> installing<00:04:26.750> this<00:04:27.229> big

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
then let you know to installing this big

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.550 
then let you know to installing this big
guy<00:04:27.740> onto<00:04:28.150> this<00:04:29.150> and<00:04:29.539> then<00:04:30.080> you<00:04:30.200> put<00:04:30.410> in<00:04:30.530> your

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
guy onto this and then you put in your

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.080 
guy onto this and then you put in your
inner<00:04:30.830> baffles<00:04:31.340> so<00:04:31.550> I'm<00:04:31.640> going<00:04:31.760> to<00:04:31.820> do<00:04:31.940> that

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
inner baffles so I'm going to do that

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.790 
inner baffles so I'm going to do that
real<00:04:32.270> quickly<00:04:32.510> so<00:04:33.110> let's<00:04:33.140> take<00:04:33.470> a<00:04:33.500> quick

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
real quickly so let's take a quick

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.830 
real quickly so let's take a quick
timeout<00:04:34.729> and<00:04:34.940> then<00:04:35.060> after<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.419> snap<00:04:35.630> it's

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
timeout and then after the snap it's

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.840 
timeout and then after the snap it's
going<00:04:35.960> to<00:04:36.020> magically<00:04:36.380> appear<00:04:36.410> so<00:04:37.220> we<00:04:37.400> are<00:04:37.580> back

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
going to magically appear so we are back

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.909 
going to magically appear so we are back
and<00:04:38.150> now<00:04:38.180> as<00:04:38.840> you<00:04:38.960> see<00:04:39.140> I<00:04:39.169> have<00:04:39.320> this<00:04:39.560> huge

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.850 
just annoying so essentially what you
want<00:04:46.729> to<00:04:46.789> have<00:04:46.910> to<00:04:47.060> do<00:04:47.240> is<00:04:47.479> I<00:04:48.350> have<00:04:48.530> it<00:04:48.650> set<00:04:48.830> up

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
want to have to do is I have it set up

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.800 
want to have to do is I have it set up
like<00:04:49.070> I<00:04:49.190> did<00:04:49.250> before<00:04:49.520> have<00:04:50.030> this<00:04:50.180> on<00:04:50.389> a<00:04:50.419> stand

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
like I did before have this on a stand

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.750 
like I did before have this on a stand
and<00:04:51.139> then<00:04:51.560> what<00:04:51.740> my<00:04:51.950> recommendation<00:04:52.130> is<00:04:52.729> for

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
and then what my recommendation is for

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.629 
and then what my recommendation is for
putting<00:04:53.090> this<00:04:53.300> on<00:04:53.479> is<00:04:54.130> hold<00:04:55.130> down<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:55.430> stand

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
putting this on is hold down the stand

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.100 
putting this on is hold down the stand
with<00:04:55.760> your<00:04:55.880> foot<00:04:56.150> because<00:04:56.720> you<00:04:56.810> want<00:04:56.960> to<00:04:57.020> get

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
with your foot because you want to get

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.690 
with your foot because you want to get
some<00:04:57.260> leverage<00:04:57.560> because<00:04:57.740> on<00:04:58.100> the<00:04:58.220> back<00:04:58.400> and

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
some leverage because on the back and

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.980 
some leverage because on the back and
I'll<00:04:58.760> show<00:04:58.940> this<00:04:59.090> on<00:04:59.240> close-up<00:04:59.660> when<00:04:59.750> I'm<00:04:59.870> done

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
I'll show this on close-up when I'm done

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.010 
I'll show this on close-up when I'm done
taking<00:05:00.349> this<00:05:00.409> down<00:05:00.909> you<00:05:01.909> just<00:05:02.060> fit<00:05:02.419> this<00:05:02.570> over

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
taking this down you just fit this over

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.190 
taking this down you just fit this over
the<00:05:03.140> bracket<00:05:03.560> you<00:05:03.650> just<00:05:03.800> kind<00:05:03.979> of

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
the bracket you just kind of

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.420 
the bracket you just kind of
stretch<00:05:04.320> it<00:05:04.470> over<00:05:04.560> kind<00:05:04.980> of<00:05:05.040> feels<00:05:05.220> like<00:05:05.340> a

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
stretch it over kind of feels like a

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.250 
stretch it over kind of feels like a
might<00:05:05.640> break<00:05:05.910> but<00:05:06.540> it's<00:05:06.690> not<00:05:06.870> that's<00:05:07.050> the

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
might break but it's not that's the

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.190 
might break but it's not that's the
point<00:05:07.470> of<00:05:07.560> it<00:05:07.650> being<00:05:07.680> very<00:05:07.890> flex<00:05:08.610> flexible<00:05:09.450> in

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
point of it being very flex flexible in

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.750 
point of it being very flex flexible in
that<00:05:10.260> regards<00:05:10.740> but<00:05:10.890> once<00:05:11.070> you<00:05:11.160> get<00:05:11.280> it<00:05:11.430> in<00:05:11.550> it's

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
that regards but once you get it in it's

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.490 
that regards but once you get it in it's
just<00:05:11.970> four<00:05:12.240> sides<00:05:12.570> that<00:05:12.840> flip<00:05:13.140> over<00:05:13.290> the

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
just four sides that flip over the

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.070 
just four sides that flip over the
rubber<00:05:13.740> mount<00:05:14.700> so<00:05:15.000> it<00:05:15.090> is<00:05:15.210> kind<00:05:15.570> of<00:05:15.630> easy<00:05:15.810> it's

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
rubber mount so it is kind of easy it's

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.930 
rubber mount so it is kind of easy it's
just<00:05:16.320> a<00:05:16.500> little<00:05:16.980> intimidating<00:05:17.520> so<00:05:17.670> don't

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
just a little intimidating so don't

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.740 
just a little intimidating so don't
worry<00:05:18.090> about<00:05:18.240> it

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
worry about it

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.150 
worry about it
but<00:05:19.110> essentially<00:05:19.410> what<00:05:19.560> I'm<00:05:19.650> going<00:05:19.800> to<00:05:19.830> do<00:05:19.980> now

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
but essentially what I'm going to do now

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.880 
but essentially what I'm going to do now
is<00:05:20.400> connect<00:05:20.910> the<00:05:21.150> I<00:05:22.110> don't<00:05:22.500> even<00:05:22.560> know<00:05:22.740> if<00:05:22.800> I'm

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
is connect the I don't even know if I'm

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.230 
is connect the I don't even know if I'm
going<00:05:23.010> to<00:05:23.070> use<00:05:23.100> the<00:05:23.340> inner<00:05:23.520> baffle<00:05:23.970> which<00:05:24.090> is

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
going to use the inner baffle which is

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.470 
going to use the inner baffle which is
just<00:05:24.540> a<00:05:24.870> small<00:05:25.830> form<00:05:26.310> of<00:05:26.490> this<00:05:26.670> which

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
just a small form of this which

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.550 
just a small form of this which
essentially<00:05:27.960> gives<00:05:28.080> a<00:05:28.260> little<00:05:28.350> bit<00:05:28.500> more

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
essentially gives a little bit more

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.070 
essentially gives a little bit more
diffusion<00:05:29.250> that<00:05:29.760> hooks<00:05:30.060> into<00:05:30.270> certain<00:05:30.870> panels

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
diffusion that hooks into certain panels

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.530 
diffusion that hooks into certain panels
here<00:05:31.560> I'm<00:05:32.460> just<00:05:32.730> pretty<00:05:32.940> much<00:05:33.150> going<00:05:33.270> to<00:05:33.420> use

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
here I'm just pretty much going to use

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.000 
here I'm just pretty much going to use
the<00:05:33.690> outside<00:05:33.840> softbox<00:05:34.620> because<00:05:34.860> I<00:05:34.950> think

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
the outside softbox because I think

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.440 
the outside softbox because I think
that's<00:05:35.250> all<00:05:35.430> I'm<00:05:35.520> going<00:05:35.640> to<00:05:35.700> need<00:05:35.760> so<00:05:36.390> I'm

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
that's all I'm going to need so I'm

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.090 
that's all I'm going to need so I'm
gonna<00:05:36.540> set<00:05:36.720> that<00:05:36.870> up<00:05:36.900> really<00:05:37.200> quickly<00:05:37.410> there's

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
gonna set that up really quickly there's

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.280 
gonna set that up really quickly there's
velcro<00:05:38.520> very<00:05:39.210> simple<00:05:39.540> install<00:05:39.870> so<00:05:40.020> let's<00:05:40.170> do

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
velcro very simple install so let's do

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:47.180 
velcro very simple install so let's do
it<00:05:40.380> real<00:05:40.470> quick<00:05:40.500> so<00:05:45.530> with<00:05:46.530> the<00:05:46.620> second<00:05:46.950> purpose

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
it real quick so with the second purpose

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.430 
it real quick so with the second purpose
of<00:05:47.280> the<00:05:47.340> video<00:05:47.580> I<00:05:47.850> have<00:05:48.180> it<00:05:48.330> on<00:05:48.420> now<00:05:48.690> you<00:05:49.260> can

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
of the video I have it on now you can

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.990 
of the video I have it on now you can
make<00:05:49.560> it<00:05:49.680> neater<00:05:49.860> the<00:05:50.040> cool<00:05:50.220> thing<00:05:50.430> is<00:05:50.580> this<00:05:50.820> is

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
make it neater the cool thing is this is

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.090 
make it neater the cool thing is this is
actually<00:05:51.300> double<00:05:51.660> sided<00:05:51.930> velcro<00:05:52.080> so<00:05:53.040> you

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
actually double sided velcro so you

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.430 
actually double sided velcro so you
can't<00:05:53.670> mess<00:05:53.940> up<00:05:53.970> and<00:05:54.420> it<00:05:54.870> just<00:05:55.020> goes<00:05:55.170> to<00:05:55.320> the

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
can't mess up and it just goes to the

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.710 
can't mess up and it just goes to the
outer<00:05:55.590> side<00:05:55.920> of<00:05:56.280> the<00:05:56.400> box<00:05:56.610> right<00:05:56.820> here<00:05:57.180> but

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
outer side of the box right here but

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.510 
outer side of the box right here but
overall<00:05:58.050> this<00:05:58.560> thing<00:05:58.800> is<00:05:58.920> a<00:05:58.950> really<00:05:59.370> good

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
overall this thing is a really good

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.000 
overall this thing is a really good
product<00:06:00.000> for<00:06:00.270> thirty-five<00:06:01.140> dollars<00:06:01.650> I'm<00:06:01.830> not

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
product for thirty-five dollars I'm not

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.860 
product for thirty-five dollars I'm not
able<00:06:02.190> to<00:06:02.310> use<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:02.760> images<00:06:03.120> that<00:06:03.150> I<00:06:03.300> tested

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
able to use the images that I tested

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.840 
able to use the images that I tested
with<00:06:04.020> this<00:06:04.230> but<00:06:04.770> it's<00:06:04.920> a<00:06:04.980> great<00:06:05.160> soft<00:06:05.460> light<00:06:05.670> it

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
with this but it's a great soft light it

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.480 
with this but it's a great soft light it
is<00:06:05.940> very<00:06:06.150> very<00:06:06.360> comparable<00:06:06.720> to<00:06:07.050> my<00:06:07.490> my
