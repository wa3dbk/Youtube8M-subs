to play with my baby ears that's what I
feel<00:02:11.670> like<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.090> good<00:02:12.270> for<00:02:12.450> it

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
feel like this is good for it

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.450 
feel like this is good for it
I<00:02:13.140> am<00:02:14.140> not<00:02:14.770> happy<00:02:15.100> with<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:15.640> at<00:02:15.910> all<00:02:17.070> but<00:02:18.070> I<00:02:18.280> can

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
I am not happy with it at all but I can

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.150 
I am not happy with it at all but I can
say<00:02:18.610> it's<00:02:18.790> not<00:02:18.880> greasy<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.780> can<00:02:20.140> say<00:02:20.320> that<00:02:20.560> it's

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
say it's not greasy I can say that it's

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.190 
say it's not greasy I can say that it's
not<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.400> greasy<00:02:21.880> formula<00:02:22.450> it's<00:02:22.900> not<00:02:23.170> a

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
not a greasy formula it's not a

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.940 
not a greasy formula it's not a
hardening<00:02:23.950> formula<00:02:24.640> so<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:26.200> just<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.890> just

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
hardening formula so it just it just

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.480 
hardening formula so it just it just
does<00:02:27.460> what<00:02:27.790> it<00:02:27.880> needs<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.180> do<00:02:28.330> for<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.660> moment

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
does what it needs to do for the moment

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.340 
does what it needs to do for the moment
again<00:02:30.490> I'll<00:02:31.090> let<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:31.690> i'll<00:02:31.930> get<00:02:32.110> them<00:02:32.230> a

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
again I'll let you i'll get them a

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.460 
again I'll let you i'll get them a
little<00:02:32.560> bit<00:02:32.650> close<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:32.980> CQC<00:02:33.460> I<00:02:34.290> might<00:02:35.290> just

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
little bit close to CQC I might just

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.060 
little bit close to CQC I might just
laid<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:35.800> down<00:02:35.830> right<00:02:36.730> in<00:02:36.910> here<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:38.830> really

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
laid it down right in here and it really

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.920 
laid it down right in here and it really
it<00:02:39.520> really<00:02:39.940> doesn't<00:02:40.270> even<00:02:40.330> look<00:02:40.510> like<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.750> did

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
it really doesn't even look like I did

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.680 
it really doesn't even look like I did
anything<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:42.100> like<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.180> said<00:02:43.360> I<00:02:43.390> think

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
anything to it so like I said I think

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.480 
anything to it so like I said I think
this<00:02:43.810> would<00:02:44.050> be<00:02:44.080> better<00:02:44.200> if<00:02:44.650> you're<00:02:44.800> relaxed

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
this would be better if you're relaxed

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.640 
this would be better if you're relaxed
or<00:02:45.670> if<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:45.910> have<00:02:46.090> extremely<00:02:46.540> thin<00:02:47.020> edges<00:02:47.290> and

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
or if you have extremely thin edges and

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.850 
or if you have extremely thin edges and
now<00:02:47.800> I<00:02:47.830> don't<00:02:48.010> have<00:02:48.280> really<00:02:48.490> thick<00:02:48.940> edges<00:02:49.180> but

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
now I don't have really thick edges but

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.890 
now I don't have really thick edges but
this<00:02:50.860> isn't<00:02:51.160> this<00:02:51.610> didn't<00:02:51.940> work<00:02:52.150> for<00:02:52.180> me<00:02:52.510> so

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
this isn't this didn't work for me so

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.060 
this isn't this didn't work for me so
that's<00:02:53.890> my<00:02:54.430> review<00:02:54.820> on<00:02:55.120> this<00:02:55.870> edge<00:02:56.200> sleeker<00:02:56.800> by
