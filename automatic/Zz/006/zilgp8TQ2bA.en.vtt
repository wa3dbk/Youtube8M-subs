so<00:00:08.160> within<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.520> last<00:00:08.550> two<00:00:08.910> weeks<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.300> think

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
so within the last two weeks I think

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.299 
so within the last two weeks I think
I've<00:00:09.660> gotten<00:00:09.870> about<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.350> dozen<00:00:11.040> messages

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
I've gotten about a dozen messages

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.940 
I've gotten about a dozen messages
regarding<00:00:11.809> AMD<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:12.960> Intel<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.530> which<00:00:13.650> one<00:00:13.830> is

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
regarding AMD and Intel and which one is

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.519 
regarding AMD and Intel and which one is
better<00:00:14.130> for<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> gaming<00:00:14.940> or<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.330> video<00:00:16.080> editing

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
better for a gaming or a video editing

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.100 
better for a gaming or a video editing
build<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.250> well<00:00:17.849> while<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.509> answer<00:00:18.810> isn't

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
build and well while that answer isn't

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.230 
build and well while that answer isn't
really<00:00:19.290> black-and-white<00:00:20.009> you<00:00:20.279> have<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.939> say

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
really black-and-white you have to say

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.720 
really black-and-white you have to say
that<00:00:21.480> their<00:00:21.660> perks<00:00:21.989> for<00:00:22.590> both<00:00:22.770> AMD<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.399> Intel

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
that their perks for both AMD and Intel

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.970 
that their perks for both AMD and Intel
which<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.270> pretty<00:00:24.509> much<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.869> inspiration<00:00:25.470> for

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
which is pretty much the inspiration for

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.979 
which is pretty much the inspiration for
this<00:00:26.130> video<00:00:26.430> right<00:00:26.669> now<00:00:26.700> and<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.599> I'm<00:00:27.810> going<00:00:27.930> to

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:27.989 
this video right now and so I'm going to

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.409 
this video right now and so I'm going to
give<00:00:28.169> you<00:00:28.259> guys<00:00:28.380> for<00:00:28.980> perks<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.640> AMD<00:00:30.090> has

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
give you guys for perks that AMD has

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.690 
give you guys for perks that AMD has
over<00:00:30.840> Intel<00:00:31.200> and<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.829> vice<00:00:32.009> versa<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.610> a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
over Intel and a vice versa in a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.030 
over Intel and a vice versa in a
different<00:00:33.090> video<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.989> start<00:00:34.200> obviously

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
different video but to start obviously

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.549 
different video but to start obviously
because<00:00:35.370> AMD<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.149> first<00:00:36.719> alphabetically<00:00:37.440> I

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
because AMD is first alphabetically I

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.710 
because AMD is first alphabetically I
decided<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.160> go<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.970> four<00:00:39.180> advantages

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
decided to go with the four advantages

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.780 
decided to go with the four advantages
that<00:00:39.930> AMD<00:00:40.140> has<00:00:40.470> over<00:00:40.890> Intel<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.550> first

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
that AMD has over Intel the first

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.580 
that AMD has over Intel the first
advantage<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.420> AMD<00:00:42.660> processors<00:00:43.260> really

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
advantage that AMD processors really

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.680 
advantage that AMD processors really
have<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> real<00:00:44.070> Intel<00:00:44.400> once<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:44.790> a<00:00:44.880> fantastic

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
have a real Intel once it's a fantastic

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.780 
have a real Intel once it's a fantastic
overclocking<00:00:46.620> ability<00:00:47.040> and<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.550> Maki

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
overclocking ability and a Maki

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.270 
overclocking ability and a Maki
potential<00:00:48.540> it's<00:00:49.230> pretty<00:00:49.620> crazy<00:00:49.920> when<00:00:50.160> you

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
potential it's pretty crazy when you

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.920 
potential it's pretty crazy when you
think<00:00:50.520> about<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.850> because<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.090> lot<00:00:51.450> of<00:00:51.480> buyers

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
think about it because a lot of buyers

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.870 
think about it because a lot of buyers
and<00:00:52.200> builders<00:00:52.740> are<00:00:52.890> like<00:00:53.040> believe<00:00:53.490> that<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
and builders are like believe that the

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.540 
and builders are like believe that the
stock<00:00:54.300> performance<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.350> CPU<00:00:55.680> actually

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
stock performance of a CPU actually

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.580 
stock performance of a CPU actually
determines<00:00:57.090> how<00:00:57.180> well<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.600> will<00:00:57.810> form<00:00:58.350> and

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
determines how well it will form and

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.410 
determines how well it will form and
even<00:00:58.920> though<00:00:59.100> that's<00:00:59.250> true<00:00:59.430> to<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.360> certain

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
even though that's true to a certain

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.740 
even though that's true to a certain
extent<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.710> said<00:01:02.100> how<00:01:02.400> much

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
extent it can be said how much

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.569 
extent it can be said how much
performance<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.470> gain<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:05.430> by

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:05.579 
performance you can gain just by

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:07.580 
performance you can gain just by
increasing<00:01:06.030> at<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> clock<00:01:06.720> speed<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.470> all

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
increasing at the clock speed and all

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.280 
increasing at the clock speed and all
Intel<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.220> really<00:01:08.790> good<00:01:09.030> at<00:01:09.329> overclocking

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
Intel is really good at overclocking

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.830 
Intel is really good at overclocking
it's<00:01:10.470> pretty<00:01:11.370> much<00:01:11.520> considered<00:01:12.120> an<00:01:12.240> art<00:01:12.570> with

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
it's pretty much considered an art with

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.860 
it's pretty much considered an art with
AMD<00:01:13.170> processors<00:01:13.920> I'm<00:01:14.420> being<00:01:15.420> completely

AMD processors I'm being completely

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.140 
AMD processors I'm being completely
serious<00:01:16.200> about<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.800> if<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.520> look<00:01:17.790> at<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
serious about this if you look at the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.910 
serious about this if you look at the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
besides the fact and I'm pretty sure

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.980 
besides the fact and I'm pretty sure
that<00:01:32.220> none<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.940> will<00:01:32.970> actually<00:01:33.299> overclock

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
that none of you will actually overclock

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.410 
that none of you will actually overclock
that<00:01:34.290> much<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.130> pretty<00:01:35.400> much<00:01:35.580> goes

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
that much but it's pretty much goes

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.960 
that much but it's pretty much goes
without<00:01:36.720> saying<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.140> AMD<00:01:37.680> does<00:01:38.159> win<00:01:38.549> with

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970

without saying that AMD does win with

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
the overclocking abilities it's also

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.100 
the overclocking abilities it's also
pretty<00:01:41.520> good<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.970> mention<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.540> within<00:01:42.780> so

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
pretty good to mention that within so

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.440 
pretty good to mention that within so
you're<00:01:43.350> pretty<00:01:43.530> sucking<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.250> only<00:01:44.430> select<00:01:45.119> K

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
you're pretty sucking to only select K

you're pretty sucking to only select K

lineup that you can actually overclock

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.710 
lineup that you can actually overclock
but<00:01:50.369> with<00:01:50.460> AMD<00:01:50.790> you're<00:01:51.090> pretty<00:01:51.270> much<00:01:51.450> free<00:01:51.689> to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
but with AMD you're pretty much free to

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.350 
but with AMD you're pretty much free to
overclock<00:01:52.170> any<00:01:52.500> processor<00:01:53.250> whether<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:54.090> new

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
overclock any processor whether it's new

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.719 
overclock any processor whether it's new

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
worth mentioning and it does add so this

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.289

like I said in my last perk that APU

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:49.670 
like I said in my last perk that APU
it's<00:05:47.400> less<00:05:47.969> than<00:05:48.240> $200<00:05:49.020> and<00:05:49.259> you<00:05:49.409> don't<00:05:49.589> even

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
it's less than $200 and you don't even

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.829 
it's less than $200 and you don't even
have<00:05:49.800> to<00:05:49.979> buy<00:05:50.099> a<00:05:50.129> second<00:05:50.759> graphics<00:05:51.150> card<00:05:51.389> you

have to buy a second graphics card you

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:53.240 
have to buy a second graphics card you
just<00:05:52.020> pop<00:05:52.229> that<00:05:52.259> in<00:05:52.620> and<00:05:52.860> you<00:05:52.919> can<00:05:53.069> play

a<00:05:55.289> decent<00:05:56.009> sentence<00:05:56.339> considering<00:05:56.849> how<00:05:57.060> much

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
a decent sentence considering how much

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.230 
a decent sentence considering how much
you<00:05:57.599> paid<00:05:57.930> for<00:05:58.500> that<00:05:58.529> apu<00:05:59.190> i<00:05:59.339> mean<00:05:59.759> it<00:05:59.879> nothing

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
you paid for that apu i mean it nothing

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.879 
you paid for that apu i mean it nothing
in<00:06:00.360> so<00:06:00.509> hats<00:06:00.779> can<00:06:01.020> really<00:06:01.289> beat<00:06:01.529> that<00:06:01.560> and

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
in so hats can really beat that and

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:03.920 
in so hats can really beat that and
that's<00:06:02.069> a<00:06:02.190> giant<00:06:02.490> perk<00:06:02.879> as<00:06:03.150> we're<00:06:03.599> matter<00:06:03.779> of

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.480 
that's a giant perk as we're matter of
fact<00:06:04.139> if<00:06:04.319> you<00:06:04.440> actually<00:06:04.560> live<00:06:04.919> close<00:06:05.219> to<00:06:05.430> a
