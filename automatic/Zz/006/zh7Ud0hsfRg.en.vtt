so<00:03:15.720> there<00:03:15.870> if<00:03:15.960> I<00:03:16.050> have<00:03:16.200> an<00:03:16.290> edge<00:03:16.410> in<00:03:16.760> most

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
so there if I have an edge in most

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.970 
so there if I have an edge in most
situations<00:03:17.970> at<00:03:18.480> least<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:18.900> therefore<00:03:19.770> I<00:03:19.800> can

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
situations at least and therefore I can

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.340 
situations at least and therefore I can
do<00:03:20.100> better<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.550> I<00:03:20.700> enjoy<00:03:21.030> doing<00:03:21.870> good<00:03:22.200> in<00:03:22.320> a

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
domination in those cases it was just

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.800 
domination in those cases it was just
because<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.550> game<00:04:02.730> of<00:04:02.880> so<00:04:03.090> random<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:03.690> be

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810
