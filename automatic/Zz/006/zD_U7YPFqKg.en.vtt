the number of flats those are the number

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.970 
the number of flats those are the number

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.790 
of semitones that it's dropping the
tuning<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:31.180> let's<00:02:31.390> say<00:02:31.510> we<00:02:31.630> want<00:02:31.870> one<00:02:32.080> semitone

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
tuning so let's say we want one semitone

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.550 
tuning so let's say we want one semitone
that<00:02:33.160> is<00:02:33.280> we're<00:02:33.489> tuning<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.330> e-flat<00:02:35.019> instead

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
that is we're tuning to e-flat instead

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.860 
that is we're tuning to e-flat instead

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
we want to set that to 432 Hertz so

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.700 
we want to set that to 432 Hertz so
that's<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.520> equals<00:03:41.030> four<00:03:41.420> we<00:03:42.170> want<00:03:42.350> to<00:03:42.410> set<00:03:42.560> this

we<00:03:47.690> want<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:47.900> be<00:03:47.990> two<00:03:49.570> so<00:03:50.570> we<00:03:50.720> say<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:51.110> is<00:03:51.730> 430<00:03:52.870> 2.0

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
we want to be two so we say a is 430 2.0

backup<00:04:10.610> or<00:04:10.880> anything<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:12.290> now<00:04:12.440> we<00:04:12.500> can<00:04:12.680> check

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
backup or anything and now we can check

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.979 
backup or anything and now we can check
that<00:04:12.980> setting<00:04:13.940> by<00:04:14.120> just<00:04:14.420> turning<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:14.840> power

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
that setting by just turning the power

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.349 
that setting by just turning the power
on<00:04:15.140> it<00:04:15.500> equals<00:04:16.190> four<00:04:16.459> three<00:04:16.880> two<00:04:17.150> point<00:04:18.109> zero

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
on it equals four three two point zero

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.720 
on it equals four three two point zero
and<00:04:20.500> now<00:04:21.500> we're<00:04:21.620> back<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:21.919> normal<00:04:22.040> operation

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.690 
and now we're back to normal operation
and<00:04:23.200> again<00:04:24.200> that<00:04:24.380> can<00:04:24.560> be<00:04:24.590> cleared<00:04:25.040> by<00:04:25.280> simply

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
and again that can be cleared by simply

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.280 
and again that can be cleared by simply

holding down both of these buttons when
we<00:04:27.380> power<00:04:27.620> on<00:04:27.890> and<00:04:28.760> now<00:04:29.000> we're<00:04:29.150> back<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.419> normal
