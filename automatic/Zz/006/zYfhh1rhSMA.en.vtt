00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
look at what happens when you take it

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.800 
look at what happens when you take it
out<00:02:27.989> of<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.200> dock<00:02:28.379> which<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.549> the<00:02:30.540> big<00:02:30.780> thing

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
out of the dock which is the big thing

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.000 
out of the dock which is the big thing
that<00:02:31.459> makes<00:02:32.459> this<00:02:33.080> into<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.470> much<00:02:34.980> more

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
that makes this into a much more

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.490 
that makes this into a much more
friendly<00:02:35.489> device<00:02:35.959> sorry<00:02:36.959> about<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.319> glare
