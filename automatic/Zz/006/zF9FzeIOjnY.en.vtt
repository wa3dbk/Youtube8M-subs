00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.140
 I greet all of you with Belem 1986 and 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.370
 This video is about choosing namely 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.380
 about randomness 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.990
 our favorite game with you and in general I 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.359
 I think it's no secret that 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.730
 there are 20 there are 5 plus minus 25 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.410
 percent scatter of penetration of 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.269
 damage also exist 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.849
 probabilities some kind of application to the module 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.160
 damage that means you can get into the module 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.489
 can cause damage can not cause 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.770
 damage you can from the first shot 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.020
 apply critical damage to the module 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.260
 you can not apply at all that is 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.250
 there I think understood what was going on and in 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.190
 Generally in this video there specifically I 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.610
 show you a little bit of battle will be three 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.239
 shot and they are the most that neither is 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.230
 elective let's see here with us 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.070
 rides from 3 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.129
 i will reduce 2x give the first shot 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.000
 missed look guys I once more 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.520
 click to pause 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.290
 I don't have one in this fight 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.740
 sabot projectile were only 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.619
 armor piercing shells armor penetration 144 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.299
 average maximum there probably somewhere 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.210
 like the subcalera average 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.090
 it may be less may be 202 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.340
 maybe there are 190 with something for sure i am not 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.409
 I remember you can count there plus minus 25 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.329
 percent but no matter there is even 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.110
 maximum armor penetration may not 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.329
 enough most likely 202 it will be like 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.659
 as much as possible armor penetration at the grandmother 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.729
 in general, I understood perfectly what bebeshko 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.360
 I probably will not break Isa the third 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.770
 what I wanted to do I wanted to shoot at 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.649
 caterpillar shot down 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.170
 and to our artillery m 4043 or 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.689
 tomatoes 15 ps arrow about the third one that is 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.250
 my calculation was 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.070
 look further 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:04.400
 did not pierce the nose aimed at the caterpillar and 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.640
 look further guys aim at the caterpillar 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.470
 breaking through 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.680
 at the wildest angle at the wildest angle 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.400
 guys who are interested i can still be me 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.500
 I 'll show you a little bit further with free 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.900
 cameras like a projectile entered but it's just 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.790
 something out there even by the way and trace 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.060
 didn't stay on these third from this 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.750
 the shot there hit the top to points in 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.800
 overall still a little ahead, I probably will show 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:37.590
 so we leave for Isa third 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.560
 somewhere struck in the upper part remains 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.290
 one projectile so here for me shot out 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.440
 and the most interesting guys now 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.270
 look, look and straightens 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.200
 to artillery will now turn over 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.200
 we will accelerate a master key 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:04.240
 so is-3 is already there it seems turned to 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:04.240
 artillery and third shot 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.600
 IS-3 is worth 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:13.280
 Of course not completely overboard, but almost 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:18.760
 stern here turned and in the upper part not 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:21.710
 struck it seems to be the maximum 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.590
 now had to break through but not break through 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.910
 where I was not supposed to break through 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.880
 broke through a 3 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.190
 Now look at these three shots. 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.800
 already by isa the third i 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.530
 approximately I will expose such here 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.110
 the line between me somewhere here and here I stand 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.730
 here are from 3 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.970
 the first shot has now just hit 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.600
 into the ground the next will have to not 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:52.450
 punch Isa third and then 4x speed 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:55.960
 worth let's see is-3 tank rides 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.120
 it will be like this now 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.760
 I am still a little bad at managing 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.760
 free camera first non penetration 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:13.830
 the first non-penetration will now fly 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.830
 the next projectile will reduce to 8x 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:23.199
 here guys are trassir from our shot 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.889
 you just heard the words breaking through 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:31.389
 there must fly chapurin there is something 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:34.590
 139 here it is guys here it is a shot here it is 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:39.580
 projectile which was part of the third Isa 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:42.580
 he will enter this part 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.270
 top to points by the way here and so 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:50.729
 our shell looks like 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.729
 so in general, I'm lost 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:58.870
 so that's all right here at such an angle entered 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.080
 our first shell and into that impression 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.389
 as if the shell ricocheted ricocheted 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.660
 kickbacks from the rink and already entered under the straight 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.610
 the corner here you yourself saw the corner quite 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.490
 seriously i won't guess how much 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.550
 there are degrees and so on 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:18.820
 I can definitely tell you more 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.900
 a little more than 45 degrees in general 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.900
 look further. 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:34.419
 click on pause and let's see 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:35.050
 where our shell went I honestly here 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.810
 I do not understand 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.669
 seemingly not in this thing and want 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.220
 check in training and is it possible 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.200
 damage this armor plate 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.229
 which is above the hull above 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.210
 roof of the hull with no idea here 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.280
 it turns out as if the trace is still in 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.370
 the roof of the projectile it is in the roof of the hull 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.250
 principle i say speak in general 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.590
 at the wildest angle relative to the roof 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.599
 enclosures ie at least 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:06.450
 As for this part, this is not 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:06.450
 wild corner but if we pierced the roof then 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:13.650
 then just go nuts 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.650
 so well we rewind further 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:23.270
 so turning that armor says no 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:26.360
 broken let's see so what have 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:29.270
 there was a corner of us here but a corner of words was 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:33.280
 less than 45 degrees is pretty strong 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:39.830
 less maybe maybe not know 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:42.979
 so reduce the camera speed a little 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:48.979
 overall angle is quite so serious but 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:58.639
 yet so let's look where are we 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:07:02.419
 hit the very top here 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:04.880
 it's honestly incomprehensible how 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:09.020
 way bills but honestly if 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:11.620
 assume that this one here is the top one 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:15.080
 edge on the idea of ​​this armor 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:18.880
 here it is the bulwark below it 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:23.630
 The weld will be hurled by the weld 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:28.130
 bliss that talk so okay in general 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:32.000
 here we didn’t break it in the ground 

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.750
 In general, guys, I think the essence of this video 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.960
 understandably 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:37.690
 tanks such tanks are elective and all 

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.889
 so and so 

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.289
 I hope someone this video yet 

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:43.580
 liked it if we liked like 

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:46.969
 subscribe to the channel 

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:49.599
 I have it all in general good luck to all 

00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:49.599
 and all bye
