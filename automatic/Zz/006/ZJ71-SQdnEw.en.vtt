00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.190
 especially very important video friends 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.010
 surely in your home you will have a 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.809
 laptop or an old summer desktop pc 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.330
 to throw it anyway you stopped 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.460
 use it for old what you mean 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.359
 means a computer with I don't know 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.520
 windows xp windows 98 windows 2000 not 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.210
 we go further because otherwise it is 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.240
 really too old we do up to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.470
 xp ok if you have a pc with xp and in 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.340
 theory had certain 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.460
 features 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.079
 instead of throwing it away there is a solution 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.149
 better to install on it 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.180
 much faster operating system is 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.450
 made for those old PCs then 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.600
 if you have an old computer from the era of 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.570
 xp then 2003 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.860
 I would not go over xp as a system 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.320
 obviously operating because not 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.350
 would hold windows 7 windows 8 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.760
 I'd get debian then there 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.430
 we will focus on these two systems 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.960
 debian and windows 8 operating systems 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.600
 as soon as tutorials on how will be ready 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.450
 install them I'll put them here and in the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.909
 description then debian 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.369
 because I chose debian and ubuntu because 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.310
 not faces but mind was acting up 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.990
 on computers with old video cards 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.950
 and we had to play at the line level 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.170
 command and since it is not so easy 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.670
 then I said better deviates why 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.909
 that at least works right away 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.579
 then download the latest version of 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.810
 debian on the official website of abyan ma 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.900
 even there we will see in the tutorial 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.310
 Do not worry about the installation 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.320
 mastered on the island of debian e 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.810
 install debian on the computer must a 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.479
 system so light that it can 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.659
 run on any computer 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.299
 then if you have a computer from windows 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.549
 view on then native attention 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.049
 windows vista 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.990
 the solution is to put ourselves 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.880
 windows 8 because windows vista is a 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.219
 operating system much heavier than 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.409
 windows xp windows 7 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.170
 the operating system was much more 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.299
 lightweight windows vista windows 8 is a 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.280
 operating system a little lighter than 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.200
 windows 7 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.800
 in the tours I deduce what better then or 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.690
 under windows view to get them to do it 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.460
 work at speed and at best 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.830
 so if you have a native windows pc 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.300
 view how is my laptop was a 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.010
 native basic view 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.710
 put it on windows 8 works 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.290
 wonderfully at startup you will also have 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.090
 an exceptional speed and therefore what 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.130
 make an old laptop on an old laptop 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.440
 fixed pc with basic windows view that i 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.680
 I would put two operating systems there 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.170
 only deviates and not just windows 8 because 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.490
 because you all know there are many 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.190
 programs that only work for 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.920
 microsoft then windows 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.900
 therefore it is better to install first 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.780
 windows 8 and then install debian 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.450
 use this procedure in order 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.520
 first windows 8 and then youtube and sorry 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.459
 diane because this is because if you do 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.310
 conversely you lose the boot at startup 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.810
 windows 8 does not recognize debian and therefore 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.700
 you will not be able to choose at system startup 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.489
 operating instead if the first one is installed 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.650
 windows 8 and then debian gabbiano 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.450
 will also recognize windows 8 startup then 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.340
 at startup you can choose some 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.140
 operating system start sees the 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.850
 configuration I have in my laptop 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.310
 two operating systems at windows startup 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.650
 8 is the dehaven despite using 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.440
 always windows 8 because it goes anyway 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.600
 very well there is no problem 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.280
 debian is also faster on the 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.100
 navigation I must say that it downloads more 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.870
 download faster and faster 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.709
 the operating system and the fantasies 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.000
 so if you take the hand use the debian 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.489
 linux systems are faster here 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.840
 instead the operating systems they had 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:48.720
 xp as maximum I would keep xp then 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.090
 I would only put debian and you will have xp e 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.160
 debian deviate will go faster disks 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.780
 most likely also because it is not 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.400
 linux is not an operating system that 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.890
 the more stuff you load the heavier it gets 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.680
 because I did not register 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.110
 system like windows but everything in 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.200
 linux and file 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.050
 and they do really great then 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.180
 summarizing the maximum pc fin ex p 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.530
 let xp and put deviates not there 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.900
 you will find a lot of operating system 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.180
 faster and you will discover that you can 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.420
 surf keep doing so many 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.580
 things on your computer though 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.340
 you thought no we obviously don't talk 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.260
 videogaming because videogaming if 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.910
 will you manage to give us what you 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.800
 it was not possible until then 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.480
 need to run powerful games 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.220
 the hardware needs the video card 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.560
 etc 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.380
 other things now important to say if 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.500
 can buy yourself a ram block 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.900
 because they cost very little Astana a 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.840
 15 euros I also know are the blocks of 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.390
 ram beaks but they cost 15 euros and 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.180
 you will succeed in aggregating your ma 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.820
 especially if you have a gigabyte of ram 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.370
 so if you have a windows xp or even 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.350
 windows vista 1 gb of ram for me is 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.240
 absolutely necessary to bring them to 2 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.370
 giga game that really make the 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.860
 difference especially gigabytes la 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.900
 difference is not seen much on 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.620
 these pc get caught because if all 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.250
 the old ardor is not seen however by 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.220
 one by two 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.669
 really we also see xp it finds 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:22.400
 so really good debian idem 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.470
 from 1 to 2 gb 2 gb of ram and then 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.760
 mark the ram model 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:30.260
 take the card booklet 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:32.960
 mother of your pc look at that ddr e 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.210
 what megahertz of speed is if not 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.340
 but you know exactly where this manolo 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.010
 how to shut down the computer 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.350
 the slot of the aran but know what the is 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.070
 look for it on google images like this 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.710
 you are not wrong 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.890
 there are two languages on the side 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.760
 open like this and take out the ticket 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.250
 bring it to your trusted retailer 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.050
 this this ticket to do it for 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.320
 show it so it should be 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:00.170
 of the same ddr and the same the same 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.450
 speed guys because ddr why 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:06.830
 Compatibility will not be there functional dr2 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:09.530
 ddr2 but speed if you have a ram 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.360
 speed 800 take a speed ram 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.330
 400 what happens 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.010
 both rams will run at 400 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.810
 because the lower speed is adjusted 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.030
 therefore absolutely not recommended 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.520
 take the same speed as the other 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.900
 block or other blocks then 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.520
 obviously make sure you don't have it 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.940
 run out blocks because there are four 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.160
 blocks 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:32.720
 if you have split 2 56 57 57 56 not 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.150
 you will have more blocks then in that case 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.350
 remove all the blocks in the put 2 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.870
 from 1 gig 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.460
 in short, you see, however, it is absolutely 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.020
 necessary to put a lock will tell why 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.060
 there are too many slowdowns 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.040
 internet will go slower trust me is not 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.600
 just a matter of line and also the 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.780
 computer speed issue 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.190
 so after putting a new ram e 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.690
 all you can put there 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.210
 I say to buy processors 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.190
 new hard drives us why so much 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.080
 it is worth buying a better computer 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.160
 however you will succeed in putting in place 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.210
 a computer make it work 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:07.610
 decently for internet for office for 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.800
 working in short, nothing about programs 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.540
 heavy assembly programs vi 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.800
 let it go if you have to mount it 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.420
 you should take versions of it 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.720
 old but absolutely not those 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.550
 new 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.590
 so you will get a computer 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.720
 perfect and functioning as is mine 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:23.390
 laptop that is not even a dual core 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:28.670
 an old communal intel celeron in con 

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:30.710
 an intel hd ma integrated graphics card 

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.990
 nothing that despite everything with 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:36.230
 damian I can see the blu ray 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:39.590
 no obviously with the blu ray disc or but 

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:42.020
 blue ray mkv digital format I see it 

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.970
 perfectly thanks precisely to ad haven 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.070
 and windows 8 windows 8 works a lot 

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:49.070
 better than windows view much better 

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:52.310
 even more secure and will be supported for 

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:54.890
 along the windows vista I have the day 

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:57.530
 is that because now too old and and is 

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:59.409
 the slower the world is, the more I do 

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:01.149
 I remember once again looking 

00:07:59.409 --> 00:08:03.179
 sign up my two video tutorials 

00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:06.309
 installing video below which is 

00:08:03.179 --> 00:08:06.909
 very simple and that of debian to do
