okay<00:00:01.110> this<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.469> part<00:00:01.740> three<00:00:02.040> of<00:00:02.070> my<00:00:02.340> casseras

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
okay this is part three of my casseras

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.200 
okay this is part three of my casseras
six<00:00:03.240> kilowatt<00:00:03.720> system<00:00:04.279> this<00:00:05.279> is<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.520> quick

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
six kilowatt system this is a quick

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.520 
six kilowatt system this is a quick
video<00:00:06.330> on<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.870> xantrex<00:00:07.529> widget<00:00:08.309> from<00:00:08.670> yahoo

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
video on the xantrex widget from yahoo

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.259 
video on the xantrex widget from yahoo
basically<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.650> giving<00:00:10.950> me<00:00:11.099> real-time<00:00:11.700> numbers

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
basically is giving me real-time numbers

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.770 
basically is giving me real-time numbers
on<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.660> system<00:00:13.110> as<00:00:13.259> far<00:00:13.500> as<00:00:13.650> what<00:00:13.860> it's<00:00:14.009> doing

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
on the system as far as what it's doing

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.930 
on the system as far as what it's doing
trying<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.839> get<00:00:16.020> my<00:00:16.170> angles<00:00:16.529> right<00:00:16.940> basically

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
trying to get my angles right basically

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.189 
trying to get my angles right basically
you<00:00:18.029> can<00:00:18.180> see<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.600> power<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.900> flowing

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
you can see that the power is flowing

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.710 
you can see that the power is flowing
from<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.650> Sun<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.279> also<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:21.090> little<00:00:21.150> bit<00:00:21.449> from

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
from the Sun and also a little bit from

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.189 
from the Sun and also a little bit from
the<00:00:21.930> battery<00:00:22.350> out<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.699> house<00:00:24.199> it's

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
the battery out to the house it's

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.210 
the battery out to the house it's
generating<00:00:25.859> 4.4<00:00:26.519> kilowatts<00:00:27.000> right<00:00:27.300> now<00:00:27.510> and

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
generating 4.4 kilowatts right now and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.099 
generating 4.4 kilowatts right now and
this<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.279> pulled<00:00:29.820> from<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.420> little<00:00:30.599> gateway

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
this is pulled from that little gateway

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.470 
this is pulled from that little gateway
unit<00:00:31.470> every<00:00:31.769> two<00:00:32.099> seconds<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.940> way<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.090> have<00:00:33.360> it

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
unit every two seconds the way I have it

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.990 
unit every two seconds the way I have it
configured<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.739> has<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> tiny<00:00:35.399> little<00:00:35.700> or

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
configured it has a tiny little or

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.750 
configured it has a tiny little or
smaller<00:00:36.390> dock<00:00:36.780> over<00:00:37.110> here<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.829> far<00:00:38.250> side

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
smaller dock over here on the far side

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.799 
smaller dock over here on the far side
which<00:00:39.750> again<00:00:40.050> gives<00:00:40.110> me<00:00:41.120> just<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.239> mini<00:00:42.540> little

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
which again gives me just a mini little

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.690 
which again gives me just a mini little
view<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.290> what's<00:00:43.500> going<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:43.980> with<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.280> system

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
view of what's going on with the system

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.790 
view of what's going on with the system
what<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.600> can<00:00:45.809> do<00:00:45.960> up<00:00:46.079> here<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.260> can<00:00:46.350> click<00:00:46.680> on

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
what I can do up here I can click on

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.060 
what I can do up here I can click on
lifetime<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.700> see<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:47.940> since<00:00:49.070> it

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
lifetime and you can see that since it

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.160 
lifetime and you can see that since it
was<00:00:50.190> about<00:00:50.430> februari<00:00:51.270> March<00:00:51.629> when<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:51.989> brought

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
was about februari March when we brought

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.770 
was about februari March when we brought
up<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.469> first<00:00:52.710> array<00:00:53.070> we've<00:00:53.879> generated<00:00:54.480> a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
up the first array we've generated a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.069 
up the first array we've generated a
total<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.230> six<00:00:55.440> megawatts<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.219> power<00:00:57.079> these

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
total of six megawatts of power these

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.959 
total of six megawatts of power these
estimates<00:00:58.559> down<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:59.070> based<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.699> what<00:00:59.940> my

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
estimates down here based on what my

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.840 
estimates down here based on what my
local<00:01:00.660> energy<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.800> costing<00:01:02.489> me<00:01:02.520> which<00:01:02.820> is

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
local energy is costing me which is

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.030 
local energy is costing me which is
about<00:01:03.270> ten<00:01:03.570> cents<00:01:03.930> per<00:01:04.140> kilowatt<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:04.890> in

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
about ten cents per kilowatt here in

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.750 
about ten cents per kilowatt here in
North<00:01:05.280> Texas<00:01:06.380> I<00:01:07.380> think<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> stuff<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
North Texas I think the stuff on the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.000 
North Texas I think the stuff on the
right<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.240> more<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:09.780> based<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.350> basic

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
right is more just based on basic

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.679 
right is more just based on basic
numbers<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.729> go<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.450> tweak

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
numbers you can go in and you can tweak

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.840 
numbers you can go in and you can tweak
these<00:01:12.869> settings<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:13.979> more<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.280> your<00:01:14.400> own<00:01:14.549> but

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
these settings for more of your own but

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.789 
these settings for more of your own but
this<00:01:15.299> just<00:01:15.450> kind<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.750> gives<00:01:15.960> me<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> nice<00:01:16.409> quick

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
this just kind of gives me a nice quick

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.770 
this just kind of gives me a nice quick
view<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.159> what<00:01:17.490> I've<00:01:17.640> done<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:18.060> fact<00:01:18.330> i'm<00:01:18.479> suppr

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
view of what I've done in fact i'm suppr

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.080 
view of what I've done in fact i'm suppr
i'd<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.439> didn't<00:01:20.189> even<00:01:20.250> realize<00:01:20.670> i<00:01:20.700> had<00:01:20.880> gone

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
i'd just didn't even realize i had gone

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.359 
i'd just didn't even realize i had gone
over<00:01:21.270> six<00:01:21.659> megawatts<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.590> last<00:01:22.799> week<00:01:23.220> or

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
over six megawatts in the last week or

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.929 
over six megawatts in the last week or
so<00:01:24.049> under<00:01:25.049> charts<00:01:25.520> basically<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.759> select

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
so under charts basically you can select

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.630 
so under charts basically you can select
the<00:01:27.210> component<00:01:28.070> either<00:01:29.070> your<00:01:29.340> charge

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the component either your charge

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.270 
the component either your charge

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
controller one or two the inverter

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.609 
controller one or two the inverter
system<00:01:32.909> total<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.509> always<00:01:33.810> usually<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.409> go<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
system total I always usually just go to

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.850 
system total I always usually just go to
the<00:01:34.740> inverter<00:01:35.070> itself<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.470> you<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.650> pick

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the inverter itself and you can pick

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.039 
the inverter itself and you can pick
whether<00:01:38.100> you're<00:01:38.430> doing<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.970> based<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.509> hours

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
whether you're doing it based on hours

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.310 
whether you're doing it based on hours
the<00:01:40.380> day<00:01:40.409> or<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.009> month<00:01:41.369> if<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.540> pull<00:01:42.780> up<00:01:42.810> hours

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the day or the month if I pull up hours

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.350 
the day or the month if I pull up hours
it'll<00:01:43.619> take<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> second<00:01:44.280> here<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.549> calculate

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
it'll take a second here to calculate

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.039 
it'll take a second here to calculate
out<00:01:45.840> what<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.170> done<00:01:46.409> for<00:01:46.439> today<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.869> as<00:01:48.869> we

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
out what it's done for today and as we

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.340 
out what it's done for today and as we
wait<00:01:49.229> patiently

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
wait patiently

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.870 
wait patiently
will<00:01:50.890> give<00:01:51.010> us<00:01:51.159> a<00:01:51.250> nice<00:01:51.430> little<00:01:51.670> graph<00:01:52.030> here<00:01:53.880> ok

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
will give us a nice little graph here ok

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.600 
will give us a nice little graph here ok
this<00:01:55.030> is<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.240> last<00:01:55.479> 24<00:01:56.080> hours<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:57.189> can<00:01:57.369> see

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
this is the last 24 hours you can see

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.940 
this is the last 24 hours you can see
that<00:01:57.640> today<00:01:58.060> I<00:01:58.180> came<00:01:58.690> up<00:01:58.930> a<00:01:59.049> little<00:01:59.380> bit<00:01:59.560> after

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
that today I came up a little bit after

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.389 
that today I came up a little bit after
eight<00:02:00.220> and<00:02:00.810> at<00:02:01.810> that<00:02:01.990> time<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:03.100> a<00:02:03.190> little

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
eight and at that time it's a little

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:04.859 
eight and at that time it's a little
difficult<00:02:03.580> to<00:02:03.880> pick<00:02:04.060> it<00:02:04.180> up<00:02:04.270> in<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.420> camera<00:02:04.780> it

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
difficult to pick it up in the camera it

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.410 
difficult to pick it up in the camera it
was<00:02:04.930> getting<00:02:05.259> about<00:02:05.590> point<00:02:06.490> five<00:02:06.790> kilowatts

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
was getting about point five kilowatts

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.370 
was getting about point five kilowatts
and<00:02:08.259> instantly<00:02:09.250> jumped<00:02:09.759> around<00:02:10.110> later<00:02:11.110> in<00:02:11.290> the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
and instantly jumped around later in the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.190 
and instantly jumped around later in the
day<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:12.090> ten<00:02:13.090> o'clock<00:02:13.300> where<00:02:13.569> I'm<00:02:13.660> getting<00:02:13.780> to

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
day to ten o'clock where I'm getting to

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:22.020 
day to ten o'clock where I'm getting to
and<00:02:14.770> then<00:02:15.010> 3.5<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.470> 4.3<00:02:17.470> at<00:02:17.590> noon<00:02:20.790> not<00:02:21.790> sure

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
and then 3.5 and 4.3 at noon not sure

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.000 
and then 3.5 and 4.3 at noon not sure
why<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.209> picked<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:22.660> up<00:02:22.810> on<00:02:22.959> hours<00:02:23.440> over<00:02:23.800> that

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
why I picked it up on hours over that

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.570 
why I picked it up on hours over that
but<00:02:24.489> that's<00:02:25.269> what<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:25.540> did<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.250> if<00:02:27.250> we<00:02:27.400> just

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
but that's what it did and if we just

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.900 
but that's what it did and if we just
take<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.760> quick<00:02:27.970> look<00:02:28.239> at<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.450> last<00:02:28.750> week

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
take a quick look at the last week

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.059 
take a quick look at the last week
Friday<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.930> was<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:32.110> total<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.620> twenty-two

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
Friday it was a total of twenty-two

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.990 
Friday it was a total of twenty-two
kilowatts<00:02:33.640> Thursday<00:02:34.600> 17<00:02:35.319> we<00:02:35.620> had<00:02:35.739> a

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
kilowatts Thursday 17 we had a

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.300 
kilowatts Thursday 17 we had a
relatively<00:02:37.000> cloudy<00:02:37.390> week<00:02:37.720> we<00:02:37.989> got<00:02:38.110> six<00:02:38.380> eight

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
relatively cloudy week we got six eight

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.509 
relatively cloudy week we got six eight
point<00:02:39.640> six<00:02:39.910> twenty<00:02:40.690> threes<00:02:40.989> here<00:02:41.319> and<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:42.340> on

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
point six twenty threes here and so on

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.330 
point six twenty threes here and so on
so<00:02:43.209> that's<00:02:43.360> basically<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:44.040> there's<00:02:45.040> not<00:02:45.160> much

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
so that's basically it there's not much

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.180 
so that's basically it there's not much
under<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.700> kilowatt<00:02:46.150> other<00:02:46.510> than<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:46.959> just

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
under the kilowatt other than it just

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.430 
under the kilowatt other than it just
minimizes<00:02:48.190> out<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.549> entire<00:02:48.790> thing<00:02:49.019> so<00:02:50.019> that's

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
minimizes out the entire thing so that's

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.170 
minimizes out the entire thing so that's
pretty<00:02:50.769> much<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:50.980> that's<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.640> zen<00:02:51.850> tracks

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
pretty much it that's the zen tracks

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.140 
pretty much it that's the zen tracks
