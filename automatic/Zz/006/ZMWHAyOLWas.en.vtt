00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
this was pretty cool you can walk in my

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.850 
this was pretty cool you can walk in my
cream<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.329> can<00:00:36.540> run<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.410> can<00:00:37.590> dash

the<00:00:38.820> arrow<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.230> pointing<00:00:40.590> downward

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
the arrow that is pointing downward

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.440 
the arrow that is pointing downward
means<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.610> your<00:00:41.730> stamina<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.270> being

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
means that your stamina is being

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.840 
means that your stamina is being
depleted<00:00:42.660> when<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.079> run<00:00:43.340> which<00:00:44.340> makes<00:00:44.640> sense

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
depleted when you run which makes sense

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.940 
depleted when you run which makes sense
because<00:00:45.030> human<00:00:45.450> beings<00:00:45.480> no<00:00:46.440> matter<00:00:46.469> if<00:00:46.800> you're

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
because human beings no matter if you're

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.639 
because human beings no matter if you're
a<00:00:47.010> track<00:00:47.460> star<00:00:47.640> or<00:00:48.270> cross<00:00:48.539> country<00:00:48.840> guy<00:00:49.140> you

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
a track star or cross country guy you

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.459 
a track star or cross country guy you
cannot<00:00:50.010> run<00:00:50.280> forever<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.090> ever<00:00:51.480> amen<00:00:51.600> without

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
cannot run forever and ever amen without

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.689 
cannot run forever and ever amen without
your<00:00:52.649> energy<00:00:52.949> deeply<00:00:53.129> at<00:00:53.250> some<00:00:53.430> point<00:00:53.640> you

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
your energy deeply at some point you

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.240 
your energy deeply at some point you
have<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.820> stop<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.239> get<00:00:54.300> water<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:55.710> very

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
have to stop and get water so it's very

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.860 
have to stop and get water so it's very
realistic<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.789> they<00:00:56.910> added<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.360> stamina

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
realistic that they added the stamina

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.319 
realistic that they added the stamina
effect<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.800> running<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.640> can't<00:00:59.850> run<00:01:00.120> for

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
effect for you running you can't run for

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.540 
effect for you running you can't run for
too<00:01:00.719> long<00:01:00.930> because<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.980> course<00:01:02.160> your<00:01:02.309> stamina

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
too long because of course your stamina

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.850 
too long because of course your stamina
will<00:01:02.820> go<00:01:02.969> down<00:01:03.120> but<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.989> really<00:01:04.320> fair<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
will go down but it's really fair the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.649 
will go down but it's really fair the
way<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.250> lengths<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.790> they<00:01:06.180> allow<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.479> to

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
way the lengths that they allow you to

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.450 
way the lengths that they allow you to
run<00:01:06.990> before<00:01:07.350> you're<00:01:07.680> completely<00:01:07.979> tired<00:01:08.220> out

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
run before you're completely tired out

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.070 
run before you're completely tired out
then<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:08.909> dash<00:01:09.180> which<00:01:09.450> uses<00:01:09.720> up<00:01:09.810> more

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
then you have dash which uses up more

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.289 
then you have dash which uses up more
stamina<00:01:10.439> because<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.189> like<00:01:11.310> sprinting<00:01:11.760> then

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
stamina because it's like sprinting then

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.850 
stamina because it's like sprinting then
they<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> unit<00:01:13.140> raw<00:01:13.350> which<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.680> think

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
they have the unit raw which I think

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.410 
they have the unit raw which I think
it's<00:01:13.979> cool<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.430> having<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> bicycle<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.390> ride

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
it's cool so having a bicycle to ride

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.730 
it's cool so having a bicycle to ride
yourself<00:01:15.840> around<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.290> unlock<00:01:16.409> this

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
yourself around you can unlock this

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.670 
yourself around you can unlock this
thing<00:01:16.979> or<00:01:17.310> buy<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.170> get

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
thing or buy it so that you can get

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.429 
thing or buy it so that you can get
around<00:01:20.150> faster<00:01:21.150> much<00:01:21.659> faster<00:01:21.689> than<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.290> were
