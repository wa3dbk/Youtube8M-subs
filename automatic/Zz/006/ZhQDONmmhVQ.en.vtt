like he can see right there I coaxed her
into<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.200> nest<00:02:16.440> by<00:02:16.910> putting<00:02:17.910> some<00:02:18.120> plastic

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
into the nest by putting some plastic

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.930 
into the nest by putting some plastic
eggs<00:02:18.870> in<00:02:19.080> there<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.980> eventually<00:02:20.250> after<00:02:20.700> a

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
eggs in there and eventually after a

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.729 
eggs in there and eventually after a
couple<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.390> days<00:02:21.600> she<00:02:21.930> went<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.290> sat<00:02:22.500> on<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
couple of days she went and sat on the

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.240 
couple of days she went and sat on the
plastic<00:02:23.580> cakes<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.750> then<00:02:24.989> I<00:02:25.190> took<00:02:26.190> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
plastic cakes and then I took the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.620 
plastic cakes and then I took the
plastic<00:02:26.700> eggs<00:02:26.880> out<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.330> she<00:02:27.450> eventually

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
plastic eggs out and she eventually

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.710 
plastic eggs out and she eventually
started<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:29.489> lay<00:02:29.670> her<00:02:29.820> own<00:02:30.000> egg<00:02:30.239> so<00:02:30.510> she's

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
started to to lay her own egg so she's

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.199 
started to to lay her own egg so she's
now<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.260> think<00:02:31.680> she's<00:02:31.980> got<00:02:32.160> three<00:02:32.519> or<00:02:32.670> four<00:02:32.700> eggs

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
now I think she's got three or four eggs

because the only other spare end I've

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.840 
because the only other spare end I've

brother<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.280> sister<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:54.000> know<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.870> because

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
brother and sister I know this because

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.830 
brother and sister I know this because
they've<00:02:55.350> both<00:02:55.500> got<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:56.130> green<00:02:56.430> rings<00:02:56.790> on<00:02:57.180> the

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
they've both got the green rings on the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.340 
they've both got the green rings on the
lake<00:02:58.050> so<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.769> won't<00:02:59.489> put<00:02:59.730> those<00:02:59.880> together<00:03:00.350> I'm

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
lake so I won't put those together I'm

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.930 
lake so I won't put those together I'm
still<00:03:01.739> keeping<00:03:01.950> them<00:03:02.190> as<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.310> spare<00:03:02.760> because

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
still keeping them as a spare because

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.670 
still keeping them as a spare because
then<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.360> could<00:03:03.420> still<00:03:03.840> lose<00:03:04.079> one<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.560> other

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
then I could still lose one of the other

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.630 
then I could still lose one of the other
intensive<00:03:05.400> hens<00:03:05.730> or<00:03:06.510> or<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.590> even<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.579> I

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
intensive hens or or a even and I

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.930 
intensive hens or or a even and I
might<00:03:08.820> have<00:03:08.850> to<00:03:09.030> swap<00:03:09.360> them<00:03:09.570> around<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:10.940> you

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
might have to swap them around so you

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.069 
might have to swap them around so you
know<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.329> never<00:03:12.450> can<00:03:12.720> tell

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
know you never can tell

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.699 
know you never can tell
whoops<00:03:14.299> so<00:03:15.299> it's<00:03:15.810> not<00:03:15.959> really<00:03:16.290> been<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.470> very

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
whoops so it's not really been a very

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.949 
whoops so it's not really been a very
good<00:03:16.860> stop<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:18.180> say<00:03:18.360> I've<00:03:18.510> never<00:03:18.660> seen

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
good stop to say I've never seen

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.870 
good stop to say I've never seen
anything<00:03:19.200> quite<00:03:19.350> as<00:03:19.769> bad<00:03:21.890> with<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:22.980> Sutil<00:03:23.579> I

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
anything quite as bad with the Sutil I

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.640 
anything quite as bad with the Sutil I
mean<00:03:24.090> normally<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:24.870> would<00:03:24.989> have<00:03:25.079> had<00:03:25.170> probably

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
mean normally I would have had probably

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.319 
mean normally I would have had probably
hens<00:03:26.510> chicks<00:03:27.510> in<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.810> nest<00:03:27.840> now<00:03:28.230> look<00:03:28.440> this

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
hens chicks in the nest now look this

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.130 
hens chicks in the nest now look this
young<00:03:30.329> in<00:03:30.510> there<00:03:30.690> I<00:03:30.930> would<00:03:31.620> normally<00:03:31.769> say<00:03:32.040> up

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
young in there I would normally say up

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.039 
young in there I would normally say up
but<00:03:34.140> chicks<00:03:34.920> feathered<00:03:35.310> up<00:03:35.430> by<00:03:35.640> now<00:03:36.049> nothing

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
but chicks feathered up by now nothing

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.140 
but chicks feathered up by now nothing
like<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:38.459> whether<00:03:38.700> it's<00:03:38.910> been<00:03:39.120> the

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
like this so whether it's been the

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.289 
like this so whether it's been the
weather<00:03:39.420> conditions<00:03:40.280> I<00:03:41.280> don't<00:03:41.910> really<00:03:42.090> know

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
weather conditions I don't really know

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.000 
weather conditions I don't really know
because<00:03:42.450> we<00:03:42.690> came<00:03:42.900> from<00:03:42.959> a<00:03:43.230> really<00:03:43.709> cold

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
because we came from a really cold

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.630 
because we came from a really cold
winter<00:03:44.130> this<00:03:44.670> year<00:03:44.970> in<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.420> UK<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:47.370> then<00:03:47.549> the

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
winter this year in the UK and then the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.319 
winter this year in the UK and then the
spring<00:03:48.090> was<00:03:49.079> straight<00:03:49.440> into<00:03:49.769> hot<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.700> don't

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
spring was straight into hot so I don't

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.720 
spring was straight into hot so I don't
know<00:03:51.390> if<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.600> birds<00:03:51.870> think<00:03:52.410> quite<00:03:52.650> know<00:03:52.950> what

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
know if the birds think quite know what

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:54.349 
know if the birds think quite know what
hit<00:03:53.940> them

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
hit them

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.220 
hit them
but<00:03:55.130> we<00:03:56.130> say<00:03:56.400> eventually<00:03:57.000> on<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.540> way<00:03:57.959> now

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
but we say eventually on the way now

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.640 
but we say eventually on the way now
