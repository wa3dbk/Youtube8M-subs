00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
for this you have to build I would

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.080 
for this you have to build I would
suggest<00:00:50.340> building<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.649> two<00:00:52.649> ply<00:00:53.090> double

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
