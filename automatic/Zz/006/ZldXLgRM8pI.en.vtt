00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210 

this<00:00:00.359> is<00:00:00.539> the<00:00:00.750> walkthrough<00:00:01.260> for<00:00:01.560> the<00:00:01.709> sewers

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
this is the walkthrough for the sewers

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.249 
this is the walkthrough for the sewers
hell<00:00:02.460> this<00:00:02.820> is<00:00:03.000> where<00:00:03.210> you<00:00:03.330> start<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:03.899> get

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
hell this is where you start to get

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.970 
hell this is where you start to get
there<00:00:05.120> there's<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.210> door<00:00:06.660> that<00:00:06.690> leads<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.470> here

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
there there's a door that leads to here

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.970 
there there's a door that leads to here
and<00:00:08.130> then<00:00:08.700> this<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.840> area<00:00:10.200> that<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.620> like<00:00:10.889> to

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
and then this is the area that I like to

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.049 
and then this is the area that I like to
call<00:00:11.099> hell<00:00:11.340> just<00:00:11.820> goes<00:00:12.090> all<00:00:12.330> red<00:00:12.599> there's<00:00:12.900> lava

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
call hell just goes all red there's lava

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.279 
call hell just goes all red there's lava
so<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.150> go<00:00:15.269> through<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.630> door<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.020> warp

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
so you go through this door in the warp

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.400 
so you go through this door in the warp
gate<00:00:16.529> room<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.240> that<00:00:18.240> will<00:00:18.510> bring<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:18.990> into

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
gate room and that will bring you into

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.519 
gate room and that will bring you into
this<00:00:19.619> room<00:00:19.920> where<00:00:20.400> there's<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.699> qubit<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.529> you

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
this room where there's a qubit and you

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.630 
this room where there's a qubit and you
just<00:00:22.710> need<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.949> lower<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> water<00:00:28.640> after

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
just need to lower the water after

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.730 
just need to lower the water after
you've<00:00:29.820> lowered<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.300> water<00:00:30.480> you'll<00:00:31.080> notice<00:00:31.529> a

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
you've lowered the water you'll notice a

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.639 
you've lowered the water you'll notice a
tetris<00:00:32.309> code<00:00:32.520> wall<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.989> code<00:00:34.350> for<00:00:34.380> that

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
tetris code wall and the code for that

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.389 
tetris code wall and the code for that
is<00:00:35.120> right<00:00:36.120> up<00:00:37.160> left<00:00:38.160> down<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:40.160> left<00:00:41.160> trigger

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
is right up left down a left trigger

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.319 
is right up left down a left trigger
right<00:00:42.210> trigger<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.730> that<00:00:44.730> will<00:00:44.879> get<00:00:45.030> you

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
right trigger a and that will get you

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.380 
right trigger a and that will get you
into<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.320> hellish<00:00:46.770> looking<00:00:47.219> area<00:00:50.059> so<00:00:51.059> I'm

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
into this hellish looking area so I'm

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.360 
into this hellish looking area so I'm
going<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.690> quickly<00:00:52.230> fast-forward<00:00:53.129> through

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
going to quickly fast-forward through

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.959 
going to quickly fast-forward through
some<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.559> it's<00:00:55.559> pretty<00:00:55.890> simple<00:00:56.190> slow

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
some of this it's pretty simple slow

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.590 
some of this it's pretty simple slow
down<00:00:57.149> at<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.410> more<00:00:58.410> difficult<00:00:58.590> part<00:00:59.600> right

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
down at the more difficult part right

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.569 
down at the more difficult part right
here<00:01:00.780> you're<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:00.989> scaling<00:01:01.469> up<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.920> rotating

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
here you're just scaling up and rotating

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.299 
here you're just scaling up and rotating
to<00:01:02.879> get<00:01:03.090> out<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.359> way

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
to get out of the way

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.500 
to get out of the way
bars

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.420 

and<00:01:08.110> you'll<00:01:08.260> have<00:01:08.410> to<00:01:08.560> do<00:01:08.710> this<00:01:08.860> too<00:01:09.130> quickly

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
and you'll have to do this too quickly

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.550 
and you'll have to do this too quickly
but<00:01:09.760> the<00:01:10.000> lava<00:01:10.330> is<00:01:10.630> rising<00:01:11.230> underneath<00:01:11.620> you

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
but the lava is rising underneath you

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.470 
but the lava is rising underneath you
this<00:01:14.560> is<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.830> tricky<00:01:15.160> part<00:01:15.190> right<00:01:15.520> here<00:01:15.760> now

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
this is the tricky part right here now

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.090 
this is the tricky part right here now
you<00:01:16.510> have<00:01:16.690> to<00:01:16.810> time<00:01:17.050> your<00:01:17.080> jumps<00:01:17.590> just<00:01:17.860> right

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
you have to time your jumps just right

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.160 
you have to time your jumps just right
wait<00:01:18.490> till<00:01:18.670> they<00:01:18.790> click<00:01:19.150> and<00:01:19.480> do<00:01:19.720> that<00:01:19.900> little

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
wait till they click and do that little

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.460 
wait till they click and do that little
subtle<00:01:20.560> move<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.760> then<00:01:22.300> jump<00:01:22.690> otherwise

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
subtle move and then jump otherwise

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.870 
subtle move and then jump otherwise
you'll<00:01:23.650> fall<00:01:23.680> like<00:01:24.070> that<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:27.400> you'll<00:01:27.550> get<00:01:27.730> the

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
you'll fall like that so you'll get the

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.160 
you'll fall like that so you'll get the
hang<00:01:28.030> of<00:01:28.180> it<00:01:28.330> don't<00:01:28.600> worry<00:01:28.750> if<00:01:28.840> you<00:01:28.900> fall<00:01:29.140> a

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
hang of it don't worry if you fall a

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.920 
hang of it don't worry if you fall a
couple<00:01:29.290> times<00:01:29.800> cuz<00:01:30.420> you've<00:01:31.420> got<00:01:31.600> plenty<00:01:31.780> of

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
couple times cuz you've got plenty of

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.429 
couple times cuz you've got plenty of
time

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.649 

and<00:01:37.649> once<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.100> get<00:01:38.219> here<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:39.030> wait<00:01:39.240> till<00:01:39.569> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
and once you get here just wait till the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.779 
and once you get here just wait till the
lava<00:01:39.899> gets<00:01:40.170> there<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:41.189> can't<00:01:41.429> do<00:01:41.579> anything

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
lava gets there you can't do anything

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:47.480 
lava gets there you can't do anything
else<00:01:43.159> so<00:01:44.159> just<00:01:44.270> simply<00:01:45.270> right<00:01:45.750> up<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:47.369> as

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
else so just simply right up and as

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.099 
else so just simply right up and as
you're<00:01:47.640> writing<00:01:47.789> up<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.240> wrote<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.689> before

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.109 
you're writing up just wrote a before

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.190 
you're writing up just wrote a before
you<00:01:49.259> bar<00:01:49.740> don't<00:01:50.189> rotate<00:01:50.490> too<00:01:51.000> early<00:01:51.450> because

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
you bar don't rotate too early because

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.709 
you bar don't rotate too early because
there<00:01:52.619> are<00:01:52.829> bars<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.490> don't<00:01:53.880> see<00:01:54.179> that<00:01:54.509> will

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
there are bars you don't see that will

00:01:54.719 --> 00:02:00.140 
there are bars you don't see that will
kill<00:01:54.929> you<00:01:55.170> touch

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.810 

so<00:02:00.510> just<00:02:00.750> try<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.350> wait<00:02:01.980> close<00:02:02.400> the<00:02:02.610> last

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
so just try to wait close the last

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.730 
so just try to wait close the last
second

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.240 

there<00:02:09.280> you<00:02:09.370> go<00:02:09.520> and<00:02:10.000> make<00:02:10.900> sure<00:02:11.080> you're<00:02:11.740> being

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
there you go and make sure you're being

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.650 
there you go and make sure you're being
careful<00:02:12.550> when<00:02:12.820> you<00:02:12.910> jump<00:02:13.150> off<00:02:13.270> this<00:02:13.420> top

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
careful when you jump off this top

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.940 
careful when you jump off this top
platform<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.400> little<00:02:15.820> glitchy<00:02:16.540> I<00:02:16.950> fell

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
platform is a little glitchy I fell

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.770 
platform is a little glitchy I fell
through<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.520> couple<00:02:18.910> times<00:02:19.120> like<00:02:19.390> there<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.780> I

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
through a couple times like there and I

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.160 
through a couple times like there and I
also<00:02:22.990> fell<00:02:23.530> through<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.100> middle<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.550> it<00:02:24.760> right

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
also fell through the middle of it right

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.880 
also fell through the middle of it right
here<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.970> just<00:02:28.420> take<00:02:28.960> your<00:02:28.990> time<00:02:29.290> when<00:02:29.770> you're

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
here so just take your time when you're

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:37.770 
here so just take your time when you're
trying<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.370> jump<00:02:30.580> over<00:02:30.730> there

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.360 

and<00:02:37.960> here<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:38.380> go<00:02:38.530> you've<00:02:38.710> got<00:02:38.890> your<00:02:39.040> anti
