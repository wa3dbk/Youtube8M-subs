00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.569
 Borisovich 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.730
 I am a dentist and communication with questions 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.460
 which my patients often ask me i 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.410
 decided to make such a vlog in 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.500
 which answer to your interest 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.289
 questions and topics of our today's 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.439
 talk I'd like to introduce to your 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:28.400
 attention is not a new prosthesis 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.400
 what are the advantages and disadvantages 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.530
 first show you 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.100
 not the main prosthesis is such a design 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.540
 and it happens a lot 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.860
 variety of materials is called 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.860
 acres retro freebie 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.890
 many options that are such here 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.580
 prosthetic brush you can see that they are only 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.200
 color different good advantage 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.180
 such prostheses 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:04.940
 that is, this prosthesis does not contain 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:10.820
 whether polymers of monomers is not a layer of us 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:13.729
 This is not his thermoplastic plastic 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.460
 cartel they do not cause a person 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.060
 allergic reactions contact with 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.520
 mucous 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:25.550
 will not cause allergy hypoallergenic 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.940
 what else these dentures do not need 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.040
 dental treatment is not necessary for them 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.649
 grind your teeth do not need to cover teeth 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.210
 crowns this is not necessary then 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.960
 there is enough to take a cast and 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.040
 make all the necessary manipulations 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.009
 that is, the teeth under them 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:47.650
 remain completely undamaged 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.930
 intact untrained nothing else 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.690
 also the advantage is that 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.410
 this process is single ie it is not 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.210
 absorbs the water smells 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.430
 all that Anna Kushina is also not herself 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.500
 perceives just before him enough 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.860
 take care sell wash clean 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.900
 soap with a toothbrush and it will 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.530
 strict enough hygiene 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:15.000
 the required data of the prostheses as well 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:19.120
 advantage of light these color 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.180
 transparency in simple plastic 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:27.340
 teeth that used to see grandmothers 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:30.720
 our money they are pink here 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.709
 here pink color do not miss here 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.590
 transparency ie aesthetic 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.770
 the character is here shining through 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.080
 your mucous accordingly the process 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:45.520
 has the color that you have 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.950
 flowery benefits too also on 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.480
 one important thing is the same quality of this 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:56.700
 protest prosthesis has elasticity then 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.930
 have see prosthetic elastic 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:04.080
 the same denture is beige it has elasticity 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.269
 that is, he does not go for a break that is 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.680
 simple plastic prosthesis I can not 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:13.550
 absolutely because it would break 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:16.080
 one hundred percent i don't have you accuracy but 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.900
 also there is a slight drawback i wouldn't 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.970
 advised to do a full removable denture 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.739
 that is, if you do not have teeth in your mouth, I would 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.970
 advised to do not new prosthesis 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.890
 because these prostheses are hard 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.590
 relocations that is over time our 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.110
 mucous dropping 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.860
 where it is in contact with the prosthesis 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.110
 pritaptyvaem pritaptyvaem 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.030
 formed it should be an empty space 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.860
 replace what it is to add again 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.030
 plastic 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.430
 add again publicity this is called 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.910
 relocation nylon process such 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:53.790
 I do not have that here either have to change 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:59.420
 prosthesis new to do either with this 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.420
 bouncing denture what else 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.360
 I would advise to do better and there 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.640
 where are still teeth then he will 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.530
 good 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.940
 prosthesis that will serve pretty 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.330
 arguments about what I would like today 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.420
 talk again show how 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.420
 nylon prostheses 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:29.730
 quite aesthetically pleasing in the cavity imperceptibly 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.730
 no wonder I am also called invisible
