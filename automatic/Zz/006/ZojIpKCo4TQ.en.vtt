00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.170 
ready to accept the bronze well in the

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.310 
ready to accept the bronze well in the
case<00:00:11.349> of<00:00:11.530> steel<00:00:11.830> when<00:00:12.460> it's<00:00:12.640> red-hot<00:00:13.320> then

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
case of steel when it's red-hot then

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.300 
case of steel when it's red-hot then
that's<00:00:14.650> when<00:00:14.860> you<00:00:14.950> put<00:00:15.130> you<00:00:15.390> put<00:00:16.390> the<00:00:17.310> brazing

that's when you put you put the brazing

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.169 
that's when you put you put the brazing
rod<00:00:18.340> in<00:00:18.730> between<00:00:19.119> the<00:00:19.269> flame<00:00:19.599> and<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.880> metal

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:22.179 
rod in between the flame and the metal

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.599 
rod in between the flame and the metal
to<00:00:22.300> be<00:00:22.390> braised<00:00:22.739> but<00:00:23.739> another<00:00:23.980> way<00:00:24.189> to<00:00:24.249> check

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:24.609 
to be braised but another way to check

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:34.500 
to be braised but another way to check
just<00:00:30.179> get<00:00:31.179> your<00:00:31.329> metal<00:00:31.569> hot<00:00:33.090> just<00:00:34.090> hit<00:00:34.300> one

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
just get your metal hot just hit one

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.939 
just get your metal hot just hit one
little<00:00:34.630> spot<00:00:35.110> and<00:00:35.940> if<00:00:36.940> it<00:00:37.090> flows<00:00:37.769> then<00:00:38.769> you're

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
little spot and if it flows then you're

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.020 
little spot and if it flows then you're
okay<00:00:39.280> you're<00:00:39.820> ready<00:00:40.030> to<00:00:40.210> go

now<00:00:44.510> on<00:00:44.660> a<00:00:44.720> piece<00:00:44.900> of<00:00:44.930> copper<00:00:46.900> sometimes<00:00:47.900> it's

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
now on a piece of copper sometimes it's

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.430 
now on a piece of copper sometimes it's
a<00:00:48.230> little<00:00:48.320> more<00:00:48.470> difficult<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:49.130> see<00:00:50.260> okay<00:00:51.260> with

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
a little more difficult to see okay with

00:00:51.440 --> 00:01:05.770 
a little more difficult to see okay with
fear

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.980 

just<00:01:06.530> kind<00:01:07.130> of<00:01:07.220> touch<00:01:07.490> it<00:01:07.670> there<00:01:07.910> and<00:01:08.300> you<00:01:08.840> can

just kind of touch it there and you can
see<00:01:09.230> whether<00:01:09.410> it's<00:01:09.650> ready<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:10.010> be<00:01:10.220> brave

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.160 

now<00:01:18.600> I'm<00:01:19.600> using<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.350> scraped

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
now I'm using the scraped

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.899 
now I'm using the scraped
332nd<00:01:23.170> flux<00:01:23.470> covered<00:01:23.920> brazing<00:01:24.369> rod<00:01:24.399> that<00:01:24.820> was

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
332nd flux covered brazing rod that was

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.510 
332nd flux covered brazing rod that was
covered<00:01:25.270> in<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.659> video<00:01:26.619> brazing<00:01:27.280> with<00:01:27.399> the

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
covered in the video brazing with the

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.670 
covered in the video brazing with the
oxygen<00:01:28.060> acetylene<00:01:28.149> torch<00:01:29.549> now<00:01:31.259> I'm<00:01:32.259> brazing

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
oxygen acetylene torch now I'm brazing

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:44.399 
oxygen acetylene torch now I'm brazing
along<00:01:32.950> here<00:01:36.030> now<00:01:37.030> if<00:01:37.119> you'll<00:01:37.270> watch<00:01:37.450> this

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
can you hear that sound and you see the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.930 
can you hear that sound and you see the
smoke<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.909> means<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.479> metal<00:01:49.720> is<00:01:49.990> too<00:01:50.260> hot<00:01:50.940> so

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
smoke that means the metal is too hot so

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.760 
smoke that means the metal is too hot so
anytime<00:01:52.120> you<00:01:52.540> get<00:01:52.720> this<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:56.350> remove<00:01:56.650> your

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
anytime you get this just remove your

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.850 
anytime you get this just remove your
torch<00:01:57.040> away<00:01:57.280> a<00:01:57.310> little<00:01:57.520> bit<00:01:58.440> just<00:01:59.440> let<00:01:59.619> it<00:01:59.710> cool

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
torch away a little bit just let it cool

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.100 
torch away a little bit just let it cool
off<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.460> you<00:02:00.940> can<00:02:01.090> go<00:02:01.210> back<00:02:01.240> to<00:02:01.690> it<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:04.840> keep

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
off and you can go back to it just keep

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.920 
off and you can go back to it just keep
that<00:02:05.290> in<00:02:05.350> mind

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
that in mind

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:21.190 
that in mind
so<00:02:07.930> we're<00:02:08.050> brazing<00:02:08.440> along<00:02:08.709> here

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.110 

-<00:02:22.200> hot<00:02:23.360> just<00:02:24.360> pull<00:02:24.629> it<00:02:24.750> away<00:02:25.790> didn't<00:02:26.790> take<00:02:26.939> long

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
- hot just pull it away didn't take long

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:36.259 
- hot just pull it away didn't take long
for<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.540> cool<00:02:27.659> down<00:02:27.720> just<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.319> second<00:02:35.269> and

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
for it to cool down just a second and

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.199 
for it to cool down just a second and
then<00:02:36.530> now<00:02:37.530> another<00:02:38.190> thing<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.670> may<00:02:38.909> happen

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
then now another thing that may happen

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.050 
then now another thing that may happen
is<00:02:39.920> that<00:02:42.560> get<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.680> brazing<00:02:44.159> rod<00:02:44.190> it's<00:02:44.730> stuck

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
is that get the brazing rod it's stuck

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.860 
is that get the brazing rod it's stuck
on<00:02:45.299> there<00:02:46.340> now<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.459> first<00:02:47.760> reaction<00:02:48.659> that<00:02:48.690> I

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
on there now the first reaction that I

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.789 
on there now the first reaction that I
would<00:02:49.140> have<00:02:49.319> would<00:02:49.560> be<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.769> pull<00:02:50.579> it<00:02:50.700> away<00:02:51.799> so

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
would have would be to pull it away so

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.280 
would have would be to pull it away so
you've<00:02:52.890> got<00:02:53.069> your<00:02:53.190> parts<00:02:53.519> all<00:02:53.700> laid<00:02:53.909> out<00:02:53.940> in<00:02:54.390> a

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
you've got your parts all laid out in a

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.009 
you've got your parts all laid out in a
certain<00:02:55.590> position<00:02:56.209> then<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.510> pull<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.870> away

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
certain position then you pull it away

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.240 
certain position then you pull it away
you're<00:02:58.530> going<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.709> move<00:02:58.889> everything<00:02:59.220> so<00:03:00.000> just

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
you're going to move everything so just

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.819 
you're going to move everything so just
gently<00:03:02.250> go<00:03:02.489> back<00:03:02.670> in<00:03:02.879> there<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.299> we<00:03:03.540> melt<00:03:03.810> it

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:29.150 

okay<00:03:07.829> the<00:03:07.980> rods<00:03:08.190> stuck<00:03:10.430> just<00:03:11.430> melt<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.150> off

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.550 

now<00:03:30.160> another<00:03:30.459> thing<00:03:30.580> is<00:03:30.819> when<00:03:31.240> you<00:03:31.560> first

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
now another thing is when you first

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.970 
now another thing is when you first
start<00:03:32.680> braising<00:03:34.080> there's<00:03:35.080> a<00:03:35.200> good<00:03:35.470> chance<00:03:35.739> you

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
start braising there's a good chance you

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.420 
start braising there's a good chance you
going<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.520> get<00:03:36.670> some<00:03:36.880> globs<00:03:38.069> see<00:03:39.069> if<00:03:39.130> I<00:03:39.220> can<00:03:39.340> get

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
going to get some globs see if I can get

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:48.090 
going to get some globs see if I can get
some<00:03:39.640> blobs<00:03:40.000> here<00:03:46.260> maybe<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.470> base<00:03:47.680> metal

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
some blobs here maybe the base metal

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.550 
some blobs here maybe the base metal
wasn't<00:03:48.280> hot<00:03:48.580> enough<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:49.780> it<00:03:50.050> just<00:03:50.260> kind<00:03:50.500> of

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
wasn't hot enough and it just kind of

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.760 
wasn't hot enough and it just kind of
globs<00:03:50.890> up

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.180 

okay<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:57.480> know<00:03:57.630> ideally<00:03:58.110> we<00:03:58.500> want<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:58.770> to<00:03:58.890> flow

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
okay you know ideally we want it to flow

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.210 
okay you know ideally we want it to flow
just<00:03:59.460> like<00:03:59.610> we<00:03:59.760> did<00:03:59.910> over<00:03:59.940> here<00:04:00.500> but<00:04:01.500> we<00:04:01.860> can<00:04:02.040> go

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
just like we did over here but we can go

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:10.700 
just like we did over here but we can go
back<00:04:02.430> in<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:05.630> remount<00:04:06.630> this<00:04:06.990> I<00:04:09.560> got<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.650> be

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
back in and remount this I got to be

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.830 
back in and remount this I got to be
careful<00:04:10.920> I<00:04:11.100> don't<00:04:11.250> get<00:04:11.370> it<00:04:11.460> too<00:04:11.640> hot<00:04:14.660> play<00:04:15.660> the

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
careful I don't get it too hot play the

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:27.610 
careful I don't get it too hot play the
flame<00:04:16.140> across<00:04:16.560> there

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.280 

we'd<00:04:28.620> rather<00:04:28.830> not<00:04:29.100> have<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.610> globs<00:04:30.080> but<00:04:31.080> if<00:04:31.170> we

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
we'd rather not have the globs but if we

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:40.330 
we'd rather not have the globs but if we
get<00:04:31.470> them<00:04:32.120> we<00:04:33.120> can<00:04:33.420> kind<00:04:34.380> of<00:04:34.470> smooth<00:04:34.950> that<00:04:35.400> out

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.160 

now<00:04:41.340> that<00:04:41.520> this<00:04:41.610> is<00:04:41.790> all<00:04:41.940> cleaned<00:04:42.240> up<00:04:42.390> you<00:04:42.990> can

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
now that this is all cleaned up you can

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.020 
now that this is all cleaned up you can
see<00:04:43.880> we<00:04:44.880> got<00:04:45.030> nice<00:04:45.570> looking<00:04:45.960> bronze<00:04:46.230> in<00:04:46.590> here

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
see we got nice looking bronze in here

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.390 
see we got nice looking bronze in here
so<00:04:48.030> even<00:04:48.210> though<00:04:48.390> you<00:04:48.450> get<00:04:48.660> these<00:04:48.810> globs<00:04:49.400> you

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
so even though you get these globs you

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.890 
so even though you get these globs you
can<00:04:50.580> go<00:04:50.730> back<00:04:51.020> and<00:04:52.020> just<00:04:52.550> flow<00:04:53.550> them<00:04:53.900> right

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
can go back and just flow them right

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:07.390 
can go back and just flow them right
with<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.380> torch<00:04:56.660> smoothes<00:04:57.660> it<00:04:57.900> out

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.460 

you
