which can be quite tricky so just so you

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.549 
which can be quite tricky so just so you
kind<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.420> your<00:00:33.450> scene<00:00:33.780> set<00:00:34.050> up<00:00:34.170> here<00:00:34.380> and

you go to mograph text object any edge

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.490 
you go to mograph text object any edge
kind<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.480> e-text<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.320> say<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.530> type<00:00:41.059> Connor

key<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.540> Sony<00:01:33.930> Vegas<00:01:34.020> what<00:01:34.470> effects<00:01:34.920> it

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
key that in Sony Vegas what effects it

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.370 
key that in Sony Vegas what effects it
it<00:01:35.610> doesn't<00:01:35.909> leave<00:01:36.000> its<00:01:36.150> crisp<00:01:36.420> edges<00:01:36.659> as<00:01:36.990> you

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
it doesn't leave its crisp edges as you

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.550 
it doesn't leave its crisp edges as you
like<00:01:37.909> so<00:01:38.909> what<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.420> are<00:01:39.570> going<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.840> do<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.439> we're

up<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.930> 1<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:15.200> we're<00:02:16.200> going<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.380> be<00:02:16.470> using<00:02:16.860> 0<00:02:17.100> to

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
up to 1 and we're going to be using 0 to

up to 1 and we're going to be using 0 to
20<00:02:17.460> that's<00:02:17.610> going<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.790> be<00:02:17.850> our<00:02:17.970> time<00:02:18.180> line<00:02:18.390> so

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
20 that's going to be our time line so

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.170 
20 that's going to be our time line so
for<00:02:19.020> example<00:02:19.350> go<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.500> keyframe<00:02:19.950> 1<00:02:20.310> gonna

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
for example go to keyframe 1 gonna

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.350 
for example go to keyframe 1 gonna
generally<00:02:21.570> set<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:21.990> up<00:02:22.200> here<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:23.120> maybe<00:02:24.120> go

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
generally set this up here and maybe go

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.580 
generally set this up here and maybe go
back<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.720> bit<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:26.660> just<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.750> little<00:02:27.810> keyframe<00:02:28.410> 1

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
back a bit and just a little keyframe 1

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.980 
back a bit and just a little keyframe 1
go<00:02:29.310> forward<00:02:29.760> by<00:02:29.940> 20<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:32.450> move<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.690> forward

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
go forward by 20 and move it forward

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.910 
go forward by 20 and move it forward
again<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:35.120> hit<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.209> keyframe<00:02:36.780> ban<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.800> if

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
again and hit the keyframe ban and if

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.290 
again and hit the keyframe ban and if
you<00:02:38.010> go<00:02:38.160> from<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.430> beginning<00:02:38.880> you'll<00:02:39.000> notice

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
you go from the beginning you'll notice

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.800 
you go from the beginning you'll notice
that<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.540> comes<00:02:39.810> forward<00:02:40.850> like<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:41.880> now<00:02:42.570> at<00:02:42.720> the

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
that it comes forward like so now at the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.810 
that it comes forward like so now at the
stage<00:02:43.020> we<00:02:43.200> want<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.470> render<00:02:43.650> now<00:02:44.310> first<00:02:44.580> things

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
stage we want to render now first things

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.250 
stage we want to render now first things
first<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:45.300> want<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.450> go<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.630> where<00:02:46.140> we're

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
first you want to go to where we're

channel<00:03:24.630> ticked<00:03:24.900> as<00:03:25.049> well<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:26.720> that's<00:03:27.720> it

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
channel ticked as well and that's it

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.479 
channel ticked as well and that's it
so<00:03:28.380> just<00:03:28.650> go<00:03:28.739> ahead<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:28.980> render<00:03:29.130> this<00:03:29.340> out

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
so just go ahead and render this out

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.690 
so just go ahead and render this out
here<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:31.049> same<00:03:31.320> will<00:03:31.709> happen<00:03:31.980> you<00:03:32.549> won't

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
here the same will happen you won't

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.400 
here the same will happen you won't
notice<00:03:32.880> much<00:03:33.299> difference<00:03:33.330> but<00:03:34.200> for<00:03:34.260> example

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
notice much difference but for example

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.160 
notice much difference but for example
if<00:03:34.799> we<00:03:34.860> go<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:35.040> shift<00:03:35.940> our<00:03:36.209> which<00:03:36.600> is<00:03:36.630> render

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
if we go to shift our which is render

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.500 
if we go to shift our which is render
and<00:03:37.830> we'll<00:03:38.549> just<00:03:38.700> kind<00:03:38.850> of<00:03:38.880> render<00:03:39.239> this<00:03:39.329> out

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
and we'll just kind of render this out

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.860 
and we'll just kind of render this out
here<00:03:40.190> here<00:03:41.190> we<00:03:41.340> go<00:03:43.280> it<00:03:44.280> will<00:03:44.489> be<00:03:44.720> doesn't<00:03:45.720> take

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
here here we go it will be doesn't take

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.280 
here here we go it will be doesn't take
that<00:03:45.989> long

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
that long

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.630 
that long
you<00:03:46.500> know<00:03:46.620> nice<00:03:46.799> settings<00:03:47.160> have<00:03:47.280> really<00:03:47.489> been

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
you know nice settings have really been

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.350 
you know nice settings have really been
added<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.239> is<00:03:48.390> quite<00:03:49.230> basic<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.920> know

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
added and it is quite basic you know

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.509 
added and it is quite basic you know
there<00:03:51.360> we<00:03:51.420> go<00:03:51.540> it's<00:03:51.720> rendered<00:03:52.079> 220<00:03:52.500> go<00:03:53.160> into

there we go it's rendered 220 go into

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.640 
there we go it's rendered 220 go into
