 fifa 15 we have a second boy 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.840
 qualifying round for the national team we 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.570
 play against Finland and we need three 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.670
 point went today coach decided 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.160
 change a bit the composition of artyom jub 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.460
 today on the edge and we instead Kerzhakov 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.719
 on the left flank of the attack, well, let's see 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.540
 what will come of it 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:46.039
 over there we are on the far cork 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:50.070
 well we removed the football player protection 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.420
 shot on goal any it's just yours 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.250
 game ahead of the curve 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.250
 but it did not work 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.210
 excellent djuba kick on goal here 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:18.060
 it was cool guys this wall 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:22.830
 I liked everything very cool 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:27.830
 played and Artem dzuba scores on 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.830
 the sixth minute of the match we made an assist 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.310
 here a good tooth pass runs right there 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:40.410
 already looked near corner but the goalkeeper is here 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.830
 confused as well as protection rather 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.790
 Total 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:49.320
 and again the coach decides after the downtrodden 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:55.040
 ball right there to play defensively i don't 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:58.040
 I understand why so play a great pass 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.040
 cool 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:07.230
 but 20 here was all played like 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.220
 we have nuts today vladimir fast 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:13.190
 see how the national team changes but it 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:19.230
 corporate style we clean the ball 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:21.060
 Good pass fifth goal for the national team and 20 we 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.630
 stayed out on top 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.290
 and friends we have a break like this 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:32.510
 the time of the first half is over 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.510
 Belgians are playing with the English 0 0 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.910
 well, we don't care even win this 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.580
 match will not give 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.760
 points for the second place 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.590
 more at first but still the same 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.709
 more matches will be meeting so us 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.709
 you need to try to win them 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:06.950
 in the attack in the attack Finns submission discount under 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.720
 blow well and could our guys could 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.750
 take out the ball 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:19.620
 Well, now our turn is Artem 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:23.069
 Dziuba I could skok cope perfectly as 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.709
 varla hiv penalty and no how well 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:36.019
 cool just like skating rushed 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:41.129
 and sorry not scored good pass pass and 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:43.579
 were able to come off korzhakov well 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.579
 finish off 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.510
 Igor Denisov where such blows just in 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:55.360
 put an empty corner but no he managed 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.360
 rule far and still didn't hit 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.230
 good was the attack of Kerzhakov 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:10.880
 after our class is very worthy 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.750
 kerzhakov oh what a mistake of the broads 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.299
 but why 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.910
 and write and the goalkeeper could not even take 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:20.479
 such a blow I wanted to say why 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:28.700
 so weak but for the goalkeeper this punch 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:31.150
 was unexpected kerzhakov cool 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.150
 cool 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:39.970
 kick on goal and corner ten minutes 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:42.930
 the last we started for the battle came out 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.930
 place wide 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.430
 excellent pass but it does not work out 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.210
 He left the ball out of bounds 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:14.840
 do not look at the ball in the field Berezutsky 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:14.840
 mistakes need to work out 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:23.790
 attack 7 5 minutes before the end 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.130
 but too far and makeev from sin 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:30.330
 far knocks the ball to the corner but there 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.930
 was already offside getting closer and closer end 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.930
 match 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:48.460
 shows the goalkeeper go out and go 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.180
 I will beat forward there away and 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:55.710
 Eremenko's novel could be hooked but 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.710
 teammates could not help him 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.010
 fighting off well 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.320
 so what is the stock but why not give 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.450
 ok on the move but one is just one 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.970
 Vadim I ran out 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:31.480
 Taras good clean tackle and still 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:34.330
 just one guys and all the final whistle 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.460
 three more points we are in our piggy bank 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.670
 national team 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:42.970
 throwing 1 assists 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:47.260
 and one goal the Belgians still could 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:49.530
 win the english next meeting have 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:53.800
 us again for real madrid 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:07:01.630
 we will be in the starting lineup but I wanted 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:05.080
 would look at the successes of the national team so 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:07.930
 we look at the third place we have one 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.660
 one point difference with the British so 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.460
 I think we can still get out of 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.050
 groups if we try to put on 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.880
 more thumbs up leave your 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:19.919
 comments with you were okey great 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.919
