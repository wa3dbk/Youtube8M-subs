about a very interesting concept the old
drop<00:00:03.870> tine<00:00:04.140> has<00:00:04.259> come<00:00:04.500> up<00:00:04.680> with<00:00:04.890> this<00:00:05.460> is<00:00:05.609> the

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
drop tine has come up with this is the

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.760 
drop tine has come up with this is the
arrow<00:00:06.089> drag<00:00:06.540> system<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.140> essentially<00:00:07.589> what

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
arrow drag system and essentially what

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.799 
arrow drag system and essentially what
it<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.340> piece<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.730> rubber<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.570> has<00:00:09.780> a

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
it is is a piece of rubber that has a

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.530 
it is is a piece of rubber that has a
big<00:00:10.170> swivel<00:00:10.620> on<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.889> end<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.309> big<00:00:11.940> clip<00:00:12.210> on<00:00:12.420> the

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
big swivel on the end a big clip on the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.870 
big swivel on the end a big clip on the
back<00:00:12.719> kind<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.080> like<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.259> fishing<00:00:13.700> steel<00:00:14.700> leader

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
back kind of like a fishing steel leader

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.160 
back kind of like a fishing steel leader
or<00:00:15.150> something<00:00:15.330> similar<00:00:15.630> like<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.139> I

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
or something similar like that and I

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.109 
or something similar like that and I
wonder<00:00:16.350> what's<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:16.920> going<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.310> do<00:00:17.430> well

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
wonder what's this going to do well

wonder what's this going to do well
first<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.600> all<00:00:18.779> we'll<00:00:18.960> start<00:00:18.990> out<00:00:19.289> with<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
first of all we'll start out with the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.679 
first of all we'll start out with the
wick<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.430> an<00:00:20.550> old<00:00:20.699> drop<00:00:20.939> tine<00:00:21.240> wick<00:00:21.480> and

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
wick this is an old drop tine wick and

wick this is an old drop tine wick and
all<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.109> does<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.619> slides<00:00:22.949> right<00:00:23.100> on<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
all this does is it slides right on the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.200 
all this does is it slides right on the
swivel<00:00:23.789> it's<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.539> simple<00:00:25.039> and<00:00:26.039> we've<00:00:27.029> all

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
swivel it's that simple and we've all

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.269 
swivel it's that simple and we've all
done<00:00:27.420> drags<00:00:27.720> before<00:00:28.170> they're<00:00:28.590> kind<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:28.920> messy

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
done drags before they're kind of messy

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.279 
done drags before they're kind of messy
they're<00:00:29.490> inconvenient<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.900> old<00:00:31.050> drop

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
they're inconvenient as the old drop

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.900 
they're inconvenient as the old drop
tine<00:00:31.560> got<00:00:31.769> together<00:00:31.980> started<00:00:32.579> thinking<00:00:32.820> about

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
tine got together started thinking about

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.280 
tine got together started thinking about
a<00:00:33.059> way<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.300> make<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.600> convenient<00:00:34.260> for

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
a way to make it convenient for

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.600 
a way to make it convenient for
everybody<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.040> first<00:00:35.280> thing<00:00:35.489> they

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
everybody and the first thing they

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.450 
everybody and the first thing they
thought<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.840> one<00:00:37.079> thing<00:00:37.460> that

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
thought of is what is the one thing that

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.450 
thought of is what is the one thing that
every<00:00:38.730> hunter<00:00:38.969> carries<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> woods<00:00:40.460> it's

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
every hunter carries to the woods it's

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.520 
every hunter carries to the woods it's
an<00:00:41.550> arrow<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:42.090> all<00:00:42.239> take<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> bunch<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.320> arrows

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
an arrow we all take a bunch of arrows

an arrow we all take a bunch of arrows
ooh<00:00:43.739> woods<00:00:44.070> for<00:00:44.219> obvious<00:00:44.640> reasons<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.239> this

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
ooh woods for obvious reasons and this

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.810 
ooh woods for obvious reasons and this
in<00:00:46.230> conjunction<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.219> makes<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
in conjunction with this makes the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.250 
in conjunction with this makes the
perfect<00:00:48.059> drag<00:00:48.390> system<00:00:48.660> let<00:00:48.809> me<00:00:48.899> show<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.140> how

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
perfect drag system let me show you how

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.529 
perfect drag system let me show you how
this<00:00:49.410> works<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.460> swivel<00:00:50.940> actually<00:00:51.329> has<00:00:51.510> a

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
this works the swivel actually has a

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.209 
this works the swivel actually has a
little<00:00:51.870> clip<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.350> end<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:53.070> open

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
little clip in the end so that it's open

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.549 
little clip in the end so that it's open
it's<00:00:53.550> it's<00:00:54.180> broken<00:00:54.660> just<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.260> what<00:00:55.530> you

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
it's it's broken just like that what you

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.400 
it's it's broken just like that what you
do<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.100> unscrew<00:00:56.840> the<00:00:57.840> head<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.379> little

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
do is you unscrew the head just a little

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.599 
do is you unscrew the head just a little
bit<00:00:59.000> you<00:01:00.000> slide<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.510> swivel<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.489> crank<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
bit you slide the swivel on crank the

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.509 
bit you slide the swivel on crank the
head<00:01:02.789> back<00:01:03.000> down<00:01:03.270> tight<00:01:04.189> yeah<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.309> kind<00:01:05.489> of

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
head back down tight yeah it kind of

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.070 
head back down tight yeah it kind of
looks<00:01:05.700> sort<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.000> fishing<00:01:06.479> rod<00:01:06.630> almost

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
looks sort of like fishing rod almost

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.380 
looks sort of like fishing rod almost
but<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.950> way<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.310> works<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:09.060> hang<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
but the way this works just hang the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.820 
but the way this works just hang the
arrow<00:01:09.570> down<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.110> side<00:01:10.320> while<00:01:10.680> you're

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
arrow down to the side while you're

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.740 
arrow down to the side while you're
walking<00:01:11.010> while<00:01:11.310> you're<00:01:11.430> doing<00:01:11.610> your<00:01:11.640> drag<00:01:12.000> you

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
walking while you're doing your drag you

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.240 
walking while you're doing your drag you
drag<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.200> wick<00:01:13.380> through<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> areas<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:13.979> you

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
simple now here's where this gets even

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.080 
simple now here's where this gets even
better<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:19.009> lot<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.159> guys<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.700> take<00:01:20.909> this

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
better a lot of guys like to take this

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.820 
better a lot of guys like to take this
and<00:01:21.299> hang<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.780> tree<00:01:21.810> somewhere<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.770> you

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
and hang it in a tree somewhere so you

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.670 
and hang it in a tree somewhere so you
can<00:01:22.950> kind<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.159> get<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.490> deer<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.850> stop<00:01:24.680> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
can kind of get that deer to stop the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.340 
can kind of get that deer to stop the
diameter<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.549> cord<00:01:26.970> just<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.659> happens<00:01:28.110> to

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
diameter of this cord just so happens to

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.030 
diameter of this cord just so happens to
fit<00:01:28.500> perfectly<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:29.460> your<00:01:29.840> nock<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:31.890> when
