00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.569
 one can come to understand all the 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.220
 let's say the accumulation of what happens 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.080
 and the campaign around the management of 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.509
 race that is magnificent and that is 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.670
 indisputable for all, even for their 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.920
 detractors but it would not be so lenient 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.660
 with this situation with these expressions 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.020
 Here is a question of substance 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.990
 it seems that when you make a mistake you have falls 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.550
 in what happens to many politicians 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.109
 that is the punitive look there is 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.179
 clarify that for criminal law this is not 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.740
 crime or for randazzo or for anyone 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.430
 it's not a crime at best it's a 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.200
 contravention without correspondence 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.760
 it is legally required to initiate actions 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.719
 civilians against parents so that 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.789
 pay the supposed damage if yes it is that 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.680
 this is a damage and I can understand that 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.780
 It's not right that we do not like that 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.460
 trains are in the context of everything 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.199
 what has been done and how you want it 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.350
 strengthen and what's happening with 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.329
 the trains but it seems to me that strictly 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.250
 you can not really take a boy a 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.680
 juvenile institution nor even if 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.519
 five minutes for painting a graffiti that 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.890
 I would not say 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.810
 vandalism I would stay with the question 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.429
 about if they are not artistic expressions 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.130
 to see what it looks like if it looks like a 

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:16.020
 crime looks positive or looks like 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.820
 a transgression of all cases I need 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.560
 a standard economic compensation for 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.210
 part of the parents I can not believe 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.819
 that this is presented with an expression 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:33.270
 artistic much more attentive to your home 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:37.920
 I truly believe that the column 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:46.530
 it seems that it is a painting the role of 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:48.659
 the artists an important effort that 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.909
 makes the state to put the trains and 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.349
 it turns out that there are two kids who do not have 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.289
 best idea I wanted to express your art there 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:57.209
 the summit of a graffiti artist painting a 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:03.409
 300 that every time I care about painting 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:03.409
 about the envelope with the reason 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:12.050
 litter about public goods 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.050
 It seems like it does not matter to me 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:25.140
 culture 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.940
 the political and political recipes and 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.980
 on the walls of the properties 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.170
 private and then with that criterion are 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.790
 a crime is harm too and because 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.010
 the rooms naturalized and not the 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.810
 we condemn and do not get anyone 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.420
 we lock up anyone because he paints the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.390
 lurch 2015 for example if the culture 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.269
 on the bottom begins with the knife to 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.950
 breaking all not all seats 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.470
 we can respect that because it's part of 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:56.459
 the culture of the underwear keeps going and 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:58.730
 people follow equality is not a 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.730
 seat 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.459
 like a mockery the deluded Argentines 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.049
 who traveled on a new train we can not 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.580
 based on hypotheses that did not happen I have 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.090
 to analyze what is happening in the 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.980
 first 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.120
 write that he is in the house of the three 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.120
 is on the street 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.069
 after defending anything 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:41.370
 excuse me to return with the currencies that 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:45.230
 send a child to an institute of 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.230
 minors because it is illegal 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:00.239
 obviously there will be responsibility but 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.920
 jorobar is difficult because delay by 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.599
 at least an institute of illegality 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.329
 the one who did that illegality for someone 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:13.190
 who was the head of the household 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.190
 at the market door 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:24.100
 the world here the windows that without 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:26.830
 supported and we are and we are but it is not 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.240
 back but nobody is going worse is the 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.130
 of the minors' institute and someone 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.419
 he did that and it's obviously illegal 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.419
 will have to comply with justice 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:05:02.310
 all the arguments that I have to be 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.310
 overwhelmed
