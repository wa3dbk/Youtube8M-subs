wire tape but that's you know that's

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.859 
wire tape but that's you know that's
pretty<00:01:53.040> tight

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.260 

but<00:01:56.770> I<00:01:56.799> want<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.219> do<00:01:57.340> if<00:01:57.609> I<00:01:57.789> want<00:01:57.969> to<00:01:58.060> get<00:01:58.149> it

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
but I want to do if I want to get it

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.300 
but I want to do if I want to get it
better<00:01:58.479> a<00:01:58.630> simpler<00:01:59.170> way<00:01:59.289> of<00:01:59.320> doing<00:01:59.619> this<00:01:59.740> just

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
better a simpler way of doing this just

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.899 
better a simpler way of doing this just
go<00:02:00.520> back<00:02:00.759> a<00:02:00.789> little<00:02:01.000> ways<00:02:01.920> put<00:02:02.920> an<00:02:03.039> overhand<00:02:03.520> or

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
go back a little ways put an overhand or

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.819 
go back a little ways put an overhand or
as<00:02:04.479> I<00:02:04.719> do<00:02:04.780> with<00:02:04.990> a<00:02:05.079> figure<00:02:05.350> of<00:02:05.380> eight<00:02:05.619> because

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
as I do with a figure of eight because

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.249 
as I do with a figure of eight because
it's<00:02:06.069> just<00:02:06.189> easier<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.579> undo<00:02:06.969> if<00:02:07.840> I<00:02:07.960> have<00:02:08.110> the

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
it's just easier to undo if I have the

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.759 
it's just easier to undo if I have the
Rope<00:02:08.440> part<00:02:09.599> then<00:02:10.599> you<00:02:10.720> do<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.959> same<00:02:11.200> thing<00:02:11.470> you

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
Rope part then you do the same thing you

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.979 
Rope part then you do the same thing you
go<00:02:11.950> around<00:02:12.450> or<00:02:13.450> whatever<00:02:13.599> you're<00:02:13.810> going<00:02:13.930> to

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
go around or whatever you're going to

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.559 
go around or whatever you're going to
cinch<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.379> to<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.890> then<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.610> run<00:02:15.819> your<00:02:15.849> rope

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
cinch it to and then you run your rope

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:25.050 
cinch it to and then you run your rope
end<00:02:17.519> through<00:02:18.519> the<00:02:18.580> loop<00:02:18.879> here<00:02:20.459> okay<00:02:24.060> now

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
end through the loop here okay now

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.240 
end through the loop here okay now
essentially<00:02:25.810> created<00:02:26.379> a<00:02:26.470> sort<00:02:26.680> of<00:02:26.769> a<00:02:26.890> three<00:02:27.129> to

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
essentially created a sort of a three to

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.309 
essentially created a sort of a three to
one<00:02:27.280> pulley<00:02:27.640> system<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.209> I'm<00:02:28.599> pulling<00:02:28.810> nylon

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
one pulley system and I'm pulling nylon

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.050 
one pulley system and I'm pulling nylon
on<00:02:29.560> nylon<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.040> know<00:02:30.250> that's<00:02:30.579> a<00:02:30.670> terrible<00:02:31.000> thing

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
on nylon I know that's a terrible thing

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.280 
on nylon I know that's a terrible thing
then<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:34.209> nylon<00:02:34.599> nap<00:02:34.870> seas<00:02:35.110> are<00:02:35.200> gonna

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
then the the nylon nap seas are gonna

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.990 
then the the nylon nap seas are gonna
get<00:02:35.560> me<00:02:35.739> but<00:02:36.220> I'm<00:02:36.459> here<00:02:36.730> come<00:02:36.970> on<00:02:37.030> get<00:02:37.269> me<00:02:39.000> and

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
get me but I'm here come on get me and

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.850 
get me but I'm here come on get me and
then<00:02:40.239> now<00:02:40.750> when<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:41.019> cinch<00:02:41.349> it<00:02:41.500> up<00:02:43.650> now<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.709> can

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
then now when I cinch it up now you can

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.160 
then now when I cinch it up now you can
just<00:02:44.950> pinch<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.400> here<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.810> don't<00:02:49.989> lose

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
just pinch it here and you don't lose

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.600 
just pinch it here and you don't lose
any<00:02:50.379> tension<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.299> just<00:02:52.299> take<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.480> bite<00:02:53.610> they're

and<00:03:04.090> I<00:03:04.270> just<00:03:04.480> do<00:03:04.600> an<00:03:04.720> overhand<00:03:05.110> to<00:03:05.260> tie<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:05.500> off

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
and I just do an overhand to tie it off

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.390 
and I just do an overhand to tie it off
for<00:03:06.760> safety<00:03:07.120> sake<00:03:07.620> cause<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.860> always<00:03:09.010> want<00:03:09.160> to

pretty<00:03:15.670> tight<00:03:16.290> tighter<00:03:17.290> than<00:03:17.500> I<00:03:17.650> could<00:03:17.890> by

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
pretty tight tighter than I could by

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.010 
pretty tight tighter than I could by
just<00:03:18.190> pulling<00:03:18.670> on<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:18.940> anyhow<00:03:19.240> that's<00:03:19.660> called

the trucker's hitch okay so I'll use two
different<00:03:23.110> colors<00:03:23.380> of<00:03:23.770> tape<00:03:24.550> here<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:24.820> I'm

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
different colors of tape here and I'm

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.490 
different colors of tape here and I'm
gonna<00:03:25.090> join<00:03:25.330> them<00:03:25.540> together<00:03:25.660> using<00:03:26.080> a<00:03:26.260> water

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
gonna join them together using a water

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.500 
gonna join them together using a water
knot<00:03:26.740> or<00:03:26.980> a<00:03:27.010> tape<00:03:27.310> not<00:03:27.520> I<00:03:27.580> guess<00:03:27.910> it's<00:03:28.120> commonly

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
knot or a tape not I guess it's commonly

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.500 
knot or a tape not I guess it's commonly
called<00:03:28.750> also<00:03:29.070> so<00:03:30.070> first<00:03:30.490> off<00:03:30.730> I<00:03:30.970> just<00:03:31.000> put<00:03:31.390> an

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
called also so first off I just put an

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.640 
called also so first off I just put an
overhand<00:03:32.880> into<00:03:33.880> my<00:03:34.390> piece<00:03:34.630> of<00:03:34.810> tape<00:03:34.990> keeping

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
overhand into my piece of tape keeping

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.270 
overhand into my piece of tape keeping
the<00:03:35.830> tape<00:03:36.310> nice<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:36.820> flat<00:03:37.440> okay<00:03:38.440> make<00:03:39.070> sure<00:03:39.130> I

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
the tape nice and flat okay make sure I

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.810 
the tape nice and flat okay make sure I
have<00:03:39.490> lots<00:03:39.790> of<00:03:40.000> tail<00:03:40.240> there<00:03:41.550> you<00:03:42.550> know<00:03:42.640> how<00:03:42.760> it

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
have lots of tail there you know how it

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.310 
have lots of tail there you know how it
is<00:03:42.880> guys<00:03:43.150> you<00:03:43.450> can't<00:03:43.630> have<00:03:43.780> too<00:03:43.930> much<00:03:44.050> tail

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
retrace this knot so that the red tail

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:03.440 
retrace this knot so that the red tail
here<00:03:57.100> is<00:03:57.220> going<00:03:57.370> to<00:03:57.430> come<00:03:57.550> out<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.790> other<00:03:57.820> end
