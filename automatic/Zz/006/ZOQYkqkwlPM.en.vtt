it's solidly cast as opposed to hollow

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.050 
it's solidly cast as opposed to hollow
casting<00:01:13.910> you<00:01:14.660> see<00:01:14.930> here<00:01:15.230> these<00:01:15.610> hooks<00:01:16.610> on<00:01:16.940> the

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
casting you see here these hooks on the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.960 
casting you see here these hooks on the
base<00:01:17.240> which<00:01:17.960> were<00:01:18.290> there<00:01:18.650> to<00:01:19.010> actually<00:01:19.250> attach

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
base which were there to actually attach

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.560 
base which were there to actually attach
a<00:01:20.240> pole<00:01:20.540> and<00:01:20.840> carry<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.530> bronze<00:01:21.850> so<00:01:22.850> bronzes

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
a pole and carry the bronze so bronzes

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.270 
a pole and carry the bronze so bronzes
like<00:01:23.780> this<00:01:23.990> could<00:01:24.260> be<00:01:24.290> carried<00:01:24.920> in<00:01:25.100> procession

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
like this could be carried in procession

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.570 
like this could be carried in procession
outside<00:01:25.940> of<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.510> temples<00:01:26.990> for<00:01:27.500> people<00:01:27.980> to

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
outside of the temples for people to

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.110 
outside of the temples for people to
engage<00:01:28.850> with<00:01:29.180> her<00:01:29.750> and<00:01:30.020> have<00:01:30.530> that<00:01:31.120> exchange

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
engage with her and have that exchange

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.350 
engage with her and have that exchange
with<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:33.230> goddess<00:01:35.140> we<00:01:36.140> are<00:01:36.260> dating<00:01:36.440> it<00:01:36.710> around

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
with the goddess we are dating it around

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.510 
with the goddess we are dating it around
1100<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:39.230> this<00:01:39.380> is<00:01:39.410> sort<00:01:39.740> of<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:39.890> high<00:01:40.100> point<00:01:40.400> of

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
1100 so this is sort of a high point of

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.830 
1100 so this is sort of a high point of
chola<00:01:40.760> period<00:01:40.880> early<00:01:42.070> bronzes<00:01:43.070> have<00:01:44.030> rounder

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
chola period early bronzes have rounder

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.920 
chola period early bronzes have rounder
subtle<00:01:45.650> beautiful<00:01:46.220> forms<00:01:46.820> later<00:01:47.420> against<00:01:47.840> a

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
subtle beautiful forms later against a

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.990 
subtle beautiful forms later against a
little<00:01:48.170> more<00:01:48.530> heavyset<00:01:49.160> maybe<00:01:49.580> in<00:01:49.820> a<00:01:49.880> little

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
little more heavyset maybe in a little

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.750 
little more heavyset maybe in a little
bit<00:01:50.180> more<00:01:50.360> angular<00:01:50.720> but<00:01:51.650> this<00:01:51.770> is<00:01:51.920> really<00:01:52.130> a

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
bit more angular but this is really a

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.170 
bit more angular but this is really a
superb<00:01:53.690> example<00:01:53.930> of<00:01:54.500> very<00:01:54.860> large<00:01:55.130> size<00:01:55.490> at<00:01:55.790> the
