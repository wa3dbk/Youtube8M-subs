buttons<00:00:18.750> these<00:00:19.380> buttons<00:00:19.920> all<00:00:20.189> need<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.699> be

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
buttons these buttons all need to be

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.420 
buttons these buttons all need to be
programmed<00:00:21.449> by<00:00:21.570> your<00:00:22.289> phone<00:00:22.560> administrator
