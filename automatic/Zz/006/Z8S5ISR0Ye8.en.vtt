00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.910
 in this analysis of the game dragon ball z 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.349
 battle of z had not been for a long time 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.169
 we had a game of dragon ball in 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.599
 conditions for good console that in 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.620
 conditions is a saying and let's see 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.870
 why 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.030
 the problem that battle or zeta has is 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.890
 just his legacy because in the past 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.570
 other games like the franchise of the 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.329
 ships to put an example put 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.430
 ready very high so much that this game by 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.160
 misfortune does not come and rushes from 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.769
 bad way if one thing they have done well 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.350
 is to innovate that can not be denied 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:58.129
 but who are really looking for fans of 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.620
 dragon ball innovation live once more 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.300
 manga stories the answer 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.100
 it really is a lot harder than 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.080
 that seems like the story has already been 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.300
 repeated over and over again throughout the 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.250
 day many games but never in a way 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.929
 totally faithful you have to say so what 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.000
 it could then be accused of being 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:16.789
 little innovative and you need to break away from 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.149
 something new but if it moves away from the handle 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:21.979
 original will not like fans so much 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.590
 as you really see the answer is a 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.179
 dilemma battle or zeta offers us a 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.009
 game style totally different to 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.659
 the previous known games we 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.520
 we will find before a game to play 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.670
 in cooperative because that is his trick 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.470
 principal 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.610
 this makes it a very game 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.040
 interesting to play online 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.600
 cooperative but not local because we 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.610
 we find before the first game of 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.860
 dragon ball without multiplayer in it 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.600
 console due to the change of gameplay 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.920
 the story that we will find in the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.140
 game will be more focused on the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.789
 cooperative four players that 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.740
 covers from the arrival of the aliens to 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.479
 the earth until the saga debut a 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.399
 special emphasis on the new movie 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.610
 dragonball released in the past year 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.680
 2013 graphically although the game continues 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.479
 being the cepsi of the characters have 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.700
 a more realistic aspect by making 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.590
 look like plasticine there will be people who 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.630
 you like there will be people watching me 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.690
 personally I do not like it and would prefer 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.400
 a style closer to the anime as soon as 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.200
 to its playability we will realize that 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.910
 have taken a step backwards because many 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.010
 Sometimes we are faced with a mechanical 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.140
 simple and repetitive that makes the 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.000
 game gain ease of control but 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.290
 that limits in a brutal way the 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.510
 playability 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.129
 this little depth in the system of 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.840
 combat that often seems that 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.819
 There are certain automatisms about 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.349
 that we do not have new control will make the 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.439
 people lose interest in the title of 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.810
 progressive way in the end this 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:42.329
 battle of eta is not a bad game but if 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.730
 is right and maximum in everything and unfortunately 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.409
 still not the game of dragon ball z 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.319
 that we all look forward to 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.390
 we will have to keep waiting 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.189
 this is a game that I would recommend so 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.569
 only the fans who really want 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.489
 to try a new game dragon ball 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.290
 although personally I would recommend before 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.290
 a title rental that is your purchase
