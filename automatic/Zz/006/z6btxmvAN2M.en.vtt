on how much space you need for the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.940 
on how much space you need for the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
application so you can focus on one big

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.340 
application so you can focus on one big
application<00:02:38.160> two<00:02:38.880> smaller<00:02:39.209> ones<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:40.200> then

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
application two smaller ones and then

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.860 
application two smaller ones and then
you<00:02:40.470> can<00:02:40.590> also<00:02:40.830> swap<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.550> windows<00:02:41.880> around<00:02:42.030> and

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
you can also swap the windows around and

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.240 
you can also swap the windows around and
as<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.170> can<00:02:43.320> see<00:02:43.350> here<00:02:43.800> when<00:02:43.950> you're<00:02:44.070> swapping

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
as you can see here when you're swapping

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.280 
as you can see here when you're swapping
the<00:02:44.520> windows<00:02:44.790> around<00:02:44.940> it's<00:02:45.390> very<00:02:45.690> seamless

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
the windows around it's very seamless

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.590 
the windows around it's very seamless
and<00:02:46.500> dynamic<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:47.430> multi<00:02:47.850> tasking<00:02:48.270> is<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.390> very

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
and dynamic so multi tasking is a very

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.410 
and dynamic so multi tasking is a very
fluid<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.200> efficient<00:02:49.770> so<00:02:50.550> on<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.120> bottom

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
fluid and efficient so on the bottom

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.900 
fluid and efficient so on the bottom
here<00:02:51.660> samsung<00:02:52.590> did<00:02:52.739> away<00:02:52.980> with<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.220> menu<00:02:53.730> she

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
here samsung did away with the menu she

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.449 
here samsung did away with the menu she
so<00:02:54.120> now<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.300> have<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.510> multi<00:02:54.930> tasking<00:02:55.470> p<00:02:55.709> and

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
so now you have a multi tasking p and

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.190 
so now you have a multi tasking p and
you<00:02:56.820> can<00:02:56.970> just<00:02:57.150> close<00:02:57.360> application<00:02:57.630> by

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
you can just close application by

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.740 
you can just close application by
swiping<00:02:58.500> up<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:59.700> menu<00:03:00.000> key<00:03:00.180> has<00:03:00.330> now<00:03:00.540> been

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
swiping up the menu key has now been

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.840 
swiping up the menu key has now been
moved<00:03:00.870> inside<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.530> application<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:02.610> can

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
moved inside the application so you can

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.520 
moved inside the application so you can
just<00:03:02.880> happen<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.480> corner<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.020> it<00:03:04.170> will<00:03:04.260> pull
