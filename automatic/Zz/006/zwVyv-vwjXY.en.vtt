00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.160
 hello people welcome to a new video 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.810
 of recipe here one for all today 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.480
 let's show you how to make a recipe 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.849
 easy very simple and they are mini pizza 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.530
 homemade that we did in the transmission in 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.530
 I live a week ago 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.019
 I do not really want to cheat you 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.289
 let's do if I'm honest with you 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.090
 They are visits known as pesetas and 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.919
 they can also make it with the common bread 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.509
 just like that but all this that we are going to 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.399
 do is more for an aesthetic question 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.320
 to make it more beautiful more sporadic 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.290
 that are round and look like 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.420
 true mini pizzas made in a way 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.540
 homemade and the best thing is that they will be 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.610
 made in 10 minutes at most 15 with 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.610
 the vacation and for this we are going to 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.620
 need the following ingredients 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.969
 first let's give cheese in threads with 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.289
 these types of cheese that come as 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.250
 grated cheese 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:00.589
 let's use some tomato olives 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.510
 to season, let's use salt and 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.179
 oregano and to make our pieces 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.950
 let's make bread in this case 

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:08.690
 we will also be using a cup 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.810
 the bigger the mouth the rate 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.250
 better but you do not have to exceed the width 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.840
 of bread 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.270
 and one more thing for those who do not 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.130
 know that it's the cheese in a thread in this 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.840
 case here in Argentina already what 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.820
 they market like this is like cheese 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.610
 grated and here we have four cheeses 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.680
 have a month to not use the give and it is 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.330
 with a tub but if you do not want to do it like that 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.400
 and they want to spend less or work a 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.200
 little else can they buy it and grate 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.969
 yourselves 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.770
 let's start our minutisa 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.409
 taking one of the slices of bread 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.270
 shape or bread mold and let's cut 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.009
 with the rate in this way the edges 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.200
 let's save to do any 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.659
 another thing later now let's start 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.610
 to crush the part of the center to 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.079
 give it the shape of mini pizza remember 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.079
 that this is an aesthetic issue 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.450
 the next step would be to cut the 'red' 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.450
 of tomato as finite as possible 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.860
 what we just did to crush 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.539
 the bread in the middle of the edge a little 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.030
 wider is also something like 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.560
 unnecessary they can do it or not but if 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.480
 they do it will be much more 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.220
 crispy and the other thing is that we 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.319
 we are going to use tomato sauce but 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.840
 the tomatoes that we already cut, we're going to 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.269
 put like this because in this way what 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.640
 we achieve is that tomato sauce does not 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.140
 deserve the bread because it's like wet 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.610
 much bread and then we have left 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.830
 crispy is like we 're going to 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.049
 break the pickaxe then we go to 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.660
 do this way now let's put 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.940
 one or two slices of tomato depending 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.519
 how much you want or how much 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.980
 finite they cut it and up we're going to 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.900
 put a little salt 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.810
 then we're going to put the oregano for 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.880
 Have a taste of pizza or oregano 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.920
 then let's put in the cheeses in 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.870
 strands in this case are four cheeses and 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.870
 finally let's put the olives 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.550
 well we finished the first one we're going to 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.500
 put in some source that serves for the 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.290
 oven and now let's do some more 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.360
 and then we have to put this in the 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.980
 oven the time it will take cooking or 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.230
 it's going to be the time that the 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.820
 that's why it's going to be enough to 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.730
 let the bread be toasted and what 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.300
 go watch the abulia in a while 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.300
 defined for this one 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.980
 and so we have the finished tracks 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.370
 notice that everything is toasted by 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.790
 under well crispy and that's all 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.790
 retirement 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.470
 spectacular 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.419
 and now let's call our 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.910
 tasters who is with us 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.070
 lately he started for dessert 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.479
 because he was the one who tried the glasses of 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.389
 chocolate but now he's going to eat the 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.569

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:36.240

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.760
 let's try the mushrooms the mini pizzas 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.620

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.620
