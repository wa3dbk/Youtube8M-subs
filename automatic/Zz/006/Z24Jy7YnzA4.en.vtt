00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
and this is what makes us fat so obesity

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.980 
and this is what makes us fat so obesity
or<00:01:18.640> overweight<00:01:18.670> it's<00:01:19.180> not<00:01:19.330> a<00:01:19.360> fat<00:01:19.690> problem

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
or overweight it's not a fat problem

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.469 
or overweight it's not a fat problem
it's<00:01:20.650> an<00:01:20.860> over<00:01:21.159> acid<00:01:21.700> problem<00:01:22.150> okay<00:01:22.420> so

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
it's an over acid problem okay so

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.600 
it's an over acid problem okay so

your thoughts can make you over acidic

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.070 
your thoughts can make you over acidic

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
let's show some of the results okay I

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.300 
let's show some of the results okay I
mean<00:03:39.959> excellent<00:03:40.410> taking<00:03:40.860> a<00:03:40.920> look<00:03:41.040> at<00:03:41.130> some<00:03:41.250> of

mean excellent taking a look at some of

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.949 
mean excellent taking a look at some of
these<00:03:41.370> pictures<00:03:41.580> it's<00:03:41.880> hard<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.209> believe<00:03:42.540> that

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
these pictures it's hard to believe that

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.130 
these pictures it's hard to believe that
these<00:03:43.410> people<00:03:44.040> lost<00:03:44.489> so<00:03:45.150> much<00:03:45.420> weight<00:03:45.480> by

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
these people lost so much weight by

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.960 
these people lost so much weight by
simply<00:03:46.530> making<00:03:46.950> those<00:03:47.160> well<00:03:47.670> they're<00:03:47.850> pretty

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
simply making those well they're pretty

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.690 
simply making those well they're pretty
basic<00:03:48.239> choices<00:03:48.930> there<00:03:49.230> when<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.190> move<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.640> a

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
basic choices there when you move to a

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.390 
basic choices there when you move to a
more<00:03:50.850> alkaline<00:03:51.150> diet<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:52.380> can<00:03:52.560> lose<00:03:52.830> up<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.160> a

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
more alkaline diet you can lose up to a

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.350 
more alkaline diet you can lose up to a

that

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
that

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.560 
that
exercise<00:04:22.860> is<00:04:23.100> bad<00:04:23.310> is<00:04:23.520> when<00:04:23.640> we<00:04:23.789> over<00:04:24.180> exercise

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
exercise is bad is when we over exercise

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.180 
exercise is bad is when we over exercise
we<00:04:24.990> produce<00:04:25.320> lactic

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
we produce lactic

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.940 
we produce lactic
Syd<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:26.640> that<00:04:27.150> lactic<00:04:27.630> acid<00:04:28.110> is<00:04:28.290> thrown<00:04:28.800> out

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
Syd and that lactic acid is thrown out

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.980 
Syd and that lactic acid is thrown out
into<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.340> fatty<00:04:29.550> tissues<00:04:30.090> which<00:04:30.330> can<00:04:30.810> cause

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
into the fatty tissues which can cause

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.930 
into the fatty tissues which can cause
the<00:04:31.260> body<00:04:31.290> to<00:04:31.650> go<00:04:31.770> into<00:04:31.800> preservation<00:04:32.760> mode

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
the body to go into preservation mode

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.110 
the body to go into preservation mode
which<00:04:33.540> can<00:04:33.780> then<00:04:33.930> also<00:04:34.470> make<00:04:34.890> us<00:04:35.160> sick<00:04:35.730> tired

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
which can then also make us sick tired

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.230 
which can then also make us sick tired
and<00:04:36.480> also<00:04:37.110> fat<00:04:37.410> all<00:04:38.070> right<00:04:38.340> you<00:04:38.730> know<00:04:38.850> what<00:04:39.030> if

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
and also fat all right you know what if

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.940 
and also fat all right you know what if
I<00:04:39.330> don't<00:04:39.480> have<00:04:39.570> to<00:04:39.630> count<00:04:39.810> calories<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.800> I

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
I don't have to count calories and I

the most important part of exercise is

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.790 
the most important part of exercise is
sweating<00:04:48.120> because<00:04:48.750> you<00:04:48.870> eliminate<00:04:49.290> acids

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
sweating because you eliminate acids

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.770 
sweating because you eliminate acids
through<00:04:49.950> perspiration<00:04:50.430> it's<00:04:50.850> when<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.210> over
