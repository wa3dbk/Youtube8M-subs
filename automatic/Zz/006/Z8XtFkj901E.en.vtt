00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.560
 ah 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.790
 yang 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.660
 for the hand 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.660
 to me 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.430
 what's up with people here in general I went 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.919
 in a tutorial on 5 ways to 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.710
 make a command command was known 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:34.670
 between us but it's a live lounge in 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:38.420
 first place the best known would be to give 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.809
 to triangle r 3 or triangle r 3 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.420
 triangle both are valid and for this 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.610
 nylon what you need are two weapons if 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.010
 it will not leave us without the two weapons does not pass 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.280
 nor this angle r3 or triangles of 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.170
 system the second way with having the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.799
 first pistol because you would have 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.979
 to give the r1 r3 or shoot and 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:07.119
 stab you can know 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:07.119
 r1 r3 and commanded perfect 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.260
 the third way you do not need anything 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.210
 nothing else that you need to do the 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.140
 dolphin drive and while you are in the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.400
 air 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.010
 r 3 is to say circle a bit and when 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.630
 you're in the air r 3 you have to do it 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.780
 quite close to the zombie if not no 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.450
 it works like this if one of three as you have 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.940
 seen and as a perfect mandate all right 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.240
 the fourth way what you need is a 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.930
 Sniper rifle does not matter 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.050
 then you have to aim with the l1 and 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.540
 l3 as you are going to see here, wait for me 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.690
 hit zombie here did not aim it well and it's 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.950
 there 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.530
 now how are you going to see r1 r3 and how andy 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.270
 blue this one is very simple but 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:05.730
 you need that as I said a 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.970
 sniper and you have to aim 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:12.840
 a little close to point when they have the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:17.050
 peephole to perform r3 and as the loop or 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.000
 be that other forms 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.770
 and the fifth and last form what 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.180
 you need is a play monkey any 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.950
 equipment that is put to the right and 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.280
 you have to give the arrow to the right 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:31.780
 most r3 and I're going functional with 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.060
 tie now so you can see that I hope that 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.200
 here 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:40.500
 I do not get it and well ultimately 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.810
 ingesa that we believe and at the same time give r3 and 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.250
 the command works what are you going to see now 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.660
 that this does not work but the next 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.170
 yes arrow to the right plus r3 and with 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.340
 lurches 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.560
 so I hope you like this one 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.580
 tutorial give the live favorites and we 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.580
 we see in the next video
