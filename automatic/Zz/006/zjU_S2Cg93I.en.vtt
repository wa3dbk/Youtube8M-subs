00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.700
 The Bible says in Scripture Titus 3:10: "A man who has been guilty of rejecting the first and second warnings". 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.350
 Listen to the same verse in the New Bible of King James: 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.950
 "Reject a mischievous man after the first and second warning". 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.050
 The Bible of King James tells us to reject the hereditary. 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.650
 The new Bible of King James tells us to reject a rude man. 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.950
 Here's what the problem is. For example, in Luke 12:51, the Bible says: 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:45.250
 "Do you think I came to give peace on earth? I tell you: No, but partition." 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.850
 So Jesus Christ in Luke 12:51 in the Gospel said that he had come to divide. 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.300
 Jesus Christ was very disgusted. God's Word is frustrating. The Bible says: 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.550
 "For the word of God is alive, and mighty, and sharper than any twin-spade, 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.350
 penetrating and separating the soul and the spirit, the joints and the spinal cord, 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.950
 and he knows the thoughts and intentions of the heart. " 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.650
 Obviously, God's word will always cause division. 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.950
 When Jesus preached in the Gospel of John, he constantly says, "There was division among the people for him." 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.000
 His words caused division, was a division among the Jews. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.750
 He said, "I've come to split." 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.250
 God's word divides people to those who trust in her and to those who do not believe her; 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.050
 those who love the truth and those who turn their ears out of the truth. 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.550
 The Bible of King James really warns us in the 16th chapter of the Romans 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.600
 about the people who cause divisions contrary to the science we learned. 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.000
 He says that we record and avoid those who cause division contrary to what we learned. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.550
 But just say that we're throwing away the odd man in general 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.750
 actually tells us to reject Jesus Christ. 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.650
 The new Bible of King James tells us - reject Jesus. 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.750
 Because Jesus was disfigured. He said that was the purpose of his arrival - to bring about division. 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.450
 Wherever he went, he caused division. 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.250
 That is why it is very important to use the Bible of King James, not these modern corrupt versions. 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.000
 Not even the New King James Bible. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.450
 And of course, foreseeable, if you look at this verse in 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.850
 NIV (New International Version), ESV (English Standard Version), 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.400
 or in other modern versions, what will it say? Wrinkled, scattered, disfigured. 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.000
 From what did the New Bible of King James pick it up?
