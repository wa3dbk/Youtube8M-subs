inside<00:01:04.650> out<00:01:05.030> it<00:01:06.030> depends<00:01:06.570> again<00:01:06.630> we've<00:01:06.960> talked

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
inside out it depends again we've talked

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.200 
inside out it depends again we've talked
about<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> lacing<00:01:08.280> system<00:01:08.310> from<00:01:08.880> some<00:01:09.119> of

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
about on the lacing system from some of

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.260 
about on the lacing system from some of
our<00:01:09.299> previous<00:01:09.780> videos<00:01:10.490> on<00:01:11.490> how<00:01:11.760> lacing

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
our previous videos on how lacing

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.420 
our previous videos on how lacing
outside-in<00:01:12.869> will<00:01:13.080> actually<00:01:13.560> maintain<00:01:13.799> a

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
outside-in will actually maintain a

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.969 
outside-in will actually maintain a
little<00:01:14.939> bit<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.450> tightness<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.560> there<00:01:16.710> but

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
little bit of tightness in there but

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.920 
little bit of tightness in there but
going<00:01:17.250> from<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> inside<00:01:17.939> out<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.390> more

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
going from the inside out is more

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.230 
going from the inside out is more
traditional<00:01:19.430> but<00:01:20.430> we're<00:01:20.610> really<00:01:20.820> trying<00:01:21.119> to

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
traditional but we're really trying to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.240 
traditional but we're really trying to

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.409 
because I full you know pretty tight on
here<00:04:59.130> so<00:04:59.280> my<00:04:59.400> feet<00:04:59.610> get<00:04:59.790> a<00:04:59.820> little<00:05:00.030> achy<00:05:00.180> I

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
here so my feet get a little achy I

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:01.790 
here so my feet get a little achy I
almost<00:05:00.600> feel<00:05:00.840> like<00:05:00.900> they're<00:05:01.200> going<00:05:01.350> to<00:05:01.470> sleep

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
almost feel like they're going to sleep

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.040 
almost feel like they're going to sleep
so<00:05:02.669> then<00:05:02.790> I<00:05:02.820> take<00:05:03.090> them<00:05:03.240> out<00:05:03.390> pull<00:05:03.780> them<00:05:03.930> off

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
so then I take them out pull them off

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.140 
so then I take them out pull them off
with<00:05:04.290> the<00:05:04.380> fan<00:05:04.620> and<00:05:04.650> then<00:05:04.890> I<00:05:05.010> go<00:05:05.190> you<00:05:05.820> know<00:05:05.850> and

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
with the fan and then I go you know and

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.490 
with the fan and then I go you know and
skate<00:05:06.390> a<00:05:06.419> couple<00:05:06.750> hours<00:05:06.960> later<00:05:07.200> and<00:05:07.320> I<00:05:07.470> don't

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
skate a couple hours later and I don't

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.770 
skate a couple hours later and I don't
have<00:05:07.800> that<00:05:07.830> feeling<00:05:08.250> again<00:05:08.490> so<00:05:08.970> again<00:05:09.570> what

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
have that feeling again so again what

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.780 
have that feeling again so again what
we're<00:05:09.930> looking<00:05:10.260> at<00:05:10.350> lacing<00:05:10.830> here<00:05:11.070> is<00:05:11.220> pretty

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
we're looking at lacing here is pretty

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.550 
we're looking at lacing here is pretty
tight<00:05:12.090> when<00:05:12.360> you<00:05:12.479> go<00:05:12.630> to<00:05:12.690> perform<00:05:13.290> in<00:05:13.440> these

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
tight when you go to perform in these

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.200 
tight when you go to perform in these
skates<00:05:13.890> you're<00:05:14.460> gonna<00:05:14.580> get<00:05:14.790> them<00:05:14.910> pretty

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
skates you're gonna get them pretty

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.260 
skates you're gonna get them pretty
tight<00:05:15.630> up<00:05:15.900> to<00:05:15.930> round<00:05:16.350> this<00:05:17.040> third<00:05:17.729> eyelid<00:05:18.120> from

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
tight up to round this third eyelid from

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.210 
tight up to round this third eyelid from
the<00:05:18.419> top<00:05:18.660> so<00:05:19.290> you<00:05:19.410> can<00:05:19.560> see<00:05:19.740> here<00:05:19.919> we<00:05:20.010> want<00:05:20.130> to

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
the top so you can see here we want to

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.680 
the top so you can see here we want to
get<00:05:20.340> a<00:05:20.370> pretty<00:05:20.700> tight<00:05:21.030> through<00:05:21.330> where<00:05:21.540> you're

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
get a pretty tight through where you're

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.600 
get a pretty tight through where you're
gonna<00:05:21.780> bend<00:05:22.169> forward<00:05:22.590> on<00:05:22.860> that<00:05:23.040> skate<00:05:23.370> which

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
gonna bend forward on that skate which

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.040 
gonna bend forward on that skate which
is<00:05:23.760> right<00:05:23.970> around<00:05:24.150> their<00:05:24.390> third<00:05:24.660> and<00:05:24.840> fourth

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
is right around their third and fourth

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.340 
is right around their third and fourth
eyelet<00:05:25.500> down<00:05:25.710> depending<00:05:26.070> on<00:05:26.280> your<00:05:27.110> instep<00:05:28.110> and

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
eyelet down depending on your instep and

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.980 
eyelet down depending on your instep and
then<00:05:28.770> I<00:05:28.800> leave<00:05:29.280> these<00:05:29.550> you<00:05:29.880> know<00:05:30.000> snug<00:05:30.419> but<00:05:30.780> a

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
then I leave these you know snug but a

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.080 
then I leave these you know snug but a
pretty<00:05:31.470> loose<00:05:31.740> so<00:05:31.979> again<00:05:32.280> part<00:05:32.910> of<00:05:32.970> the

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
pretty loose so again part of the

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.880 
pretty loose so again part of the
dynamics<00:05:33.630> of<00:05:33.780> this<00:05:33.870> skate<00:05:34.200> that<00:05:34.410> makes<00:05:34.680> it

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
dynamics of this skate that makes it

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.700 
dynamics of this skate that makes it
function<00:05:35.430> so<00:05:35.760> great<00:05:36.060> on<00:05:36.240> ice<00:05:36.510> is<00:05:37.050> ability<00:05:37.620> to

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
function so great on ice is ability to

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.070 
function so great on ice is ability to
really<00:05:37.919> flex<00:05:38.310> forward<00:05:38.760> and<00:05:39.090> get<00:05:39.660> full<00:05:39.900> range

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
really flex forward and get full range

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.230 
really flex forward and get full range
of<00:05:40.260> motion<00:05:40.410> not<00:05:40.800> only<00:05:41.100> forward<00:05:41.580> but<00:05:42.060> also

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
of motion not only forward but also

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.540 
of motion not only forward but also
backwards<00:05:42.990> and<00:05:43.229> really<00:05:43.260> feel<00:05:43.740> athletic<00:05:44.370> out

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
backwards and really feel athletic out

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.120 
backwards and really feel athletic out
there<00:05:44.820> and<00:05:45.000> get<00:05:45.510> to<00:05:45.750> kind<00:05:46.500> of<00:05:46.620> a<00:05:46.650> little<00:05:46.890> bit

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
there and get to kind of a little bit

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.920 
there and get to kind of a little bit
forward<00:05:47.520> of<00:05:47.580> center<00:05:47.970> your<00:05:48.210> skate<00:05:48.510> which<00:05:48.780> is

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
forward of center your skate which is

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.270 
forward of center your skate which is
we're<00:05:49.110> going<00:05:49.320> to<00:05:49.410> generate<00:05:49.590> a<00:05:49.770> lot<00:05:49.979> of<00:05:50.010> power

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
we're going to generate a lot of power

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.190 
we're going to generate a lot of power
on<00:05:50.550> the<00:05:50.580> ice

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
on the ice

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.260 
on the ice
