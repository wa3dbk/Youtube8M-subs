medieval<00:00:12.360> weapons<00:00:13.190> last<00:00:14.190> time<00:00:14.490> we<00:00:15.030> worked<00:00:15.420> on

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:15.859 
medieval weapons last time we worked on

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.260 
medieval weapons last time we worked on
how<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.920> draw<00:00:17.400> maces<00:00:18.270> swords<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.289> battle-axes

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
how to draw maces swords and battle-axes

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.240 
how to draw maces swords and battle-axes
this<00:00:21.270> time<00:00:21.650> we're<00:00:22.650> going<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.830> focus<00:00:23.010> on

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
this time we're going to focus on

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:42.650 
this time we're going to focus on
something<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.910> little<00:00:24.029> different<00:00:24.300> uh<00:00:39.980> first<00:00:41.660> we

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
something a little different uh first we

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.520 
something a little different uh first we
are<00:00:42.690> going<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.290> work<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:44.510> drawing<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:46.820> dagger

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
are going to work on drawing a dagger

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.760 
are going to work on drawing a dagger
which<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:50.129> not<00:00:50.879> much<00:00:54.320> it's<00:00:55.320> pretty<00:00:55.559> easy

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
which is not much it's pretty easy

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.010 
which is not much it's pretty easy
actually<00:00:56.539> maybe<00:00:57.539> even<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.559> easiest

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
actually maybe even one of the easiest

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.840 
actually maybe even one of the easiest
okay<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.469> easiest<00:01:01.829> part<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.430> destroying

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
okay the easiest part of a destroying

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.039 
okay the easiest part of a destroying
handle<00:01:05.000> I'm<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.270> draw<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.570> pretty<00:01:06.810> close

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
handle I'm going to draw it pretty close

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.020 
handle I'm going to draw it pretty close
up<00:01:07.380> since<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.010> such<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> small<00:01:08.430> weapon<00:01:09.560> um<00:01:11.030> you

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
up since it's such a small weapon um you

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.280 
up since it's such a small weapon um you
could<00:01:12.180> have<00:01:12.330> handles<00:01:12.780> like<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.670> um<00:01:18.020> put<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.110> a

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
could have handles like this um put it a

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.450 
could have handles like this um put it a
little<00:01:19.530> bit<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.799> design<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.750> and<00:01:21.750> then<00:01:22.460> I'm

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
little bit of design on it and then I'm

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.870 
little bit of design on it and then I'm
putting<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.390> little<00:01:24.570> rigid<00:01:24.900> design<00:01:26.420> like<00:01:27.420> a

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
putting a little rigid design like a

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.340 
putting a little rigid design like a
cave<00:01:29.880> stone<00:01:30.240> dagger<00:01:31.430> um<00:01:33.079> really<00:01:34.079> there's<00:01:34.290> a

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
cave stone dagger um really there's a

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.710 
cave stone dagger um really there's a
lot<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.530> possibilities<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.310> make<00:01:35.720> so

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
lot of possibilities you can make so

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:45.480 
lot of possibilities you can make so
that's<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.680> dagger

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.789 

uh<00:01:45.579> next<00:01:46.570> we<00:01:46.750> should<00:01:46.930> focus<00:01:47.110> on<00:01:47.439> something

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
uh next we should focus on something

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.219 
uh next we should focus on something
like<00:01:48.189> I<00:01:48.750> don't<00:01:49.750> know<00:01:50.020> how<00:01:50.680> about<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:51.430> fork

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
like I don't know how about the fork

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.950 
like I don't know how about the fork
yeah<00:01:53.229> it<00:01:53.590> doesn't<00:01:53.799> seem<00:01:53.920> that<00:01:54.070> bad<00:01:54.250> does<00:01:54.670> it

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
yeah it doesn't seem that bad does it

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.249 
yeah it doesn't seem that bad does it
think<00:01:55.960> again<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.670> fork<00:01:58.119> is<00:01:58.689> one<00:01:58.990> of<00:01:59.170> the

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
think again the fork is one of the

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.570 
think again the fork is one of the
strongest<00:01:59.470> weapons<00:02:01.920> okay<00:02:02.920> I'm<00:02:03.070> gonna<00:02:03.250> put<00:02:03.490> it

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
strongest weapons okay I'm gonna put it

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.169 
strongest weapons okay I'm gonna put it
up<00:02:03.640> up<00:02:04.000> here<00:02:04.299> because<00:02:04.570> it'll<00:02:04.929> take<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:06.179> little

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
up up here because it'll take a little

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.860 
up up here because it'll take a little
bit<00:02:07.360> of<00:02:07.479> space<00:02:10.080> again<00:02:11.080> just<00:02:11.380> drop<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.620> handle

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
bit of space again just drop a handle

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.930 
bit of space again just drop a handle
you<00:02:13.870> can<00:02:13.900> make<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.349> kind<00:02:14.709> of<00:02:14.800> fancy<00:02:15.250> sort<00:02:15.790> of

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
you can make it kind of fancy sort of

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.930 
you can make it kind of fancy sort of
like<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:16.470> which<00:02:17.470> actually<00:02:18.190> seems<00:02:18.880> pretty

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
like this which actually seems pretty

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:28.800 
like this which actually seems pretty
cool<00:02:19.239> to<00:02:19.360> me<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:20.260> then<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:22.510> could<00:02:22.660> put<00:02:22.959> a<00:02:27.810> four

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
cool to me and then you could put a four

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.840 
cool to me and then you could put a four
part<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.319> it<00:02:30.120> right<00:02:31.120> here<00:02:32.580> then<00:02:33.580> you<00:02:33.670> could

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
part of it right here then you could

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.140 
part of it right here then you could
kind<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.120> make<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.330> look<00:02:34.540> like<00:02:34.690> a<00:02:34.750> trident<00:02:35.140> sir

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
kind of make it look like a trident sir

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.170 
kind of make it look like a trident sir
put<00:02:37.150> arrows<00:02:37.420> on<00:02:41.730> imagine<00:02:42.730> getting<00:02:42.819> stabbed

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
put arrows on imagine getting stabbed

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:53.120 
put arrows on imagine getting stabbed
with<00:02:43.269> one<00:02:43.360> of<00:02:43.540> those<00:02:47.730> event<00:02:49.320> is<00:02:50.320> a<00:02:50.380> fork<00:02:51.900> and

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
with one of those event is a fork and

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.830 
with one of those event is a fork and
not<00:02:54.130> one<00:02:54.280> of<00:02:54.310> those<00:02:54.459> dinner<00:02:54.820> for<00:02:55.180> its<00:02:55.329> know

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.650 

it's<00:02:58.840> about<00:02:58.930> this<00:03:00.780> big<00:03:03.239> compared<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.359> the<00:03:04.480> size

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
it's about this big compared to the size

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.890 
it's about this big compared to the size
of<00:03:04.810> Hannah<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:07.500> yeah<00:03:09.390> next<00:03:10.390> is<00:03:10.510> also<00:03:10.750> very

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
of Hannah so yeah next is also very

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.630 
of Hannah so yeah next is also very
simple<00:03:11.700> actually<00:03:12.700> one<00:03:13.180> of<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.299> simplest<00:03:13.720> the

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
simple actually one of the simplest the

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.699 
simple actually one of the simplest the
spear<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:17.650> all<00:03:18.100> you<00:03:18.130> do<00:03:18.459> is<00:03:18.670> you<00:03:19.410> put<00:03:20.410> like<00:03:20.590> an

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
spear so all you do is you put like an

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:29.150 
spear so all you do is you put like an
arrowhead<00:03:21.010> right<00:03:21.400> here<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:25.260> let's<00:03:26.260> stick

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.660 

right<00:03:30.160> around<00:03:30.370> here<00:03:31.560> those<00:03:32.560> are<00:03:32.980> three<00:03:33.340> of<00:03:33.549> the

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
right around here those are three of the

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.640 
right around here those are three of the
easiest<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.299> drop<00:03:36.150> now<00:03:37.150> here's<00:03:37.750> something<00:03:38.079> a

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
easiest to drop now here's something a

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.699 
easiest to drop now here's something a
little<00:03:38.980> bit<00:03:39.609> harder<00:03:42.239> something<00:03:43.239> might<00:03:44.170> want

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
little bit harder something might want

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:56.140 
little bit harder something might want
to<00:03:44.920> take<00:03:45.069> up<00:03:45.280> another<00:03:45.430> page

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.370 

ok<00:03:57.150> this<00:03:57.840> is<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.680> bow<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.430> arrow<00:04:00.080> quite<00:04:01.080> hard

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
ok this is the bow and arrow quite hard

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.920 
ok this is the bow and arrow quite hard
but<00:04:03.050> simple<00:04:04.050> at<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.260> same<00:04:04.440> time<00:04:05.480> so<00:04:06.480> first<00:04:06.750> you

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
but simple at the same time so first you

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.310 
but simple at the same time so first you
have<00:04:07.080> to<00:04:07.200> draw<00:04:08.030> kind<00:04:09.030> of<00:04:09.240> a<00:04:10.310> curve<00:04:12.320> right

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
have to draw kind of a curve right

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.380 
have to draw kind of a curve right
around<00:04:13.560> here<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.220> leave<00:04:14.520> that<00:04:15.320> empty<00:04:16.320> and<00:04:17.390> do
