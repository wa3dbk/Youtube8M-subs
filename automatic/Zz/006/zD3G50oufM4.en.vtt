00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
that crank still is going to last

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.590 
that crank still is going to last
being<00:00:33.309> that<00:00:33.489> it's<00:00:33.610> probably<00:00:33.820> still<00:00:34.089> original

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
being that it's probably still original

being that it's probably still original
like<00:00:34.750> I<00:00:34.780> have<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.050> other<00:00:35.230> parts<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:37.590> here's<00:00:38.590> a

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
like I have the other parts so here's a

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.270 
like I have the other parts so here's a
couple<00:00:38.829> of<00:00:39.040> tools<00:00:39.219> we're<00:00:39.430> going<00:00:39.550> to<00:00:39.610> use<00:00:39.760> today

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
couple of tools we're going to use today

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.700 
couple of tools we're going to use today
now<00:00:42.280> have<00:00:42.399> a<00:00:42.489> little<00:00:42.610> center<00:00:42.940> punch

you<00:00:47.829> can<00:00:47.890> get<00:00:48.129> at<00:00:48.250> Harbor<00:00:48.520> Freight<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.829> we're

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
you can get at Harbor Freight and we're

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.900 
you can get at Harbor Freight and we're
going<00:00:51.460> to<00:00:51.550> have<00:00:51.670> a<00:00:51.699> little<00:00:51.940> tap

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.570 

and<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.630> puller<00:00:58.040> we're<00:00:59.040> going<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.250> see<00:00:59.370> if<00:00:59.460> this

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
and a puller we're going to see if this

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.549 
and a puller we're going to see if this
method<00:01:00.000> works<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:02.480> so<00:01:03.480> being<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.810> it<00:01:03.990> has<00:01:04.110> 20

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
method works so so being that it has 20

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.670 
method works so so being that it has 20
teeth<00:01:05.330> what<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.360> did<00:01:06.690> since<00:01:07.230> I'm<00:01:07.380> going<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.590> use

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
teeth what I did since I'm going to use

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.120 
teeth what I did since I'm going to use
two<00:01:07.920> equal<00:01:08.190> sides<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.350> went<00:01:10.350> ahead<00:01:10.440> and<00:01:10.590> counted

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
two equal sides I went ahead and counted

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.580 
two equal sides I went ahead and counted
I<00:01:11.340> marked<00:01:12.180> my<00:01:12.210> first<00:01:12.540> one<00:01:12.690> on<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.930> side<00:01:13.170> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
I marked my first one on this side and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.620 
I marked my first one on this side and
counted<00:01:14.460> ten<00:01:14.730> for<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> other<00:01:15.180> side<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.570> just

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
counted ten for the other side and just

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.150 
counted ten for the other side and just
used<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.080> regular<00:01:16.220> old<00:01:17.220> sharpie<00:01:18.860> can't<00:01:19.860> find<00:01:20.070> my

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
used a regular old sharpie can't find my

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.840 
used a regular old sharpie can't find my
whiteout<00:01:21.230> so<00:01:22.230> I<00:01:22.260> marked<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.800> before<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.520> punch

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
whiteout so I marked it before I punch

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:52.330 
whiteout so I marked it before I punch
it

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.590 

it<00:01:53.340> will<00:01:53.520> see<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.790> center<00:01:54.090> punch<00:01:54.330> right<00:01:54.540> here

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.490 

should<00:01:57.600> be<00:01:57.720> right<00:01:57.900> around<00:01:58.020> there

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
should be right around there

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.590 
should be right around there
a<00:01:58.530> little<00:01:58.979> mark<00:01:59.190> that's<00:02:00.000> about<00:02:00.300> where<00:02:00.510> I'm

a little mark that's about where I'm
going<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.840> drill<00:02:02.390> on<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.479> other<00:02:03.630> side<00:02:06.830> yeah

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
going to drill on the other side yeah

going to drill on the other side yeah
it's<00:02:07.979> got<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:09.200> but<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.350> right<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.709> here

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
we got this close quarter drilled

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.740 
we got this close quarter drilled
because<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.530> remove<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.340> radiator<00:02:17.640> but<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.480> sit

because I remove the radiator but I sit

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.830 
because I remove the radiator but I sit
in<00:02:18.840> half<00:02:19.020> size<00:02:19.230> for<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.560> full<00:02:19.739> size<00:02:19.980> drill<00:02:20.310> and

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
in half size for a full size drill and

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.970 
in half size for a full size drill and
later<00:02:21.840> on<00:02:22.050> I'm<00:02:22.140> going<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.350> be<00:02:22.410> doing<00:02:22.560> exhaust

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
later on I'm going to be doing exhaust

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.150 
later on I'm going to be doing exhaust
studs<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:24.239> it's<00:02:24.360> going<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.600> help<00:02:24.690> me<00:02:24.870> out<00:02:25.160> it's

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
studs so it's going to help me out it's

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.360 
studs so it's going to help me out it's
got<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.370> simple<00:02:27.260> quarter<00:02:28.260> by<00:02:28.380> 20<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:28.950> mean

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
got a simple quarter by 20 I mean

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.010 
got a simple quarter by 20 I mean
quarter<00:02:29.760> inch<00:02:29.910> drill<00:02:30.180> bit<00:02:30.239> I'm<00:02:30.600> going<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.810> tap

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
quarter inch drill bit I'm going to tap

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.290 
quarter inch drill bit I'm going to tap
it<00:02:31.050> with<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.260> quarter<00:02:31.590> by<00:02:31.709> twenty<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.310> see

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
it with the quarter by twenty and see

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.640 
it with the quarter by twenty and see
how<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.480> works<00:02:33.600> if<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.260> doesn't<00:02:34.530> work

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
how that works if that doesn't work

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.900 
how that works if that doesn't work
there's<00:02:34.980> another<00:02:35.160> method<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.610> I've<00:02:35.790> found

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
there's another method that I've found

00:02:35.910 --> 00:03:09.780 
there's another method that I've found
on<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.150> Internet

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.729 

so<00:03:10.790> you'll<00:03:10.939> see<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.269> hole<00:03:11.450> now<00:03:12.409> I'm<00:03:12.560> about<00:03:12.680> to

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
so you'll see the hole now I'm about to

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:19.570 
so you'll see the hole now I'm about to
tap<00:03:13.870> so<00:03:14.870> kind<00:03:15.049> of<00:03:15.109> do<00:03:15.200> it<00:03:15.319> on<00:03:15.409> the<00:03:15.500> other<00:03:15.590> side

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.490 

so<00:03:20.150> there's<00:03:20.330> the<00:03:20.510> two<00:03:20.660> holes<00:03:20.930> you<00:03:21.170> can<00:03:21.260> see

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
so there's the two holes you can see

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.210 
so there's the two holes you can see
clearly<00:03:21.800> I<00:03:22.100> can't<00:03:23.000> emphasize<00:03:23.120> enough<00:03:24.220> while

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
clearly I can't emphasize enough while

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.030 
clearly I can't emphasize enough while
you're<00:03:25.340> cutting<00:03:25.550> or<00:03:26.270> drilling<00:03:26.770> have<00:03:27.770> some

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
you're cutting or drilling have some

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.330 
you're cutting or drilling have some
kind<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.340> lubricant<00:03:29.050> wd-40<00:03:30.050> I<00:03:30.200> use<00:03:30.530> PB<00:03:30.860> Blaster

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
kind of lubricant wd-40 I use PB Blaster

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.190 
kind of lubricant wd-40 I use PB Blaster
works<00:03:31.520> really<00:03:31.670> good<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.180> that's<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.900> clean<00:03:33.080> up

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
works really good and that's to clean up

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.770 
works really good and that's to clean up
the<00:03:33.290> shavings<00:03:33.680> while<00:03:33.860> you're<00:03:34.540> drilling<00:03:35.540> in

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
the shavings while you're drilling in

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.000 
the shavings while you're drilling in
there<00:03:35.960> so<00:03:36.170> you<00:03:36.260> don't<00:03:36.410> burn<00:03:36.560> up<00:03:36.620> your<00:03:36.770> bit<00:03:37.960> a

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
there so you don't burn up your bit a

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.170 
there so you don't burn up your bit a
little<00:03:40.010> lubrication<00:03:40.430> goes<00:03:40.730> a<00:03:40.760> long<00:03:40.880> way<00:03:41.120> you

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
little lubrication goes a long way you

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.200 
little lubrication goes a long way you
can<00:03:41.360> see<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.600> metal<00:03:41.750> shavings<00:03:43.000> right<00:03:44.000> there

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
can see the metal shavings right there

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.800 
can see the metal shavings right there
I'll<00:03:44.330> have<00:03:44.390> to<00:03:44.570> clean<00:03:44.780> up<00:03:44.810> afterwards<00:03:45.470> but<00:03:45.830> uh

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
I'll have to clean up afterwards but uh

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:53.800 
I'll have to clean up afterwards but uh
next<00:03:47.810> is<00:03:48.050> to<00:03:48.260> uh<00:03:48.290> tap<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.490> hole<00:03:50.830> all<00:03:51.830> right<00:03:52.810> so

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
next is to uh tap the hole all right so

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.320 
next is to uh tap the hole all right so
we<00:03:53.960> cleaned<00:03:54.200> off<00:03:54.380> all<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.620> metal<00:03:54.980> shavings

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.030 

use<00:03:59.330> a<00:03:59.360> little<00:03:59.660> bit<00:03:59.720> of<00:03:59.870> brake<00:04:00.020> cleaner<00:04:00.320> now

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
use a little bit of brake cleaner now

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.310 
use a little bit of brake cleaner now
I'm<00:04:01.190> going<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.400> lube<00:04:01.520> it<00:04:01.610> up<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:02.810> tap<00:04:03.080> that<00:04:03.110> I

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
I'm going to lube it up the tap that I

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.880 
I'm going to lube it up the tap that I
have<00:04:03.530> with<00:04:03.920> a<00:04:04.630> little<00:04:05.630> bit<00:04:05.720> of<00:04:05.750> PB<00:04:06.050> blast<00:04:06.320> so

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
have with a little bit of PB blast so

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:27.220 
have with a little bit of PB blast so
help<00:04:07.160> it<00:04:07.280> cut<00:04:07.520> and

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.890 

so<00:04:27.950> here's<00:04:28.160> the<00:04:28.280> setup<00:04:28.550> I<00:04:28.910> had<00:04:29.510> a<00:04:29.540> pretty<00:04:29.780> good

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
so here's the setup I had a pretty good

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.130 
so here's the setup I had a pretty good
1/2<00:04:30.110> inch<00:04:30.380> ratchet<00:04:31.240> so<00:04:32.240> I<00:04:32.300> can<00:04:32.480> go<00:04:32.600> slow<00:04:32.810> on<00:04:33.050> the

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
1/2 inch ratchet so I can go slow on the

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.290 
1/2 inch ratchet so I can go slow on the
torque<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:34.250> get<00:04:34.400> two<00:04:34.670> bolts<00:04:36.910> two<00:04:37.910> holes<00:04:38.180> you

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
torque you get two bolts two holes you

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.930 
torque you get two bolts two holes you
just<00:04:38.570> drilled<00:04:39.580> two<00:04:40.580> quarter<00:04:41.000> inch<00:04:41.030> wash<00:04:41.570> it<00:04:41.780> up

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
just drilled two quarter inch wash it up

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.160 
just drilled two quarter inch wash it up
trying<00:04:43.940> to<00:04:44.030> pull<00:04:44.180> this<00:04:44.300> gear<00:04:44.570> off<00:04:44.600> let's<00:04:45.020> see

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
trying to pull this gear off let's see

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.770 
trying to pull this gear off let's see
if<00:04:45.260> it<00:04:45.350> works

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
if it works

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.360 
if it works
cross<00:04:47.780> your<00:04:47.900> fingers<00:04:48.050> you<00:04:48.350> tube<00:04:51.280> okay<00:04:52.280> I've

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
cross your fingers you tube okay I've

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.130 
cross your fingers you tube okay I've
run<00:04:52.490> into<00:04:52.640> a<00:04:52.730> slight<00:04:53.000> snag<00:04:53.180> but<00:04:53.600> I<00:04:53.660> actually

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
run into a slight snag but I actually

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.670 
run into a slight snag but I actually
have<00:04:54.560> a<00:04:54.590> tool<00:04:54.830> for<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.250> problem<00:04:56.590> when<00:04:57.590> I'm

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
have a tool for the problem when I'm

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.340 
have a tool for the problem when I'm
turning<00:04:57.920> once<00:04:58.490> I<00:04:58.610> got<00:04:58.760> some<00:04:58.940> torque<00:04:59.150> on<00:04:59.390> it<00:04:59.420> the

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
turning once I got some torque on it the

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.470 
turning once I got some torque on it the
whole<00:05:00.530> crankshaft<00:05:01.070> wanted<00:05:01.370> to<00:05:01.460> move<00:05:01.640> so<00:05:02.270> what

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
whole crankshaft wanted to move so what

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.150 
whole crankshaft wanted to move so what
I<00:05:02.510> did<00:05:02.630> I<00:05:03.490> have<00:05:04.490> a<00:05:04.520> really<00:05:05.270> huge<00:05:05.450> set<00:05:05.720> of<00:05:05.840> pliers

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
I did I have a really huge set of pliers

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.760 
I did I have a really huge set of pliers
I'm<00:05:07.160> holding<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:07.610> two<00:05:07.790> bolts<00:05:08.030> so<00:05:08.770> that's

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
I'm holding the two bolts so that's

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.860 
I'm holding the two bolts so that's
actually<00:05:10.190> helping<00:05:10.580> and<00:05:10.790> I<00:05:11.300> just<00:05:11.570> heard<00:05:11.750> it

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
actually helping and I just heard it

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.140 
actually helping and I just heard it
break<00:05:11.960> loose<00:05:12.320> so<00:05:12.590> I'm<00:05:13.280> almost<00:05:13.430> there<00:05:13.820> so<00:05:14.060> this

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
break loose so I'm almost there so this

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.720 
break loose so I'm almost there so this
system<00:05:14.390> actually<00:05:14.750> does<00:05:14.990> work<00:05:15.470> it<00:05:16.370> just<00:05:16.400> takes

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
system actually does work it just takes

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.020 
system actually does work it just takes
a<00:05:16.850> little<00:05:17.000> bit<00:05:17.120> of<00:05:17.180> patience<00:05:18.400> a<00:05:19.400> lot<00:05:19.880> of

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
a little bit of patience a lot of

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.110 
a little bit of patience a lot of
lubrication<00:05:21.190> you<00:05:22.190> don't<00:05:22.490> go<00:05:22.610> in<00:05:22.730> there<00:05:22.850> trying

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
lubrication you don't go in there trying

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.760 
lubrication you don't go in there trying
to<00:05:23.180> do<00:05:23.300> it<00:05:23.420> while<00:05:23.600> it's<00:05:23.720> rusted<00:05:24.140> and<00:05:24.200> dry<00:05:24.470> make

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
to do it while it's rusted and dry make

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.830 
to do it while it's rusted and dry make
sure<00:05:24.920> you<00:05:25.010> spray<00:05:25.280> enough<00:05:25.520> wd-40<00:05:26.240> or<00:05:26.270> PB<00:05:26.600> blast

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
sure you spray enough wd-40 or PB blast

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.500 
sure you spray enough wd-40 or PB blast
whatever<00:05:27.140> you're<00:05:27.290> using<00:05:27.320> and<00:05:28.360> spray<00:05:29.360> that

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
whatever you're using and spray that

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.170 
whatever you're using and spray that
stuff<00:05:29.660> liberally<00:05:30.290> is<00:05:30.700> much<00:05:31.700> of<00:05:31.820> it<00:05:31.910> on<00:05:32.030> there

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
stuff liberally is much of it on there

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.110 
stuff liberally is much of it on there
as<00:05:32.300> you<00:05:32.330> can<00:05:33.250> you'll<00:05:34.250> see<00:05:34.520> right<00:05:34.760> there<00:05:34.970> it's

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
as you can you'll see right there it's

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.850 
as you can you'll see right there it's
starting<00:05:35.240> to<00:05:35.450> come<00:05:35.690> off<00:05:37.060> so<00:05:38.060> I<00:05:38.510> will<00:05:38.930> show<00:05:39.230> the

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
starting to come off so I will show the

00:05:39.860 --> 00:06:22.070 
starting to come off so I will show the
finished<00:05:40.100> product<00:05:40.670> in<00:05:40.790> a<00:05:40.880> second

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:33.749 

easier<00:06:31.080> so<00:06:32.080> the<00:06:32.169> trick<00:06:32.409> was<00:06:32.650> really<00:06:33.129> it<00:06:33.669> was

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 
easier so the trick was really it was

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.999 
easier so the trick was really it was
just<00:06:33.849> a<00:06:34.090> lot<00:06:34.240> of<00:06:34.270> lubrication<00:06:34.750> I<00:06:35.139> mean<00:06:35.770> a

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:36.009 
just a lot of lubrication I mean a

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:38.040 
just a lot of lubrication I mean a
little<00:06:36.819> mechanical<00:06:37.030> know-how<00:06:37.479> to<00:06:37.690> but

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
little mechanical know-how to but

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.430 
little mechanical know-how to but
basically<00:06:38.949> I<00:06:39.490> read<00:06:40.210> on<00:06:40.300> some<00:06:40.479> forums<00:06:40.810> some

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
basically I read on some forums some

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.740 
basically I read on some forums some
people<00:06:41.680> trying<00:06:42.069> to<00:06:42.159> do<00:06:42.250> this<00:06:42.370> method<00:06:42.729> but<00:06:43.060> they

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750 
people trying to do this method but they
