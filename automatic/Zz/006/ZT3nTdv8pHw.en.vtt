00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.259
 hello everyone with you viper 29 09 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.780
 and today talk about m24 chaffee sport 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.509
 Well, in general, and racing mode in general 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.790
 let's start by picking this 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.310
 tank because we have a small selection 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.170
 so from the equipment I would give you 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.900
 recommended setting stabilizer 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.670
 rammer and fan stabilizer 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.890
 to understandably on the go just 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.230
 more accurately shoot and big fish with 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.630
 Opponents kill but more was chance 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.540
 getting rammer just to more often 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.640
 do it but also the fan will strengthen these 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.700
 quality and plus everything adds to you 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.920
 and to speed and to maneuverability and in general 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.850
 to all other indicators that is 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.500
 fan is a universal thing and 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.660
 if also put here to crews 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.329
 martial brotherhood it will be double 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.300
 well and stabilizer and dos 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.789
 vadim just good things as for 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.410
 equipment then there is a small selection 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.530
 the best option to put gasoline and 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.710
 cola 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.869
 in fact, this is all that is needed here. 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.180
 repair kit and first aid kits or fire extinguishers 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.400
 we have no choice here 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.490
 is to deliver either 105 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.670
 octane gasoline or just sotochku it 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.280
 already depending on your finances from 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.290
 shells I would recommend you 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.270
 still take some subcaliber 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.939
 shells I take with them twenty-five 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.640
 things just to capture the base 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.310
 no problem beating run pass page 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.020
 they gave it to us absolutely with 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.530
 chaffy and that is, you can choose 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.290
 perks already very immediately what to put here 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.270
 race mode will not be long afterwards 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.490
 this crew will go completely into your 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.659
 order you can transplant it 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.280
 on any other tank therefore 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.130
 in my opinion it would be more appropriate 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.259
 now put the ki you need but 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.219
 here specifically in this mode will be 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:59.530
 really need perks for the gunner and 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:03.159
 mechvod to reduce scatter when 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.679
 the movement is more in theory here is nothing 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.310
 you need to shine shine you everywhere and 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.920
 is always 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.989
 and yes and the presence or absence of 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.910
 there is no role here at all 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.709
 plays so it would be best 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.680
 put these two perks here 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.390
 and the rest choose what you need well and 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.459
 now let's talk a little about 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.430
 the mode itself is about how best 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.590
 to win it is just an option 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.739
 go and not paying attention to 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.930
 opponents to drive to the finish this option 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.530
 very good but unfortunately it works 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.930
 not always 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.299
 if your team is far behind you 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.129
 and just fights with opponents 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.560
 then most likely you have nothing 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.290
 it will work with the seizure of the base though 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.640
 very fast but still problematic 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.549
 do in 1 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.590
 if your team supports you and 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.120
 rides not far from you then it generally 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.650
 one hundred percent option 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.130
 it should also be used if strongly 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.049
 bother about murder 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.030
 opponents most likely too 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.370
 nothing good will come of it 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.489
 you just leave them alone and come 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.859
 already later all well and just simply not 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.410
 have time to shoot down with her capture he goes 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.700
 very quickly and try not to miss 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.669
 it's out of sight 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.430
 one hundred percent straight here tactics are not here 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:20.069
 it all depends on the situation, well, well 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.090
 that's all thank you all for your attention 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.200
