00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.870
 Fukushima do not stop fighting 

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.490
 radioactive water leakage 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.759
 move went dyes which hopefully 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.640
 experts will help clarify the situation 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.900
 reported that the liquidators of the accident 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.400
 On the NPP at last have adjusted three times 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.380
 food and just now everyone 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.539
 provided dosimeters to those 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.000
 Magata sends to Japan 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.109
 new experts today they have to 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:21.820
 meet with local nuclear specialists 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.170
 to exchange views on the situation and 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.060
 discuss further action topic 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.599
 continue her leads rf 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.130
 Does the world threaten man-made 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.630
 disaster the answer to this question 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.219
 cannot be received on 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:34.829
 negotiations of two representatives 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.899
 magate with japanese specialists 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.769
 which will be held on monday they 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:40.399
 hope to get information from the first 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:41.260
 hands 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.720
 several experts are already working in japan 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.830
 international atomic agency but 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.510
 solve mix radiation levels 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.030
 the situation at Fukushima NF 1 is still 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.570
 unclear until the end 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.770
 despite the desperate attempts to withdraw under 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.180
 control leakage of radioactive 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.750
 substances content fails 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.420
 iodine 131 in sea water near the station 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.560
 exceeds the norm 4385 times the cathedral totals 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.760
 the waters are 10 thousand times to blame for the cracks in 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.090
 the foundation of the second power unit 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.210
 tried to pour concrete on leaks 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.300
 contaminated water continues underway 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.420
 search for similar crack others 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.460
 reactors its boat uniqueness 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.770
 rafts 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.380
 we can only confirm that 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.430
 the leak continues but it is not known where 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.750
 Specifically, we also do not have data on 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.370
 quantity from contaminated water on 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.620
 a year later it turned out that until the end of 2011 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.780
 the reason fails because the quantity 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.140
 the resulting 1 is so large then 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.810
 that concrete can not afford even Yanukovych 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.950
 trying to eliminate using special 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.560
 chemical reagents 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.229
 Experts believe that the active core of the second 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:42.950
 reactor 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.670
 melted destroyed one 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.579
 protective chambers m and lasted 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.469
 millionth ton radioactive 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:50.909
 elements in particular isotopes of iodine and cesium 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.130
 found in some areas of Japan are not 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.189
 only in sea and drinking water and 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:56.509
 food 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.170
 Citizens of the year decided to pump in floating 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.729
 platforms one of these mega tankers 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.439
 intended for fishing 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.469
 the pilot that 36 meters holds up to 18 thousand 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.319
 tons of water due to high radiation 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.980
 long stay in the territory oez can not 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.239
 so now there are still ready-made volunteers 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.659
 work there for the maximum 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.030
 a short time to pay them promise to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.599
 five thousand dollars 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.760
 after the elimination of the accident Fukushima 1 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.560
 will be closed said the prime minister 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.859
 Japan naoto kan in a whole new together 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.560
 with local authorities we will think like 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.799
 restore fisheries 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.669
 a long battle ahead of the government 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:35.299
 will do everything possible 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.339
 according to the latest death toll in 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:38.699
 earthquake and 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:41.569
 tsunami exceeded 12 thousand people without 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.199
 lead missing are listed almost 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:45.359
 fifteen and a half thousand 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.689
 most killed in miyagi prefectures 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.449
