00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:14.019
 envelop or at least to reduce 

00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:17.069
 perception of those noises by

 charge the device with the base 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:07.950
 we will have to connect this connection 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.680
 special 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.920

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.580
 opportunity to try it already for about 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.760
 how many minutes and the truth is that 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.920

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.840
 interlocutor even if much noise 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.530
 around us and as I said 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:43.160
 previously we can exchange the 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:46.510
 pads depending on the size of the 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:49.810
 quality of our ear 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:53.249
 this would be the speaker of the device 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.109
 with a metallic finish 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:57.900

00:06:55.109 --> 00:06:59.550

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.910
 plantronics is that once we what
