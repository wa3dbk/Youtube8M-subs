00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
the of recent years because it just does

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.010 
the of recent years because it just does
wonder<00:01:11.060> it's<00:01:11.180> like<00:01:11.270> a<00:01:11.300> miracle<00:01:11.570> pedal<00:01:11.930> and

set up you can use humbuckers or you can
switch<00:01:27.560> over<00:01:27.680> to<00:01:27.800> single<00:01:28.580> coil<00:01:28.760> kind<00:01:29.300> of<00:01:29.390> sound

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
switch over to single coil kind of sound

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.870 
switch over to single coil kind of sound
for<00:01:30.170> this<00:01:30.320> particular<00:01:31.100> song<00:01:31.280> I<00:01:31.430> do<00:01:31.490> use<00:01:31.760> the

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
for this particular song I do use the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.670 
for this particular song I do use the
single<00:01:32.180> coil<00:01:32.330> so<00:01:32.510> here's<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:32.810> single<00:01:33.080> chord

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:46.420 

that's<00:01:39.680> with<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.009> EP<00:01:40.280> here's<00:01:40.520> without<00:01:40.640> it

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.470 

so<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:47.580> got<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.880> great<00:01:48.060> single-coil

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
so it's got that great single-coil

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.200 
so it's got that great single-coil
clarity<00:01:49.080> but<00:01:49.650> when<00:01:50.190> I<00:01:50.220> turn<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.460> EP<00:01:50.880> off<00:01:51.030> it

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
clarity but when I turn that EP off it

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.760 
clarity but when I turn that EP off it
just<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.660> said<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.050> just<00:01:52.260> feels<00:01:52.440> kind<00:01:52.620> of

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
just like I said it just feels kind of

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.460 
just like I said it just feels kind of
deflated<00:01:53.160> so<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.090> really<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.600> leave<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.110> EP<00:01:55.350> on

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
deflated so I really I leave the EP on

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.960 
deflated so I really I leave the EP on
all<00:01:55.620> the<00:01:55.680> time<00:01:55.860> there<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.370> a<00:01:56.400> section<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:56.880> the

all the time there is a section in the

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.430 
all the time there is a section in the
middle<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.330> this<00:01:57.450> song<00:01:57.690> where<00:01:57.900> I<00:01:57.930> am<00:01:58.170> gonna

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
middle of this song where I am gonna

in<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.020> particular<00:02:01.800> AC<00:02:02.010> booster<00:02:02.930> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
in this particular AC booster the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.210 
in this particular AC booster the
settings<00:02:04.260> that<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.380> have<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.650> have<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> treble

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
really want to push that much gain on

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.730 
really want to push that much gain on
top<00:02:11.820> of<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.090> bass<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:12.840> straight<00:02:13.320> up<00:02:13.350> at<00:02:13.560> 12

top of this bass is straight up at 12

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.990 
top of this bass is straight up at 12
o'clock<00:02:14.010> in<00:02:14.160> my<00:02:14.220> volume<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.610> straight<00:02:14.820> up<00:02:14.910> at

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
o'clock in my volume is straight up at

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.570 
o'clock in my volume is straight up at
12<00:02:15.210> o'clock<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:15.780> here's<00:02:16.110> without<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.650> AC

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.550 

here's<00:02:23.580> with<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.820> AC

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.309 

now<00:02:30.340> this<00:02:30.490> pedal<00:02:30.850> does<00:02:31.180> give<00:02:31.569> me<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.990> good

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
now this pedal does give me a good

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.080 
now this pedal does give me a good
amount<00:02:32.560> of<00:02:32.740> compression<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.850> part<00:02:34.060> that

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
amount of compression and the part that

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.510 
amount of compression and the part that
I'm<00:02:34.209> going<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.390> use<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.630> on<00:02:34.720> in<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:34.959> song<00:02:35.140> is

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
I'm going to use it on in the song is

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.040 
I'm going to use it on in the song is
kind<00:02:36.520> of<00:02:36.580> an<00:02:36.790> exciting<00:02:37.270> part<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.900> there's

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
kind of an exciting part and there's

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.620 
kind of an exciting part and there's
some<00:02:38.770> good<00:02:38.950> amount<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.340> faster<00:02:40.270> kind<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.480> stuff

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
some good amount of faster kind of stuff

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.850 
some good amount of faster kind of stuff
going<00:02:40.870> on<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.140> again<00:02:41.290> I'd<00:02:41.440> like<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.620> have<00:02:41.830> a

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
going on and again I'd like to have a

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.900 
going on and again I'd like to have a
little<00:02:42.040> bit<00:02:42.100> more<00:02:42.250> compression<00:02:42.490> for<00:02:42.819> those

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
little bit more compression for those

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.880 
little bit more compression for those
parts<00:02:43.209> so<00:02:43.360> this<00:02:43.990> pedal<00:02:44.230> works<00:02:44.380> perfectly<00:02:44.740> for

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
parts so this pedal works perfectly for

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.200 
parts so this pedal works perfectly for
that<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:45.670> here<00:02:46.420> we<00:02:46.480> go<00:02:46.569> and<00:02:46.780> play<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.020> tune
