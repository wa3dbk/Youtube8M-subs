00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
to do a bill 101 on offsets what we're

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.730 
to do a bill 101 on offsets what we're
going<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.030> do<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.480> start<00:00:09.690> explaining<00:00:10.260> how<00:00:10.679> an

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
going to do is start explaining how an

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.350 
going to do is start explaining how an
office<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.250> works<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.940> then<00:00:12.059> we're<00:00:12.179> going<00:00:12.269> to

office it works and then we're going to

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.120 
office it works and then we're going to
explain<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.780> implications<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.740> having<00:00:13.889> the

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
explain the implications of having the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.580 
explain the implications of having the
correct<00:00:14.429> I've<00:00:14.670> seen<00:00:14.940> on<00:00:15.059> your<00:00:15.179> vehicle<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:16.560> it

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
correct I've seen on your vehicle so it

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.590 
correct I've seen on your vehicle so it
will<00:00:17.310> take<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.550> look<00:00:17.760> at<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.970> diagram<00:00:18.390> on<00:00:18.570> the

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
will take a look at the diagram on the

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.560 
will take a look at the diagram on the
board<00:00:18.690> behind<00:00:19.080> me<00:00:19.670> we'll<00:00:20.670> start<00:00:21.000> by<00:00:21.210> just

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
board behind me we'll start by just

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.099 
board behind me we'll start by just
simply<00:00:22.670> establishing<00:00:23.670> how<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.000> how<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.750> get

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
simply establishing how you how you get

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.470 
simply establishing how you how you get
to<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.289> given<00:00:25.590> offset<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.910> if<00:00:26.970> we<00:00:27.060> look<00:00:27.240> at<00:00:27.300> this

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
to a given offset so if we look at this

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.689 
to a given offset so if we look at this
wheel<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.140> brown<00:00:28.410> part<00:00:28.859> represents<00:00:29.550> a

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
wheel that the brown part represents a

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.540 
wheel that the brown part represents a
crosscut<00:00:30.359> section<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> wheel<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
crosscut section of a wheel this is the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.400 
crosscut section of a wheel this is the
face<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.030> wheel<00:00:33.149> that's<00:00:33.390> facing<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
face of the wheel that's facing the the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.260 
face of the wheel that's facing the the
sidewalk<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> side<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
sidewalk and this is the side of the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.639 
sidewalk and this is the side of the
wheel<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.630> facing<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.110> inside<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
wheel that is facing the inside of the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.250 
wheel that is facing the inside of the
car<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.640> Bluebirds<00:00:39.120> represent<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.960> pad

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
car the Bluebirds represent the pad

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.750 
car the Bluebirds represent the pad
where<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.649> wheel<00:00:40.829> mounts<00:00:41.190> ever<00:00:41.340> gets<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
where the wheel mounts ever gets in the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.180 
where the wheel mounts ever gets in the
car<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.899> brake<00:00:43.140> pad<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.070> is

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
car this is the brake pad and this is

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.790 
car this is the brake pad and this is
the<00:00:44.280> fender<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.910> vehicle<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:46.320> purple<00:00:46.680> is

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the fender of the vehicle the purple is

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.270 
the fender of the vehicle the purple is
a<00:00:46.829> tire

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
a tire

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.959 
a tire
so<00:00:48.320> this<00:00:49.320> wheel<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> thirty<00:00:50.280> five<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.760> seven

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
so this wheel is a thirty five of seven

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.150 
so this wheel is a thirty five of seven
women<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.480> way<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.750> establish<00:00:52.590> an<00:00:52.710> orcid<00:00:53.070> on

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
women the way you establish an orcid on

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.819 
women the way you establish an orcid on
a<00:00:53.250> wheel<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:54.570> take<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.930> centerline<00:00:55.559> of

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
a wheel is you take the centerline of

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.220 
a wheel is you take the centerline of
the<00:00:55.920> wheel<00:00:56.730> starting<00:00:57.480> from<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> bead<00:00:57.899> seats

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the wheel starting from the bead seats

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.080 
the wheel starting from the bead seats
the<00:00:58.920> middle<00:00:59.280> across<00:00:59.489> you're<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.879> dead

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
the middle across you're going to dead

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.430 
the middle across you're going to dead
center<00:01:00.329> line<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.660> drop<00:01:00.930> down<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.170> middle

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
center line you drop down the middle

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.549 
center line you drop down the middle
that<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.160> your<00:01:02.430> zero<00:01:02.760> offset<00:01:03.170> do<00:01:04.170> they<00:01:04.320> measure

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
that is your zero offset do they measure

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.460 
that is your zero offset do they measure
the<00:01:04.769> distance<00:01:05.280> from<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.659> pad<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
the distance from that to the pad of the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.130 
the distance from that to the pad of the
wheel<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.420> opposite<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.930> that

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
wheel and that is the opposite of that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.530 
wheel and that is the opposite of that
given<00:01:10.470> wheel<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.250> if<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.670> pad<00:01:12.000> was<00:01:12.030> out<00:01:12.360> there

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
given wheel so if this pad was out there

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.270 
given wheel so if this pad was out there
there<00:01:12.900> would<00:01:12.990> be<00:01:13.020> zero<00:01:13.140> up<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.830> over<00:01:14.070> here

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
there would be zero up so it's over here

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.719 
there would be zero up so it's over here
it's<00:01:14.400> 35<00:01:14.880> if<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.630> followed<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:17.070> dotted<00:01:17.430> blue

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
it's 35 if it followed this dotted blue

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.910 
it's 35 if it followed this dotted blue
line<00:01:17.759> over<00:01:18.270> here<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.540> would<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.780> 40<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.680> we

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
line over here it would be 40 if we

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.800 
line over here it would be 40 if we
shaved<00:01:20.280> five<00:01:20.640> millimeters<00:01:21.150> off<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> back<00:01:21.540> pad

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
shaved five millimeters off the back pad

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.770 
shaved five millimeters off the back pad
you'd<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> 40<00:01:22.710> millimeter<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.310> sin<00:01:23.549> wheel

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
you'd have a 40 millimeter of sin wheel

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.630 
you'd have a 40 millimeter of sin wheel
so<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.470> how<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.680> establish<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.340> offset

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
so that is how you establish the offset

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.490 
so that is how you establish the offset
of<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.759> wheel<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> one<00:01:28.229> thing

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
of the wheel and that is the one thing

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.929 
of the wheel and that is the one thing
that<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:28.860> extremely<00:01:29.340> well<00:01:29.490> at<00:01:29.700> tears

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
that we do extremely well at tears

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.940 
that we do extremely well at tears
double<00:01:30.270> we<00:01:30.390> make<00:01:30.630> sure<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.560> officer

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
double we make sure that the officer

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.160 
double we make sure that the officer
that<00:01:32.100> we're<00:01:32.220> prescribing<00:01:32.729> fits<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:33.810> vehicle

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
that we're prescribing fits your vehicle

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.920 
that we're prescribing fits your vehicle
properly<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:35.460> want<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.759> avoid<00:01:36.150> hitting<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
properly you want to avoid hitting the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.380 
properly you want to avoid hitting the
fender<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.650> having<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.310> trim<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> fender<00:01:39.150> and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
fender and having to trim the fender and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.960 
fender and having to trim the fender and
you<00:01:39.689> absolutely<00:01:40.350> cannot<00:01:40.619> hit<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.829> brakes<00:01:41.189> so

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
you absolutely cannot hit the brakes so

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.510 
you absolutely cannot hit the brakes so
that<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.450> very<00:01:42.600> important<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.200> other<00:01:43.520> problem

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
that is very important the other problem
