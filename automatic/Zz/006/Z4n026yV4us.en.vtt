00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:03.209
 but 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.350
 plus 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.360
 here 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.410
 for example we have this watch that is a 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.990
 sports watch that you can know that in 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.650
 truth is an all occasion that can be 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:31.720
 use this so much good there is a 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.720
 also informal or formal sighting 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.260
 this clock here is more formal is more 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.640
 for terno to a little more directed such 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.640
 the modern executive 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:51.950
 we also have this clock here 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.670
 which is an automatic watch that is 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.059
 one of the best watches 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:02.969
 what is basically an elegant watch 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.969
 they came to be the most exclusive be here 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.500
 that is now I like them quite 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.970
 because that pretty much combines what it is 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.970
 eternal 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.290
 yet 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.450
 or an elegant dress 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.120
 but basically that depends a lot on the 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.290
 of the client that's why 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.000
 There are people who like to use 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.850
 watches 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.290
 every occasion and other people who 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.880
 taking on his middle school dress 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.880
 especially elegant watches 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.460
 and then it's the preference of the 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.350
 people are evolving according to 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.350
 trends and especially in those times 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:49.180
 as much as cellular computing go 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.740
 looking for new things and is improving 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.740
 your costs 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:03.310
 They are more sporty or casual watches 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.359
 more than what the watches are 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.359
 totally elegant 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.650
 the trend is a little more people are 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.840
 see much more accurate then has 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.620
 involved more with with a style of 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.690
 much healthier life much more sporty 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.690
 it's basically what you see now 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.140
 do not 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.319
 well you know from the start 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.569
 open the store the sale of watches is 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.990
 is very even between what is men and 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.990
 women 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:44.209
 basically, how can you explain 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.290
 we do not see there is not a difference very 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.030
 checked 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.489
 has more than men and women is almost 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.810
 even for sale the skill of 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.700
 women that we have right now 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.560
 we have a replacement that is 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.109
 arriving if you see in the line of 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.319
 women is right now it's a little under a 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:02.510
 The output of both women varies 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:06.650
 from watch steel watches with 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:10.659
 little golden leather straps is 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.659
 varied the strength that we have
