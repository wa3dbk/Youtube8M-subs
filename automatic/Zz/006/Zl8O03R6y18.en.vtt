00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.089
 if the ahs invites you to a meet then 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.859
 needs something bigger that 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.139
 international congress center in 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.450
 dresden next to the saxon 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.990
 just enough space for the round 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.430
 500 visitors from home and abroad 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.460
 many of them have been around for some time now 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.320
 time with it for the annual one 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.320
 Day meeting has a long tradition 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.450
 not quite right 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.660
 In 1970 , my film reminiscence ran to the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.489
 future in the us or the carrier 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.440
 grade from cocos coast to coast or eight 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.930
 I've been showing celebrities the times 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.719
 I was invited to many 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.199
 lectures colleges college and such 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.059
 continue 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.610
 One day a lawyer joined 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.010
 not to be the name was doctrine philips 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.449
 he was so excited he said 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.280
 if I agree 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.159
 an erich of danish society 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.200
 Basically, I was for like that 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.689
 a society but not under that 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.700
 Names erich of danish and so on 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.250
 in the us who are determined on the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.409
 page 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.110
 in the beginning we have it also engine 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.520
 astronauts called in germany but 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.380
 the Germans and the Swiss could 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.780
 so do not start with the title like that 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.390
 we came up with the idea how to do that 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.250
 all then the society came for 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.170
 archeology astronautics and city 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.119
 if we wanted to advise the letters 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.579
 to equip the logo of the country and so on 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.590
 aa researchers have been leading it ever since 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.479
 decades of research at the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.640
 around the world through this they are 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.180
 fundamental questions of history 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.399
 the trace 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.799
 ask our previous understanding 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.380
 on the evolution of humanity 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.140
 There could be a change of heart 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.899
 Visitors of extraterrestrial cultures 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.680
 here on our earth they leave 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.530
 Traces in our solar system which we 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.509
 just to find the proof 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.560
 to keep it in your hands 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:13.230
 the extraterrestrial life exists 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.630
 the extraterrestrial spaceman or 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.599
 unmanned robot but already before 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.630
 millions of years into the evolution of the earth 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.400
 intervened thousands of years ago 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.170
 cultural development of ours 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:33.080
 civilization controlled or just 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:35.459
 Watchers of a young love world were 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.610
 extraterrestrial visitors in the gray past 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.220
 the central hypothesis of the palio city 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.080
 hundreds of indices have research 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.190
 Researcher of the ahs already 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.310
 collected 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.230
 presented at the meeting in dresden 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.830
 twelve speakers will be their latest 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.349
 findings as well as luc citgin the 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.720
 Publisher of mystery magazine is 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.980
 just with interesting news 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.989
 China returned 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.540
 as one of the first western 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.239
 He even has journalists in China 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.160
 huang shan mountains one recently 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.349
 Discovered cave labyrinth explores 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.940
 who the builders are is unknown 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:17.209
 and then there were not telling us 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.959
 Now the things are really big 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:25.220
 and you say you're going purely is the first 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.260
 big cave and in four 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.930
 square kilometer big on two 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.370
 storeys 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.230
 you do not know the size yet 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.630
 guessing there are some photos with people 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.810
 everything looks very tiny on this 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.329
 They run through cathedrals 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.230
 they walk through the trees that are part of 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:49.530
 15 meter high piers have huge 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.140
 pier 15 meters high then you are man 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.180
 gone further there they are so stroked 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.920
 always had to squares 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.950
 cut out and a butter knife 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.050
 Here is a bit because a piece of 100 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.350
 x thousand times see what in all 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:08.280
 Variations on the ceilings had to be patterned 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:11.730
 had and they are all only on 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.560
 Meanwhile, as I said, then uncover 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.730
 they have that too so they see that 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.320
 canon out a little bit more again 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.459
 can you structure so wrong 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.410
 stair-step 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:24.950
 They find a mix of everything possible 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.020
 for whom was that created what is that 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.590
 a heretic question 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.790
 research society why there is 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.350
 a working science 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.210
 apparat why he does not leave the one 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.860
 professional 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.650
 our scientists I know 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:41.729
 Although most of them are very brilliant 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.320
 in tumors stubborn they all look 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.010
 just in your direction on your own 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.650
 specialist knowledge 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.440
 it does not find interdisciplinary 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.479
 research and that's what we offer 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.190
 see beyond the boundaries of the individual 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.210
 Scientists away and connect the 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.310
 That's not necessary, that's important 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.110
 in fact, the interests of the 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.000
 US researchers diversified the search 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.650
 for extraterrestrial artifacts 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.150
 she is not limited in the meantime 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.470
 more only on the earth 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.640
 other planets are also obtained in the eye 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.320
 fascinating objects unexplained 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.860
 origin on the mars surface 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.140
 so is the title of the lecture 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.320
 it's not about pictures like that 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.630
 like this one 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.400
 that has an object time that shows 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.830
 looks like a stone hill of 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.220
 maybe it could be a bit of a thing 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:35.430
 sometimes a stone man or a stone grad means 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.900
 what are we really talking about? 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.570
 of course, have no proof 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.450
 because if the proof was there is clear 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.430
 then this indicates a university 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.550
 to be explored accordingly that is 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.040
 our goal is our theory as well 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.320
 wishes to moor 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.600
 that is also generally accepted 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.130
 can be in science and there 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.580
 are we here at the very very good 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.160
 ways 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.990
 because we research image worldwide 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.090
 have also supported now 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.460
 through the eleven of a few foundation the 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.960
 at university projects out there 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.670
 which then under certain 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.210
 Questions quite scientifically 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:13.910
 quite solid unfortunately ask for the with 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.820
 an open exit like that for 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.000
 a science is also the heard 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.840
 party research in general 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.970
 arrived at the science business and 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.940
 accepted are the members of the 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.490
 ahs continue to research the next one day 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:32.140
 By the way, in the 2013 meeting 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.140
 southern German space take place
