00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.220 
these bars are you have an N and you
have<00:02:56.290> two<00:02:56.620> outs<00:02:56.830> one<00:02:59.370> says<00:03:00.370> myxer<00:03:01.180> phone<00:03:01.230> OCD

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
have two outs one says myxer phone OCD

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.910 
have two outs one says myxer phone OCD
line<00:03:02.620> which<00:03:03.610> means<00:03:04.120> that<00:03:04.480> is<00:03:04.930> what<00:03:05.709> is

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
line which means that is what is

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.940 
line which means that is what is
directly<00:03:06.880> from<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.269> turntable<00:03:07.959> whereas

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
directly from the turntable whereas

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.090 
directly from the turntable whereas
mixer<00:03:09.370> line<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:10.390> is<00:03:10.720> what<00:03:11.019> comes<00:03:11.350> from<00:03:11.709> the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
mixer line that is what comes from the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.650 
mixer line that is what comes from the
software<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.890> both<00:03:15.280> of<00:03:15.310> them<00:03:15.610> and<00:03:15.880> then<00:03:16.150> just

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
software so both of them and then just

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.979 
software so both of them and then just
plug<00:03:17.140> them<00:03:17.320> in<00:03:17.530> like<00:03:18.250> this<00:03:18.430> so<00:03:19.269> the<00:03:19.660> red<00:03:19.840> and

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
plug them in like this so the red and

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.250 
plug them in like this so the red and
black<00:03:20.200> is<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.500> end<00:03:20.829> and<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:22.019> yellow<00:03:23.019> and

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
black is the end and the yellow and

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.720 
black is the end and the yellow and
white<00:03:23.769> is<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.430> out<00:03:24.579> then<00:03:25.329> you<00:03:25.480> have<00:03:25.600> your<00:03:25.630> USB

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
white is the out then you have your USB

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.720 
white is the out then you have your USB

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
like ok so one of the first things I

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.340 
like ok so one of the first things I
want<00:03:38.170> you<00:03:38.290> two<00:03:38.410> guys<00:03:38.530> to<00:03:38.590> notice<00:03:39.100> is<00:03:40.019> red<00:03:41.019> light

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
want you two guys to notice is red light

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.750 
want you two guys to notice is red light
right<00:03:41.620> here<00:03:41.680> lit<00:03:42.340> up<00:03:43.950> it's<00:03:44.950> not<00:03:45.070> very<00:03:45.280> clear

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
right here lit up it's not very clear

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.830 
right here lit up it's not very clear
but<00:03:45.790> what<00:03:46.209> it<00:03:46.329> says<00:03:46.360> is<00:03:46.870> software<00:03:47.650> lock<00:03:48.840> what

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
but what it says is software lock what

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.479 
but what it says is software lock what
that<00:03:50.049> means<00:03:50.440> is<00:03:50.769> that<00:03:50.860> now<00:03:51.519> I<00:03:51.850> cannot<00:03:52.780> change

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
that means is that now I cannot change

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.690 
that means is that now I cannot change
the<00:03:55.350> input<00:03:56.350> mode<00:03:56.980> channel<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:58.000> be

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
the input mode channel a be

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.320 
the input mode channel a be
so<00:04:00.739> usually<00:04:01.739> you<00:04:01.770> would<00:04:01.980> have<00:04:02.220> control<00:04:02.819> vinyl

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
so usually you would have control vinyl

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.150 
so usually you would have control vinyl
control<00:04:03.810> CD<00:04:04.200> line<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.250> phone<00:04:05.879> and<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:07.650> button

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
control CD line and phone and the button

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.930 
control CD line and phone and the button
right<00:04:08.459> here<00:04:09.530> would<00:04:10.530> change<00:04:10.950> these<00:04:11.280> but<00:04:11.519> since

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
right here would change these but since

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.690 
right here would change these but since
mine<00:04:12.870> is<00:04:12.900> already<00:04:13.290> synced<00:04:13.980> and<00:04:14.129> I<00:04:14.489> already

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
mine is already synced and I already

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.659 
mine is already synced and I already
installed<00:04:15.150> everything<00:04:15.599> now<00:04:16.530> it<00:04:16.799> recognizes

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
installed everything now it recognizes

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.129 
installed everything now it recognizes
that<00:04:17.700> it's<00:04:18.239> CD<00:04:18.630> i<00:04:18.750> always<00:04:19.530> used<00:04:19.889> patrol<00:04:20.489> CD<00:04:20.850> on

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
that it's CD i always used patrol CD on

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.690 
that it's CD i always used patrol CD on
that<00:04:22.139> i<00:04:22.169> never<00:04:22.440> change<00:04:22.770> it<00:04:22.950> so<00:04:23.160> now<00:04:23.340> it's<00:04:23.580> on

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
that i never change it so now it's on

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.469 
that i never change it so now it's on
software<00:04:24.180> lock<00:04:24.680> meaning<00:04:25.680> that<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:26.070> software

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
software lock meaning that the software

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.020 
software lock meaning that the software
programmed<00:04:27.479> it<00:04:28.460> actually<00:04:29.460> know<00:04:29.550> when<00:04:29.850> it's

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
programmed it actually know when it's

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.570 
programmed it actually know when it's
when<00:04:30.210> you<00:04:30.330> install<00:04:30.780> it<00:04:31.070> you<00:04:32.070> have<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.340> change

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
when you install it you have to change

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.200 
when you install it you have to change
it<00:04:32.790> and<00:04:32.940> once<00:04:33.600> its<00:04:33.810> installed<00:04:34.940> you<00:04:35.940> cannot

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
it and once its installed you cannot

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.760 
it and once its installed you cannot
change<00:04:36.270> it<00:04:36.720> unless<00:04:36.870> you<00:04:37.080> use<00:04:37.410> it<00:04:37.590> on<00:04:37.740> another

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
change it unless you use it on another

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.270 
change it unless you use it on another
computer<00:04:38.660> so<00:04:39.660> that's<00:04:39.990> one<00:04:40.139> of<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.380> features

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
computer so that's one of the features

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.580 
computer so that's one of the features
that<00:04:41.310> comes<00:04:41.729> so<00:04:42.479> it's<00:04:42.600> on<00:04:42.690> software<00:04:43.139> luck<00:04:43.410> so

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
that comes so it's on software luck so

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.620 
that comes so it's on software luck so
you<00:04:43.680> can<00:04:43.860> no<00:04:44.010> longer<00:04:44.250> change<00:04:44.610> it<00:04:44.790> so<00:04:45.419> what<00:04:45.540> you

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
you can no longer change it so what you

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.879 
you can no longer change it so what you
have<00:04:45.660> to<00:04:45.780> do<00:04:46.020> is<00:04:46.290> go<00:04:46.470> on<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.830> software<00:04:47.340> and

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
have to do is go on the software and

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.870 
have to do is go on the software and
figure<00:04:49.889> it<00:04:49.919> out<00:04:50.540> ok<00:04:51.540> so<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.620> channel<00:04:53.100> in<00:04:53.460> the

figure it out ok so the channel in the

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.590 
talk about little is a channel see is
the<00:05:25.889> channel<00:05:26.340> that<00:05:26.760> pretty<00:05:27.360> much<00:05:27.570> has

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
the channel that pretty much has

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.050 
the channel that pretty much has
everything<00:05:28.310> what<00:05:29.310> I<00:05:29.370> mean<00:05:29.490> by<00:05:29.550> that<00:05:29.700> is<00:05:29.910> that

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
everything what I mean by that is that

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.719 
everything what I mean by that is that
theres<00:05:30.510> the<00:05:30.600> mic<00:05:30.630> in<00:05:31.110> and<00:05:31.740> there's<00:05:32.400> the<00:05:32.550> end

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
theres the mic in and there's the end

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:39.110 
theres the mic in and there's the end
for<00:05:33.389> the<00:05:33.900> third<00:05:35.210> turntable<00:05:36.740> and<00:05:37.740> also<00:05:38.430> you

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
for the third turntable and also you

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.310
