running playing mmorpgs got a lot of
repetitive<00:00:40.379> tasks<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.040> can<00:00:41.160> just<00:00:41.309> kind<00:00:41.460> of

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
repetitive tasks you can just kind of

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.490 
repetitive tasks you can just kind of
you<00:00:42.059> know<00:00:42.090> programming<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.840> macro<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.350> do

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
you know programming to a macro can do

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.840 
you know programming to a macro can do
that<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.800> can<00:00:43.829> actually<00:00:44.219> program<00:00:44.399> with<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
that you can actually program with the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.060 
that you can actually program with the
accompanying<00:00:45.210> software<00:00:45.870> inside<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.440> your<00:00:46.559> PC

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
or you can actually as well do them on

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.979 
or you can actually as well do them on
the<00:00:49.770> fly<00:00:49.980> hit<00:00:50.520> record<00:00:50.910> program<00:00:51.510> your<00:00:51.660> macro

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
the fly hit record program your macro

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.840 
the fly hit record program your macro
assign<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.770> key<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.129> then<00:00:53.219> do<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.520> key

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
assign it to a key and then do that key

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.490 
assign it to a key and then do that key
repetitively<00:00:54.600> that's<00:00:54.809> good<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.079> tournaments

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
repetitively that's good for tournaments

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
repetitively that's good for tournaments
where<00:00:55.620> you're<00:00:55.710> going<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.890> make<00:00:56.010> stuff<00:00:56.250> up<00:00:56.340> as

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
where you're going to make stuff up as

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.270 
where you're going to make stuff up as
you<00:00:56.730> go<00:00:56.760> really<00:00:57.570> cool<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.469> wired<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.190> you

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
you go really cool it is wired so you

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.319 
you go really cool it is wired so you

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
have to worry about any type of latency

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.760 
have to worry about any type of latency
issues<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:00.809> not<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.989> wireless<00:01:01.320> keyboard<00:01:01.469> it

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
issues it's not a wireless keyboard it

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.049 
issues it's not a wireless keyboard it
is<00:01:01.859> going<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.070> be<00:01:02.100> completely<00:01:02.489> wired<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.000> on

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
is going to be completely wired and on

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.840 
is going to be completely wired and on
the<00:01:03.149> other<00:01:03.270> end<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.629> course<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.080> USB<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.670> is

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the other end of course is a USB it is

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.270 
the other end of course is a USB it is
not<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.330> ps2<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.619> work<00:01:07.740> on<00:01:07.950> modern

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
not a ps2 it can work on modern

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.199 
look super pretty per se but it's really
really<00:03:04.680> nice<00:03:04.859> and<00:03:05.670> it's<00:03:05.819> going<00:03:05.909> to<00:03:06.000> get<00:03:06.090> the

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
really nice and it's going to get the

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.729 
really nice and it's going to get the
job<00:03:06.420> done<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.659> really<00:03:07.200> really<00:03:07.440> like<00:03:07.590> it

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
job done I really really like it

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.250 
job done I really really like it
especially<00:03:08.420> versus<00:03:09.420> paying<00:03:09.629> more<00:03:09.840> money<00:03:09.870> for

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
especially versus paying more money for

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.539 
especially versus paying more money for
some<00:03:10.470> keyboards<00:03:10.799> that<00:03:10.829> might<00:03:11.040> look<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.430> little

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
some keyboards that might look a little

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.220 
some keyboards that might look a little
nicer<00:03:11.760> but<00:03:12.209> probably<00:03:12.840> aren't<00:03:13.019> going<00:03:13.140> to

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
nicer but probably aren't going to

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.770 
nicer but probably aren't going to
perform<00:03:13.470> as<00:03:13.650> well<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:14.329> it's<00:03:15.329> just<00:03:15.480> not<00:03:15.629> worth

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
perform as well and it's just not worth

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.509 
perform as well and it's just not worth
it<00:03:15.930> i<00:03:16.019> really<00:03:16.319> really<00:03:16.440> like<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.769> g1<00:03:17.099> 10<00:03:17.280> so
