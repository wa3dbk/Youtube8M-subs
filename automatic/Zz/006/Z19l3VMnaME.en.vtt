jerkbait this time of the year like I

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.590 
jerkbait this time of the year like I
said<00:01:23.310> when<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.549> start<00:01:23.820> talking<00:01:24.000> about<00:01:24.270> what

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
said when you start talking about what

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.510 
said when you start talking about what
bait<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.020> throw<00:01:25.400> probably<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
bait to throw probably the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.340 
bait to throw probably the
decision-making<00:01:27.210> factor<00:01:27.720> for<00:01:27.960> me<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.200> going

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
decision-making factor for me is going

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.140 
decision-making factor for me is going
to<00:01:28.409> be<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.619> little<00:01:28.920> bit<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.220> watercolor<00:01:29.790> and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
to be a little bit of watercolor and

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.149 
to be a little bit of watercolor and
it's<00:01:30.780> also<00:01:30.960> going<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.320> be<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.619> conditions

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
it's also going to be the conditions

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.149 
it's also going to be the conditions
outside<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.670> mean<00:01:33.090> if<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.479> calmer<00:01:34.020> sunny<00:01:34.920> or

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
outside I mean if it's a calmer sunny or

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.670 
outside I mean if it's a calmer sunny or
day<00:01:35.400> I'm<00:01:35.790> gonna<00:01:36.030> throw<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> soft<00:01:36.720> fluke<00:01:37.079> jerk

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
day I'm gonna throw the soft fluke jerk
