nice so we still have this interesting
kind<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.409> game<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:06.470> we<00:01:07.470> also<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
kind of game here we also have the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.109 
kind of game here we also have the
changes<00:01:08.939> at<00:01:09.320> 5.1<00:01:10.320> did<00:01:10.530> bring<00:01:10.770> gun<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
changes at 5.1 did bring gun in the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.870 
changes at 5.1 did bring gun in the
notification<00:01:12.450> area<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:14.040> check<00:01:14.340> out<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.700> mall

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
notification area to check out the mall

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:24.080 
notification area to check out the mall
to<00:01:15.060> user<00:01:15.299> here<00:01:22.310> so<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.430> seems<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.850> be<00:01:23.909> working

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
to user here so that seems to be working

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:33.080 
to user here so that seems to be working
fine<00:01:26.210> to<00:01:27.210> go<00:01:27.390> back

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:44.730 

so<00:01:34.090> let's<00:01:34.479> check<00:01:34.750> out<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:34.930> camera

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.429 

I<00:01:44.799> do<00:01:45.670> like<00:01:45.970> that<00:01:46.030> simple<00:01:46.720> sound<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:47.200> makes

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
I do like that simple sound it makes

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.800 
I do like that simple sound it makes
when<00:01:47.590> you<00:01:47.799> making<00:01:48.189> it<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:49.380> shot<00:01:50.380> I<00:01:51.810> definitely

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
when you making it a shot I definitely

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.010 
when you making it a shot I definitely
think<00:01:53.229> as<00:01:53.439> time<00:01:53.680> has<00:01:53.710> gone<00:01:53.860> on<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.490> Nexus<00:01:55.420> has

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
think as time has gone on the Nexus has

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.679 
think as time has gone on the Nexus has
been<00:01:56.380> improved<00:01:56.799> in<00:01:56.950> regards<00:01:57.399> to<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:57.759> focusing

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
been improved in regards to the focusing

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.149 
been improved in regards to the focusing
a<00:01:59.220> boy<00:02:00.220> still<00:02:00.610> could<00:02:00.759> be<00:02:00.789> better<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.950> could

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
a boy still could be better and so could

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.630 
a boy still could be better and so could
my<00:02:03.220> camcorders<00:02:04.149> focusing<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:06.189> we<00:02:06.340> still<00:02:06.580> have

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
my camcorders focusing so we still have

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.699 
my camcorders focusing so we still have
the<00:02:07.090> folk<00:02:07.539> panorama<00:02:08.880> here<00:02:10.860> which<00:02:11.860> is<00:02:12.040> nice<00:02:12.280> and

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
the folk panorama here which is nice and

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.170 
the folk panorama here which is nice and
the<00:02:14.709> photosphere<00:02:17.160> see<00:02:18.160> if<00:02:18.250> we<00:02:18.489> still<00:02:18.549> get<00:02:18.940> the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
the photosphere see if we still get the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:30.330 
the photosphere see if we still get the
4k<00:02:23.640> yes<00:02:24.640> we<00:02:24.850> do<00:02:28.440> as<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.620> look<00:02:29.830> in<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.100> settings

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
4k yes we do as I look in the settings

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:37.110 
4k yes we do as I look in the settings
see<00:02:31.090> if<00:02:31.180> we<00:02:31.269> can<00:02:31.420> see<00:02:31.660> any<00:02:31.780> differences<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.850> I

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
see if we can see any differences so I

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.990 
see if we can see any differences so I
don't<00:02:37.330> think<00:02:37.540> there<00:02:37.750> will<00:02:37.900> be<00:02:37.959> but<00:02:39.000> worthwhile

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
don't think there will be but worthwhile

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.690 
don't think there will be but worthwhile
checking<00:02:40.720> anyway<00:02:42.360> doesn't<00:02:43.360> seem<00:02:43.599> to<00:02:43.840> be<00:02:44.700> so

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
checking anyway doesn't seem to be so

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.349 
checking anyway doesn't seem to be so
probably<00:02:46.030> another<00:02:46.269> kind<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:47.190> incremental

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
probably another kind of incremental

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.640 
probably another kind of incremental
kind<00:02:49.359> of<00:02:49.450> boring<00:02:49.780> update<00:02:50.500> from<00:02:50.769> google<00:02:51.250> here<00:02:51.640> I

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
kind of boring update from google here I

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.870 
kind of boring update from google here I
think<00:02:53.650> there's<00:02:53.799> still<00:02:54.070> definitely<00:02:54.340> some

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
think there's still definitely some

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.910 
think there's still definitely some
areas<00:02:55.299> which<00:02:55.510> lollipop<00:02:56.109> could<00:02:56.410> become

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:16.319 

progressively<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:11.470> do<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:14.340> so<00:03:15.340> I<00:03:15.760> think<00:03:16.180> it

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
progressively to do that so I think it

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.740 
progressively to do that so I think it
would<00:03:16.480> be<00:03:16.510> quite<00:03:17.489> good<00:03:18.489> to<00:03:18.850> make<00:03:19.569> that

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
would be quite good to make that

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.780 
would be quite good to make that
possible<00:03:20.130> also<00:03:21.130> I<00:03:21.160> think<00:03:21.250> Google<00:03:21.700> would

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
possible also I think Google would

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.789 
possible also I think Google would
definitely<00:03:22.450> kind<00:03:22.810> of<00:03:22.870> make<00:03:23.049> use<00:03:23.260> of<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.590> big

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
definitely kind of make use of the big

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.160 
definitely kind of make use of the big
display<00:03:24.310> here<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.760> little<00:03:25.000> bit<00:03:25.150> more<00:03:25.390> very

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
display here a little bit more very

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.039 
display here a little bit more very
probably<00:03:26.440> put<00:03:27.400> on<00:03:27.489> some<00:03:27.790> multitasking<00:03:28.150> kind

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
probably put on some multitasking kind

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.920 
probably put on some multitasking kind
of<00:03:29.170> functionality<00:03:32.220> well<00:03:33.220> hopefully<00:03:33.930> Android

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
of functionality well hopefully Android

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.840 
of functionality well hopefully Android
M<00:03:35.170> will<00:03:35.470> bring<00:03:35.799> some<00:03:36.329> you<00:03:37.329> know<00:03:37.359> real<00:03:37.780> kind<00:03:38.410> of

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
working it seems and it does feel about

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:58.550 
working it seems and it does feel about
as<00:03:50.350> fast<00:03:50.650> as<00:03:50.889> the<00:03:51.130> android<00:03:51.639> 5.1

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:08.910 

as<00:03:59.560> you<00:03:59.860> can<00:04:00.069> see

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:23.970 

and<00:04:10.120> also<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.630> multitasking

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.060 

so<00:04:24.980> no<00:04:25.220> issues<00:04:25.640> there<00:04:25.670> it<00:04:26.120> seems<00:04:26.830> do<00:04:27.830> we<00:04:27.950> get

nevertheless let's search at the and 22
I<00:04:54.790> will<00:04:55.790> fast<00:04:56.090> forward<00:04:56.210> through<00:04:56.750> this<00:04:56.990> to<00:04:57.410> see

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
I will fast forward through this to see

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.190 
I will fast forward through this to see
if<00:04:58.480> we<00:04:59.480> can<00:04:59.660> see<00:04:59.870> anything<00:04:59.900> new<00:05:01.120> so<00:05:02.120> less<00:05:02.900> got

if we can see anything new so less got
40<00:05:03.730> 9350<00:05:04.730> to<00:05:05.230> keep<00:05:06.230> that<00:05:06.380> in<00:05:06.440> your<00:05:06.560> head<00:05:07.150> let's

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
40 9350 to keep that in your head let's

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.620 
40 9350 to keep that in your head let's
go<00:05:12.130> so<00:05:13.130> where<00:05:13.520> we<00:05:13.700> come<00:05:13.880> to<00:05:14.000> the<00:05:14.090> end<00:05:14.150> of<00:05:14.420> the

go so where we come to the end of the
test<00:05:14.930> here<00:05:15.410> and<00:05:15.680> you<00:05:16.190> can<00:05:16.340> see<00:05:16.990> we<00:05:17.990> have<00:05:18.020> got

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
test here and you can see we have got

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.170 
test here and you can see we have got
actually<00:05:18.710> quite<00:05:19.310> a<00:05:19.340> less<00:05:19.820> than<00:05:20.000> i<00:05:20.090> was
