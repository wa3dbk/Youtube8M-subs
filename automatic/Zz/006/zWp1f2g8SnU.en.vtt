00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
having her draw umberto and an anime

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.150 
having her draw umberto and an anime
character<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.350> then<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:55.649> also<00:00:55.800> kind<00:00:56.100> of

like<00:00:59.190> asian<00:00:59.550> looking<00:00:59.670> or<00:01:00.149> something<00:01:00.539> but<00:01:01.199> it

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559
