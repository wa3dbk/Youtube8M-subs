00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
and they can live quite a long time I'd

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.340 
and they can live quite a long time I'd
say<00:02:02.220> probably<00:02:02.370> five<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.910> eight<00:02:03.060> years<00:02:03.390> um<00:02:03.840> I

I'm gonna get bigger I would recommend
75<00:02:44.670> gallons<00:02:45.180> because<00:02:45.270> 55<00:02:45.810> gallons<00:02:46.230> is<00:02:46.350> not<00:02:46.710> big

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
75 gallons because 55 gallons is not big

75 gallons because 55 gallons is not big
enough<00:02:46.950> very<00:02:47.940> important<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.450> know<00:02:48.570> 55<00:02:49.320> gallons

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860

enough<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.500> don't<00:02:52.680> even<00:02:52.740> think<00:02:52.890> that's<00:02:53.100> big

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
enough I don't even think that's big

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.030 
enough I don't even think that's big
enough<00:02:53.550> but<00:02:53.850> 55<00:02:54.840> gallon<00:02:55.140> tanks<00:02:55.440> are<00:02:55.560> only<00:02:55.680> 12

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
enough but 55 gallon tanks are only 12
