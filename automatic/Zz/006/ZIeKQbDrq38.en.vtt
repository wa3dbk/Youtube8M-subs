00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.450 
that was really what it was was like
people<00:01:42.479> pairing<00:01:42.869> up<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.200> okay<00:01:43.470> one<00:01:44.009> dragon

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.120 
people pairing up like okay one dragon
slayer<00:01:44.750> against<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.560> guess<00:01:46.920> because

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
slayer against this and I guess because

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.609 
slayer against this and I guess because
like<00:01:47.490> really<00:01:48.390> they<00:01:48.540> can't<00:01:48.810> do<00:01:48.960> much<00:01:49.229> against

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
like really they can't do much against

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.859 
like really they can't do much against
dragons<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.399> they<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.820> assist<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.450> guess<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
dragons but they can assist I guess the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.719 
dragons but they can assist I guess the
Dragonslayer<00:01:52.740> because<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.610> know
