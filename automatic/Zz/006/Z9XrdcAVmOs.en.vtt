00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:18.849
 I was created to save the planet 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.849
 what people see looking at the sky 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:36.160
 hope and and i will take away the first world 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.160
 it becomes only when people die out 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:45.949
 I wanted to protect the world indestructible armor and 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.519
 but he made a monster artificial 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.519
 intelligence 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:56.420
 he program altron i'm tired of watching 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.420
 how people pay for our mistakes 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.660
 the new goal is justified to end the war and 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.079
 home 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.079

 everything depends on us 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.310
 from our resilience and determination to save 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.310
 the world has nowhere to retreat 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.509
 this is a date with death and and tomorrow 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.509
 in the evening of freedom 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.420
 forever they have to clean up 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.119
 we'll tear them apart 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.030
 and from the inside 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.939
 and more than one is capable 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.500
 you run into
