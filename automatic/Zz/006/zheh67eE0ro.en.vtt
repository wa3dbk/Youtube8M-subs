but<00:00:41.160> also<00:00:41.370> bring<00:00:41.730> them<00:00:41.879> back<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.110> that

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
but also bring them back and so that

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.840 
but also bring them back and so that
really<00:00:43.649> takes<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.100> look<00:00:44.219> at<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.430> end-to-end

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
really takes a look at the end-to-end

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.560 
really takes a look at the end-to-end
process<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.530> if<00:00:46.829> Elan<00:00:47.309> can<00:00:47.579> cut<00:00:47.789> corners<00:00:48.210> make

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
process so if Elan can cut corners make

process so if Elan can cut corners make
something<00:00:48.989> happen<00:00:49.170> we're<00:00:49.860> gonna<00:00:49.980> learn<00:00:50.280> from

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309

a large system in certain congressional
districts<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.300> then<00:02:28.870> they<00:02:29.020> are<00:02:29.110> giving<00:02:29.410> it<00:02:29.530> to

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
districts and then they are giving it to

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.980 
districts and then they are giving it to
you<00:02:29.680> NASA<00:02:30.100> doesn't<00:02:30.490> really<00:02:30.670> want<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.360> and

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
you NASA doesn't really want it and and

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.290 
you NASA doesn't really want it and and
telling<00:02:32.410> you<00:02:32.530> do<00:02:32.860> something<00:02:33.280> with<00:02:33.460> this<00:02:33.640> what

do you say oh I disagree completely in

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.360 
do you say oh I disagree completely in
the<00:02:37.150> sense<00:02:37.510> that<00:02:37.900> NASA<00:02:38.910> doesn't<00:02:39.910> want<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.720> SLS

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
the sense that NASA doesn't want the SLS

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.320 
the sense that NASA doesn't want the SLS
okay<00:02:42.370> we<00:02:43.030> need<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.720> vehicle<00:02:44.020> like<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.890> SLS<00:02:45.460> to

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
okay we need a vehicle like the SLS to

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.620 
okay we need a vehicle like the SLS to
be<00:02:46.510> able<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:47.050> get<00:02:47.260> well<00:02:47.590> beyond<00:02:48.130> Earth's

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
be able to get well beyond Earth's

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.110 
be able to get well beyond Earth's
boundaries<00:02:49.800> past<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:51.100> moon<00:02:51.280> vicinity<00:02:51.940> and

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
boundaries past the moon vicinity and

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.500 
boundaries past the moon vicinity and
well<00:02:52.720> on<00:02:53.020> to<00:02:53.290> Mars<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:53.890> know<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.370> SLS<00:02:54.880> is<00:02:55.090> far

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
well on to Mars you know the SLS is far

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.560 
well on to Mars you know the SLS is far
more<00:02:55.750> capable<00:02:56.080> than<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:57.130> Saturn<00:02:57.520> five<00:02:57.790> which

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
more capable than the Saturn five which

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.570 
more capable than the Saturn five which
is<00:02:58.750> was<00:02:58.960> the<00:02:59.170> most<00:02:59.380> capable<00:02:59.620> thing<00:03:00.190> that<00:03:00.430> we

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
is was the most capable thing that we

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.510 
is was the most capable thing that we
ever<00:03:00.790> put<00:03:01.030> together<00:03:01.210> for<00:03:02.170> for<00:03:02.680> humans<00:03:03.070> going

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
ever put together for for humans going

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.080 
ever put together for for humans going
to<00:03:03.760> space<00:03:04.120> but<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.780> SLS<00:03:05.110> also<00:03:05.950> provides<00:03:06.460> us<00:03:06.820> an

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
to space but the SLS also provides us an

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.840 
to space but the SLS also provides us an
enormous<00:03:07.900> opportunity<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:09.100> open<00:03:09.490> up<00:03:09.640> the

third<00:03:36.460> of<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.670> time<00:03:38.160> yeah<00:03:39.160> so<00:03:39.490> for<00:03:39.820> me<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:40.270> just

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
third of the time yeah so for me it just

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.840 
third of the time yeah so for me it just
blows<00:03:40.780> open<00:03:41.020> the<00:03:41.290> outer<00:03:41.440> solar<00:03:41.800> system<00:03:41.890> the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
blows open the outer solar system the

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.480 
blows open the outer solar system the
ability<00:03:43.240> to<00:03:43.270> rapidly<00:03:43.870> bring<00:03:44.560> those<00:03:44.860> objects

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
ability to rapidly bring those objects

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.850 
ability to rapidly bring those objects
close<00:03:45.910> at<00:03:46.240> hand<00:03:46.570> because<00:03:47.110> we<00:03:47.260> can<00:03:47.440> get<00:03:47.650> there

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
close at hand because we can get there

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.550 
close at hand because we can get there
quickly<00:03:48.250> allows<00:03:49.209> our<00:03:49.480> science<00:03:49.959> to<00:03:50.140> mature

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
quickly allows our science to mature

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.890 
quickly allows our science to mature
quite<00:03:50.980> rapidly<00:03:51.520> and<00:03:51.790> gives<00:03:52.390> us<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.690> deeper

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
quite rapidly and gives us a deeper

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.790 
quite rapidly and gives us a deeper
understanding<00:03:53.110> of<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:55.120> place<00:03:55.450> this<00:03:55.810> world<00:03:56.170> is

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
understanding of the place this world is

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.790 
understanding of the place this world is
in<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.400> that's<00:03:57.850> our<00:03:58.030> solar<00:03:58.300> system<00:03:58.780> very<00:03:59.560> well

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
in and that's our solar system very well

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.460 
in and that's our solar system very well
