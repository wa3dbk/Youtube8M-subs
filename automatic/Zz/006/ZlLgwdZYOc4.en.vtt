47 years old and I started three years
ago<00:00:19.980> in<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:21.119> project<00:00:21.600> as<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.840> test<00:00:22.109> pilot<00:00:22.439> for

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
ago in the project as a test pilot for

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.430 
ago in the project as a test pilot for
the<00:00:22.740> Solar<00:00:22.949> Impulse<00:00:23.130> airplane

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.440 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.920 

the<00:00:30.440> purpose<00:00:30.890> of<00:00:31.010> the<00:00:31.160> first<00:00:31.430> flight<00:00:31.789> will<00:00:32.750> be

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
the purpose of the first flight will be

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.950 
the purpose of the first flight will be
to<00:00:33.170> look<00:00:33.620> at<00:00:33.800> the<00:00:34.059> handling<00:00:35.059> qualities<00:00:35.540> of<00:00:35.570> the

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
to look at the handling qualities of the

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.350 
to look at the handling qualities of the
airplane<00:00:36.320> and<00:00:36.350> basically<00:00:37.160> look<00:00:37.879> at<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:38.120> first

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
airplane and basically look at the first

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.270 
airplane and basically look at the first
performance<00:00:38.900> data<00:00:39.140> and<00:00:39.320> then<00:00:39.830> land<00:00:40.129> the

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
performance data and then land the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.890 
performance data and then land the
airplane<00:00:40.460> safely<00:00:41.090> back<00:00:41.600> in<00:00:41.840> pioneer<00:00:42.559> base

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.700 

on<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.470> second<00:00:49.800> flight<00:00:49.950> we<00:00:50.640> will<00:00:50.790> look<00:00:50.970> into

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
on the second flight we will look into

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.740 
on the second flight we will look into
slow<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.890> air<00:00:53.160> speeds<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:54.360> look<00:00:54.510> at<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
slow of air speeds to look at the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.510 
slow of air speeds to look at the
handling<00:00:55.050> qualities<00:00:55.200> of<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.860> airplane<00:00:56.250> at

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
handling qualities of the airplane at

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.729 
handling qualities of the airplane at
slower<00:00:56.910> speeds<00:00:57.060> and<00:00:57.720> we<00:00:58.080> will<00:00:58.260> also<00:00:58.530> fly<00:00:58.710> a

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
slower speeds and we will also fly a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.340 
slower speeds and we will also fly a
little<00:00:59.010> bit<00:00:59.130> faster<00:00:59.610> than<00:00:59.850> bit<00:01:00.030> higher<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.570> we

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
little bit faster than bit higher and we

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.070 
little bit faster than bit higher and we
look<00:01:01.530> into<00:01:02.220> more<00:01:02.430> more<00:01:03.210> into<00:01:03.540> the<00:01:03.660> system

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
look into more more into the system

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:12.200 
look into more more into the system
behavior<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.489> airplane

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.810 

it's<00:01:13.210> each<00:01:13.630> flight<00:01:13.929> will

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
it's each flight will

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.760 
it's each flight will
and<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:15.420> will<00:01:15.600> change<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.020> configuration<00:01:16.680> of

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
and we will change the configuration of

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.620 
and we will change the configuration of
the<00:01:16.890> airplane<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.700> first<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.300> second

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the airplane and the first in the second

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.800 
the airplane and the first in the second
flight<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.050> will<00:01:19.200> fly<00:01:19.440> with<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.800> cage<00:01:20.010> and<00:01:20.810> on

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
flight we will fly with the cage and on

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.110 
flight we will fly with the cage and on
the<00:01:21.990> third<00:01:22.200> flight<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:23.130> will<00:01:23.310> install<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
the third flight we will install the

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.360 
the third flight we will install the
eggshell<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.440> we<00:01:25.590> will<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.040> final

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
eggshell so we will have the final

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.940 
eggshell so we will have the final
configuration<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.330> airplane<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.950> then

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
configuration of the airplane and then

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.940 
configuration of the airplane and then
we<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.340> have<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.880> good<00:01:30.600> data<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
we can have the good data for the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.670 
we can have the good data for the
mission<00:01:32.640> flights

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.560 

the<00:01:40.680> day<00:01:40.830> before<00:01:41.010> we<00:01:41.340> do<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.640> first<00:01:42.060> flight<00:01:42.330> we

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
the day before we do the first flight we

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.300 
the day before we do the first flight we
will<00:01:42.630> meet<00:01:42.900> we<00:01:43.380> will<00:01:43.530> check<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.860> weather<00:01:44.040> we

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
will meet we will check the weather we

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.270 
will meet we will check the weather we
will<00:01:44.340> talk<00:01:44.670> about<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.120> flight<00:01:45.330> profile<00:01:45.810> and

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
will talk about the flight profile and

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.850 
will talk about the flight profile and
on<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.490> day<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.940> flight<00:01:48.060> we<00:01:48.690> will<00:01:48.870> confirm

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
on the day of the flight we will confirm

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.640 
on the day of the flight we will confirm
the<00:01:50.610> leather<00:01:50.820> forecast<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:52.230> have<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.500> do<00:01:52.620> a

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
the leather forecast we have to do a

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.270 
the leather forecast we have to do a
final<00:01:53.160> check<00:01:53.910> of<00:01:53.940> the<00:01:54.150> airplane<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:55.020> we

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
final check of the airplane then we

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.760 
final check of the airplane then we
transport<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.400> airplane<00:01:56.760> to<00:01:57.300> the<00:01:57.330> runway<00:01:57.840> we

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
transport the airplane to the runway we

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.890 
transport the airplane to the runway we
do<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> check<00:01:59.400> on<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.729> weather<00:01:59.760> conditions<00:02:00.660> and

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
do a check on the weather conditions and

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.890 
do a check on the weather conditions and
if<00:02:01.860> everything<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.400> fine<00:02:02.460> we<00:02:02.970> we<00:02:03.390> start<00:02:03.750> the

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
if everything is fine we we start the

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.890 
if everything is fine we we start the
first<00:02:04.080> flight<00:02:04.380> we<00:02:05.190> need<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.370> lot<00:02:05.580> of<00:02:05.900> equipment

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
first flight we need a lot of equipment

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.359 
first flight we need a lot of equipment
around<00:02:07.260> so<00:02:07.680> we<00:02:07.770> will<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.070> chase

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
around so we will have a chase

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.260 
around so we will have a chase
helicopter<00:02:09.030> following<00:02:09.990> the<00:02:10.140> airplane<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.890> do

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
helicopter following the airplane to do

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.260 
helicopter following the airplane to do
pictures<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.540> also<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.440> look<00:02:13.680> at<00:02:13.860> all<00:02:14.010> the

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
pictures and also to look at all the

pictures and also to look at all the
parts<00:02:15.270> of<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.510> airplane<00:02:15.930> in<00:02:16.140> flight<00:02:17.090> the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
parts of the airplane in flight the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.670 
parts of the airplane in flight the
flight<00:02:18.330> profile<00:02:18.720> for<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.020> first<00:02:19.260> flight<00:02:19.440> will

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
flight profile for the first flight will

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.520 
flight profile for the first flight will
be<00:02:19.709> we<00:02:20.010> do<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.160> take-off<00:02:21.320> typically<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.500> the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
be we do a take-off typically to the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.430 
be we do a take-off typically to the
north<00:02:22.860> east<00:02:23.370> because<00:02:24.360> they<00:02:24.750> are<00:02:24.810> less<00:02:25.110> hills

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
north east because they are less hills

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.410 
north east because they are less hills
around<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.430> we<00:02:26.550> want<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.850> gain<00:02:27.030> all<00:02:27.300> the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
around and we want to gain all the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.290 
around and we want to gain all the
tudors<00:02:27.930> as<00:02:28.230> quickly<00:02:28.470> as<00:02:28.680> possible<00:02:29.030> so<00:02:30.030> we<00:02:30.060> do<00:02:30.270> a

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
tudors as quickly as possible so we do a

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.080 
tudors as quickly as possible so we do a
long<00:02:30.600> straight<00:02:31.080> climb<00:02:31.620> for<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.550> first<00:02:32.850> flight

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
long straight climb for the first flight

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.870 
long straight climb for the first flight
and<00:02:33.480> then<00:02:33.720> we<00:02:33.900> start<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.260> gentle<00:02:34.620> turn<00:02:34.770> look<00:02:35.760> at

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
and then we start a gentle turn look at

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.520 
and then we start a gentle turn look at
the<00:02:36.000> handling<00:02:36.300> qualities<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:37.170> airplane

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
the handling qualities of the airplane

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.470 
the handling qualities of the airplane
so<00:02:37.800> we<00:02:37.980> see<00:02:38.160> if<00:02:38.400> we<00:02:38.520> can<00:02:38.700> do<00:02:38.880> left<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.330> right

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
so we see if we can do left and right

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.160 
so we see if we can do left and right
turns<00:02:39.900> how<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.560> feels<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.330> then<00:02:42.330> we<00:02:42.510> look<00:02:42.660> into

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
turns how it feels and then we look into

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.660 
turns how it feels and then we look into
a<00:02:43.470> level<00:02:43.860> flight<00:02:44.550> portion<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:45.900> we<00:02:46.200> have<00:02:47.010> some

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
a level flight portion so we have some

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.900 
a level flight portion so we have some
performance<00:02:48.239> data<00:02:48.330> for<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.019> airplane<00:02:49.320> and

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
performance data for the airplane and

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.330 
performance data for the airplane and
the<00:02:50.910> next<00:02:51.180> test<00:02:52.170> will<00:02:52.470> be<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:53.190> landing

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
the next test will be the landing

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.460 
the next test will be the landing
configuration<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:54.390> we<00:02:54.540> do<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:54.900> simulated

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
configuration so we do a simulated

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.320 
configuration so we do a simulated
landing<00:02:55.980> high<00:02:56.160> up<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:56.730> we<00:02:56.880> have<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.120> shut<00:02:57.299> down

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
landing high up so we have to shut down

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.970 
landing high up so we have to shut down
the<00:02:57.709> outboard<00:02:58.709> engines<00:02:59.100> and<00:03:00.500> lower<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.769> gear

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
the outboard engines and lower the gear

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.090 
the outboard engines and lower the gear
again<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.870> deploy<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.110> air<00:03:04.260> brakes<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.010> then

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
again and deploy the air brakes and then

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.699 
again and deploy the air brakes and then
we<00:03:05.250> do<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.400> similarity<00:03:06.239> sent<00:03:06.750> up<00:03:06.959> high<00:03:07.200> out<00:03:07.230> in

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
we do a similarity sent up high out in

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.280 
we do a similarity sent up high out in
high<00:03:08.040> altitude<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.790> then<00:03:09.720> we<00:03:09.870> simulate<00:03:10.260> a

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
high altitude and then we simulate a

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.900 
high altitude and then we simulate a
go-around<00:03:10.590> because<00:03:11.100> one<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.459> interesting

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
go-around because one of the interesting

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.690 
go-around because one of the interesting
points<00:03:12.330> is<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.690> know<00:03:12.900> how<00:03:13.200> much<00:03:13.410> altitudes<00:03:14.070> we

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
points is to know how much altitudes we

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.270 
points is to know how much altitudes we
need<00:03:14.970> in<00:03:15.209> order<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.739> retract<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.860> air<00:03:16.980> brakes

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
need in order to retract the air brakes

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.789 
need in order to retract the air brakes
start<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.850> outboard<00:03:18.239> engines<00:03:18.600> again<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.140> do

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
start the outboard engines again and do

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.800 
start the outboard engines again and do
a<00:03:19.830> climb<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.459> that<00:03:21.090> will<00:03:21.269> determine<00:03:21.390> the

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
a climb and that will determine the

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.560 
a climb and that will determine the
altitudes<00:03:22.290> where<00:03:22.739> we<00:03:22.860> have<00:03:23.100> still<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.790> option

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
altitudes where we have still the option

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.330 
altitudes where we have still the option
to<00:03:24.720> do<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.870> go-around<00:03:25.380> on<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.709> first<00:03:25.950> landing

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
to do a go-around on the first landing

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.840 
to do a go-around on the first landing
and<00:03:26.700> then<00:03:27.420> once<00:03:28.080> we<00:03:28.230> have<00:03:28.320> seen<00:03:28.470> that<00:03:28.650> we<00:03:29.190> come

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
and then once we have seen that we come

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.789 
and then once we have seen that we come
back<00:03:29.880> to<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.420> airfield<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.140> do<00:03:31.320> an<00:03:31.470> approach

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
back to the airfield and do an approach

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.390 
back to the airfield and do an approach
and<00:03:33.080> do<00:03:34.080> a<00:03:34.410> landing<00:03:34.769> out<00:03:34.890> of<00:03:35.010> that<00:03:35.160> approach

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
and do a landing out of that approach

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.699 
and do a landing out of that approach
and<00:03:35.850> if<00:03:36.360> something<00:03:36.780> doesn't<00:03:36.930> feel<00:03:37.200> right<00:03:37.260> we

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
and if something doesn't feel right we

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.289 
and if something doesn't feel right we
have<00:03:37.830> obviously<00:03:38.070> option<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.760> do<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:38.910> go-around

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
have obviously option to do a go-around

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.960 
have obviously option to do a go-around
fly<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.200> small<00:03:40.470> traffic<00:03:41.010> pattern<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.580> do

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
fly a small traffic pattern and do

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.200 
fly a small traffic pattern and do
another<00:03:42.150> approach

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.970 

hmmm<00:03:48.080> I<00:03:49.540> think<00:03:50.540> they're<00:03:50.960> the<00:03:51.170> final<00:03:51.770> goal<00:03:51.950> of

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
hmmm I think they're the final goal of

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.680 
hmmm I think they're the final goal of
the<00:03:52.370> first<00:03:52.640> slide<00:03:52.910> is<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.210> bring<00:03:53.450> back<00:03:53.660> the

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
the first slide is to bring back the

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.920 
the first slide is to bring back the
airplane<00:03:53.960> in<00:03:54.320> one<00:03:54.470> piece

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.190 

I<00:04:00.790> feel<00:04:01.790> pretty<00:04:01.970> confident<00:04:02.480> because<00:04:02.659> we<00:04:03.019> had<00:04:03.170> a

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
I feel pretty confident because we had a

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.440 
I feel pretty confident because we had a
solo<00:04:03.980> check<00:04:04.280> out<00:04:04.430> of<00:04:04.610> the<00:04:04.760> airplane<00:04:05.030> we<00:04:05.269> did<00:04:05.420> a

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
solo check out of the airplane we did a

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.170 
solo check out of the airplane we did a
lot<00:04:05.629> of<00:04:05.750> pre<00:04:06.019> tests<00:04:06.530> we<00:04:07.310> have<00:04:07.489> people<00:04:07.909> in<00:04:08.030> the

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
lot of pre tests we have people in the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.210 
lot of pre tests we have people in the
telemetry<00:04:08.599> so<00:04:08.989> they<00:04:09.140> see<00:04:09.200> all<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.709> data<00:04:09.920> they

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
telemetry so they see all the data they

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.089 
telemetry so they see all the data they
can<00:04:10.280> help<00:04:10.640> if<00:04:10.940> there's<00:04:11.480> a<00:04:11.510> problem<00:04:11.959> and<00:04:12.140> we<00:04:12.980> did

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
can help if there's a problem and we did

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.710 
can help if there's a problem and we did
a<00:04:13.129> lot<00:04:13.310> of<00:04:13.340> training<00:04:13.760> in<00:04:13.849> a<00:04:13.909> simulator<00:04:14.330> so<00:04:14.599> I'm

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
a lot of training in a simulator so I'm

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.850 
a lot of training in a simulator so I'm
very<00:04:14.870> confident<00:04:15.440> that<00:04:15.500> it<00:04:15.920> will<00:04:16.220> fly

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.990 

we<00:04:22.860> did<00:04:23.010> some<00:04:23.220> some<00:04:23.460> flights<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:23.910> other

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
we did some some flights and other

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.330 
we did some some flights and other
airplanes<00:04:24.540> that<00:04:24.720> have<00:04:24.840> an<00:04:25.080> open<00:04:25.350> cockpit<00:04:25.560> so

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
airplanes that have an open cockpit so

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.980 
airplanes that have an open cockpit so
it's<00:04:26.550> getting<00:04:26.820> cold<00:04:27.060> after<00:04:27.480> a<00:04:27.510> while<00:04:27.660> but<00:04:27.930> I

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
it's getting cold after a while but I

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.080 
it's getting cold after a while but I
hope<00:04:28.200> it's<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.830> weather's<00:04:29.130> turning<00:04:29.400> nice<00:04:29.730> and

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
hope it's the weather's turning nice and

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.360 
hope it's the weather's turning nice and
we'll<00:04:30.630> be<00:04:30.750> warmer<00:04:31.080> than<00:04:31.230> it<00:04:31.380> was<00:04:31.560> months<00:04:32.190> ago

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
we'll be warmer than it was months ago

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.970 
we'll be warmer than it was months ago
we<00:04:33.120> have<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.270> lot<00:04:33.540> of<00:04:33.570> good<00:04:34.020> equipment<00:04:34.320> we<00:04:34.770> have

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
we have a lot of good equipment we have

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.000 
we have a lot of good equipment we have
a<00:04:35.610> big<00:04:36.030> suit<00:04:36.630> that's<00:04:36.960> insulated<00:04:37.290> and<00:04:37.770> there's

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
a big suit that's insulated and there's

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.430 
a big suit that's insulated and there's
auto<00:04:38.310> electrical<00:04:38.970> heating<00:04:39.150> for<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.540> gloves

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
auto electrical heating for the gloves

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.370 
auto electrical heating for the gloves
and<00:04:40.800> for<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.160> feet
