00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
video the new kepler architecture really

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.999 
video the new kepler architecture really
impressed<00:00:17.650> with<00:00:17.770> it<00:00:17.890> so<00:00:18.040> far<00:00:18.360> it's<00:00:19.800> only<00:00:20.800> a

a quick picture is it you know a tiny
bit<00:00:29.380> bigger<00:00:29.619> than<00:00:30.220> the<00:00:30.329> gtx<00:00:31.329> 570<00:00:31.980> still<00:00:32.980> fits

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
bit bigger than the gtx 570 still fits

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.620 
bit bigger than the gtx 570 still fits
in<00:00:33.250> my<00:00:33.340> case<00:00:33.579> quite<00:00:33.790> nicely<00:00:34.059> they<00:00:34.390> I<00:00:36.480> know<00:00:37.480> that

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
in my case quite nicely they I know that

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.600 
in my case quite nicely they I know that
they're<00:00:37.990> going<00:00:38.140> to<00:00:38.260> release<00:00:38.380> other<00:00:39.130> cards

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
they're going to release other cards

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.820 
they're going to release other cards
yeah<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.620> Kepler<00:00:41.970> series<00:00:43.380> but<00:00:44.380> this<00:00:44.500> one<00:00:44.680> is

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
yeah the Kepler series but this one is

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.320 
yeah the Kepler series but this one is
definitely<00:00:45.010> a<00:00:45.310> very<00:00:45.520> impressive<00:00:46.210> and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
definitely a very impressive and

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.540 
definitely a very impressive and
definitely<00:00:46.900> a<00:00:46.960> good<00:00:47.110> start<00:00:49.770> as<00:00:50.770> you<00:00:50.890> can<00:00:51.010> see<00:00:51.220> i

definitely a good start as you can see i

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.680 
definitely a good start as you can see i
got<00:00:52.270> about<00:00:52.329> 90<00:00:52.990> FPS<00:00:53.380> at<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.620> moment<00:00:54.480> good<00:00:55.480> time

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
got about 90 FPS at the moment good time

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.430 
got about 90 FPS at the moment good time
to<00:00:55.810> like<00:00:55.960> 60<00:00:56.410> though<00:00:56.560> when<00:00:58.110> when<00:00:59.110> you<00:00:59.170> look<00:00:59.290> at

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
to like 60 though when when you look at

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.380 
to like 60 though when when you look at
looking<00:00:59.950> at<00:01:00.040> the<00:01:00.130> entire<00:01:00.250> map<00:01:00.670> this<00:01:01.210> is

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
looking at the entire map this is

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.850 
looking at the entire map this is
actually<00:01:01.720> a<00:01:01.750> 32<00:01:02.320> slot<00:01:03.070> server<00:01:03.370> on<00:01:03.640> cars<00:01:03.910> island

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
actually a 32 slot server on cars island

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.980 
actually a 32 slot server on cars island
i'll<00:01:05.860> show<00:01:06.009> you<00:01:06.070> a<00:01:06.159> quick<00:01:06.690> benchmark<00:01:07.690> i<00:01:07.840> put

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
i'll show you a quick benchmark i put

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.920 
i'll show you a quick benchmark i put
together<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:09.729> you<00:01:09.850> can<00:01:09.940> see<00:01:10.120> is<00:01:10.240> considerably

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
together as you can see is considerably

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.870 
together as you can see is considerably
more<00:01:10.990> than<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.470> I<00:01:11.590> gtx<00:01:12.159> 570<00:01:14.220> that's<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.430> game

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
more than the I gtx 570 that's the game

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.030 
more than the I gtx 570 that's the game
word<00:01:16.290> golden<00:01:17.290> sample<00:01:17.650> one<00:01:19.530> still<00:01:20.530> a<00:01:20.560> good<00:01:20.740> card

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
word golden sample one still a good card

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.600 
word golden sample one still a good card
but<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:22.000> gtx<00:01:22.420> 680<00:01:22.750> is<00:01:22.960> to<00:01:23.770> sort<00:01:23.950> dominates<00:01:24.490> it

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
but the gtx 680 is to sort dominates it

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.520 
but the gtx 680 is to sort dominates it
really<00:01:24.820> you<00:01:25.540> know<00:01:25.659> as<00:01:25.720> you<00:01:25.810> can<00:01:25.960> see<00:01:26.080> then<00:01:26.229> when

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
really you know as you can see then when

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.800 
really you know as you can see then when
the<00:01:26.620> helicopter<00:01:26.799> and<00:01:27.159> they<00:01:27.280> took<00:01:27.400> my<00:01:27.520> head<00:01:27.670> off

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
the helicopter and they took my head off

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.620 
the helicopter and they took my head off
and<00:01:28.810> you<00:01:29.590> still<00:01:29.830> get<00:01:29.950> a<00:01:30.010> good<00:01:30.190> fifty<00:01:30.760> solid<00:01:31.119> 60

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
and you still get a good fifty solid 60

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.750 
and you still get a good fifty solid 60
FPS<00:01:32.049> really<00:01:32.440> which<00:01:33.220> is<00:01:33.250> quite<00:01:33.520> impressive

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
FPS really which is quite impressive

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.200 
FPS really which is quite impressive
especially<00:01:34.210> in<00:01:34.450> this<00:01:34.540> game<00:01:34.780> you<00:01:35.320> know<00:01:35.440> when

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
especially in this game you know when

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.310 
especially in this game you know when
explosions<00:01:37.210> start<00:01:37.450> going<00:01:37.690> off<00:01:37.750> around<00:01:37.930> you

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
you can take a bit of fbsm

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:48.780 
you can take a bit of fbsm
take<00:01:41.290> out<00:01:41.440> that<00:01:41.530> tank<00:01:41.800> quickly<00:01:45.810> yeah<00:01:47.640> as<00:01:48.640> you
