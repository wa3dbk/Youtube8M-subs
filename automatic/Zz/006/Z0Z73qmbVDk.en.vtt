00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.320

 indispensable the support of the family 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.250

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.770
 moments though I'm going to add brandy 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.930
 because an onion soup without brandy does not 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.400
 it's an onion soup is very important 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.990
 here lasts the role of evaporating the 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.600
 alcohol and the ship of the 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:37.300
 brandy that good brandy is your base 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.610
 hey hariri you compose and sing they are nothing 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.890
 more than active I compose since I was 8 years old 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.420
 yes all the songs that are going to be 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.310
 in the album they will be my compositions 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.070
 and well I think that is something father 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.200
 because it's not bad they can know things 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.440
 real from you not because they are things that 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.440
 they live 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:03.180
 and if not 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.940
 the simple past that was tornasol 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.489
 in fact the song I composed it thinking 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.500
 in an ex girlfriend who had the pupils 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.750
 that we used clients from different 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.750
 colors in school arose the idea of 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.520
 say as part of your life not only 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.290

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:53.700
 because one can see that the race 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:04.090
