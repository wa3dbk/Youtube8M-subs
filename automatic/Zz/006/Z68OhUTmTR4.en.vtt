00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.420 
and today's crochet corner I'm going to
show<00:00:16.630> you<00:00:16.689> how<00:00:16.930> to<00:00:16.960> make<00:00:17.230> a<00:00:17.380> triangular<00:00:17.890> motif

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
show you how to make a triangular motif

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.370 
show you how to make a triangular motif
and<00:00:18.699> then<00:00:19.090> how<00:00:19.240> to<00:00:19.269> join<00:00:19.660> those<00:00:19.869> triangular

and then how to join those triangular

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.500 
and then how to join those triangular
motifs<00:00:20.949> together<00:00:21.369> to<00:00:21.910> create<00:00:22.090> a<00:00:22.240> square

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510

Afghan if you'll see here on the Afghan
we<00:00:26.080> used<00:00:26.410> two<00:00:26.860> colors<00:00:26.890> of<00:00:27.750> yarn<00:00:28.750> and<00:00:29.050> one<00:00:29.800> of

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
we used two colors of yarn and one of

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.310 
we used two colors of yarn and one of
them<00:00:30.070> is<00:00:30.250> a<00:00:30.279> tweeted<00:00:30.850> salt<00:00:31.360> a<00:00:31.510> light<00:00:31.750> color<00:00:32.020> and

them is a tweeted salt a light color and

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.900 
them is a tweeted salt a light color and
then<00:00:32.439> we<00:00:32.559> used<00:00:32.739> a<00:00:32.890> solid<00:00:33.100> color<00:00:33.489> for<00:00:33.820> the

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
then we used a solid color for the

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.970 
then we used a solid color for the
alternate<00:00:34.390> roast<00:00:34.600> and<00:00:34.870> that<00:00:35.199> kind<00:00:35.410> of<00:00:35.500> softens

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
alternate roast and that kind of softens

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.250 
alternate roast and that kind of softens
up<00:00:36.129> the<00:00:36.190> contrast<00:00:36.850> between<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.359> two<00:00:37.570> and<00:00:37.780> also

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
up the contrast between the two and also

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.040

show you how to join them together
I've<00:01:24.040> already<00:01:24.280> started<00:01:24.430> this<00:01:25.000> motif<00:01:25.810> I've

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
I've already started this motif I've

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.900 
I've already started this motif I've
done<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.620> first<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:27.100> second<00:01:27.430> rounds<00:01:27.760> already

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
done the first and second rounds already

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.720

available on the website so we're

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.090 
available on the website so we're
working<00:01:37.660> a<00:01:37.900> corner<00:01:38.290> here<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.770> I've<00:01:38.860> worked

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
working a corner here and I've worked

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.340 
working a corner here and I've worked
force<00:01:39.430> double<00:01:40.000> crochets<00:01:40.450> into<00:01:40.750> this<00:01:41.020> space

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
force double crochets into this space

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.270 
force double crochets into this space
then<00:01:41.920> I'm<00:01:42.040> going<00:01:42.250> to<00:01:42.310> do<00:01:42.430> a<00:01:42.460> chain<00:01:42.790> five<00:01:43.090> and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
then I'm going to do a chain five and

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.890 
then I'm going to do a chain five and
one<00:01:45.280> trick<00:01:45.580> that<00:01:45.760> I<00:01:45.790> like<00:01:46.090> to<00:01:46.300> use<00:01:46.330> when<00:01:46.750> I'm

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
one trick that I like to use when I'm

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.610 
one trick that I like to use when I'm
working<00:01:47.380> stitches<00:01:48.310> after<00:01:48.520> working<00:01:49.390> a<00:01:49.870> long

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
working stitches after working a long

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.160 
working stitches after working a long
strip<00:01:51.100> of<00:01:51.250> chains<00:01:51.580> is<00:01:51.820> that<00:01:52.060> I<00:01:52.090> hook<00:01:52.420> my<00:01:52.870> ring

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
strip of chains is that I hook my ring

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.740 
strip of chains is that I hook my ring
finger<00:01:53.620> into<00:01:53.860> that<00:01:54.190> chain<00:01:54.520> to<00:01:55.060> help<00:01:55.270> give<00:01:55.510> me<00:01:55.720> a

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
finger into that chain to help give me a

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.630 
finger into that chain to help give me a
little<00:01:56.140> more<00:01:56.320> stability<00:01:56.710> when<00:01:56.980> working<00:01:57.400> the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
little more stability when working the

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.160 
little more stability when working the
next<00:01:57.790> stitch<00:01:58.120> so<00:01:58.630> I'm<00:01:58.720> going<00:01:58.870> to<00:01:58.930> work<00:01:59.020> a

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
next stitch so I'm going to work a

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.840 
next stitch so I'm going to work a
double<00:01:59.380> crochet<00:01:59.530> into<00:02:00.190> here<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:00.610> I'm<00:02:00.700> going

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
double crochet into here and I'm going

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.570 
double crochet into here and I'm going
to<00:02:00.909> yarn<00:02:01.120> over<00:02:01.570> my<00:02:01.750> hook<00:02:02.050> pull<00:02:02.860> up<00:02:03.010> a<00:02:03.130> loop<00:02:03.310> then

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
to yarn over my hook pull up a loop then

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.390

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.050 
slips the first stitch was a chain three
that<00:02:35.380> counts<00:02:35.680> as<00:02:35.770> a<00:02:35.800> double<00:02:36.010> crochet<00:02:36.550> so<00:02:36.940> we're

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
that counts as a double crochet so we're

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.100
