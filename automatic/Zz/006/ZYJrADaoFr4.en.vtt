00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.910 

and<00:00:03.660> just<00:00:04.660> measure<00:00:04.990> how<00:00:05.170> much<00:00:05.529> you're<00:00:05.770> gonna

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:05.920 
and just measure how much you're gonna

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.960 
and just measure how much you're gonna
get<00:00:06.189> in<00:00:06.370> there

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:06.970 
get in there

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:14.209 
get in there
30<00:00:07.569> seconds<00:00:08.019> time

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.660 

so<00:00:14.790> they<00:00:15.000> decrease<00:00:15.900> our<00:00:16.080> flow<00:00:16.500> twice<00:00:17.279> and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
so they decrease our flow twice and

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.179 
so they decrease our flow twice and
we're<00:00:17.820> getting<00:00:17.970> somewhere<00:00:18.360> around<00:00:19.009> six<00:00:20.009> or

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
we're getting somewhere around six or

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.440 
we're getting somewhere around six or
seven<00:00:20.610> meals<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:22.289> 30<00:00:22.619> seconds<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:24.060> would<00:00:24.240> be

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450 
seven meals in 30 seconds that would be

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:32.569 
seven meals in 30 seconds that would be
equal<00:00:25.310> some<00:00:26.310> around<00:00:28.400> 2025<00:00:31.369> milliliters<00:00:32.369> of

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
equal some around 2025 milliliters of

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.950 
equal some around 2025 milliliters of
spirit<00:00:33.090> per<00:00:33.300> hour<00:00:34.340> and<00:00:35.340> we<00:00:36.030> have<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.450> keep<00:00:36.750> this

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
spirit per hour and we have to keep this

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.479 
spirit per hour and we have to keep this
flow<00:00:37.290> up<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.980> end

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
flow up to the end

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.830 
flow up to the end
so<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.480> closer<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:40.020> get<00:00:40.140> into<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> end<00:00:41.840> there

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
so the closer we get into the end there

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.599 
so the closer we get into the end there
more<00:00:43.050> openly<00:00:43.559> if<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.989> shift<00:00:45.989> our<00:00:46.679> spirit<00:00:47.339> into

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
more openly if to shift our spirit into

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:52.369 
more openly if to shift our spirit into
the<00:00:47.730> bigger<00:00:47.940> vessel<00:00:48.449> and<00:00:49.789> smell<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.379> taste

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the bigger vessel and smell and taste

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.919 
the bigger vessel and smell and taste
probably<00:00:53.370> some<00:00:53.609> time<00:00:54.530> what<00:00:55.530> kind<00:00:55.679> of<00:00:55.829> spirit

00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:56.929 
probably some time what kind of spirit

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:05.780 
probably some time what kind of spirit
coming<00:00:57.929> out<00:01:01.519> so<00:01:02.519> just<00:01:03.260> about<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.620> finish<00:01:04.860> this

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
particular spirit that we can see it's

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.670 
particular spirit that we can see it's
not<00:01:08.610> going<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.909> be<00:01:09.060> used<00:01:10.050> for<00:01:10.170> consumption

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680

how it was possible for whatever guys

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.779 
how it was possible for whatever guys
would<00:02:04.830> just<00:02:05.070> drink<00:02:05.760> this<00:02:06.030> former<00:02:06.480> stuff<00:02:07.789> to

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
would just drink this former stuff to

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.140 
would just drink this former stuff to
drink<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.149> stuff<00:02:09.450> before<00:02:09.720> without<00:02:10.379> being

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
drink this stuff before without being

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.720 
drink this stuff before without being
fractionally<00:02:12.150> super<00:02:12.480> related<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.650> as<00:02:14.580> I

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
fractionally super related so as I

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.399 
fractionally super related so as I
mentioned<00:02:15.120> before<00:02:15.150> we're<00:02:15.599> gonna<00:02:15.750> get<00:02:16.110> in

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
mentioned before we're gonna get in

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:21.170 
mentioned before we're gonna get in
reality<00:02:17.159> about<00:02:18.019> 20%<00:02:19.019> lists<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.250> spirits<00:02:20.940> that

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
reality about 20% lists of spirits that

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.490 
reality about 20% lists of spirits that
we

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.309 

we're<00:02:25.500> counting<00:02:25.680> four<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.879> in<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.269> case<00:02:27.599> just

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
we're counting four so in this case just

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.390 
we're counting four so in this case just
meet<00:02:29.150> all<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.300> notes<00:02:30.540> about<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.410> every<00:02:31.920> patron

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
meet all the notes about a every patron

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.050 
meet all the notes about a every patron
spirit<00:02:32.819> I<00:02:32.940> took<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:34.290> we<00:02:34.530> started<00:02:34.950> from<00:02:35.310> 400

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
spirit I took so we started from 400

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.600 
spirit I took so we started from 400
mils<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.569> five<00:02:36.810> hundred<00:02:37.140> mils<00:02:37.349> 300<00:02:37.980> mils<00:02:38.190> open

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
mils and five hundred mils 300 mils open

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.280 
mils and five hundred mils 300 mils open
it<00:02:38.730> wheels<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:40.110> on<00:02:40.349> and<00:02:40.620> finally<00:02:40.799> we<00:02:41.129> put

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
it wheels and so on and finally we put

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.140 
it wheels and so on and finally we put
2.2<00:02:43.290> liters<00:02:43.830> of<00:02:44.010> spirit<00:02:44.549> but<00:02:44.910> our

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
2.2 liters of spirit but our

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:58.009 
2.2 liters of spirit but our
calculations<00:02:45.959> were<00:02:46.080> showing<00:02:46.319> us<00:02:50.269> -<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:57.019> 934

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
calculations were showing us - and 934

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.009 
calculations were showing us - and 934
millilitres<00:02:58.739> of<00:02:58.860> it<00:02:59.010> on<00:02:59.160> all<00:02:59.340> so<00:03:00.030> if<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.840> will

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
millilitres of it on all so if you will

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.309 
millilitres of it on all so if you will
reduce<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.530> by<00:03:01.680> 20%<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.610> will<00:03:02.880> give<00:03:03.120> you

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
reduce it by 20% that will give you

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.960 
reduce it by 20% that will give you
approximately<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:05.069> figure<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.430> we're<00:03:05.730> good

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
approximately the figure that we're good

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.830 
approximately the figure that we're good
took<00:03:06.420> my<00:03:06.599> two<00:03:06.870> liters<00:03:07.230> 2.3<00:03:07.980> liters<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:09.720> it

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
took my two liters 2.3 liters so it

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.900 
took my two liters 2.3 liters so it
doesn't<00:03:10.260> mean<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:10.470> we<00:03:10.769> lost<00:03:11.010> some<00:03:11.370> spirit

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
doesn't mean that we lost some spirit

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.970 
doesn't mean that we lost some spirit
there<00:03:14.209> but<00:03:15.209> on<00:03:15.360> all<00:03:15.540> indicators<00:03:16.379> that<00:03:16.590> there

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
there but on all indicators that there

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.270 
there but on all indicators that there
is<00:03:17.129> no<00:03:17.370> more<00:03:18.180> ethanol<00:03:18.540> left<00:03:19.079> now<00:03:19.379> a<00:03:19.410> distiller

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
is no more ethanol left now a distiller

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.479 
is no more ethanol left now a distiller
so<00:03:20.849> that's<00:03:21.120> mean<00:03:21.420> we<00:03:22.079> didn't<00:03:22.379> lose<00:03:22.560> our<00:03:22.860> spirit

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
so that's mean we didn't lose our spirit

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.580 
so that's mean we didn't lose our spirit
we<00:03:23.730> just<00:03:24.030> don't<00:03:24.269> have<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.510> spirit<00:03:25.019> any<00:03:25.170> longer

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
we just don't have the spirit any longer

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.110 
we just don't have the spirit any longer
what<00:03:26.549> we<00:03:26.760> hear<00:03:27.500> this<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.739> almost<00:03:30.019> three<00:03:31.019> liters

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
what we hear this is almost three liters

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:40.520

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
but it will give some idea how to

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.399 
but it will give some idea how to
operate<00:05:02.550> this<00:05:02.729> machine<00:05:03.000> so<00:05:03.539> we<00:05:03.780> just<00:05:03.990> about

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409

petrol<00:06:07.759> for<00:06:07.999> so<00:06:08.899> in<00:06:09.050> a<00:06:09.110> copy<00:06:09.319> is<00:06:09.679> for<00:06:09.889> now<00:06:10.360> so

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:11.469 
petrol for so in a copy is for now so

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:16.869 
petrol for so in a copy is for now so
now<00:06:12.469> we<00:06:12.529> finish<00:06:13.039> our<00:06:13.249> distillation<00:06:15.699> we<00:06:16.699> can

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:16.879 
now we finish our distillation we can

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:19.929 
now we finish our distillation we can
leave<00:06:17.089> our<00:06:17.389> steel<00:06:18.019> to<00:06:18.349> cool<00:06:19.009> down<00:06:19.279> or<00:06:19.610> we<00:06:19.729> just

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:19.939 
leave our steel to cool down or we just

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:33.699 
leave our steel to cool down or we just
can<00:06:23.079> empty<00:06:24.079> it<00:06:24.229> very<00:06:25.039> easy<00:06:25.279> to<00:06:31.300> get<00:06:32.709> the

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:33.709 
can empty it very easy to get the

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:35.950 
can empty it very easy to get the
spliced<00:06:34.069> across<00:06:34.490> on

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
spliced across on

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:43.600 
spliced across on
and<00:06:38.919> open<00:06:39.919> it<00:06:40.039> up

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:49.980 

I<00:06:43.639> would<00:06:44.240> recommend<00:06:44.900> to<00:06:48.039> increase<00:06:49.039> water<00:06:49.430> flow

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:49.990 
I would recommend to increase water flow

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:56.920 
I would recommend to increase water flow
because<00:06:51.550> orders<00:06:54.220> going<00:06:55.220> to<00:06:55.310> be<00:06:55.400> very<00:06:55.610> open<00:06:56.120> so

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
because orders going to be very open so

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.080 
because orders going to be very open so
they<00:06:57.199> stop<00:06:57.500> reduced<00:06:58.280> when<00:06:58.490> the<00:06:58.520> column<00:06:58.940> is

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.090 
they stop reduced when the column is

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.909 
they stop reduced when the column is
going<00:06:59.270> to<00:06:59.360> be<00:06:59.449> mixed<00:06:59.659> with<00:06:59.900> cold<00:07:00.169> water<00:07:00.530> that

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 
going to be mixed with cold water that

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:07.300 
going to be mixed with cold water that
will<00:07:01.460> prevent<00:07:01.970> the<00:07:02.240> steam<00:07:04.569> so<00:07:05.569> because<00:07:06.310> it's

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:07.310 
will prevent the steam so because it's

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.700 
will prevent the steam so because it's
very<00:07:07.580> simple<00:07:08.120> to<00:07:08.599> chill<00:07:08.840> environment<00:07:09.470> you

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:09.710 
very simple to chill environment you

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.980 
very simple to chill environment you
know<00:07:09.889> we<00:07:10.129> want<00:07:10.340> the<00:07:10.430> dishes<00:07:11.300> and<00:07:11.479> everything

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:11.990 
know we want the dishes and everything

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.149 
know we want the dishes and everything
you<00:07:12.169> can<00:07:12.379> prepare<00:07:12.639> very<00:07:13.639> good<00:07:13.909> distillation

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:15.159 
you can prepare very good distillation

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:20.760 
you can prepare very good distillation
so<00:07:16.159> this<00:07:16.490> is<00:07:16.639> pretty<00:07:17.409> one<00:07:18.409> save<00:07:18.710> to<00:07:18.919> your

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:20.770 
so this is pretty one save to your

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.969 
so this is pretty one save to your
vessel<00:07:21.770> just<00:07:22.509> detach<00:07:23.509> the<00:07:23.690> column<00:07:24.080> and<00:07:24.289> store

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:24.979 
vessel just detach the column and store

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:27.939 
vessel just detach the column and store
it<00:07:25.099> in<00:07:25.280> a<00:07:25.340> place<00:07:26.139> whenever<00:07:27.139> you<00:07:27.380> would<00:07:27.500> like<00:07:27.710> to
