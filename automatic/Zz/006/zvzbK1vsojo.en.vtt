at<00:00:55.469> first<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.890> didn't<00:00:56.190> think<00:00:56.219> generals<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.850> would

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
at first I didn't think generals I would

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.340 
at first I didn't think generals I would
get<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.239> was<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> cool<00:00:58.140> character

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
get it was going to be a cool character

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.220 
get it was going to be a cool character
to<00:00:58.620> play<00:00:58.710> as<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.789> do<00:00:59.910> think<00:01:00.300> he<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.780> by<00:01:01.170> no

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
to play as but I do think he is by no

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.429 
to play as but I do think he is by no
means<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.710> clone<00:01:01.920> character<00:01:02.809> to<00:01:03.809> Superman<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
means a clone character to Superman and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.990 
means a clone character to Superman and
I<00:01:04.710> think<00:01:04.860> he's<00:01:04.949> completely<00:01:05.400> different<00:01:05.909> from

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
I think he's completely different from

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.480 
I think he's completely different from
Superman<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.659> pretty<00:01:06.869> much<00:01:06.930> every<00:01:07.500> way<00:01:07.740> like

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
he got he's got these awesome guns like

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.820 
he got he's got these awesome guns like
Kryptonian<00:01:12.119> guns<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.450> he<00:01:12.570> uses<00:01:12.810> which<00:01:13.710> I

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
Kryptonian guns that he uses which I

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.260 
Kryptonian guns that he uses which I
haven't<00:01:14.070> figured<00:01:14.159> out<00:01:14.310> how<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.460> combo<00:01:14.880> off<00:01:15.060> of
