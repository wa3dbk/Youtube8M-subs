can see how big this ship really is and

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.560 
can see how big this ship really is and
I<00:02:46.079> believe<00:02:46.410> there<00:02:46.590> was<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:48.410> there<00:02:49.410> was<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:50.480> set<00:02:51.480> of

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
I believe there was a there was a set of

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.270 
I believe there was a there was a set of
stairs<00:02:51.959> over<00:02:52.260> here<00:02:52.380> somewhere<00:02:52.859> which<00:02:52.980> we<00:02:53.130> can

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
stairs over here somewhere which we can

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.569 
stairs over here somewhere which we can
take<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.670> get<00:02:53.760> up<00:02:53.910> or<00:02:54.150> -<00:02:54.720> oh<00:02:55.650> God<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.400> think

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
take to get up or - oh God and I think

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:57.590 
take to get up or - oh God and I think
we<00:02:56.640> just<00:02:56.700> broke<00:02:56.850> through<00:02:57.030> than<00:02:57.180> they<00:02:57.269> okay

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
we just broke through than they okay

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.340 
we just broke through than they okay
that<00:02:57.959> uh<00:02:58.609> there<00:02:59.609> is<00:02:59.790> this<00:03:00.000> as<00:03:00.150> well<00:03:00.390> which

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.010 
I feel that's a very important part of
the<00:04:45.599> batter<00:04:45.780> of<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.520> aircraft<00:04:47.520> carrier<00:04:48.020> where

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
the batter of the aircraft carrier where

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.240 
the batter of the aircraft carrier where
we<00:04:49.139> get<00:04:49.289> in<00:04:49.440> here<00:04:51.440> let's<00:04:52.440> turn<00:04:52.710> fly<00:04:53.099> off<00:04:53.280> and

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
we get in here let's turn fly off and

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.620 
we get in here let's turn fly off and
there<00:04:56.250> this<00:04:56.729> would<00:04:56.909> be<00:04:57.030> an<00:04:57.090> easy<00:04:57.210> way<00:04:57.389> to<00:04:57.449> get

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
there this would be an easy way to get

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.480 
there this would be an easy way to get
up<00:04:57.720> so<00:04:58.620> yeah<00:04:58.710> that's<00:04:58.889> how<00:04:58.949> you<00:04:59.070> get<00:04:59.190> down<00:04:59.310> to

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
up so yeah that's how you get down to

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.070 
up so yeah that's how you get down to
the<00:04:59.669> decks<00:05:00.270> I<00:05:00.479> should<00:05:00.599> have<00:05:00.690> figured<00:05:00.810> that<00:05:00.960> out

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
the decks I should have figured that out

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.589 
the decks I should have figured that out
before<00:05:01.229> and<00:05:02.190> let's<00:05:02.669> go<00:05:02.820> to<00:05:02.880> the<00:05:03.120> control<00:05:03.570> room

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:03.599 
before and let's go to the control room

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:29.300 
before and let's go to the control room
which<00:05:08.900> makes<00:05:09.900> sense<00:05:27.979> so<00:05:28.979> I<00:05:29.009> guess<00:05:29.159> this

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
which makes sense so I guess this

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.710 
which makes sense so I guess this
control<00:05:29.699> room<00:05:29.789> there's<00:05:30.030> no<00:05:30.120> computer<00:05:30.630> or

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
control room there's no computer or

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.629 
control room there's no computer or
anything<00:05:30.900> and<00:05:32.930> um<00:05:34.310> doesn't<00:05:35.310> look<00:05:35.430> like

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639
