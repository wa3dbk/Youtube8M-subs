00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.290 

I<00:01:45.740> thought<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.950> myself<00:01:47.070> if<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.790> rest<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
I thought to myself if the rest of the

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.450 
I thought to myself if the rest of the
kids<00:01:48.480> pretty<00:01:48.750> much<00:01:48.990> falling<00:01:49.410> apart<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:50.160> I<00:01:50.190> use

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
kids pretty much falling apart can I use

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.450 
kids pretty much falling apart can I use
this<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.940> my<00:01:51.060> advantage<00:01:51.260> and<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:52.410> answer<00:01:52.800> is

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
this to my advantage and the answer is

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.020 
this to my advantage and the answer is
yes<00:01:54.770> with<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.160> little<00:01:56.310> bit<00:01:56.580> of<00:01:56.790> gentle

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
yes with just a little bit of gentle

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.360 
yes with just a little bit of gentle
persuasion<00:01:57.260> the<00:01:58.260> pack<00:01:58.530> seemed<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:58.950> break<00:01:59.160> away

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
persuasion the pack seemed to break away

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.660 
persuasion the pack seemed to break away
quite<00:01:59.790> easily

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
quite easily

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.940 
quite easily
I'm<00:02:02.210> going<00:02:02.420> to<00:02:02.509> break<00:02:02.750> this<00:02:02.930> down<00:02:02.990> just<00:02:03.830> so

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
I'm going to break this down just so

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.609 
I'm going to break this down just so
it's<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.220> little<00:02:04.460> bit<00:02:04.580> easier<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:04.939> pain

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:18.310 

you

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.020 

so<00:02:19.320> is<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.830> engine<00:02:20.070> block<00:02:20.280> as<00:02:20.430> it's<00:02:20.610> down<00:02:20.820> this

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
so is the engine block as it's down this

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.120 
so is the engine block as it's down this
I've<00:02:21.240> give<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.510> bit<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.840> repaint<00:02:22.290> put<00:02:23.100> a

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
I've give it a bit of a repaint put a

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.000 
I've give it a bit of a repaint put a
wash<00:02:23.400> over<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.850> actual<00:02:24.180> engine<00:02:24.600> block<00:02:25.010> we

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
wash over the actual engine block we

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.790 
wash over the actual engine block we
