00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.659
 Welcome friends 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.339
 well maintained entertainment my name is 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.259
 shows and we'll take a look now 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.780
 new teaser trailer on the too bright 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.420
 Five has now been shown at the e3 and 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.980
 for both the xbox want 2014 'out 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.199
 come and I am very curious 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.060
 At the beginning you can see people in the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.340
 carriage it's master chiefs yes the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.990
 through a desert does not quite run 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.720
 as much as you ask yourself what is that 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.130
 that on the earth where that is what makes 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.140
 he there at all why yes runs quite 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.279
 alone through desert without anyone 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.929
 another tree ever had a 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.189
 carriage 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.420
 questions about questions will of course be 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.190
 once again posed as one 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.829
 teaser common and yes then comes on 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.149
 the cliff and everything about your environment 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:49.110
 to move and suddenly at 1 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.050
 Promethean approves her bra vehicle 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.149
 or a creature shoots from the ground 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.910
 out and one wonders what is it 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.410
 bird finally looks and general 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.600
 pretty blatant presentation 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.000
 you ask yourself that's the didactic 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.650
 is he had returned now 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.869
 other gadgets finally in his 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.500
 cool ball like halo 4 is something quite 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.210
 other 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.530
 where the master chief at all is 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.180
 has been proven to appear 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.350
 one has indeed seen the horny moon 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.720
 right in the very big other 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.040
 planets it is not on the earth so 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.619
 it's probably on some 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.119
 planets or is it another blood father 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.900
 only on a planet where the blues 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.549
 fathers were 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.619
 you do not know it then you see 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.250
 of course, deep again from his 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.310
 carriage then yes or probably 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.220
 in my opinion it is a chip and 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.119
 although the fontana he still has 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.549
 and that was empty now 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.729
 as you know, joy at the end of halo 4 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.049
 sacrificed himself to save him and as 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.090
 man the masterchief sees as the 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.810
 pressure wave in the hood submits 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.799
 you also see it looks pretty 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.990
 taken away 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.939
 the paint peels off his helmet 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.969
 his visors jumped and like us 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.159
 he has a deep suit at the end 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.439
 from halo 4 even filed and it has to be yes 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.979
 also have a reason so again 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.960
 attracts 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.440
 and now maybe he's pulling 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.870
 uninhabited has its goods mankind 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.180
 found his true innermost, so to speak 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.530
 even the portan has lost him 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.060
 really hard hit as it seems and 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.360
 Now he is alone in the desert 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.849
 a yes as in halo 4 already said 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.560
 was aging this maybe without waiting 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.830
 hope maybe to die in the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.930
 desert or to someone again 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.000
 confront in a true determination 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.450
 I do not know you do not know 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.269
 definitely a lot of content and 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.580
 Personally, I'm really curious if 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:50.819
 we are not quite so sure yet 3 43 19 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:52.920
 want advertises anna may come 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.760
 but returning will not do 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.000
 you can not say it if so how 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.200
 maybe he's there too somehow 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.780
 no idea a way to find them 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.739
 to return or something else 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.450
 one does not know 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.690
 you definitely recognize that you are him 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.840
 alone means that he still has much 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:18.780
 so the band carries around with it 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.099
 and made it so maybe me 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.720
 do not want to hope for it but maybe 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.450
 since we actually experience the end of 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.500
 all six that the chief dies that 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.019
 would be synonymous now a guess 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.340
 but could do good 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.560
 many ask what do you think of that 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.030
 whole teaser trailer looks natural 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.629
 pretty cool is out of synonymous in the render 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.190
 trailer 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.450
 so it was to be expected 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.810
 Personally, I actually found it completely 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.920
 cool with me the halo 4 teaser at that time 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.240
 more faked but that 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.780
 probably because it was so 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.400
 message came deep tank he planned 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.230
 comes back and there is new halo with 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.360
 the deep well now it's just easy 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.150
 only further was to be expected halo five 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.640
 eggs were already announced indirectly 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.710
 and now, okay, to me 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.270
 halo 4 should appear in 2014 I hope 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.580
 you liked this little analysis 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.040
 if you see more german halo videos 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.240
 want jackman channels I have the 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.420
 channel for all who do not know 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.130
 even with a colleague who crosses and yes 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.270
 we do but videos is I guess 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.460
 nice you can drop by 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.600
 and otherwise it should be the front of me 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.290
 I hope it has you 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.330
 like 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.330
 skin in until first 1000 times
