00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.580 

so<00:00:06.790> let's<00:00:07.360> begin<00:00:08.220> with<00:00:09.840> trying<00:00:10.840> to<00:00:10.930> introduce

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
so let's begin with trying to introduce

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.730 
so let's begin with trying to introduce
you<00:00:11.740> to<00:00:11.830> biochemistry<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:16.059> we're<00:00:16.510> going<00:00:16.630> to<00:00:16.740> be

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
you to biochemistry so we're going to be

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.900 
you to biochemistry so we're going to be
thinking<00:00:18.570> atoms<00:00:19.570> and<00:00:19.869> and<00:00:20.369> molecules<00:00:21.369> for<00:00:21.880> a

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
thinking atoms and and molecules for a

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:31.109 
thinking atoms and and molecules for a
little<00:00:22.150> bit<00:00:29.070> let's<00:00:30.070> begin<00:00:30.400> by<00:00:30.580> thinking<00:00:30.640> about

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
little bit let's begin by thinking about

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.939 
little bit let's begin by thinking about
the<00:00:31.420> composition<00:00:31.750> of<00:00:32.050> a<00:00:32.169> cells<00:00:32.439> that's<00:00:32.769> the

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
the composition of a cells that's the

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:40.280 
the composition of a cells that's the
basic<00:00:34.559> unit<00:00:35.559> of<00:00:35.650> life<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:38.260> about<00:00:38.620> 60<00:00:39.610> percent

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
basic unit of life it's about 60 percent

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.150 
basic unit of life it's about 60 percent
hydrogen<00:00:41.290> 20<00:00:41.920> percent<00:00:42.370> oxygen<00:00:43.739> 12<00:00:44.739> percent

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
hydrogen 20 percent oxygen 12 percent

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.799 
hydrogen 20 percent oxygen 12 percent
carbon<00:00:46.410> 5<00:00:47.410> percent<00:00:47.860> nitrogen<00:00:48.040> and<00:00:48.809> then

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
carbon 5 percent nitrogen and then

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.229 
carbon 5 percent nitrogen and then
there's<00:00:50.410> a<00:00:50.500> bunch<00:00:50.710> of<00:00:50.829> other<00:00:50.980> stuff<00:00:51.280> class

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
there's a bunch of other stuff class

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.220 
there's a bunch of other stuff class
states<00:00:52.600> sulfur<00:00:53.610> magnesium<00:00:55.020> manganese<00:00:56.129> etc

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
states sulfur magnesium manganese etc

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.110 
states sulfur magnesium manganese etc
but<00:00:59.230> it's<00:00:59.379> not<00:00:59.500> a<00:00:59.530> very<00:00:59.890> helpful<00:01:00.219> way<00:01:01.090> of

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
but it's not a very helpful way of

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.380 
but it's not a very helpful way of
studying<00:01:01.780> biology<00:01:02.170> it's<00:01:02.829> interesting<00:01:03.129> and<00:01:03.760> is

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
studying biology it's interesting and is

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.670 
studying biology it's interesting and is
relevant<00:01:04.989> in<00:01:05.080> some<00:01:05.259> contexts<00:01:05.860> but<00:01:06.700> that's<00:01:06.940> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
relevant in some contexts but that's the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.250 
relevant in some contexts but that's the
atomic<00:01:08.680> composition<00:01:08.920> if<00:01:09.610> we<00:01:10.270> look<00:01:10.450> instead<00:01:11.020> at

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
atomic composition if we look instead at

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.320 
atomic composition if we look instead at
the<00:01:11.890> molecular<00:01:12.640> composition<00:01:13.510> of<00:01:14.080> a<00:01:14.170> cell<00:01:15.330> then

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
the molecular composition of a cell then

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.929 
the molecular composition of a cell then
things<00:01:16.570> start<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:16.869> get<00:01:17.020> interesting<00:01:17.939> cells

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
things start to get interesting cells

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.810 
things start to get interesting cells
are<00:01:19.150> about<00:01:20.100> somewhere<00:01:21.100> in<00:01:21.189> the<00:01:21.280> ballpark<00:01:21.400> of

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
are about somewhere in the ballpark of

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.590 
are about somewhere in the ballpark of
80%<00:01:22.420> water<00:01:24.030> water<00:01:25.030> is<00:01:25.150> going<00:01:25.270> to<00:01:25.330> be<00:01:25.420> very

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
80% water water is going to be very

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.230 
80% water water is going to be very
important<00:01:26.049> when<00:01:26.200> we<00:01:26.439> talk<00:01:26.590> about<00:01:26.770> that<00:01:27.009> but<00:01:28.000> of

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
important when we talk about that but of

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.060 
important when we talk about that but of
the<00:01:28.479> remain<00:01:28.810> of<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.170> remainder<00:01:31.979> then<00:01:33.360> about

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
the remain of the remainder then about

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.770 
the remain of the remainder then about
50%<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:37.210> protein<00:01:40.049> about<00:01:41.280> 15%<00:01:42.570> are<00:01:43.570> these

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
50% it's protein about 15% are these

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.359 
50% it's protein about 15% are these
molecules<00:01:44.350> we<00:01:44.560> call<00:01:45.450> nucleic<00:01:46.450> acids<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.369> that

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
molecules we call nucleic acids and that

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.330 
molecules we call nucleic acids and that
means<00:01:48.610> DNA<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.869> RNA<00:01:50.259> which<00:01:50.740> I<00:01:50.770> think<00:01:51.009> most<00:01:51.130> of

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340

you have probably heard of we'll be

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.010 
you have probably heard of we'll be
