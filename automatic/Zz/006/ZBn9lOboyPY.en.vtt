00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
all but I can't think of a purpose for

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.200 
all but I can't think of a purpose for
this<00:00:18.119> Pokemon<00:00:18.630> other<00:00:19.080> than<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.800> look<00:00:19.949> like<00:00:20.220> one

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
this Pokemon other than to look like one

of<00:00:21.240> Wright's<00:00:21.539> use<00:00:21.779> testicles<00:00:23.990> although<00:00:24.990> it's

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
of Wright's use testicles although it's

not in the Pikachu family and I don't
really<00:00:29.010> understand<00:00:29.609> what<00:00:30.210> it's<00:00:30.480> purposes

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.600 
really understand what it's purposes
aside<00:00:31.650> from<00:00:32.009> having<00:00:32.790> some<00:00:33.270> decent<00:00:33.660> speed<00:00:34.079> and

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
aside from having some decent speed and

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.060 
aside from having some decent speed and
maybe<00:00:35.610> coming<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> dragon<00:00:37.320> attack<00:00:37.739> and

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
maybe coming in on a dragon attack and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.060 
maybe coming in on a dragon attack and
doing<00:00:38.640> something<00:00:38.989> but<00:00:39.989> other<00:00:40.290> than<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.620> I

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
doing something but other than that I

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.250 
doing something but other than that I
have<00:00:41.460> no<00:00:41.640> idea<00:00:41.910> what<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.149> thing<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.420> actually

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
have no idea what this thing is actually

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.979 
have no idea what this thing is actually
for<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:44.430> said<00:00:44.789> with<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.329> said<00:00:45.600> I've<00:00:45.750> tried

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
for that said with that said I've tried

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.360 
for that said with that said I've tried
to<00:00:46.110> build<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.320> set<00:00:46.530> around<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.190> I've

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
to build a set around it but I've

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.340 
to build a set around it but I've
literally<00:00:47.640> never<00:00:47.789> seen<00:00:48.090> dedenne<00:00:48.629> being<00:00:49.050> used

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
literally never seen dedenne being used

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.770 
literally never seen dedenne being used
and<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:50.219> would<00:00:50.550> not<00:00:50.730> advise<00:00:50.969> using<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.480> set

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
and I would not advise using this set

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.720 
and I would not advise using this set
because<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.739> gimmicky<00:00:53.160> but<00:00:53.340> it's

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
because it is gimmicky but it's

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.430 
because it is gimmicky but it's
literally<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.270> only<00:00:54.480> thing<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:55.110> can<00:00:55.410> think

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
literally the only thing I can think

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.529 
literally the only thing I can think
that<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.579> do<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.030> something<00:00:57.420> else

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
that it can do that something else

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.500 
that it can do that something else
doesn't<00:00:58.050> do<00:00:58.289> infinitely<00:00:59.070> better<00:00:59.280> so<00:01:00.149> we're

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
doesn't do infinitely better so we're

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.729 
doesn't do infinitely better so we're
gonna<00:01:00.600> go<00:01:00.870> over<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.320> right<00:01:01.500> now

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
gonna go over it right now

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.969 
gonna go over it right now
um<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.940> Eevee's<00:01:03.329> are<00:01:03.600> fairly<00:01:03.809> simple<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.439> den

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
um the Eevee's are fairly simple the den

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.280 
um the Eevee's are fairly simple the den
only<00:01:05.369> has<00:01:05.519> one<00:01:05.790> good<00:01:05.970> stat<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.810> got<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> decent

only has one good stat it's got a decent
special<00:01:07.860> attacks<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.420> everything<00:01:09.420> else<00:01:09.540> is

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
special attacks that everything else is

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.870 
special attacks that everything else is
 awful<00:01:10.890> except<00:01:11.189> for<00:01:11.369> speed<00:01:11.640> which<00:01:11.850> is

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
 awful except for speed which is

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.859 
 awful except for speed which is

berry boost on the 4th one so yeah just
even<00:01:48.570> HP<00:01:48.869> number<00:01:50.509> you<00:01:51.509> know<00:01:51.659> whatever<00:01:52.380> else

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
even HP number you know whatever else

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.550 
even HP number you know whatever else
doesn't<00:01:53.130> matter<00:01:53.360> anyway<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.869> ability<00:01:55.290> you

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
doesn't matter anyway the ability you

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.139 
doesn't matter anyway the ability you
want<00:01:55.680> cheek<00:01:56.009> pouch<00:01:56.250> because<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> other<00:01:56.939> two

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
want cheek pouch because the other two

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.859 
want cheek pouch because the other two
abilities<00:01:57.360> are<00:01:57.890> absolutely<00:01:59.000> pointless<00:02:00.000> maybe

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
abilities are absolutely pointless maybe

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.690 
abilities are absolutely pointless maybe
in<00:02:01.200> double<00:02:01.469> battles<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:01.920> could<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.219> good<00:02:02.460> but

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
in double battles this could be good but

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.229 
in double battles this could be good but
even<00:02:03.450> then<00:02:03.890> it's<00:02:04.890> pretty<00:02:05.820> much<00:02:06.060> pointless<00:02:06.659> so

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
even then it's pretty much pointless so

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.649 
even then it's pretty much pointless so
run<00:02:09.239> cheek<00:02:09.450> pouch

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659 
run cheek pouch

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.979

I<00:02:10.689> don't<00:02:11.650> really<00:02:11.799> know<00:02:12.189> how<00:02:12.459> much<00:02:12.700> HP<00:02:13.510> this

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
I don't really know how much HP this

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.619 
I don't really know how much HP this
restores<00:02:14.409> I<00:02:14.590> think<00:02:14.769> it's<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.069> random<00:02:15.640> number<00:02:15.790> so

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
restores I think it's a random number so

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.330 
restores I think it's a random number so
you<00:02:16.689> got<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.079> kind<00:02:17.260> of<00:02:17.319> cross<00:02:17.620> your<00:02:17.829> fingers<00:02:18.010> I

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
you got to kind of cross your fingers I

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.069 
you got to kind of cross your fingers I
guess<00:02:18.519> when<00:02:18.700> you're<00:02:18.790> berry<00:02:19.180> activates<00:02:19.840> and

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
guess when you're berry activates and

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.500 
guess when you're berry activates and
hope<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.379> it<00:02:20.530> restores<00:02:20.859> a<00:02:21.010> decent<00:02:21.370> amount

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
hope that it restores a decent amount

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.240 
hope that it restores a decent amount
but<00:02:22.510> let's<00:02:22.659> go<00:02:22.810> over<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.019> moves<00:02:23.200> though<00:02:23.409> this

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
but let's go over the moves though this

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.069 
but let's go over the moves though this
is<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.519> only<00:02:24.700> thing<00:02:24.969> I<00:02:25.209> could<00:02:25.510> think<00:02:25.540> that

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
is the only thing I could think that

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.470 
is the only thing I could think that
this<00:02:26.650> thing<00:02:26.859> could<00:02:27.159> do<00:02:27.310> decently<00:02:27.849> so<00:02:28.239> let's

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
this thing could do decently so let's

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.599 
this thing could do decently so let's
see<00:02:28.780> if<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:29.409> know<00:02:29.500> see<00:02:29.980> what<00:02:30.099> you<00:02:30.189> guys<00:02:30.340> think

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
see if you know see what you guys think

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.330 
see if you know see what you guys think
of<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:30.909> I<00:02:30.970> guess<00:02:31.470> substitutes<00:02:32.470> there<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:33.010> block

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
of it I guess substitutes there to block

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.490 
of it I guess substitutes there to block
status<00:02:33.819> it's<00:02:34.150> there<00:02:34.329> to<00:02:34.569> sub<00:02:34.900> on

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500

you<00:02:35.709> know<00:02:35.829> something<00:02:36.370> may<00:02:36.519> be<00:02:36.870> stuck<00:02:37.870> in<00:02:38.019> on<00:02:38.139> on

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
you know something may be stuck in on on

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.979 
you know something may be stuck in on on
the<00:02:38.470> electric<00:02:38.799> attack<00:02:39.069> or<00:02:39.400> I<00:02:39.969> don't<00:02:40.900> know

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
the electric attack or I don't know

the electric attack or I don't know
something<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.560> can't<00:02:42.069> do<00:02:42.219> anything<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.639> you

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
something that can't do anything to you

something that can't do anything to you
I<00:02:42.790> don't<00:02:43.000> know<00:02:43.209> what<00:02:43.480> can't<00:02:43.900> hurt<00:02:44.260> this<00:02:44.470> thing

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
I don't know what can't hurt this thing

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.460 
I don't know what can't hurt this thing

pitaya berry you can you know
something's<00:02:57.819> in<00:02:57.939> and<00:02:58.150> it's<00:02:58.239> attacking<00:02:58.540> you

you<00:02:58.810> can<00:02:59.019> just<00:02:59.139> sub<00:02:59.409> down<00:02:59.620> so<00:02:59.799> you<00:02:59.889> get<00:02:59.980> your

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
you can just sub down so you get your

you can just sub down so you get your
Pattaya<00:03:00.340> berry<00:03:00.549> boost<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:00.939> then<00:03:01.000> maybe<00:03:01.329> do

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
Pattaya berry boost and then maybe do

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.960 
Pattaya berry boost and then maybe do

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
next move is charged beam now you can

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.199 
next move is charged beam now you can

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
tea bowl over charge beam I'm gonna be

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.939 
tea bowl over charge beam I'm gonna be
optimistic<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.900> say<00:03:13.989> that<00:03:14.379> the<00:03:14.500> dens<00:03:14.709> gonna

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:14.949 
optimistic and say that the dens gonna

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.909 
optimistic and say that the dens gonna
live<00:03:15.250> some<00:03:16.060> kind<00:03:16.090> of<00:03:16.359> hits<00:03:16.569> and<00:03:16.810> be<00:03:17.470> able<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:17.799> do

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:17.919 
live some kind of hits and be able to do

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:19.920 
live some kind of hits and be able to do
this<00:03:18.099> set<00:03:18.370> probably<00:03:19.329> needs<00:03:19.449> all<00:03:19.569> the<00:03:19.659> power<00:03:19.840> I

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
this set probably needs all the power I

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.390 
this set probably needs all the power I
can<00:03:20.169> get<00:03:20.319> though<00:03:20.530> so<00:03:20.799> you<00:03:20.889> probably<00:03:21.190> just<00:03:21.310> want

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
can get though so you probably just want

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.490 
can get though so you probably just want
to<00:03:21.549> run<00:03:21.669> Thunderbolt<00:03:22.269> here<00:03:22.540> or<00:03:22.720> over

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
to run Thunderbolt here or over

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.920 
to run Thunderbolt here or over
parabolic<00:03:24.040> charge<00:03:24.069> or<00:03:24.609> whatever<00:03:24.849> but<00:03:25.780> we're

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
parabolic charge or whatever but we're

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.689 
parabolic charge or whatever but we're
gonna<00:03:26.019> go<00:03:26.199> with<00:03:26.409> charge<00:03:26.739> beam<00:03:27.010> for<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.400> sake

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:27.699 
gonna go with charge beam for the sake

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.309 
gonna go with charge beam for the sake
of<00:03:27.729> whatever<00:03:28.389> and<00:03:28.750> we're<00:03:28.989> gonna<00:03:29.109> go<00:03:29.229> to

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
of whatever and we're gonna go to

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.550 
of whatever and we're gonna go to
parabolic<00:03:29.739> charge<00:03:29.769> because<00:03:30.549> it's<00:03:30.849> like

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
parabolic charge because it's like

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.009 
parabolic charge because it's like
varied<00:03:32.790> it's<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:33.849> very<00:03:34.030> uncommon<00:03:34.299> move<00:03:34.659> so<00:03:34.930> we

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
varied it's a very uncommon move so we

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.449 
varied it's a very uncommon move so we
might<00:03:35.199> as<00:03:35.260> well<00:03:35.319> try<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.739> build<00:03:36.010> something

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
might as well try to build something

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.110 
might as well try to build something
around<00:03:36.549> it<00:03:36.849> but<00:03:37.919> the<00:03:38.919> idea<00:03:39.069> is<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.699> sub<00:03:39.940> so<00:03:40.030> you

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
around it but the idea is to sub so you

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.309 
around it but the idea is to sub so you
don't<00:03:40.239> something<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:40.930> know<00:03:41.019> get<00:03:41.169> some

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
don't something you know get some

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.949 
don't something you know get some
initiative<00:03:41.970> charge<00:03:42.970> beam<00:03:43.269> if<00:03:43.540> they<00:03:43.720> can't

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
initiative charge beam if they can't

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.069 
initiative charge beam if they can't
break<00:03:44.169> yourself<00:03:44.650> if<00:03:44.799> they<00:03:44.949> can<00:03:45.250> then<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:46.959> know

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
break yourself if they can then you know

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:53.039 
break yourself if they can then you know
go<00:03:47.470> for<00:03:49.620> go<00:03:50.620> for<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:52.060> pitaya<00:03:52.359> berry<00:03:52.599> boosts

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
go for go for the pitaya berry boosts

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.140 
go for go for the pitaya berry boosts
and<00:03:53.139> hope<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.439> kill<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.829> in<00:03:53.919> which<00:03:54.280> case<00:03:54.519> yeah

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
and hope to kill it in which case yeah

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.789 
and hope to kill it in which case yeah
you<00:03:55.359> probably<00:03:55.599> just<00:03:55.720> want<00:03:55.870> thunderbolt<00:03:56.379> here

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
you probably just want thunderbolt here

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.879 
you probably just want thunderbolt here
yeah<00:03:57.010> obviously<00:03:57.540> but<00:03:58.540> it's<00:03:58.659> a<00:03:58.870> charge<00:03:59.470> beam<00:03:59.709> if

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
yeah obviously but it's a charge beam if

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:02.009 
yeah obviously but it's a charge beam if
they<00:04:00.010> don't<00:04:00.280> you<00:04:00.939> know<00:04:00.970> get<00:04:01.299> some<00:04:01.510> boosts<00:04:01.930> or

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
they don't you know get some boosts or

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.610 
they don't you know get some boosts or
whatever<00:04:03.150> hopefully<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:04.329> then<00:04:05.019> start

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
whatever hopefully and then start

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.379 
whatever hopefully and then start
whaling<00:04:05.949> away<00:04:06.040> with<00:04:06.400> Tebow<00:04:06.790> and<00:04:07.060> hidden<00:04:07.239> power

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:07.389 
whaling away with Tebow and hidden power

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:09.240 
whaling away with Tebow and hidden power
ice<00:04:07.479> which<00:04:07.870> is<00:04:08.019> pretty<00:04:08.319> good<00:04:08.530> coverage<00:04:08.949> I

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
ice which is pretty good coverage I

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.099 
ice which is pretty good coverage I
think<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.060> only<00:04:10.150> thing<00:04:10.209> that<00:04:10.329> resists<00:04:10.780> it<00:04:10.900> is

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
think the only thing that resists it is

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.270 
think the only thing that resists it is
Magneton<00:04:11.859> and<00:04:12.099> that<00:04:12.790> line<00:04:13.000> so<00:04:14.099> here<00:04:15.099> you

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
Magneton and that line so here you

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.770 
Magneton and that line so here you
probably<00:04:15.549> just<00:04:15.819> want<00:04:15.939> t-bolt<00:04:16.419> but<00:04:16.570> if<00:04:16.659> you're

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
probably just want t-bolt but if you're

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.629 
probably just want t-bolt but if you're
feeling<00:04:17.079> brave<00:04:17.259> like<00:04:17.650> I<00:04:17.769> said<00:04:18.099> you<00:04:18.340> can<00:04:18.489> run

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
feeling brave like I said you can run

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.969 
feeling brave like I said you can run
parabolic<00:04:19.209> charge<00:04:19.239> and<00:04:19.779> this<00:04:20.680> is<00:04:20.859> an

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
parabolic charge and this is an

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:21.960 
parabolic charge and this is an
interesting<00:04:21.430> move

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
interesting move

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.800 
interesting move

you're not completely useless in the

health department if you do happen to

sub down get the pitaya berry boost all
that<00:04:32.860> but<00:04:33.610> if<00:04:33.820> you're<00:04:33.970> thinking<00:04:34.270> too<00:04:34.390> dense

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
that but if you're thinking too dense

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.840 
that but if you're thinking too dense
just<00:04:34.810> gonna<00:04:34.960> die<00:04:35.440> anyway<00:04:35.470> you<00:04:36.250> probably<00:04:36.430> just

just gonna die anyway you probably just

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.910 
just gonna die anyway you probably just
want<00:04:37.120> to<00:04:37.150> run<00:04:37.300> thunderbolt<00:04:37.900> that's<00:04:38.440> totally

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
want to run thunderbolt that's totally

you<00:04:44.500> can't<00:04:44.710> run<00:04:44.830> t-bolt<00:04:45.190> over<00:04:45.400> it<00:04:45.520> as<00:04:45.640> well<00:04:45.850> but

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
you can't run t-bolt over it as well but

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.520 
you can't run t-bolt over it as well but

the dents a week

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.200 
the dents a week
it<00:04:47.620> needs<00:04:48.130> some<00:04:48.310> way<00:04:48.430> to<00:04:48.490> boost<00:04:48.760> something

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
it needs some way to boost something

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.590 
it needs some way to boost something
it's<00:04:49.900> a<00:04:49.960> charge<00:04:50.170> beam<00:04:50.410> um<00:04:51.570> parabolic<00:04:52.570> charge

if you're feeling saucy otherwise just

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.880 
if you're feeling saucy otherwise just
go<00:04:55.090> with<00:04:55.210> Tebow<00:04:55.540> honestly<00:04:56.230> t-bolts<00:04:56.650> probably

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
go with Tebow honestly t-bolts probably

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.160 
go with Tebow honestly t-bolts probably
a<00:04:56.950> better<00:04:57.100> option<00:04:57.370> I'm<00:04:57.610> gonna<00:04:57.760> switch<00:04:57.970> it<00:04:58.170> and

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
a better option I'm gonna switch it and

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.440 
a better option I'm gonna switch it and

maybe assault vest go alert would be
good

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
good

in<00:05:26.470> on<00:05:26.530> Lantern<00:05:26.980> like<00:05:27.130> maybe<00:05:27.340> a<00:05:27.430> grass<00:05:27.850> type

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
in on Lantern like maybe a grass type

in on Lantern like maybe a grass type
bulky<00:05:28.780> grass<00:05:29.020> type<00:05:29.320> will<00:05:29.470> be<00:05:29.500> good<00:05:29.710> too

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
bulky grass type will be good too

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.290 
bulky grass type will be good too
but<00:05:31.720> yes<00:05:31.990> that's<00:05:32.560> two<00:05:32.830> din<00:05:33.010> it's<00:05:33.340> pretty<00:05:33.820> awful

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
but yes that's two din it's pretty awful

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
don't know what Game Freak was thinking

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.590 
don't know what Game Freak was thinking
maybe<00:05:36.370> they<00:05:36.580> just<00:05:36.760> wanted<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.150> make<00:05:37.330> something

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
maybe they just wanted to make something

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.430 
maybe they just wanted to make something
cute<00:05:38.050> with<00:05:38.620> bad<00:05:38.830> stats<00:05:39.450> maybe<00:05:40.450> this<00:05:40.990> thing<00:05:41.200> was

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
cute with bad stats maybe this thing was

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.840 
cute with bad stats maybe this thing was
actually<00:05:41.620> pretty<00:05:42.010> good<00:05:42.100> maybe<00:05:42.370> I<00:05:42.490> had<00:05:42.640> like<00:05:42.820> a

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
actually pretty good maybe I had like a

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.030 
actually pretty good maybe I had like a
decent<00:05:43.180> Special<00:05:43.690> Attack<00:05:43.780> stat<00:05:44.020> and<00:05:44.530> then<00:05:44.800> like

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
decent Special Attack stat and then like

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.990 
decent Special Attack stat and then like
the<00:05:45.970> designer<00:05:46.360> to<00:05:46.570> this<00:05:46.890> ended<00:05:47.890> up<00:05:48.040> touching

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
the designer to this ended up touching
