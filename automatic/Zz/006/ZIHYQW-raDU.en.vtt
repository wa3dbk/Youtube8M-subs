00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
idiot I just stuffed a bunch of

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.340 
idiot I just stuffed a bunch of
fiberglass<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:08.149> body<00:02:08.509> filler<00:02:08.810> back<00:02:09.080> there

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
fiberglass and body filler back there

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.009 
fiberglass and body filler back there
and<00:02:09.590> uh<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:12.470> much<00:02:12.709> that<00:02:12.980> it<00:02:13.130> pressed<00:02:13.640> on<00:02:14.019> the

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
and uh so much that it pressed on the

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.050 
and uh so much that it pressed on the
backside<00:02:15.500> here<00:02:15.530> when<00:02:15.830> you<00:02:15.890> step<00:02:16.160> on<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.370> see

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
backside here when you step on it see

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.210 
backside here when you step on it see
that's<00:02:17.239> why<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.450> didn't<00:02:17.720> get<00:02:18.680> in<00:02:18.800> there<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.040> put

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
that's why I didn't get in there and put

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.800 
that's why I didn't get in there and put
mesh<00:02:19.430> behind<00:02:19.640> it<00:02:19.970> because<00:02:20.120> this<00:02:20.299> hole<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.630> so

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
mesh behind it because this hole is so

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.570 
mesh behind it because this hole is so
small<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.440> didn't<00:02:21.980> want<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.160> drill<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.489> out

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
small I didn't want to drill it out

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.630 
small I didn't want to drill it out
that's<00:02:22.880> what<00:02:22.970> I'm<00:02:23.060> going<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.209> do<00:02:23.360> this<00:02:23.540> time<00:02:24.640> so

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.870 
I just pushed it in there and that's how
that<00:02:27.650> came<00:02:27.860> out<00:02:28.010> that<00:02:28.190> sucks<00:02:28.489> but

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
in the front lowering really simple to

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.590 
in the front lowering really simple to
put<00:03:18.450> in<00:03:18.950> at<00:03:19.950> least<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.400> beams<00:03:21.090> there<00:03:21.390> are<00:03:21.570> I

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
put in at least the beams there are I

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.910 
put in at least the beams there are I
don't<00:03:21.900> know<00:03:21.990> if<00:03:22.110> you<00:03:22.170> can<00:03:22.320> see<00:03:22.500> those<00:03:22.680> either

but you go all the way across the back
you<00:03:28.410> basically<00:03:28.830> are<00:03:28.950> putting<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.550> uh<00:03:29.930> putting

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
you basically are putting the uh putting

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.520 
you basically are putting the uh putting
the<00:03:31.050> axle<00:03:31.560> on<00:03:31.800> top<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.550> the<00:03:32.870> leaf<00:03:33.870> springs<00:03:34.260> and

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
the axle on top of the leaf springs and

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.570 
the axle on top of the leaf springs and
it<00:03:34.890> comes<00:03:35.070> with<00:03:35.220> an<00:03:35.340> adapter<00:03:40.370> really<00:03:41.370> nice

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
it comes with an adapter really nice

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.150 
it comes with an adapter really nice
easy<00:03:41.910> setup<00:03:42.210> it's<00:03:42.840> like<00:03:42.960> four<00:03:43.440> in<00:03:43.530> a<00:03:43.590> box<00:03:43.830> -<00:03:44.130> I

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
easy setup it's like four in a box - I

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.860 
easy setup it's like four in a box - I
mean<00:03:44.460> it<00:03:44.520> wasn't<00:03:44.790> bad<00:03:46.400> for<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.460> motor<00:03:47.870> that's

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
mean it wasn't bad for the motor that's

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.970 
mean it wasn't bad for the motor that's
the<00:03:49.020> only<00:03:49.200> thing<00:03:49.350> I<00:03:49.410> haven't<00:03:49.560> done<00:03:49.680> his

the only thing I haven't done his

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:59.140 
the only thing I haven't done his
interior<00:03:50.370> but<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:53.600> 1984<00:03:56.510> here<00:03:57.510> 351<00:03:58.380> Windsor

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
interior but the 1984 here 351 Windsor

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.750 
interior but the 1984 here 351 Windsor
with<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.330> you<00:04:00.990> know<00:04:01.020> the<00:04:02.010> good<00:04:02.190> bottom<00:04:02.580> end

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
with the you know the good bottom end

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.620 
with the you know the good bottom end
and<00:04:03.000> unfortunately<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.790> Windsor<00:04:05.790> heads<00:04:06.030> -<00:04:06.360> I

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
and unfortunately the Windsor heads - I

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.510 
and unfortunately the Windsor heads - I
plan<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:06.960> get<00:04:07.200> Cleveland's<00:04:07.740> eventually<00:04:08.340> and

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
plan to get Cleveland's eventually and

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.370 
plan to get Cleveland's eventually and
make<00:04:08.670> one<00:04:08.850> of<00:04:08.940> them<00:04:09.060> cleaver<00:04:09.390> motors<00:04:09.870> but<00:04:10.140> I

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
make one of them cleaver motors but I

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.260 
make one of them cleaver motors but I
guess<00:04:11.190> you<00:04:11.310> got<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:11.580> drill<00:04:11.760> out<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.120> head

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
guess you got to drill out the head

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.900 
guess you got to drill out the head
bolts<00:04:12.600> -<00:04:12.750> or<00:04:12.990> head<00:04:13.320> bolt<00:04:13.530> holes<00:04:13.950> there<00:04:14.280> so<00:04:14.880> I

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
bolts - or head bolt holes there so I

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.140 
bolts - or head bolt holes there so I
haven't<00:04:15.210> committed<00:04:16.080> to<00:04:16.290> that<00:04:16.470> yet<00:04:16.790> but<00:04:17.790> these
