00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.880
 let's learn how to do this kind of 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.330
 wave that is a much more wave 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.250
 carefree and very disheveled we have 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.790
 made a small line in the part 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.340
 inferior and what we are going to do is all 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.830
 this line we are going to make the waves 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.310
 to that side the line above with the 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.420
 iron a little more waves 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.350
 [Music] 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.020
 with the hair I do not know 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.570
 since we always recommend this so that 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.130
 the hair does not spoil simply 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.770
 let's take a little hair 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.380
 we put the iron we turn it towards a 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.830
 side and that the tip of the hair always 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.800
 go down that is a little trick 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.150
 so that the unah is perfect for us 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.160
 we want you to have us a little bit more 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.780
 stretched the inclination of the iron 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.780
 it always has to be down 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.170
 the band is much more stretched 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.170
 what is it about 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.729
 the turn 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.299
 in this second line we are going to perform 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.219
 the same job but turning to the 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.319
 iron to the other side then 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:31.049
 let's take the lock and we're going to 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:33.420
 turn to the opposite side equally 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.640
 always with the ironed down and 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.450
 with the client's hair lock 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.450
 always down 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.890
 with 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.890
 inclination 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.470
 you see that the band is staying very much 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.130
 more open if we leave the 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.820
 iron with a vertical effect what 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.820
 we make a corkscrew 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.760
 look if you notice the part 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.220
 we have divided it in this way 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.160
 so that the hair falls 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.050
 direct and another of the tricks to 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.360
 do this type of waves is that the 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.630
 Tufts always take them in 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.000
 horizontal 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.000
 so that the much more undone 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.409
 as you see we are doing partitions with 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.000
 straight lines we have left the part 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.650
 superior to give you a little more 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.450
 volume 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.849
 at the root and always will 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.430
 We advise from play extension is that 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.620
 when you fuck the strands always 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.930
 you shoot vertically so that the wave 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.629
 be much more extended 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.510
 to give volume at the root where we're going 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:18.510
 to do is with the iron make a 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.730
 small turn in the upper area and 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.040
 always also what we advise you is 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.870
 that the iron did not apply a lot 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.510
 Ad pressure simply leave it 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.109
 slide because if we press hard we 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.500
 they make many cuts in the hair many 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.500
 brands 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.140
 Well, you are already seeing the result 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:43.360
 Now what are we going to do stretching 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.360
 a little bit the wicks 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.220
 so why 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.220
 the natural 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.860
 and as a final trick we're going to put on a 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.340
 little bit more 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.290
 we will always work on the hands 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.040
 we turn our heads up and what 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.040
 we do everything 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.019
 as you see the final result is a wave 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.560
 super casual 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.830
 that will run with all the 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.629
 trend that we have in this year 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.569
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:32.759
 that this serves to be able to comb the a 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.750
 from now on and let's leave all 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.750
 much more beautiful
