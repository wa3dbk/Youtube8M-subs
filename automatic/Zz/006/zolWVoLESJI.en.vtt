00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.010 

here<00:00:37.060> will<00:00:37.210> open<00:00:37.450> up<00:00:37.540> activity<00:00:38.320> monitor<00:00:38.890> and

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
here will open up activity monitor and

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.770 
here will open up activity monitor and
there's<00:00:41.020> our<00:00:41.200> 3<00:00:41.590> gigabytes<00:00:41.950> of<00:00:42.280> RAM<00:00:42.640> running

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.820 

and<00:00:47.250> here<00:00:48.250> is<00:00:48.430> our<00:00:48.640> two<00:00:49.150> cores<00:00:49.600> so<00:00:50.380> it<00:00:50.620> does

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
and here is our two cores so it does

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.590 
and here is our two cores so it does
show<00:00:51.040> you<00:00:51.100> that<00:00:51.400> we're<00:00:51.610> actually<00:00:51.820> running<00:00:52.300> off

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
show you that we're actually running off

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:01.010 
show you that we're actually running off

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.410 

now<00:01:01.620> I'm<00:01:01.740> going<00:01:01.950> to<00:01:02.070> kind<00:01:02.400> of<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.700> scroll

through our bar here and show this to

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
through our bar here and show this to
you<00:01:09.860> show<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.280> does<00:01:11.460> function

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
you show you that it does function

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.970 
you show you that it does function
exactly<00:01:12.210> how<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.570> Mac<00:01:13.200> now<00:01:13.440> this<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.830> not

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
the icons as you're going through one of

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:34.300 
the icons as you're going through one of
those<00:02:15.880> neat<00:02:16.150> features<00:02:16.660> of<00:02:17.640> mac<00:02:18.640> OS<00:02:18.880> x<00:02:19.270> leopard

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.620 

and<00:02:34.610> this<00:02:35.209> is<00:02:35.390> actually<00:02:35.599> very<00:02:37.180> new<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.360> me<00:02:38.390> I've
