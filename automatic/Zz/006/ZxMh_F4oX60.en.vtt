i'm<00:03:37.860> only<00:03:38.010> running<00:03:38.219> one<00:03:38.400> because<00:03:38.939> I<00:03:38.969> only

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
i'm only running one because I only

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.750 
i'm only running one because I only
pulled<00:03:39.480> one<00:03:39.750> yesterday<00:03:40.069> but<00:03:41.069> I<00:03:41.099> think<00:03:41.549> I'd

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
pulled one yesterday but I think I'd

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.300 
pulled one yesterday but I think I'd
probably<00:03:41.969> run<00:03:42.359> who<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.260> don't<00:03:43.590> know<00:03:43.680> maybe<00:03:43.890> two

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
probably run who I don't know maybe two

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.390 
probably run who I don't know maybe two
it's<00:03:44.939> a<00:03:45.060> balanced<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.739> balanced<00:03:46.739> version<00:03:47.189> of

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
it's a balanced a balanced version of

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.149 
it's a balanced a balanced version of
gateway<00:03:47.879> so<00:03:48.629> of<00:03:49.409> course<00:03:49.650> it's<00:03:49.890> not<00:03:49.950> this

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
gateway so of course it's not this

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.349 
gateway so of course it's not this
overpowered<00:03:51.530> so<00:03:52.530> I<00:03:52.980> think<00:03:53.129> only<00:03:53.459> two<00:03:53.760> for<00:03:54.239> my

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
overpowered so I think only two for my

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.690 
overpowered so I think only two for my
deck<00:03:54.599> anyway<00:03:54.959> maybe<00:03:55.590> red<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.069> blue<00:03:56.189> samurais
