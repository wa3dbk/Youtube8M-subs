00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.289 
plugs so I'll see for the UK we've got
the<00:01:59.460> standard<00:02:00.090> three-pin<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.590> u.s.

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
the standard three-pin and it's the u.s.

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.420 
the standard three-pin and it's the u.s.
USB<00:02:03.299> style<00:02:04.290> one<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.799> works<00:02:04.979> in

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
USB style one so that works in

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.639 
USB style one so that works in
conjunction<00:02:05.460> with<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:07.290> sync<00:02:07.500> charge

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
cable and that's it

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.999 
cable and that's it
so<00:02:09.690> let's<00:02:09.959> have<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.110> very<00:02:10.349> quick<00:02:10.470> look<00:02:10.560> just

so let's have a very quick look just
around<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.370> device<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.270> the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
around of the device that the the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.009 
around of the device that the the
actual<00:02:13.390> hardware<00:02:15.030> starting<00:02:16.030> on<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.180> back<00:02:16.360> all

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
actual hardware starting on the back all

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.690 
actual hardware starting on the back all
we've<00:02:17.260> got<00:02:17.440> these<00:02:17.620> we've<00:02:18.159> got<00:02:18.310> our<00:02:18.370> five

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
we've got these we've got our five

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.910 
we've got these we've got our five
megapixel<00:02:19.239> camera<00:02:19.269> lens<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:20.019> the<00:02:20.379> flash<00:02:20.620> and

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
megapixel camera lens and the flash and

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.110 
megapixel camera lens and the flash and
then<00:02:21.099> our<00:02:21.220> nicer<00:02:21.700> blackberry<00:02:22.599> logo<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.940> won't

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
then our nicer blackberry logo you won't

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.160 
then our nicer blackberry logo you won't
get<00:02:25.239> this<00:02:25.330> sticker<00:02:25.599> on<00:02:25.780> yours<00:02:25.959> of<00:02:26.049> those

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
get this sticker on yours of those

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.780 
get this sticker on yours of those
things<00:02:26.379> you<00:02:26.620> probably<00:02:27.159> just<00:02:27.310> because<00:02:27.549> it's<00:02:27.700> a

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
things you probably just because it's a

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.970 
things you probably just because it's a
review<00:02:28.120> unit<00:02:28.440> over<00:02:29.440> on<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.590> left-hand<00:02:29.829> side

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
review unit over on the left-hand side

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.110 
review unit over on the left-hand side
we've<00:02:30.400> got<00:02:30.610> our<00:02:31.049> our<00:02:32.250> charging<00:02:33.250> port<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.700> then

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
we've got our our charging port and then

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.759 
we've got our our charging port and then
something<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:34.959> little<00:02:35.140> bit<00:02:35.230> different<00:02:35.620> with

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
something a little bit different with

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:36.960 
something a little bit different with
the<00:02:35.860> door<00:02:36.159> that<00:02:36.310> opens<00:02:36.579> here

all power power button and as you can
see<00:03:13.209> I<00:03:13.569> couldn't<00:03:14.109> resist<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.409> play<00:03:14.560> this<00:03:14.739> one

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
see I couldn't resist to play this one

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.319 
see I couldn't resist to play this one
so<00:03:15.129> it's<00:03:15.250> already<00:03:15.400> set<00:03:15.640> up<00:03:15.670> but<00:03:15.940> we're<00:03:16.030> not<00:03:16.150> I'm

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
so it's already set up but we're not I'm

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.520 
so it's already set up but we're not I'm
not<00:03:16.390> going<00:03:16.599> to<00:03:16.659> focus<00:03:16.750> on<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.139> actual

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
not going to focus on the actual

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.839 
not going to focus on the actual
software<00:03:17.799> because<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.370> software<00:03:18.639> is

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
software because the software is

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.270 
software because the software is
identical<00:03:19.419> to<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:19.569> sword<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.190> all<00:03:21.190> the

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
identical to that sword and all the

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.680 
identical to that sword and all the
other<00:03:21.400> black<00:03:21.639> boots<00:03:21.819> and<00:03:21.880> smartphones<00:03:22.389> but

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
other black boots and smartphones but

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.360 
other black boots and smartphones but
with<00:03:23.470> this<00:03:23.590> one<00:03:23.739> it's<00:03:23.889> really<00:03:23.950> about<00:03:24.250> the

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
with this one it's really about the

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.879 
with this one it's really about the
keyboard<00:03:24.760> you<00:03:25.690> know<00:03:25.780> it's<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:26.019> it's<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.769> nice

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
keyboard you know it's a it's a nice

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.759 
keyboard you know it's a it's a nice
feeling<00:03:27.160> device<00:03:27.569> this<00:03:28.569> isn't<00:03:28.870> by<00:03:29.230> any<00:03:29.260> means<00:03:29.620> a

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
feeling device this isn't by any means a

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.819 
feeling device this isn't by any means a
review<00:03:30.069> it's<00:03:30.250> purely<00:03:30.459> an<00:03:30.879> unboxing<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:32.620> keys

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
review it's purely an unboxing the keys

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.680 
review it's purely an unboxing the keys
are<00:03:33.069> significantly<00:03:33.700> significantly

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
are significantly significantly

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.900 
are significantly significantly
different<00:03:35.169> to<00:03:35.230> that<00:03:35.620> on<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:35.950> air<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.310> q10<00:03:36.730> is

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
you can hopefully see there it's just if

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.559 
you can hopefully see there it's just if
we<00:03:40.239> can<00:03:40.389> zoom<00:03:40.540> in<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:40.750> little<00:03:40.870> bit<00:03:41.169> for<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:42.090> so<00:03:43.090> I

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
we can zoom in a little bit for you so I

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.339 
we can zoom in a little bit for you so I

the<00:03:47.470> keyboard<00:03:48.069> on<00:03:48.190> this<00:03:48.310> it<00:03:48.910> feels<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.299> little

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
the keyboard on this it feels a little

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.539 
the keyboard on this it feels a little
bit<00:03:49.989> more<00:03:50.079> tactile<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.829> little<00:03:51.099> bit<00:03:51.250> more<00:03:51.400> like

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
bit more tactile a little bit more like

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.930 
bit more tactile a little bit more like
the<00:03:52.120> curve<00:03:52.829> whereas<00:03:53.829> obviously<00:03:54.099> on<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.340> q10

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
the curve whereas obviously on the q10

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.150 
the curve whereas obviously on the q10
they're<00:03:55.299> a<00:03:55.329> little<00:03:55.690> bit<00:03:55.840> softer<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.500> well

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
they're a little bit softer and well

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.509 
they're a little bit softer and well
bulb<00:03:57.370> like<00:03:57.579> and<00:03:59.129> obviously<00:04:00.129> we've<00:04:00.310> got<00:04:00.430> our

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
bulb like and obviously we've got our
