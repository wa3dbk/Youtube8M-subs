00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 hi my friends my compatriots my 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.880
 subscribers but not hot complained 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.550
 for a first video on fifa 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.679
 quiet then yes I did a 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.540
 change before I was absolutely that 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.160
 on the call of 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.039
 I was fed up with it drunk me modern 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:25.109
 warfare 3 blackhawks 1 w 2 and I got 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.820
 said why not do a little fifa and 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.220
 it's true I was a big fan 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.359
 of fifa also I do not have I love you 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.420
 adou I found that there was 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.040
 a lot of change compared to fifa 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.809
 11 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.760
 so to finish I have not bought I am 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.730
 said we're going we're still going thrown 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.180
 fifa 13 games prices --one big 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.770
 astonishment 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.149
 damn it must be a darker and 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.219
 this is to my astonishment I found 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.210
 this exceptional game yes there have been some 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.489
 bugs setara online ladies in career 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.600
 but you have to know 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.030
 I think they really are their 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.859
 the better the quality was going very well the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.760
 game techniques they are are not 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.610
 badly their pittance and then so that's it 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.640
 so I put something on jeuxvideo.com 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.200
 saying talk to the worst for young people 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.720
 for those interested 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.820
 if he wanted to do if you want that 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.770
 I make some videos of tricks like 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:26.240
 roulette shooting from far and the field 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.350
 the scorpion kick the bournat shot all this 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.950
 and I saw that there were a lot of people 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.320
 interested 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.320
 I said yes why not do it 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.740
 and I do them and I did everything 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.939
 program that will unfortunately I 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.579
 know there are a lot who were 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.930
 can not wait for me to do the tic scorpion 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.390
 but I had to postpone it eventually 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.380
 because I have the requests then so we have 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.690
 immediately shown 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.710
 because yes someone asked me to 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.100
 show him the missing places 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.680
 so that's very simple we're here on 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.250
 supports an area of l2 who did and 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.670
 fire make good morning left 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.709
 right 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.280
 it gives us a kind of 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:15.700
 very interesting legs I showed them 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.160
 do not forget l2 left right left at 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.290
 choice and that makes us something 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.260
 like this I think that's what 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.530
 asked us who knows someone 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.400
 thing 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:32.770
 so like that and that's up to you 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:35.739
 left is 180 degrees and you 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.420
 happens by the right by the water in si 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.520
 you understand it's left 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.950
 and then you go to the right but 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.140
 by our and that makes you the passements 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.330
 of legs both kinds of fits 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.100
 of legs that I showed you first 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.410
 12 do not know exactly not what 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.380
 moment when this one but it's still 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.010
 something not bad and the second 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.350
 it is necessarily the placement request 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.989
 like that which is up and down 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.390
 in the meantime I think that you have a 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.560
 little helped all the players 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.760
 have to do it 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.600
 even the guardian can do that and fucking 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.230
 I do not care a bit 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:18.700
 we do anything to have there finally 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.220
 for the sombrero I will explain it to you 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.590
 very rare very quickly it will be 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.860
 definitely hit this ground tomorrow at 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.860
 meet again
