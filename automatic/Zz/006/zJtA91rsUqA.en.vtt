00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
glass and pour it in and to figure out

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.409 
glass and pour it in and to figure out
the<00:04:29.770> calories<00:04:30.280> of<00:04:30.310> this<00:04:30.669> all<00:04:30.940> you<00:04:31.090> really

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
the calories of this all you really

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.790 
the calories of this all you really
would<00:04:31.570> have<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.900> do<00:04:32.050> is<00:04:32.199> figure<00:04:32.410> out<00:04:32.560> the

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
would have to do is figure out the

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.730 
would have to do is figure out the
calories<00:04:33.310> of<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.669> Apple<00:04:34.150> you<00:04:34.330> put<00:04:34.960> in<00:04:35.110> the

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
couple of blueberries and the your

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.200 
couple of blueberries and the your
yogurt<00:04:40.960> that<00:04:41.199> you<00:04:41.320> use<00:04:41.650> I<00:04:41.949> use<00:04:42.280> about<00:04:42.880> it's

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
yogurt that you use I use about it's

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.480 
yogurt that you use I use about it's
about<00:04:43.360> six<00:04:43.750> ounces<00:04:43.930> of<00:04:44.289> yogurt<00:04:44.740> so<00:04:45.100> I<00:04:45.130> can

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
about six ounces of yogurt so I can

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.810 
about six ounces of yogurt so I can
figure<00:04:45.669> it<00:04:45.910> out<00:04:46.000> that<00:04:46.270> way<00:04:46.510> and<00:04:47.490> yeah<00:04:48.490> it's

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
figure it out that way and yeah it's

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.330 
figure it out that way and yeah it's
virtually<00:04:49.600> this<00:04:49.750> is<00:04:49.960> much<00:04:50.169> lower<00:04:50.410> in<00:04:50.710> calories

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
virtually this is much lower in calories

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.490 
virtually this is much lower in calories
maybe<00:04:52.000> a<00:04:52.090> little<00:04:52.180> higher<00:04:52.510> sugar<00:04:52.870> but<00:04:53.229> the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
maybe a little higher sugar but the

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.990 
maybe a little higher sugar but the
sugars<00:04:53.889> that<00:04:54.070> were<00:04:54.160> using<00:04:54.370> come<00:04:54.699> from<00:04:54.880> an

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
sugars that were using come from an

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.290 
sugars that were using come from an
apple<00:04:55.479> and<00:04:55.690> blueberries<00:04:56.789> the<00:04:57.789> texture<00:04:58.270> of

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
apple and blueberries the texture of

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.120 
apple and blueberries the texture of
