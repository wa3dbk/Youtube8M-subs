00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.099
 I want to show application technology 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.499
 helium to marker is not which you can 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.379
 use your work for both 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:18.230
 building and strengthening nails 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.830
 and so before the procedure is necessary 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.960
 carefully prepare the nail plate 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.960
 move cuticle clean pateriki 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.210
 using a grinder for natural 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.270
 nails 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.270
 remove shine on co. 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.920
 then with a special drug 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.330
 intended for degreasing 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.940
 nail and remove stickiness handle all 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.680
 on to the point 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:05.030
 also very carefully walk in 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:11.240
 side rollers at the cuticle and using 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.240
 first base layer of the gel tunnel 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.700
 Gelin brush first 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.410
 very melted napkin 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:26.030
 hairs brush it thin 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.030
 layer on the nail 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.950
 be careful of the lateral cuticle 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:49.970
 rollers and be sure to seal the butt 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:52.730
 nail I will put now the base layer 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.800
 only two nails on a pointer to and 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.250
 moodless on name I'll show you 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.020
 using single phase gel 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.650
 after that, draw a basic one 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.240
 layer and apply color gel which you 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.869
 can also use for 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.200
 nail extension 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.510
 gel density is high enough 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.920
 length is very easy to model 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.190
 today I will show you 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.380
 exactly strengthen the nail plate for 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.570
 which we will not use 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.720
 large amount of material it will be 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.330
 flat enough 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:35.209
 I'll put a nail in the beginning 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:38.209
 the first layer is not so thick enough 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:42.860
 finely spread it on the nail 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:45.290
 using the same gel brush for 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.760
 polimerizuyu in the ultraviolet lamp and 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:54.709
 overlap for color density second 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:58.630
 a layer of gel will get more dense 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:02.420
 taller than gel polish 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:08.080
 drawing them on the second almost show you 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.080
 applying the gel without nacre 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:22.700
 also very viscous consistency also 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.700
 I spread the first layer thin enough 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.180
 and after polymerization by the second layer 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.730
 sell color density 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.440
 already adding a small amount to 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.110
 nail surface 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:51.960
 top must be overlapped 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:54.090
 the final top cover which is not 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.950
 has stickiness since this is on 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.720
 three phase system required 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.720
 use top cover 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.830
 polymerize quickly purple vale here 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.360
 we have no stickiness after polymerization and 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.190
 at the end as usual we finish 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.190
 application procedure waved 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:28.090
 and also wanted to show you one 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.090
 using a single phase gel is difficult 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:35.300
 also quite dense consistency 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.020
 forget to glue the hairs brush it 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:42.320
 napkin recruit a small amount 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.610
 gel on the brush and distribute 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.610
 nail surface 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.889
 after applying the material you also 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:05:00.050
 can be applied from above as usual 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.050
 lacquer and gel polish 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:20.369
 polymerize the ultraviolet lamp and 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.369
 remove stickiness 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.530
 and finish by applying 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.699
 before removing the gel must be processed 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:41.210
 surface coverage is also a drug 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:45.099
 for degreasing nails with 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.870
 files 150 180 units 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:52.009
 Begin to carefully cut the material 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:53.840
 the main volume and then using 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:57.620
 soft grinder for natural 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:02.270
 nails remove the remnants of materials with 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:04.490
 rolled bad because the amount of material 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.550
 small he sawed enough 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:11.210
 quickly and easily and at the end necessarily 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:16.400
 apply the mask on the skin around the nail and 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:18.289
 nail plate filter questions 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.569
 please leave under the video and 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:22.780
 Thank you very much for your attention and to the new ones 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:22.780
 meeting
