00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:04.280
The sound of you crying creeps through

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:18.140
This shut door – Rejection.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:31.420
Why must you hate me so?

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:40.620
If you’re lost, come to me for help!

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:49.920
Are you afraid I’ll reject you?

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.640
I press the broken door chime again and again, screaming,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.300
My bursting pleas trailing off emptily.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.220
A sharp loneliness pains my heart

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.280
Ringing, though the door bell will not.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:01.340
Across the wall I feel your body heat, and

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:15.600
I think I feel your heart start to race.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.200
With our backs together like this, just barely making contact,

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.560
I ask you again and again,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.840
But the gears won’t lock together,

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.420
Silent and still.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.940
I’ve seen that wound you’ve hidden in bandages, and

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.940
When I watch you walk along that twisted rail,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.480
I am afraid – of the end…

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:16.520
I can feel it, even now.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:23.460
I press the broken door chime again and again, screaming,

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:30.300
My bursting pleas trailing off emptily.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:37.220
The door to the roof gently closes

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:44.040
A text message that will not be read, shines in the dark.
