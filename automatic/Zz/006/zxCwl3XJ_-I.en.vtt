at<00:00:11.339> the<00:00:11.490> intel<00:00:11.759> corporation<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.809> it's<00:00:12.959> my<00:00:13.200> job

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
at the intel corporation and it's my job

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.279 
at the intel corporation and it's my job
to<00:00:13.919> come<00:00:14.129> up<00:00:14.249> with<00:00:14.280> an<00:00:14.999> actionable<00:00:15.570> vision<00:00:16.080> for

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
to come up with an actionable vision for

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.710 
to come up with an actionable vision for
computing<00:00:16.830> in<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.100> year<00:00:17.400> 2020<00:00:18.240> now<00:00:18.570> that

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
computing in the year 2020 now that

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.820 
computing in the year 2020 now that
might<00:00:18.810> sound<00:00:18.990> like<00:00:19.170> science<00:00:19.349> fiction<00:00:19.529> but

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
might sound like science fiction but

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.710 
might sound like science fiction but
actually<00:00:20.220> working<00:00:20.519> at<00:00:20.609> Intel<00:00:20.939> it's<00:00:21.300> very<00:00:21.509> very

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
actually working at Intel it's very very

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.720 
actually working at Intel it's very very
pragmatic<00:00:22.289> which<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.619> for<00:00:22.769> us<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.099> design<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
pragmatic which is for us to design the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.179 
pragmatic which is for us to design the
chips<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.810> platforms<00:00:25.439> inside<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:26.070> your

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
chips and the platforms inside of your

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.270 
chips and the platforms inside of your
TV<00:00:26.429> you're<00:00:26.849> smart

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.280 
TV you're smart

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.880 
TV you're smart
your<00:00:27.490> PC<00:00:27.850> takes<00:00:28.330> about<00:00:28.480> five<00:00:28.690> potatoes<00:00:29.260> so

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
your PC takes about five potatoes so

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.430 
your PC takes about five potatoes so
we're<00:00:30.220> working<00:00:30.430> right<00:00:30.910> now<00:00:31.050> looking<00:00:32.050> five<00:00:32.320> to

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:32.440 
we're working right now looking five to

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.870 
we're working right now looking five to
ten<00:00:32.619> years<00:00:32.650> with<00:00:33.010> each<00:00:33.190> other<00:00:33.430> so<00:00:33.670> the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
ten years with each other so the

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.730 
ten years with each other so the
engineers<00:00:34.180> come<00:00:34.450> to<00:00:34.630> me<00:00:34.780> to<00:00:34.990> get<00:00:35.140> a<00:00:35.170> vision<00:00:35.650> of

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:35.740 
engineers come to me to get a vision of

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.950 
engineers come to me to get a vision of
what<00:00:36.280> not<00:00:36.520> only<00:00:36.700> will<00:00:37.000> computing<00:00:37.570> look<00:00:37.720> like

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
what not only will computing look like

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.960 
what not only will computing look like
but<00:00:38.620> will<00:00:38.950> the<00:00:39.040> world<00:00:39.220> look<00:00:39.490> like<00:00:39.700> and<00:00:39.880> what

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
but will the world look like and what

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.760 
but will the world look like and what
people<00:00:40.210> want<00:00:40.570> to<00:00:40.660> do<00:00:40.810> with<00:00:41.020> computers<00:00:41.260> in<00:00:41.680> the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
people want to do with computers in the

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.890 
people want to do with computers in the
year<00:00:41.950> 2012

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.360 

so<00:00:46.900> when<00:00:47.080> I<00:00:47.110> look<00:00:47.260> out<00:00:47.380> to<00:00:47.560> the<00:00:47.650> future<00:00:48.010> of<00:00:48.130> TV

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
so when I look out to the future of TV

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.760 
so when I look out to the future of TV
what<00:00:49.330> it<00:00:49.450> really<00:00:49.480> see<00:00:49.870> is<00:00:49.930> what<00:00:50.080> the<00:00:50.170> future<00:00:50.440> TV

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
what it really see is what the future TV

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.430 
what it really see is what the future TV
is<00:00:50.860> all<00:00:51.010> about<00:00:51.250> screen<00:00:51.870> TV<00:00:52.870> used<00:00:53.080> to<00:00:53.170> be<00:00:53.290> about

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
is all about screen TV used to be about

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.110 
is all about screen TV used to be about
the<00:00:53.560> TV<00:00:53.800> that<00:00:53.920> hangs<00:00:54.130> on<00:00:54.340> your<00:00:54.370> wall<00:00:54.730> and

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
the TV that hangs on your wall and

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.640 
the TV that hangs on your wall and
that's<00:00:55.420> beginning<00:00:55.810> to<00:00:55.840> change<00:00:56.140> it's<00:00:56.500> being

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
that's beginning to change it's being

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.380 
that's beginning to change it's being
brought<00:00:56.890> about<00:00:57.040> by<00:00:57.460> some<00:00:57.940> of<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.090> things<00:00:58.300> that

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
brought about by some of the things that

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.730 
brought about by some of the things that
Intel's<00:00:58.750> different<00:00:59.140> but<00:00:59.230> it's<00:00:59.350> also<00:00:59.470> being

00:00:59.730 --> 00:00:59.740 
Intel's different but it's also being

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.070 
Intel's different but it's also being
brought<00:00:59.980> about<00:01:00.100> by<00:01:00.450> connectivity<00:01:01.450> by

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
brought about by connectivity by

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.960 
brought about by connectivity by
software<00:01:02.560> and<00:01:02.830> by<00:01:02.950> what<00:01:03.130> consumers<00:01:03.610> are<00:01:03.700> doing

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
software and by what consumers are doing

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.120 
software and by what consumers are doing
and<00:01:04.420> once<00:01:04.570> 30<00:01:04.750> that<00:01:04.930> happen<00:01:05.230> is<00:01:05.350> that<00:01:05.500> TVs

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
and once 30 that happen is that TVs

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.710 
and once 30 that happen is that TVs
really<00:01:06.400> come<00:01:06.610> off<00:01:06.760> the<00:01:06.970> wall<00:01:07.150> and<00:01:07.450> it's<00:01:07.660> gone

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
really come off the wall and it's gone

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.690 
really come off the wall and it's gone
into<00:01:08.350> our<00:01:08.470> smartphone<00:01:08.980> it's<00:01:09.310> not

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
into our smartphone it's not

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.190 
into our smartphone it's not
basically<00:01:11.700> going<00:01:11.850> everywhere<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.050> when<00:01:13.170> I

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
basically going everywhere and so when I

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.470 
basically going everywhere and so when I
think<00:01:13.440> about<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.770> future<00:01:13.920> TV<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.880> how<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.060> see

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 
think about the future TV and how I see

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.240 
think about the future TV and how I see
it<00:01:15.510> is<00:01:15.660> it's<00:01:15.810> really<00:01:15.870> all<00:01:16.230> just<00:01:16.260> about<00:01:16.680> screens

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
it is it's really all just about screens

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.550 
it is it's really all just about screens
and<00:01:17.940> it's<00:01:18.150> about<00:01:18.420> maybe<00:01:18.810> that's<00:01:19.080> flat<00:01:19.290> screen

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and it's about maybe that's flat screen

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.630 
and it's about maybe that's flat screen
on<00:01:19.650> your<00:01:19.680> wall<00:01:19.980> the<00:01:20.250> screen<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.610> your

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
on your wall the screen on your

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.860 
on your wall the screen on your
smartphone<00:01:21.060> screen<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:21.840> you

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
smartphone screen on you

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.140 
smartphone screen on you
so<00:01:23.110> it's<00:01:23.230> not<00:01:23.410> about<00:01:23.590> one<00:01:24.160> device<00:01:24.550> to<00:01:24.850> rule

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
so it's not about one device to rule

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.140 
so it's not about one device to rule
them<00:01:25.390> all<00:01:25.570> it's<00:01:26.170> about<00:01:26.410> whatever<00:01:27.160> screen<00:01:27.730> not

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
them all it's about whatever screen not

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.030 
them all it's about whatever screen not
handy<00:01:28.630> and<00:01:29.020> whatever<00:01:29.290> screen<00:01:29.620> you<00:01:29.800> want<00:01:29.950> to

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
handy and whatever screen you want to

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.310 
handy and whatever screen you want to
carry<00:01:30.220> with<00:01:30.520> you<00:01:30.730> or<00:01:31.030> how<00:01:31.750> you<00:01:31.810> can<00:01:32.080> move<00:01:32.260> your

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
carry with you or how you can move your

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.020 
carry with you or how you can move your
entertainment<00:01:33.160> experience<00:01:33.730> with<00:01:33.850> you

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
entertainment experience with you

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.060 
entertainment experience with you
throughout<00:01:34.600> your<00:01:34.720> gay<00:01:35.110> it's<00:01:35.470> whatever<00:01:35.770> screen

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
throughout your gay it's whatever screen

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.610 
throughout your gay it's whatever screen

so<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.260> walked<00:01:46.590> for<00:01:47.010> at<00:01:47.220> CES<00:01:47.760> in<00:01:48.080> 2011<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.590> thing

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
so I walked for at CES in 2011 the thing

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.080 
so I walked for at CES in 2011 the thing
that<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.010> see<00:01:50.190> that<00:01:50.220> really<00:01:50.670> really

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
that I see that really really

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.690 
that I see that really really
interesting<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.750> me<00:01:51.870> is<00:01:51.900> I<00:01:52.080> think<00:01:52.700> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
interesting to me is I think the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.530 
interesting to me is I think the
connected<00:01:54.180> TV<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:55.320> Smart<00:01:56.220> TV<00:01:56.640> has<00:01:57.240> really

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
connected TV the Smart TV has really

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.600

come<00:01:57.690> of<00:01:57.840> age<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.290> think<00:01:58.800> we<00:01:58.860> were<00:01:58.979> at<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> really

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
come of age I think we were at a really

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.340 
come of age I think we were at a really
interesting<00:01:59.940> point<00:02:00.420> because<00:02:00.570> for<00:02:00.960> years<00:02:01.110> and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
interesting point because for years and

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.870 
interesting point because for years and
years<00:02:01.410> and<00:02:01.590> years<00:02:01.890> i'm<00:02:02.010> an<00:02:02.130> old<00:02:02.220> TV<00:02:02.460> i<00:02:02.580> have

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
years and years i'm an old TV i have

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.060 
years and years i'm an old TV i have
been<00:02:03.000> doing<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.270> but

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
been doing it but

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.070 
been doing it but
we've<00:02:04.640> had<00:02:04.850> hardware<00:02:05.420> problems<00:02:05.900> we've<00:02:06.050> had

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
we've had hardware problems we've had

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.899 
we've had hardware problems we've had
software<00:02:06.740> problems<00:02:07.159> and<00:02:07.280> connectivity

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
software problems and connectivity

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.600 
software problems and connectivity
problems<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:08.899> i<00:02:08.990> think<00:02:09.200> this<00:02:09.350> year<00:02:09.410> 2011<00:02:10.280> when

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
problems and i think this year 2011 when

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.970 
problems and i think this year 2011 when
i<00:02:10.700> see<00:02:10.970> on<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.240> floor<00:02:11.510> is<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:12.200> this<00:02:12.650> my

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
i see on the floor is that this my
