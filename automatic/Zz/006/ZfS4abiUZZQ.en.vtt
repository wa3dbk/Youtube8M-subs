00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
you can pick herbs while you're mounted

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.450 
you can pick herbs while you're mounted
which<00:00:54.930> actually<00:00:55.379> means<00:00:55.800> if<00:00:55.980> you're<00:00:56.100> trying<00:00:56.280> to

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
which actually means if you're trying to

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.099 
which actually means if you're trying to
farm<00:00:56.699> gold<00:00:56.760> with<00:00:57.120> herbs<00:00:57.360> by<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.539> way<00:00:57.690> farming

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
farm gold with herbs by the way farming

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.450 
farm gold with herbs by the way farming
goal<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.469> that's<00:00:58.680> very<00:00:58.920> inefficient<00:00:59.370> way<00:00:59.430> of

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
goal like that's very inefficient way of

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.939 
goal like that's very inefficient way of
making<00:00:59.820> money<00:00:59.940> but<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.870> are<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.859> be

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
making money but if you are you can be

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.410 
making money but if you are you can be
that<00:01:01.980> little<00:01:02.190> bit<00:01:02.460> faster<00:01:02.850> because<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.300> have

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
that little bit faster because you have

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.329 
that little bit faster because you have
the<00:01:03.570> mountain<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.229> overall<00:01:04.650> very<00:01:04.920> awesome

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the mountain so overall very awesome

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.100 
the mountain so overall very awesome
maybe<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.119> kind<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.540> sad<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:06.780> don't<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
maybe it kind of sad we don't have the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.140 
maybe it kind of sad we don't have the
sky<00:01:07.290> club<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:07.770> i<00:01:07.799> think<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> sky<00:01:08.490> Golan<00:01:08.850> does

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
sky club but i think the sky Golan does

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.020 
sky club but i think the sky Golan does
look<00:01:09.390> far<00:01:09.810> far<00:01:10.350> cooler<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> next<00:01:11.520> thing<00:01:11.760> we

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
said that apparently every day they wish

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.050 
said that apparently every day they wish
they<00:01:34.409> could<00:01:34.439> redo<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.040> class<00:01:35.250> system<00:01:35.490> they

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
they could redo the class system they

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.969 
they could redo the class system they
spent<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.390> lot<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.540> time<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.110> effort<00:01:37.409> dealing

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
spent a lot of time and effort dealing

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.980 
spent a lot of time and effort dealing
with<00:01:38.070> player<00:01:38.280> expectations<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.450> precedence

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
with player expectations and precedence

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.109 
with player expectations and precedence
and<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.860> sounds<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.220> really<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
and it sounds like really it's to the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.999 
and it sounds like really it's to the
detriment<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.750> their<00:01:43.079> vision<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> game

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
detriment of their vision of the game

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.590 
detriment of their vision of the game
but<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.460> player<00:01:44.670> reaction<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.270> any<00:01:45.390> major

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
but the player reaction to any major

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.389 
but the player reaction to any major
changes<00:01:45.840> would<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.200> too<00:01:46.320> big<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.220> suppose

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
changes would be too big and I suppose

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.399 
changes would be too big and I suppose
this<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.700> really<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.090> problem<00:01:48.540> that's<00:01:48.899> inherent

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
this is really a problem that's inherent

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.160 
this is really a problem that's inherent
to<00:01:49.560> such<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.250> ghost<00:01:50.909> along<00:01:51.299> spamming<00:01:51.930> game

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
to such a ghost along spamming game

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.899 
to such a ghost along spamming game
people<00:01:52.890> been<00:01:52.979> planning<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:53.729> long

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
people been planning this for so long

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.670 
people been planning this for so long
and<00:01:54.180> there's<00:01:54.329> one<00:01:54.509> thing<00:01:54.659> people<00:01:55.049> do<00:01:55.259> not<00:01:55.439> like

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
and there's one thing people do not like

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.530 
and there's one thing people do not like
change<00:01:56.040> we<00:01:56.490> see<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:56.759> every<00:01:57.000> time<00:01:57.149> YouTube

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
change we see this every time YouTube

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.080 
change we see this every time YouTube
does<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> new<00:01:57.990> layout<00:01:58.320> friggin<00:01:58.799> rage<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.790> stuff

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
does a new layout friggin rage and stuff

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.440 
does a new layout friggin rage and stuff
everywhere<00:02:00.630> um<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:02.100> yeah<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:03.030> it's

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
everywhere um so yeah it's it's

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.080 
everywhere um so yeah it's it's
definitely<00:02:03.840> hard<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.110> for<00:02:04.320> game<00:02:04.530> design<00:02:04.829> I

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
definitely hard in for game design I

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.950 
definitely hard in for game design I
suppose<00:02:06.090> that's<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.270> problem<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.719> most

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
suppose that's a problem that most

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.749 
suppose that's a problem that most
really<00:02:07.469> when<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.710> make<00:02:07.890> your<00:02:07.920> MMO<00:02:08.520> at<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
really when you make your MMO at the

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.999 
really when you make your MMO at the
start<00:02:09.060> there's<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.780> lot<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:09.989> core<00:02:10.349> things<00:02:10.679> that

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
start there's a lot of core things that

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.740 
start there's a lot of core things that
will<00:02:11.400> probably<00:02:11.910> have<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.180> continue<00:02:12.540> for<00:02:12.660> a

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
will probably have to continue for a

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.270 
will probably have to continue for a
long<00:02:12.780> time

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
long time

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.230 
long time
you<00:02:13.370> need<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.610> make<00:02:13.700> sure<00:02:13.880> things<00:02:14.030> are

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
you need to make sure things are

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.059 
you need to make sure things are
designed<00:02:14.540> for<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.810> future<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.350> I'd<00:02:15.890> be

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
designed for the future and I'd be

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.520 
designed for the future and I'd be
worried<00:02:16.310> that<00:02:16.340> perhaps<00:02:16.750> Warcraft<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:18.050> is

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
worried that perhaps Warcraft is is

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.470 
worried that perhaps Warcraft is is
getting<00:02:18.920> more<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.130> more<00:02:19.250> dated<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.819> do<00:02:20.150> think

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
getting more and more dated I do think

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.970 
getting more and more dated I do think
though<00:02:20.600> that<00:02:20.630> its<00:02:20.900> combat<00:02:21.230> system<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:21.830> stuff

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
though that its combat system and stuff

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.130 
though that its combat system and stuff
like<00:02:22.130> that<00:02:22.190> is<00:02:22.550> saved<00:02:23.209> by<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.450> fact<00:02:23.750> that<00:02:23.840> it's

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
like that is saved by the fact that it's

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.740 
like that is saved by the fact that it's
just<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:24.560> damn<00:02:24.860> responsive<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:26.300> heavy

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
just so damn responsive the heavy

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.780 
just so damn responsive the heavy
animation<00:02:27.410> or<00:02:27.620> like<00:02:28.160> emphasis<00:02:28.670> and

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
animation or like emphasis and

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.400 
animation or like emphasis and
animations<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:29.420> some<00:02:29.540> other<00:02:29.690> animals<00:02:30.170> like

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
animations and some other animals like

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.170 
animations and some other animals like
Guild<00:02:30.650> Wars<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:30.980> stuff<00:02:31.160> do<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.370> know<00:02:31.940> that's

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
Guild Wars and stuff do you know that's

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.670 
Guild Wars and stuff do you know that's
cool<00:02:32.420> have<00:02:32.540> nice<00:02:32.750> animations<00:02:33.290> but<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.530> makes

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
cool have nice animations but it makes

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.530 
cool have nice animations but it makes
the<00:02:33.800> combat<00:02:34.130> feel<00:02:34.280> really<00:02:34.670> unresponsive<00:02:35.420> and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
the combat feel really unresponsive and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.780 
the combat feel really unresponsive and
floaty<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.530> yeah<00:02:36.980> there's<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.459> wraith<00:02:37.610> one

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
floaty so yeah there's a wraith one

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.160 
floaty so yeah there's a wraith one
thing<00:02:37.910> they're<00:02:38.030> doing<00:02:38.180> a<00:02:38.209> pretty<00:02:38.330> good<00:02:38.420> job<00:02:38.540> so

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
thing they're doing a pretty good job so

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.320 
thing they're doing a pretty good job so
the<00:02:39.290> next<00:02:39.319> thing<00:02:39.590> is<00:02:39.739> that<00:02:40.459> they<00:02:40.730> think<00:02:40.790> the

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
the next thing is that they think the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.270 
the next thing is that they think the
current<00:02:41.810> touts<00:02:42.080> are<00:02:42.350> still<00:02:42.590> not<00:02:42.709> ideal<00:02:43.100> and

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
current touts are still not ideal and

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.220 
current touts are still not ideal and
need<00:02:43.430> work<00:02:43.610> done<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:44.180> they<00:02:44.660> said<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:44.900> patch

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
need work done and they said that patch

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.590 
need work done and they said that patch
5.4<00:02:45.709> is<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:45.980> great<00:02:46.160> opportunity<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:47.060> from<00:02:47.480> this

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
5.4 is a great opportunity so from this

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.750 
5.4 is a great opportunity so from this
will<00:02:47.840> all<00:02:47.959> I<00:02:47.989> take<00:02:48.320> is<00:02:48.560> that<00:02:48.590> some<00:02:49.580> of<00:02:49.640> your

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
will all I take is that some of your

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.130 
will all I take is that some of your
lesser<00:02:50.060> used<00:02:50.180> towns<00:02:50.480> will<00:02:50.660> be<00:02:50.780> built<00:02:50.959> and

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
lesser used towns will be built and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.020 
lesser used towns will be built and
that's<00:02:51.320> pretty<00:02:51.739> nice<00:02:51.950> more<00:02:52.250> choices<00:02:52.519> always<00:02:52.880> a

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
that's pretty nice more choices always a

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.780 
that's pretty nice more choices always a
great<00:02:53.180> thing<00:02:53.239> however<00:02:54.200> men<00:02:55.160> maxing<00:02:55.670> will

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
great thing however men maxing will

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.699 
great thing however men maxing will
pretty<00:02:55.970> much<00:02:56.060> always<00:02:56.330> calculate<00:02:57.080> a<00:02:57.110> solid

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
pretty much always calculate a solid

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.750 
pretty much always calculate a solid
sort<00:02:58.489> of<00:02:58.580> mathematical<00:02:58.989> one<00:02:59.989> that's<00:03:00.200> better

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
sort of mathematical one that's better

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.800 
sort of mathematical one that's better
of<00:03:01.760> course<00:03:01.970> because<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:02.330> did<00:03:02.480> say<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:02.720> know

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
of course because it did say you know

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.540 
of course because it did say you know
it's<00:03:02.930> about<00:03:03.110> what<00:03:03.290> gives<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:03.890> most<00:03:04.160> dps

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
it's about what gives you the most dps

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.400 
it's about what gives you the most dps
and<00:03:04.790> if<00:03:05.330> they<00:03:05.450> can<00:03:05.660> get<00:03:05.810> them<00:03:05.930> balance<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.319> the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
and if they can get them balance to the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.530 
and if they can get them balance to the
point<00:03:06.650> where<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.280> individual<00:03:07.819> player<00:03:08.090> skill

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
point where the individual player skill

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.960 
point where the individual player skill
and<00:03:08.959> stuff<00:03:09.200> like<00:03:09.319> that<00:03:09.380> is<00:03:09.739> what<00:03:10.459> determines

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
and stuff like that is what determines

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.220 
and stuff like that is what determines
what's<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.450> most<00:03:11.569> efficient<00:03:11.989> than<00:03:12.019> that

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
what's the most efficient than that

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.470 
what's the most efficient than that
would<00:03:12.380> probably<00:03:12.620> be<00:03:12.890> ideal<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:14.209> final

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
would probably be ideal and the final

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.120 
would probably be ideal and the final
thing<00:03:14.510> is<00:03:14.870> about<00:03:15.110> smart<00:03:15.500> heels<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:15.890> I<00:03:15.920> said

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
thing is about smart heels and I said

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.560 
thing is about smart heels and I said
that<00:03:16.250> they're<00:03:16.370> just<00:03:16.400> too<00:03:16.910> dominant<00:03:17.420> at<00:03:17.480> the

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
that they're just too dominant at the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.509 
that they're just too dominant at the
minute<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:17.959> but<00:03:18.739> it's<00:03:18.920> a<00:03:19.010> really<00:03:19.250> hefty

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
minute and but it's a really hefty

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.610 
minute and but it's a really hefty
design<00:03:19.970> issue<00:03:20.180> because<00:03:20.570> the<00:03:21.110> smoked<00:03:21.320> eels<00:03:21.500> are

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
design issue because the smoked eels are

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.199 
design issue because the smoked eels are
really<00:03:21.799> strong<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.820> problem<00:03:23.060> with<00:03:23.150> the

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
really strong and the problem with the

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.240 
really strong and the problem with the
dumb<00:03:23.360> heels<00:03:23.630> is<00:03:23.930> that<00:03:24.560> even<00:03:24.709> if<00:03:24.860> they've<00:03:25.070> you

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
dumb heels is that even if they've you

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.560 
dumb heels is that even if they've you
know<00:03:25.280> both<00:03:25.519> them<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.730> little<00:03:25.880> bit<00:03:26.120> they'd<00:03:26.299> still

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
know both them a little bit they'd still

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.220 
know both them a little bit they'd still
be<00:03:26.600> sort<00:03:26.870> of<00:03:26.930> low<00:03:27.260> priority<00:03:28.329> in<00:03:29.329> terms<00:03:29.630> of<00:03:30.110> how

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
be sort of low priority in terms of how

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.340 
be sort of low priority in terms of how
people<00:03:30.560> do<00:03:30.980> like<00:03:31.940> two<00:03:32.180> spells<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:32.690> stuff<00:03:32.780> so

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
people do like two spells and stuff so

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.930 
people do like two spells and stuff so
it<00:03:33.500> seems<00:03:33.709> like<00:03:33.829> an<00:03:33.980> issue<00:03:34.070> i'm<00:03:34.370> not<00:03:34.549> a<00:03:34.579> healer

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
it seems like an issue i'm not a healer

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.670 
it seems like an issue i'm not a healer
so<00:03:35.120> i'm<00:03:35.239> not<00:03:35.360> really<00:03:35.420> going<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:35.989> get<00:03:36.260> into<00:03:36.560> it

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
so i'm not really going to get into it

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.190 
so i'm not really going to get into it
that<00:03:36.829> much<00:03:36.860> but<00:03:37.489> you<00:03:38.390> know<00:03:38.480> a<00:03:38.630> third<00:03:38.930> of<00:03:39.079> my

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
that much but you know a third of my

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.800 
that much but you know a third of my
listeners<00:03:39.440> are<00:03:39.829> probably<00:03:40.310> healer<00:03:40.549> so<00:03:40.970> so

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
listeners are probably healer so so

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.479 
listeners are probably healer so so
skipper<00:03:42.320> get<00:03:42.440> that<00:03:42.560> information<00:03:42.739> out<00:03:43.100> so

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
skipper get that information out so

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.610 
skipper get that information out so
that's<00:03:43.670> it<00:03:43.850> for<00:03:44.150> today's<00:03:44.390> daily<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:44.959> a<00:03:45.380> little

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
that's it for today's daily and a little

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.140 
that's it for today's daily and a little
short<00:03:45.859> one<00:03:46.070> hopefully<00:03:46.519> will<00:03:46.670> be<00:03:46.730> more<00:03:46.910> stuff

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
short one hopefully will be more stuff

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.569 
short one hopefully will be more stuff
coming<00:03:47.180> down<00:03:47.600> the<00:03:47.900> pipe<00:03:48.109> I<00:03:48.380> did<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.370> first

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
is going to be a thing now when on the

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.680 
is going to be a thing now when on the
channel<00:03:59.959> we<00:04:00.049> may<00:04:00.200> have<00:04:00.410> some<00:04:00.859> well<00:04:01.600> there<00:04:02.600> will

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
channel we may have some well there will

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.420 
channel we may have some well there will
probably<00:04:02.989> be<00:04:03.230> two<00:04:03.500> videos<00:04:03.799> every<00:04:04.100> day<00:04:04.250> this

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
probably be two videos every day this

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.150 
probably be two videos every day this
week<00:04:04.489> but<00:04:05.230> some<00:04:06.230> of<00:04:06.320> them<00:04:06.380> will<00:04:06.500> probably<00:04:06.530> just

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
week but some of them will probably just
