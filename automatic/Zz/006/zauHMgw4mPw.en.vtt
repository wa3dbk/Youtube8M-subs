00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
like in people's genealogy and when we

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.150 
like in people's genealogy and when we
had<00:01:21.370> singing<00:01:21.730> revolution<00:01:22.560> Estonians<00:01:23.560> they

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
and sang it was the declaration and I

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.340 
and sang it was the declaration and I
remember<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:31.810> feeling<00:01:32.020> that<00:01:32.710> we<00:01:33.370> have<00:01:34.350> 80,000

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350

remember the feeling that we have 80,000
people<00:01:35.470> here<00:01:35.920> you<00:01:36.850> can't<00:01:37.150> arrest<00:01:37.479> and<00:01:37.900> you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
people here you can't arrest and you

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.950

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
it made estonian people feel that music

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.730 
it made estonian people feel that music
can<00:01:44.650> make<00:01:44.890> difference<00:01:45.580> and<00:01:45.850> that's<00:01:46.750> why<00:01:47.050> we'll

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
can make difference and that's why we'll

00:01:47.740 --> 00:02:35.470 
can make difference and that's why we'll
continue<00:01:47.920> with<00:01:48.310> this<00:01:48.430> tradition
