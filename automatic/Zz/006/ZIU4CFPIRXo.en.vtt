models<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.180> compact<00:00:39.540> system<00:00:39.660> camera<00:00:40.170> a

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
models of this compact system camera a

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.569 
models of this compact system camera a
word<00:00:40.440> or<00:00:40.559> two<00:00:40.590> about<00:00:40.680> why<00:00:40.980> they<00:00:41.160> vary<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.550> much

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
word or two about why they vary so much

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.030 
word or two about why they vary so much
in<00:00:41.879> size<00:00:42.260> you<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.350> see<00:00:43.440> they<00:00:43.559> go<00:00:43.680> from<00:00:43.800> quite

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
in size you can see they go from quite

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.770 
in size you can see they go from quite
small<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.489> much<00:00:44.640> larger<00:00:45.090> now<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.450> single

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
small to much larger now the single

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.660 
small to much larger now the single
biggest<00:00:45.870> reason<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.129> size<00:00:47.520> of

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
biggest reason for that is the size of

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.100 
biggest reason for that is the size of
the<00:00:47.760> sensor<00:00:48.000> employed<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> camera

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
the sensor employed in the camera

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.049 
the sensor employed in the camera
there's<00:00:49.680> no<00:00:49.860> standard<00:00:50.399> sensor<00:00:50.610> used<00:00:50.910> in

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
there's no standard sensor used in

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.580 
there's no standard sensor used in
kampar<00:00:51.390> system<00:00:51.719> cameras<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.199> they<00:00:52.260> vary<00:00:52.500> a

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
kampar system cameras and they vary a

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.319 
kampar system cameras and they vary a
lot<00:00:52.739> from<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.070> quite<00:00:53.280> small<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.180> much

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
lot from the quite small to the much

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.180 
lot from the quite small to the much
larger<00:00:54.539> sensors<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.500> I've<00:00:55.800> decided<00:00:56.010> to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
larger sensors and I've decided to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.950 
larger sensors and I've decided to
represent<00:00:56.399> these<00:00:56.850> sizes<00:00:57.120> using<00:00:57.719> Lego

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
represent these sizes using Lego

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.810 
represent these sizes using Lego
obviously<00:00:58.680> these<00:00:58.829> are<00:00:58.949> not<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.160> scale<00:00:59.309> but

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
obviously these are not to scale but

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.430 
obviously these are not to scale but
they<00:00:59.940> are<00:01:00.059> proportional<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.660> each<00:01:00.930> other<00:01:01.170> and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
they are proportional to each other and

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.290 
they are proportional to each other and
I<00:01:02.070> used<00:01:02.250> Lego<00:01:02.609> because<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:02.940> quite<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> good

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
I used Lego because it's quite a good

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.399 
I used Lego because it's quite a good
demonstration<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.989> each<00:01:04.049> one<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.350> these

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
demonstration and each one of these

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.469 
demonstration and each one of these
little<00:01:04.619> dimples<00:01:04.939> represents<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.030> millimeter

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
little dimples represents a millimeter

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.090 
little dimples represents a millimeter
and<00:01:06.990> obviously<00:01:07.290> I've<00:01:07.439> had<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.619> round<00:01:07.830> up<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and obviously I've had to round up and

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.490 
and obviously I've had to round up and
round<00:01:08.310> down<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.390> nearest<00:01:09.479> millimeter<00:01:09.869> but

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
round down to the nearest millimeter but

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.480 
round down to the nearest millimeter but
it's<00:01:10.650> give<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.830> an<00:01:10.890> idea<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.369> relative

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
it's give you an idea of the relative

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.370 
it's give you an idea of the relative
sizes<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> sensors<00:01:12.659> used<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.049> compact

different<00:01:34.710> sizes<00:01:35.250> used<00:01:35.460> by<00:01:35.610> compacts<00:01:36.030> as<00:01:36.210> well

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
different sizes used by compacts as well

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.569 
different sizes used by compacts as well
now<00:01:38.149> the<00:01:38.210> nickel<00:01:38.540> one<00:01:38.720> system<00:01:39.200> uses<00:01:39.860> a<00:01:40.070> much

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
now the nickel one system uses a much

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.340 
now the nickel one system uses a much
larger<00:01:40.970> sensor<00:01:41.240> a<00:01:41.270> one<00:01:41.479> inch<00:01:41.659> sensor<00:01:41.899> and<00:01:42.320> you

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
larger sensor a one inch sensor and you

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.080 
larger sensor a one inch sensor and you
can<00:01:42.649> see<00:01:42.860> proportionally<00:01:43.610> it's<00:01:43.970> a

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
can see proportionally it's a

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.120 
can see proportionally it's a
significantly<00:01:44.689> larger<00:01:45.049> sensor<00:01:45.470> than<00:01:45.860> anyone

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
significantly larger sensor than anyone

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.590 
significantly larger sensor than anyone
in<00:01:46.189> this<00:01:46.280> camera<00:01:46.670> even<00:01:47.090> though<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.299> camera

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
in this camera even though the camera

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.940 
in this camera even though the camera
itself<00:01:47.930> is<00:01:48.229> not<00:01:48.649> that<00:01:49.070> much<00:01:49.280> bigger<00:01:50.829> and<00:01:51.829> then

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
itself is not that much bigger and then

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.230 
itself is not that much bigger and then
we<00:01:52.070> move<00:01:52.220> on<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:52.549> the<00:01:52.670> Micro<00:01:53.030> Four<00:01:53.210> Thirds

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
we move on to the Micro Four Thirds

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.870 
we move on to the Micro Four Thirds
cameras<00:01:54.020> like<00:01:54.289> Olympus<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:54.920> Panasonic<00:01:55.490> and

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
cameras like Olympus and Panasonic and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.240 
cameras like Olympus and Panasonic and
this<00:01:56.090> represents<00:01:56.750> a<00:01:56.810> micro<00:01:57.140> 4/3<00:01:57.590> sensor

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
this represents a micro 4/3 sensor

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.580 
this represents a micro 4/3 sensor
compared<00:01:58.759> with<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:59.299> Nikon<00:01:59.630> one<00:01:59.810> sensor<00:02:00.259> and

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
compared with the Nikon one sensor and

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.469 
compared with the Nikon one sensor and
as<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:00.799> can<00:02:00.920> see<00:02:01.039> is<00:02:01.369> that<00:02:01.640> much<00:02:01.820> bigger<00:02:02.030> again

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
as you can see is that much bigger again

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.679 
as you can see is that much bigger again
and<00:02:03.320> then<00:02:03.979> finally<00:02:04.490> we<00:02:04.909> have<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.240> aps-c

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
and then finally we have the aps-c

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.290 
and then finally we have the aps-c
sensor<00:02:06.439> used<00:02:06.770> in<00:02:07.009> most<00:02:07.310> consumer<00:02:08.179> digital

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
sensor used in most consumer digital

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.590 
sensor used in most consumer digital
SLRs<00:02:09.050> and<00:02:09.229> in<00:02:09.920> quite<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.610> few<00:02:10.670> systems<00:02:11.299> in<00:02:11.450> the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
SLRs and in quite a few systems in the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.570 
SLRs and in quite a few systems in the
compact<00:02:11.900> system<00:02:12.140> camera<00:02:12.590> sector<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.220> can

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
compact system camera sector and you can

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.220 
compact system camera sector and you can
see<00:02:13.670> that's<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.970> biggest<00:02:14.150> sensor<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.780> all<00:02:14.930> and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
see that's the biggest sensor of all and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.979 
see that's the biggest sensor of all and
so<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:15.620> is<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:15.860> aps-c<00:02:16.400> size<00:02:16.880> sensor<00:02:16.910> this<00:02:17.780> is

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
so this is the aps-c size sensor this is

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.979 
so this is the aps-c size sensor this is
the<00:02:18.230> Micro<00:02:18.560> Four<00:02:18.739> Thirds<00:02:18.769> sensor

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
the Micro Four Thirds sensor

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.030 
the Micro Four Thirds sensor
so<00:02:20.989> going<00:02:21.260> from<00:02:21.700> aps-c<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:23.450> Micro<00:02:23.750> Four<00:02:23.959> Thirds

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
so going from aps-c to Micro Four Thirds

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.420 
so going from aps-c to Micro Four Thirds
to<00:02:25.040> Nick<00:02:25.220> on<00:02:25.370> one<00:02:26.019> to<00:02:27.019> Pentax<00:02:27.440> Q<00:02:27.769> you<00:02:28.250> can

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
to Nick on one to Pentax Q you can

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.339 
to Nick on one to Pentax Q you can
imagine<00:02:28.819> when<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.060> put<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.360> Pentax<00:02:29.750> Q<00:02:29.930> sensor

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
imagine when you put the Pentax Q sensor

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.680 
imagine when you put the Pentax Q sensor
next<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.950> aps-c<00:02:31.340> sensor<00:02:32.000> look<00:02:32.390> how<00:02:32.540> much

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
next to the aps-c sensor look how much

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.960 
next to the aps-c sensor look how much
bigger<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.380> sensor<00:02:33.799> in<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.130> Fuji<00:02:34.430> x-pro<00:02:34.700> one

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
bigger the sensor in the Fuji x-pro one

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.970 
bigger the sensor in the Fuji x-pro one
is<00:02:35.120> for<00:02:35.299> example<00:02:35.750> than<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.170> sensor<00:02:36.500> in<00:02:36.890> the

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
is for example than the sensor in the

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.800 
is for example than the sensor in the
Pentax<00:02:37.370> Q<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.180> gives<00:02:38.330> you<00:02:38.390> some<00:02:38.540> idea

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
Pentax Q and that gives you some idea

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.780 
Pentax Q and that gives you some idea
why<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.049> image<00:02:39.319> quality<00:02:39.470> from<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.099> Fuji

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
why the image quality from the Fuji

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.220 
why the image quality from the Fuji
x-pro<00:02:40.970> one<00:02:41.269> is<00:02:41.450> going<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:41.840> be<00:02:41.900> that<00:02:42.079> much

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
x-pro one is going to be that much

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.470 
x-pro one is going to be that much
better<00:02:42.290> than<00:02:43.010> that<00:02:43.040> from<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.519> Pentax<00:02:43.940> Q<00:02:44.239> and

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
better than that from the Pentax Q and

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.199 
better than that from the Pentax Q and
also<00:02:44.840> why<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.019> camera<00:02:45.410> so<00:02:45.530> much<00:02:45.680> bigger<00:02:46.209> I'm

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
also why the camera so much bigger I'm

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.849 
also why the camera so much bigger I'm
going<00:02:47.359> to<00:02:47.420> go<00:02:47.480> from<00:02:47.690> smallest<00:02:48.170> system<00:02:48.380> to

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
going to go from smallest system to

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:50.229 
going to go from smallest system to
larger<00:02:49.130> system<00:02:49.400> in<00:02:49.489> terms<00:02:49.640> of<00:02:49.760> sensor<00:02:50.060> size

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
larger system in terms of sensor size

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.640 
larger system in terms of sensor size
which<00:02:50.420> means<00:02:50.660> we<00:02:50.780> kick<00:02:50.930> off<00:02:51.049> with<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.260> Pentax

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
which means we kick off with the Pentax

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.940 
which means we kick off with the Pentax
q10<00:02:51.890> which<00:02:52.670> has<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:52.959> 12<00:02:53.959> point<00:02:54.109> 4<00:02:54.350> megapixel

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
q10 which has a 12 point 4 megapixel

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.380 
q10 which has a 12 point 4 megapixel
sensor<00:02:55.280> quite<00:02:55.519> small<00:02:55.880> so<00:02:56.060> image<00:02:56.269> quality

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
sensor quite small so image quality

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.670 
sensor quite small so image quality
won't<00:02:56.750> be<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.930> hot<00:02:57.049> as<00:02:57.170> high<00:02:57.290> as<00:02:57.350> some<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.620> the

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
won't be the hot as high as some of the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.170 
won't be the hot as high as some of the
others<00:02:57.890> here<00:02:58.040> but<00:02:58.459> it's<00:02:58.579> did<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.700> quite<00:02:58.910> a<00:02:58.940> nice

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
others here but it's did a quite a nice

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.970 
others here but it's did a quite a nice
to<00:02:59.329> cute<00:02:59.540> little<00:02:59.660> camera<00:03:00.079> and<00:03:00.350> it<00:03:00.560> does<00:03:00.739> have

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
to cute little camera and it does have

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.740 
to cute little camera and it does have
things<00:03:01.459> like<00:03:01.579> Shake<00:03:01.819> Reduction<00:03:01.970> it<00:03:02.540> does<00:03:02.720> a

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
things like Shake Reduction it does a

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.449 
things like Shake Reduction it does a
full<00:03:03.019> HD<00:03:03.140> video<00:03:03.590> on<00:03:03.739> there<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.069> there's<00:03:04.400> a

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
full HD video on there and there's a

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.640 
full HD video on there and there's a
range<00:03:04.640> of<00:03:04.730> 5<00:03:04.970> lenses<00:03:05.390> available<00:03:05.560> including<00:03:06.560> a

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
manual focus kind of fun lens is it

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.759 
manual focus kind of fun lens is it
fairly<00:03:10.280> inexpensive<00:03:11.079> because<00:03:12.079> the<00:03:12.410> sense<00:03:12.620> are

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
fairly inexpensive because the sense are

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.500
