be<00:00:12.469> so<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.559> see<00:00:13.740> it's<00:00:13.860> not<00:00:13.889> just<00:00:14.040> resources

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
be so you see it's not just resources

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.519 
be so you see it's not just resources

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
that are wasted along this system but

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.960 
that are wasted along this system but
people<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.279> whole<00:00:18.060> communities<00:00:18.359> get<00:00:18.990> wasted

but even more leave as byproducts or
pollution<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.460> lot<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:30.119> pollution<00:00:30.480> in

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
pollution and it's a lot of pollution in

releasing over four billion pounds of
toxic<00:00:35.760> chemicals<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.510> year<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:37.500> probably<00:00:37.710> a

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
toxic chemicals a year it's probably a

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.080 
toxic chemicals a year it's probably a
lot<00:00:38.100> more<00:00:38.129> because<00:00:38.399> that's<00:00:38.640> all<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.820> what<00:00:38.969> they

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
lot more because that's all I what they

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.360 
lot more because that's all I what they
admit<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:40.140> that's<00:00:40.290> another<00:00:40.530> limit<00:00:40.980> because

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
admit so that's another limit because

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.970 
admit so that's another limit because
yok<00:00:41.760> who<00:00:42.390> wants<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.719> look<00:00:42.989> at<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.350> smell<00:00:43.649> four

yok who wants to look at and smell four
billion<00:00:44.280> pounds<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.789> toxic<00:00:44.940> chemicals<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.600> year

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
billion pounds of toxic chemicals a year

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.170 
billion pounds of toxic chemicals a year
so<00:00:46.440> what<00:00:46.590> do<00:00:46.649> they<00:00:46.739> do<00:00:46.800> move<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.000> dirty

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
so what do they do move the dirty

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.600 
so what do they do move the dirty
factories<00:00:48.719> overseas<00:00:48.920> dude<00:00:49.920> someone<00:00:50.190> else's

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
factories overseas dude someone else's

factories overseas dude someone else's
land<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.539> surprise<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.469> lot<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.100> that

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
land but surprise a lot of that

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.709 
land but surprise a lot of that
pollution<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.640> coming<00:00:53.940> right<00:00:54.210> back<00:00:54.449> at<00:00:54.690> us

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
pollution is coming right back at us

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.189 
pollution is coming right back at us
carried<00:00:55.320> by<00:00:55.469> wind<00:00:55.530> currents<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:57.390> what<00:00:57.629> happens

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
carried by wind currents so what happens

about<00:01:21.619> externalizing<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> costs<00:01:23.250> what<00:01:23.970> that

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
about externalizing the costs what that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.090 
about externalizing the costs what that
means<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.869> real<00:01:25.110> cost<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.860> making

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
means is that the real cost of making

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.760 
means is that the real cost of making
stuff<00:01:26.490> aren't<00:01:26.820> captured<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.689> price<00:01:27.960> in

and<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.280> was<00:01:44.399> thinking<00:01:44.430> how<00:01:45.329> could<00:01:45.540> four

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
and I was thinking how could four

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.109 
and I was thinking how could four
dollars<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> 99-cent<00:01:46.549> possibly<00:01:47.549> capture<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
dollars a 99-cent possibly capture the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.149 
dollars a 99-cent possibly capture the
cost<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.630> making<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.200> radio<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.740> getting<00:01:50.070> it

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
cost of making this radio and getting it

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.760

planned<00:05:32.900> obsolescence<00:05:33.110> is<00:05:33.770> another<00:05:34.100> word<00:05:34.310> for

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
planned obsolescence is another word for

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.820 
planned obsolescence is another word for
designed<00:05:35.030> for<00:05:35.300> the<00:05:35.390> dump<00:05:35.690> it<00:05:36.380> means<00:05:36.650> they

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
designed for the dump it means they

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.770 
designed for the dump it means they
actually<00:05:37.280> make<00:05:37.580> stuff<00:05:37.910> to<00:05:38.060> be<00:05:38.180> useless<00:05:38.510> as

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
actually make stuff to be useless as

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.390 
actually make stuff to be useless as
quickly<00:05:39.110> as<00:05:39.350> possible<00:05:39.740> so<00:05:39.890> we'll<00:05:40.010> chuck<00:05:40.250> it

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
quickly as possible so we'll chuck it

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.460 
quickly as possible so we'll chuck it
and<00:05:40.760> buy<00:05:40.940> a<00:05:40.970> new<00:05:41.030> one<00:05:41.240> it's<00:05:41.900> obvious<00:05:42.350> with

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
and buy a new one it's obvious with

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.110 
and buy a new one it's obvious with
things<00:05:42.650> like<00:05:42.740> plastic<00:05:43.250> bags<00:05:43.430> and<00:05:43.580> coffee<00:05:43.820> cups

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
things like plastic bags and coffee cups

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.870 
things like plastic bags and coffee cups
but<00:05:44.330> now<00:05:44.420> it's<00:05:44.570> even<00:05:44.660> big<00:05:45.080> stuff<00:05:45.380> mops<00:05:45.980> DVDs

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
but now it's even big stuff mops DVDs

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.110 
but now it's even big stuff mops DVDs
cameras<00:05:47.660> barbecues<00:05:48.440> even<00:05:48.770> everything<00:05:49.190> even

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
cameras barbecues even everything even

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.270 
cameras barbecues even everything even
computers<00:05:50.660> I've<00:05:51.410> even<00:05:51.680> want<00:05:51.860> to<00:05:51.920> sit<00:05:52.070> when<00:05:52.160> you

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
computers I've even want to sit when you

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.920 
computers I've even want to sit when you
buy<00:05:52.460> a<00:05:52.490> computer<00:05:52.730> now<00:05:53.090> the<00:05:53.150> technology<00:05:53.840> is

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
buy a computer now the technology is

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.510 
buy a computer now the technology is
changing<00:05:53.960> so<00:05:54.350> fast<00:05:54.560> that<00:05:54.920> in<00:05:55.130> just<00:05:55.220> a<00:05:55.370> couple

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
changing so fast that in just a couple

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.980 
changing so fast that in just a couple
of<00:05:55.730> years<00:05:55.790> it's<00:05:56.000> actually<00:05:56.390> an<00:05:56.510> impediment<00:05:56.870> to

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
of years it's actually an impediment to

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.500 
of years it's actually an impediment to
communication<00:05:57.890> I<00:05:58.070> was<00:05:58.760> curious<00:05:59.060> about<00:05:59.240> this

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
communication I was curious about this

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.630 
communication I was curious about this
so<00:05:59.630> I<00:05:59.690> opened<00:06:00.260> up<00:06:00.350> a<00:06:00.500> big<00:06:00.530> desktop<00:06:01.100> computer<00:06:01.610> to

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
so I opened up a big desktop computer to

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.760 
so I opened up a big desktop computer to
see<00:06:01.850> what<00:06:01.880> was<00:06:02.090> inside<00:06:02.270> and<00:06:03.169> I<00:06:03.350> found<00:06:03.590> out<00:06:03.740> that

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
see what was inside and I found out that

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.860 
see what was inside and I found out that
the<00:06:03.980> piece<00:06:04.250> that<00:06:04.280> changes<00:06:05.000> each<00:06:05.150> year<00:06:05.180> is<00:06:05.630> just

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
the piece that changes each year is just

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.320 
the piece that changes each year is just
a<00:06:06.200> tiny<00:06:06.500> little<00:06:06.710> piece<00:06:07.160> in<00:06:07.340> the<00:06:07.430> corner<00:06:07.820> but

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
a tiny little piece in the corner but

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.760 
a tiny little piece in the corner but
you<00:06:08.450> can't<00:06:08.690> just<00:06:08.840> change<00:06:09.080> that<00:06:09.169> one<00:06:09.470> piece

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
you can't just change that one piece

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.740 
you can't just change that one piece
because<00:06:10.190> each<00:06:10.400> new<00:06:10.669> version<00:06:11.120> is<00:06:11.270> a<00:06:11.300> different

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
because each new version is a different

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.300 
because each new version is a different
shape<00:06:11.960> so<00:06:12.410> you<00:06:12.500> got<00:06:12.620> to<00:06:12.740> chuck<00:06:13.130> the<00:06:13.160> whole

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
shape so you got to chuck the whole

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.559 
shape so you got to chuck the whole
thing<00:06:13.640> by<00:06:14.180> anyone

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:15.569 
thing by anyone

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:17.689 
thing by anyone
so<00:06:16.169> I<00:06:16.199> was<00:06:16.439> reading<00:06:16.860> industrial<00:06:17.399> design

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 
so I was reading industrial design

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:19.549 
so I was reading industrial design
journals<00:06:18.119> in<00:06:18.240> the<00:06:18.300> 1950s<00:06:19.050> when<00:06:19.229> planned

00:06:19.549 --> 00:06:19.559 
journals in the 1950s when planned

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:21.049 
journals in the 1950s when planned
obsolescence<00:06:19.740> was<00:06:20.249> really<00:06:20.550> catching<00:06:20.939> on

00:06:21.049 --> 00:06:21.059 
obsolescence was really catching on

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:23.570 
obsolescence was really catching on
these<00:06:21.719> designers<00:06:22.319> are<00:06:22.499> so<00:06:22.800> open<00:06:23.189> about<00:06:23.399> it

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
these designers are so open about it

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.419 
these designers are so open about it
they<00:06:24.149> actually<00:06:24.659> discuss<00:06:25.139> how<00:06:25.469> fast<00:06:26.039> can<00:06:26.309> they

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:26.429 
they actually discuss how fast can they

00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:28.399 
they actually discuss how fast can they
make<00:06:26.610> stuff<00:06:26.759> break<00:06:27.240> this<00:06:27.779> still<00:06:28.080> leaves<00:06:28.289> the

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
make stuff break this still leaves the

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:29.899 
make stuff break this still leaves the
consumer<00:06:28.919> having<00:06:29.159> enough<00:06:29.309> faith<00:06:29.580> in<00:06:29.610> the

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:29.909 
consumer having enough faith in the

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:31.309 
consumer having enough faith in the
product<00:06:30.240> to<00:06:30.270> go<00:06:30.389> out<00:06:30.479> and<00:06:30.569> buy<00:06:30.659> another<00:06:30.779> one<00:06:31.110> it

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 
product to go out and buy another one it

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:34.519 
product to go out and buy another one it
was<00:06:31.770> so<00:06:32.129> intentional<00:06:32.969> the<00:06:33.779> stuff<00:06:34.050> cannot

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:34.529 
was so intentional the stuff cannot

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:36.230 
was so intentional the stuff cannot
break<00:06:34.860> fast<00:06:35.129> enough<00:06:35.459> to<00:06:35.610> keep<00:06:35.729> this<00:06:35.939> arrow

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
break fast enough to keep this arrow

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.329 
break fast enough to keep this arrow
afloat<00:06:36.689> so<00:06:37.289> there's<00:06:37.469> also<00:06:37.649> perceived

convinces us to throw away stuff that is
still<00:06:43.649> perfectly<00:06:44.369> useful<00:06:45.080> how<00:06:46.080> do<00:06:46.139> they<00:06:46.289> do

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:46.349 
still perfectly useful how do they do

that well they change the way the
