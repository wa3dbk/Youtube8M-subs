00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
personally involved it's impossible to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.139 
personally involved it's impossible to
know<00:01:57.719> exactly<00:01:58.100> what<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.219> story<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.549> there<00:01:59.850> so

in that sense yeah

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.980 
in that sense yeah
perhaps<00:02:05.280> if<00:02:05.580> he<00:02:05.700> only<00:02:05.850> said<00:02:06.180> sorry<00:02:06.510> for<00:02:06.600> having

perhaps if he only said sorry for having
