intercostal space mid-axillary line with
slight<00:04:19.229> tilting<00:04:19.889> upwards<00:04:20.190> of<00:04:20.789> the<00:04:21.000> needle

slight tilting upwards of the needle

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.960 
slight tilting upwards of the needle
anyhow<00:04:22.410> let's<00:04:22.650> look<00:04:22.889> at<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.130> options<00:04:23.310> so

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
anyhow let's look at the options so

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.270 
anyhow let's look at the options so
fourth<00:04:24.300> intercostal<00:04:24.630> space<00:04:25.320> this<00:04:25.950> will<00:04:26.130> be

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
fourth intercostal space this will be

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.930 
fourth intercostal space this will be
dangerous

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
dangerous

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.940 
dangerous
fifth<00:04:27.210> intercostal<00:04:27.570> space<00:04:27.990> again<00:04:28.620> this<00:04:28.800> is

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
fifth intercostal space again this is

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.980 
fifth intercostal space again this is
dangerous<00:04:29.190> because<00:04:29.880> it<00:04:30.090> might<00:04:30.450> injure<00:04:30.780> the

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
dangerous because it might injure the

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.339 
dangerous because it might injure the
lung

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
lung

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.010

six<00:04:31.919> intercostal<00:04:32.639> space<00:04:32.939> again<00:04:33.330> seventh

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
six intercostal space again seventh

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.989 
six intercostal space again seventh
intercostal<00:04:34.259> space<00:04:34.860> is<00:04:35.069> located<00:04:35.639> between<00:04:35.789> the

00:04:35.989 --> 00:04:35.999 
intercostal space is located between the

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:38.809 
intercostal space is located between the
seventh<00:04:36.449> and<00:04:36.629> eighth<00:04:37.110> ribs<00:04:37.379> and<00:04:37.830> as<00:04:38.669> I

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:38.819 
seventh and eighth ribs and as I

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:40.670 
seventh and eighth ribs and as I
mentioned<00:04:39.240> that<00:04:39.389> the<00:04:39.599> lung<00:04:39.869> extends<00:04:40.439> down<00:04:40.619> to

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
mentioned that the lung extends down to

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.290 
mentioned that the lung extends down to
the<00:04:40.919> level<00:04:41.129> of<00:04:41.189> the<00:04:41.369> eighth<00:04:41.520> rib<00:04:41.819> so<00:04:42.029> there<00:04:42.210> is

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
the level of the eighth rib so there is

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.019 
the level of the eighth rib so there is
a<00:04:42.330> still<00:04:42.629> possibility<00:04:43.229> to<00:04:43.349> injure<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.710> lung

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:44.029 
a still possibility to injure the lung

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:46.659 
a still possibility to injure the lung
while<00:04:45.029> if<00:04:45.389> we<00:04:45.569> go<00:04:45.749> into<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.259> eighth

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
while if we go into the eighth

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.389 
while if we go into the eighth
intercostal<00:04:47.669> space<00:04:47.969> here<00:04:48.499> then<00:04:49.499> below<00:04:50.369> the

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:50.399 
intercostal space here then below the

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:53.779 
intercostal space here then below the
eighth<00:04:50.699> rib<00:04:50.999> then<00:04:51.599> this<00:04:51.990> will<00:04:52.199> be<00:04:52.349> safe<00:04:52.619> but<00:04:53.399> to

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
eighth rib then this will be safe but to

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.379 
eighth rib then this will be safe but to
be<00:04:54.169> safer<00:04:55.169> usually<00:04:55.830> we<00:04:55.949> go<00:04:56.129> into<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:56.939> ninth

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
be safer usually we go into the ninth

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.049 
be safer usually we go into the ninth
intercostal<00:04:58.319> space<00:04:58.740> but<00:04:59.309> the<00:04:59.580> question<00:04:59.909> is

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:00.059 
intercostal space but the question is

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:01.820 
intercostal space but the question is
asking<00:05:00.479> which<00:05:00.839> of<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.229> following<00:05:01.379> is<00:05:01.800> the

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
asking which of the following is the

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.100 
asking which of the following is the
highest<00:05:02.369> level<00:05:02.729> at<00:05:02.879> which<00:05:03.389> this<00:05:03.629> procedure

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
highest level at which this procedure

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.010 
highest level at which this procedure
might<00:05:04.949> safely<00:05:05.520> be<00:05:05.669> done<00:05:05.909> without<00:05:06.419> injuring

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
might safely be done without injuring

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.619 
might safely be done without injuring
the<00:05:07.259> lung<00:05:07.409> because<00:05:07.800> at<00:05:07.979> this<00:05:08.249> location<00:05:09.180> eighth

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:09.629 
the lung because at this location eighth

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:12.769 
the lung because at this location eighth

intercostal space mid-axillary line we
have<00:05:13.020> no<00:05:13.289> lung<00:05:13.589> but<00:05:14.249> we<00:05:14.459> still<00:05:14.789> have<00:05:15.029> pleura

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:15.659 
have no lung but we still have pleura

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:18.589 
have no lung but we still have pleura
