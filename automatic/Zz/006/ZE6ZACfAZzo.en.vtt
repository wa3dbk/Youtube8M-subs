00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.840
 dear astrology friends today i want 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.330
 give them quality over time 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.320
 astrological view in the month of march 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.410
 to report 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.690
 we have with sun merkur venus mars 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.000
 and neptune to month beginning've ago 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.220
 five planets in fish and that 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.789
 means the power continues 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.589
 Inside 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.130
 we are still a bit tired 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:31.779
 driveless the long winter consumes 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.420
 gradually at our forces and so on 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.110
 It may be that one or the other 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.360
 Cliff would still be pending 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.220
 you should pay particular attention to the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.200
 Declining mercury in the fish 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.850
 there until the 17th 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:51.730
 march will not sign any contracts 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.220
 planning yes, yes, yes 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.910
 just do not fix it would be 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:01.540
 everything turns around again 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:05.439
 yes and then it really is really 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.369
 quite abruptly in a different time quality 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.530
 in 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.830
 you could almost get one from one 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.900
 time change talk 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.400
 Maas changes to the Aries on 12 March 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:21.150
 and that means yes mars is in winter in 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.520
 its strongest sign it is one 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.930
 unbelievably strong energy of us 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.240
 drives us on and then on 20 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.920
 March we have the beginning of spring that is 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.280
 the sun changes into the aries 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.290
 And on the 22nd of march comes venus 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.550
 the also in the weather change 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:45.640
 and this creates a spring 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.130
 Energy itself for spring 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.040
 rarely are there such strong scenes 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.040
 So these typical departure moods 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.310
 which we feel in spring about this 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.920
 this lust for eroticism and sex this lust 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.850
 it is still very much alive 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:08.100
 stronger than in others 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.850
 spring and thus an interesting one 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.160
 Spring a spring with big ones 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.280
 youthful swing even older 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:23.150
 can inspire people very strongly 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:26.940
 when you open yourself to life 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.190
 however, and that's the big one right now 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.950
 other side of this one of these strong ones 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.430
 energy it gets too heavy 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.489
 Part of relaxation measures 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.860
 namely on us too in the 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.840
 aries is and will be on 22 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.319
 cross March 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.190
 and now there's a really big one 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:53.040
 critical full moon in the days around the 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.530
 27 he forms in the scales and 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.100
 now we have the fact that on the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.190
 on one side we have a conjunction 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:05.670
 a planet bunch between sun measured 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:09.269
 and uranus, on the other hand, is the result 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:14.130
 and in the scales and pluto respectively in 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:19.170
 quadrath to these planets and that is 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:22.140
 now a tremendous passive tension in 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.340
 the world can do violence 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:29.489
 escalate so we have to go with the 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.890
 increasing tension in crisis areas 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.900
 count 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.180
 we are very much at risk of accidents 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.090
 you'll hear that in the news though 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.060
 there are also very often separations and 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.400
 and we must do it ourselves 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.470
 take care that we are peaceful 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.109
 stay that we continue to try 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.140
 to compromise even when we are 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.300
 too much about at 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.000
 a human annoyance will be in this 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.920
 day in these days a lot of things 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.590
 to come to us provoke us 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.780
 possibly in the form of just as well 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.990
 very aggressive and arguable 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.570
 people therefore be careful in these days 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.370
 These are very dangerous 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:13.030
 But then spring is already on 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.480
 continue with its positive energy end 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.299
 of the month is the beta venus beautiful 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:23.650
 view to jupiter but also in tension 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.810
 To pluto that increases the desire makes 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.390
 but also a bit too 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.540
 power struggle in love inclined so 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:34.480
 Overall, we can say that is one 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.030
 spring of us really out of ours 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.160
 tired everyday life tears them out 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.590
 can move a lot in this 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.240
 but spring must also be 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.360
 also take care that she does not 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.190
 exaggerate and should confrontations 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.700
 if possible, go out of the way 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.660
 they would escalate and have a lot 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:57.690
 negative effects 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.690
 I wish you a very good march
