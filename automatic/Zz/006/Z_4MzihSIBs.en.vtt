everything inside there's also some

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.390 
everything inside there's also some
externals<00:00:26.259> but<00:00:26.439> i<00:00:26.470> thought<00:00:26.830> you<00:00:27.009> know<00:00:27.040> we'll

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
externals but i thought you know we'll

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.819 
externals but i thought you know we'll
just<00:00:27.430> wait<00:00:27.669> till<00:00:27.910> seven<00:00:28.450> morning<00:00:29.140> for<00:00:29.290> that<00:00:29.439> so

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:29.829 
just wait till seven morning for that so

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.350 
just wait till seven morning for that so
we've<00:00:30.009> got<00:00:30.220> a<00:00:30.430> couple<00:00:30.730> of<00:00:30.849> minutes<00:00:30.970> before

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
we've got a couple of minutes before

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.730 
we've got a couple of minutes before
that<00:00:31.480> happens<00:00:31.900> so<00:00:32.020> we'll<00:00:32.140> take<00:00:32.349> a<00:00:32.380> look<00:00:32.619> around

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:32.740 
that happens so we'll take a look around

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.300 
that happens so we'll take a look around
so<00:00:33.310> the<00:00:33.970> first<00:00:34.329> one<00:00:34.600> of<00:00:34.780> course<00:00:34.810> is<00:00:35.230> a<00:00:35.320> skeleton

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
so the first one of course is a skeleton

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.850 
so the first one of course is a skeleton
in<00:00:36.460> its<00:00:36.670> natural<00:00:36.880> environment<00:00:37.390> so<00:00:38.260> we've<00:00:38.710> got

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
in its natural environment so we've got

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.340 
in its natural environment so we've got
some<00:00:39.010> cool<00:00:39.250> blocks<00:00:39.670> behind<00:00:39.970> there<00:00:40.540> some<00:00:41.140> wood

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
assaulting some vine growing up to the

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.639 
assaulting some vine growing up to the
ceiling<00:00:43.300> makes<00:00:43.600> it<00:00:43.809> look<00:00:43.930> really<00:00:44.079> cool<00:00:44.379> you

the<00:01:14.350> craters<00:01:14.860> you<00:01:15.100> know<00:01:15.220> made<00:01:15.369> little

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
the craters you know made little

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.969 
the craters you know made little
habitats<00:01:16.210> for<00:01:16.420> every<00:01:16.630> single<00:01:16.869> mob<00:01:17.200> in<00:01:17.560> the

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
habitats for every single mob in the

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.740 
habitats for every single mob in the
game<00:01:18.159> so<00:01:18.369> this<00:01:18.460> is<00:01:18.579> a<00:01:18.610> spider<00:01:19.119> and<00:01:19.299> of<00:01:19.479> course

don't know

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.350 
don't know
because<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.370> looks<00:02:24.519> pretty<00:02:24.610> locked<00:02:24.909> up<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.209> me

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
because it looks pretty locked up to me

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.970 
because it looks pretty locked up to me
it's<00:02:25.930> kind<00:02:26.080> of<00:02:26.110> like<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.260> prison<00:02:26.739> but<00:02:26.860> they've

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
it's kind of like a prison but they've

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.410 
it's kind of like a prison but they've
got<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.129> cool<00:02:27.340> spot<00:02:27.549> on<00:02:27.700> this<00:02:27.909> one<00:02:28.120> spawning

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
got a cool spot on this one spawning

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.850 
got a cool spot on this one spawning
zombies<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:29.019> don't<00:02:29.170> think<00:02:29.409> they<00:02:29.560> all<00:02:29.680> had

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
zombies I don't think they all had

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.199 
zombies I don't think they all had
spawners<00:02:30.159> but<00:02:30.519> that<00:02:30.640> one<00:02:30.760> does<00:02:30.909> for<00:02:30.940> some

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
spawners but that one does for some

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.030 
spawners but that one does for some
reason<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:32.049> now<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.230> got<00:02:32.379> wolves<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.799> course

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
reason so now you got wolves of course

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.160 
reason so now you got wolves of course
very<00:02:33.400> nice<00:02:33.670> neutral<00:02:34.239> creatures<00:02:34.720> usually

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
very nice neutral creatures usually

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.839 
very nice neutral creatures usually
unless<00:02:35.349> you<00:02:35.620> hit<00:02:35.769> one<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.099> face<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.700> which

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
unless you hit one of the face in which

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.460 
unless you hit one of the face in which
case<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.299> will<00:02:37.390> break<00:02:37.629> your<00:02:37.840> face<00:02:37.989> off<00:02:38.230> but

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
case it will break your face off but

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.259 
case it will break your face off but
yeah<00:02:38.920> in<00:02:39.099> the<00:02:39.190> men<00:02:39.340> are<00:02:39.459> awesome<00:02:39.790> too<00:02:39.819> i<00:02:40.030> think

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
yeah in the men are awesome too i think

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.850 
yeah in the men are awesome too i think
i<00:02:40.629> would<00:02:40.750> assume<00:02:40.840> they<00:02:41.170> could<00:02:41.319> teleport<00:02:41.590> out

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
i would assume they could teleport out

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.589 
i would assume they could teleport out
of<00:02:42.159> here<00:02:42.370> if<00:02:42.549> you<00:02:42.579> were<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.849> stare<00:02:43.239> them<00:02:43.390> in<00:02:43.510> the

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
of here if you were to stare them in the

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.080 
of here if you were to stare them in the
eyes<00:02:43.870> I'm<00:02:44.680> not<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:45.040> hundred<00:02:45.190> percent<00:02:45.370> sure<00:02:45.700> and

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
eyes I'm not a hundred percent sure and

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.759 
eyes I'm not a hundred percent sure and
since<00:02:46.299> when<00:02:46.480> creative<00:02:46.900> mode<00:02:47.049> it's<00:02:47.230> even<00:02:47.470> less

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
since when creative mode it's even less

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.240 
since when creative mode it's even less
a<00:02:48.159> for<00:02:49.000> sure<00:02:49.180> thing<00:02:49.209> in<00:02:49.810> my<00:02:50.049> mind<00:02:50.230> but<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:51.099> know
