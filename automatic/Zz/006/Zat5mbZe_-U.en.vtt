so<00:02:11.260> we<00:02:11.410> didn't<00:02:11.620> think<00:02:11.770> he<00:02:11.890> would<00:02:12.010> play<00:02:12.220> that

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
so we didn't think he would play that

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.300 
so we didn't think he would play that
girl<00:02:12.730> across<00:02:12.910> but<00:02:13.480> I<00:02:13.840> just<00:02:14.320> think<00:02:14.410> that's<00:02:15.100> the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
girl across but I just think that's the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.950 
girl across but I just think that's the
ball<00:02:15.490> should<00:02:15.700> mirror<00:02:15.970> life<00:02:16.150> or<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.630> get<00:02:16.810> with

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
ball should mirror life or you get with

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:27.590 
ball should mirror life or you get with
your<00:02:17.110> knees<00:02:17.680> earning<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.220> right<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.430> play

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.970 

different<00:02:28.380> ways
