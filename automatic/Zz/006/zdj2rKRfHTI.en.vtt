00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
timeline and it sounds silly but I am a

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.899 
timeline and it sounds silly but I am a
visual<00:05:04.110> learner<00:05:04.320> and<00:05:04.740> this<00:05:04.889> works<00:05:05.130> all<00:05:05.520> you<00:05:05.760> do

visual learner and this works all you do
is<00:05:06.150> draw<00:05:06.510> out<00:05:06.720> a<00:05:06.750> timeline<00:05:07.320> and<00:05:07.560> write<00:05:07.770> all<00:05:08.039> the

dates for the subject in that timeline

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.589 
dates for the subject in that timeline
break<00:05:11.099> it<00:05:11.250> into<00:05:11.400> sections<00:05:11.729> and<00:05:12.180> memorize<00:05:12.449> it

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
break it into sections and memorize it

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.960 
break it into sections and memorize it
that<00:05:12.750> way<00:05:12.900> see<00:05:13.800> it<00:05:13.949> all<00:05:14.070> drawn<00:05:14.310> out<00:05:14.340> makes<00:05:14.849> it

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
that way see it all drawn out makes it

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.250 
that way see it all drawn out makes it
more<00:05:15.120> of<00:05:15.180> a<00:05:15.300> story<00:05:15.599> and<00:05:15.840> I<00:05:15.900> can<00:05:16.110> memorize
