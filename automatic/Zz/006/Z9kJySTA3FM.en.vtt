00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.130 

right<00:00:01.620> now<00:00:01.920> let's<00:00:02.580> talk<00:00:02.850> about<00:00:02.959> well<00:00:03.959> we'll

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
right now let's talk about well we'll

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.280 
right now let's talk about well we'll
briefly<00:00:04.410> look<00:00:04.650> at<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.799> pencil<00:00:05.299> it's<00:00:06.299> just<00:00:07.200> a

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
briefly look at the pencil it's just a

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.890 
briefly look at the pencil it's just a
drawing<00:00:07.500> tool<00:00:07.830> like<00:00:08.069> on<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.760> brush<00:00:09.000> but<00:00:09.750> it's

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
drawing tool like on the brush but it's

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.780 
drawing tool like on the brush but it's
the<00:00:10.440> difference<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.920> that<00:00:10.950> it's<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.370> single

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
the difference is that it's a single

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.410 
the difference is that it's a single
string<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.690> vector<00:00:13.410> points<00:00:13.769> rather<00:00:14.070> than<00:00:14.420> an

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
string of vector points rather than an

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.779 
string of vector points rather than an
area<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.410> vector<00:00:16.920> points<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.369> if<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.550> draw<00:00:17.609> the

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
area of vector points so if I draw the

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.960 
area of vector points so if I draw the
draw<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> brushstroke<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.670> then<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.699> draw<00:00:20.939> a

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
draw a brushstroke and then I draw a

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.410 
draw a brushstroke and then I draw a
pencil<00:00:21.449> stroke<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.250> we<00:00:23.250> select<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.180> with<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
pencil stroke and we select it with the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.740 
pencil stroke and we select it with the
contour<00:00:24.810> editor<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.769> can<00:00:25.830> see<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.750> the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
contour editor you can see that the the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.279 
contour editor you can see that the the
brushstroke<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.560> an<00:00:28.740> outline<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.160> points<00:00:29.699> and

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
brushstroke is an outline of points and

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.069 
brushstroke is an outline of points and
the<00:00:31.289> pencil<00:00:31.679> stroke<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.610> perimeter<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.510> I'm

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
the pencil stroke is a perimeter of I'm

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.220 
the pencil stroke is a perimeter of I'm
sream<00:00:36.110> is<00:00:37.110> just<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.469> string<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.860> points<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:39.270> yeah

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
sream is just a string of points so yeah

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.750 
sream is just a string of points so yeah
that's<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.590> main<00:00:40.770> difference<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.700> that

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
that's the main difference is just that

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.119 
that's the main difference is just that
it's<00:00:41.940> some<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.480> lot<00:00:42.809> cleaner<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.620> pencil<00:00:43.980> line

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
it's some a lot cleaner the pencil line

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.500 
it's some a lot cleaner the pencil line
but<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.059> very<00:00:45.210> consistent<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.170> if<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:47.510> this

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
but it's very consistent so if you this

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.060 
but it's very consistent so if you this
might<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.960> way<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.110> want<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.469> go<00:00:49.620> if<00:00:49.829> you

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
might be the way you want to go if you

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.360 
might be the way you want to go if you
choose<00:00:50.820> if<00:00:51.390> your<00:00:51.960> character<00:00:52.710> has<00:00:52.920> a

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
choose if your character has a

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.910 
choose if your character has a
consistent<00:00:54.090> outline<00:00:54.449> or<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.289> line<00:00:55.469> work<00:00:55.649> in

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
consistent outline or the line work in

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.680 
consistent outline or the line work in
your<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.550> your<00:00:56.610> movies<00:00:57.530> rum<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.859> very

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
your in your movies rum a very

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.859 
your in your movies rum a very
consistent<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:02.250> not<00:01:02.820> brushstroke<00:01:03.780> e<00:01:03.989> painty

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
consistent and not brushstroke e painty

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.980 
consistent and not brushstroke e painty
thick<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.049> thin<00:01:07.229> E<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.610> forth<00:01:09.140> in<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
thick and thin E and so forth in the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.899 
thick and thin E and so forth in the
pencil<00:01:12.990> options<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.890> course<00:01:14.220> we've<00:01:14.460> got<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
pencil options of course we've got the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.480 
pencil options of course we've got the
draw<00:01:15.180> behind<00:01:15.570> thing<00:01:15.960> as<00:01:16.140> well<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.979> i<00:01:17.009> can<00:01:17.310> draw

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
draw behind thing as well so i can draw

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.480 
draw behind thing as well so i can draw
that<00:01:17.930> click<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.080> draw<00:01:19.320> behind<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.220> i'm<00:01:20.369> going

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
that click on draw behind and i'm going

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.670 
that click on draw behind and i'm going
to<00:01:20.549> draw<00:01:20.640> behind<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.119> click<00:01:21.630> off<00:01:22.310> click<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:24.680> so

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
to draw behind it click off click on so

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.469 
to draw behind it click off click on so
and<00:01:25.979> then<00:01:26.130> there's<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.580> auto<00:01:26.759> flatten<00:01:27.330> as

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
and then there's the auto flatten as

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.300 
and then there's the auto flatten as
well<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.229> prefer<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.560> sketch<00:01:28.979> just

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
well so if you prefer to sketch just

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.940 
well so if you prefer to sketch just
like<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.670> brush<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.470> brush<00:01:31.680> thing

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
like in the brush and the brush thing

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:40.069 
like in the brush and the brush thing
you<00:01:32.159> can<00:01:32.340> order<00:01:32.520> flatten<00:01:34.939> your<00:01:35.939> strokes<00:01:39.079> hey

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
you can order flatten your strokes hey

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.999 
you can order flatten your strokes hey
what's<00:01:40.350> going<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.680> there<00:01:40.860> that's<00:01:41.159> not<00:01:41.340> working

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
what's going on there that's not working

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.469 
what's going on there that's not working
there<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.100> fix<00:01:44.340> that

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
there to fix that

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.300 
there to fix that
auto<00:01:47.479> flattened<00:01:50.979> shouldn't<00:01:51.979> it<00:01:52.010> be<00:01:52.070> auto

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
auto flattened shouldn't it be auto

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.200 
auto flattened shouldn't it be auto
flattening<00:01:52.850> it<00:01:53.229> should<00:01:54.229> be<00:01:54.550> anyway<00:01:55.550> that's

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
flattening it should be anyway that's

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.200 
flattening it should be anyway that's
not<00:01:56.450> dwell<00:01:56.810> on<00:01:56.840> that<00:01:57.550> I'm<00:01:58.550> not<00:01:58.790> sure<00:01:58.850> what<00:01:59.180> that

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
not dwell on that I'm not sure what that

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.690 
not dwell on that I'm not sure what that
it<00:01:59.420> are<00:01:59.600> auto<00:01:59.840> close<00:02:00.140> gap<00:02:00.470> so<00:02:00.740> I<00:02:00.950> will<00:02:01.550> talk

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
it are auto close gap so I will talk

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.580 
it are auto close gap so I will talk
about<00:02:01.850> gap<00:02:02.150> closing<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:02.690> stuff<00:02:02.900> at<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.380> later

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
about gap closing and stuff at a later

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.840 
about gap closing and stuff at a later
point<00:02:04.210> right<00:02:05.210> moving<00:02:06.200> on<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:07.190> pencil<00:02:07.610> tool<00:02:07.729> is

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
point right moving on the pencil tool is

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.090 
point right moving on the pencil tool is
pretty<00:02:08.060> straightforward<00:02:08.330> it<00:02:09.080> also<00:02:09.259> can<00:02:09.709> be<00:02:09.740> if

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
pretty straightforward it also can be if

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.380 
pretty straightforward it also can be if
it's<00:02:10.250> use<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.399> pencil<00:02:10.640> tool<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:11.090> can<00:02:11.209> also

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
it's use a pencil tool you can also

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.290 
it's use a pencil tool you can also
adjust<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.230> width<00:02:12.560> thickness<00:02:13.310> by<00:02:13.760> holding

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
adjust the width thickness by holding

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.090 
adjust the width thickness by holding
down<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:17.300> 0<00:02:17.330> key<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.140> just<00:02:18.530> dragging<00:02:18.920> and

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
down the the 0 key and just dragging and

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.290 
down the the 0 key and just dragging and
you<00:02:20.000> can<00:02:20.480> save<00:02:21.280> your<00:02:22.280> own<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:23.000> can<00:02:23.120> add

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
you can save your own you can add

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.750 
you can save your own you can add
brushes<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:23.930> delete<00:02:24.350> brushes<00:02:24.739> and<00:02:25.100> rename

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
brushes and delete brushes and rename

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.790 
brushes and delete brushes and rename
them<00:02:25.910> moving<00:02:26.720> on<00:02:27.019> to<00:02:27.410> one<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:29.050> we've<00:02:30.050> been

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
them moving on to one that we've been

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.180 
this was an in previous version of anime
and<00:02:36.489> I'm<00:02:37.489> very<00:02:37.730> glad<00:02:37.970> we<00:02:38.360> now<00:02:38.600> have<00:02:38.959> it<00:02:39.130> it<00:02:40.130> just

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
and I'm very glad we now have it it just

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.600 
and I'm very glad we now have it it just
allows<00:02:40.610> you<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.910> type<00:02:41.090> stuff<00:02:41.450> which<00:02:41.989> is<00:02:42.739> very

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
allows you to type stuff which is very

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.759 
allows you to type stuff which is very
important<00:02:44.300> for<00:02:47.110> for<00:02:48.110> those<00:02:48.230> of<00:02:48.380> us<00:02:48.440> who<00:02:48.590> make

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
important for for those of us who make

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.910 
important for for those of us who make
movies<00:02:49.160> because<00:02:49.550> you<00:02:49.760> know<00:02:49.880> not<00:02:50.090> only<00:02:50.739> text<00:02:51.739> in

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
movies because you know not only text in

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.340 
movies because you know not only text in
the<00:02:52.130> movie<00:02:52.459> for<00:02:52.790> like<00:02:53.180> logos<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.079> street

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
the movie for like logos and street

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.319 
the movie for like logos and street
signs<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:55.010> book<00:02:55.220> titles<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:55.970> things<00:02:56.209> like

signs and book titles and things like

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.650 
signs and book titles and things like
that<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:56.630> you<00:02:56.780> see<00:02:56.989> in<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.320> movie<00:02:57.620> every<00:02:57.860> day

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
that that you see in the movie every day

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.199 
that that you see in the movie every day
because<00:02:59.660> we<00:02:59.810> are<00:02:59.930> surrounded<00:03:00.260> by<00:03:00.500> text<00:03:01.209> but

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
because we are surrounded by text but

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.630 
because we are surrounded by text but
also<00:03:02.239> for<00:03:02.720> titles<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:03.170> credits<00:03:03.400> which<00:03:04.400> is<00:03:04.610> a

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
also for titles and credits which is a

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.060 
also for titles and credits which is a
very<00:03:05.420> important<00:03:06.019> we<00:03:06.200> need<00:03:06.230> we<00:03:06.620> want<00:03:06.799> people<00:03:06.950> to

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
very important we need we want people to

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.949 
very important we need we want people to
know<00:03:07.280> who<00:03:07.489> made<00:03:07.700> this<00:03:07.850> movie<00:03:08.209> so<00:03:08.420> titles<00:03:08.810> and

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
know who made this movie so titles and

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.199 
know who made this movie so titles and
credits<00:03:09.079> are<00:03:09.440> something<00:03:09.829> that<00:03:10.010> can<00:03:10.820> be<00:03:10.850> quite

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
credits are something that can be quite

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.590 
credits are something that can be quite
tedious<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.989> hand-draw<00:03:12.579> or<00:03:13.579> import<00:03:14.209> from<00:03:14.450> a

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
tedious to hand-draw or import from a

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.050 
tedious to hand-draw or import from a
different<00:03:15.190> from<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.310> from<00:03:16.610> another<00:03:16.790> program

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
different from it from another program

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.670 
different from it from another program
which<00:03:17.450> is<00:03:17.600> what<00:03:17.750> we've<00:03:17.870> done<00:03:18.019> in<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.200> past<00:03:18.350> so

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
which is what we've done in the past so

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.240 
which is what we've done in the past so
it's<00:03:19.280> good<00:03:19.549> to<00:03:19.579> see<00:03:19.850> that<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:22.010> we<00:03:22.100> have<00:03:22.220> a

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
it's good to see that that we have a

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.809 
it's good to see that that we have a
text<00:03:22.579> tool<00:03:22.730> now<00:03:22.970> so

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.790 

so<00:03:29.819> now<00:03:30.060> when<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.480> select<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:31.050> it<00:03:31.319> selects<00:03:31.650> it

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
so now when I select that it selects it

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.220 
so now when I select that it selects it
as<00:03:31.920> one<00:03:32.129> object<00:03:32.690> now<00:03:33.690> one<00:03:33.870> thing<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:34.080> I

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
as one object now one thing that I

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.720 
as one object now one thing that I
haven't<00:03:34.410> actually<00:03:34.620> tested<00:03:35.040> yet<00:03:35.430> I'm<00:03:35.610> just

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
haven't actually tested yet I'm just

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:43.880 
haven't actually tested yet I'm just
going<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:39.440> make<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.590> bigger<00:03:41.629> let's<00:03:42.629> go<00:03:42.840> 40<00:03:43.470> no

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
going to make it bigger let's go 40 no

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.740 
going to make it bigger let's go 40 no
let's<00:03:44.370> go<00:03:44.550> 60<00:03:45.620> that<00:03:46.620> hasn't<00:03:46.980> done<00:03:47.130> it<00:03:47.250> so<00:03:47.819> once

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
all the options and things we have to

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.200 
all the options and things we have to
play<00:05:38.460> with<00:05:40.070> I'm<00:05:41.070> sure<00:05:41.340> if<00:05:41.669> there<00:05:41.940> isn't

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
play with I'm sure if there isn't

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.060 
play with I'm sure if there isn't
already<00:05:42.330> there<00:05:43.020> will<00:05:43.229> be<00:05:43.349> a<00:05:43.380> way<00:05:43.620> that<00:05:43.650> we<00:05:43.860> can

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
already there will be a way that we can

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.909 
already there will be a way that we can
break<00:05:44.280> that<00:05:44.430> text<00:05:44.849> up<00:05:45.000> into<00:05:45.419> playing<00:05:46.380> artwork

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
break that text up into playing artwork

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.870 
break that text up into playing artwork
so<00:05:47.460> that<00:05:47.610> it<00:05:47.729> can<00:05:47.909> be<00:05:48.030> manipulated<00:05:48.720> painted

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
so that it can be manipulated painted

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.920 
so that it can be manipulated painted

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
touches on to the the characters just to

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.110 
touches on to the the characters just to
make<00:06:05.880> it<00:06:05.909> look<00:06:06.440> not<00:06:07.440> too<00:06:07.710> much<00:06:07.890> like<00:06:08.250> a<00:06:08.280> font

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
make it look not too much like a font

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.760 
make it look not too much like a font
that<00:06:10.219> that<00:06:11.219> I've<00:06:11.340> just<00:06:11.520> ripped<00:06:11.909> off<00:06:12.090> the<00:06:12.240> web

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
that that I've just ripped off the web

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.640 
that that I've just ripped off the web
right<00:06:13.770> so<00:06:14.180> there's<00:06:15.180> the<00:06:15.750> pencil<00:06:16.080> on<00:06:16.229> the<00:06:16.349> text

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
right so there's the pencil on the text

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.339 
right so there's the pencil on the text
tool<00:06:16.830> and<00:06:17.510> the<00:06:18.510> eraser<00:06:18.780> is<00:06:19.080> pretty

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:19.349 
tool and the eraser is pretty

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:22.190 
tool and the eraser is pretty
straightforward<00:06:19.590> so<00:06:20.219> the<00:06:20.550> next<00:06:20.700> one<00:06:21.200> will

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
straightforward so the next one will

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.170 
straightforward so the next one will
will<00:06:22.740> the<00:06:23.010> next<00:06:23.099> video<00:06:23.460> we'll<00:06:23.700> just<00:06:23.880> look<00:06:24.000> at

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
will the next video we'll just look at

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.320 
will the next video we'll just look at
the<00:06:24.330> paint<00:06:24.780> bucket<00:06:24.930> and<00:06:25.289> perhaps<00:06:26.219> the<00:06:27.120> paint

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
the paint bucket and perhaps the paint

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.089 
the paint bucket and perhaps the paint
bucket<00:06:27.450> has<00:06:27.690> a<00:06:27.719> few<00:06:28.020> options<00:06:28.409> that<00:06:28.740> I'd<00:06:28.919> like

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:29.099 
bucket has a few options that I'd like

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:31.070 
bucket has a few options that I'd like
to<00:06:29.250> cover<00:06:29.460> so<00:06:29.729> maybe<00:06:29.940> that'll<00:06:30.180> be<00:06:30.360> the

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
to cover so maybe that'll be the

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.690 
to cover so maybe that'll be the
entirety<00:06:31.710> of<00:06:31.740> the<00:06:31.979> next<00:06:32.280> video<00:06:32.820> see<00:06:33.390> you<00:06:33.510> then
