places for insects and diseases so I

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.329 
places for insects and diseases so I
pick<00:00:47.690> it<00:00:47.809> up<00:00:47.930> because<00:00:48.110> I<00:00:48.260> have<00:00:48.620> places<00:00:48.890> to<00:00:49.070> put

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
pick it up because I have places to put

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:50.860

it but you may be in a community that
won't<00:00:51.260> let<00:00:51.530> you<00:00:51.769> pick<00:00:52.339> it<00:00:52.489> up<00:00:52.610> because<00:00:52.760> they

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
won't let you pick it up because they

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
may pick it up so what do you do then

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.500 
may pick it up so what do you do then
well<00:00:55.250> you<00:00:55.400> still<00:00:55.610> pick<00:00:55.790> up<00:00:55.909> enough<00:00:56.210> to<00:00:56.329> use<00:00:56.480> as

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
well you still pick up enough to use as

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.170 
well you still pick up enough to use as
mulch<00:00:57.019> and<00:00:57.260> then<00:00:57.440> compost<00:00:57.920> piles<00:00:58.280> but<00:00:59.090> if

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
mulch and then compost piles but if

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.549 
mulch and then compost piles but if
you're<00:00:59.300> going<00:00:59.420> to<00:00:59.480> leave<00:00:59.719> it<00:00:59.870> lay<00:01:00.020> there<00:01:00.320> then

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
you're going to leave it lay there then

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.380 
you're going to leave it lay there then
you<00:01:00.680> have<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:01.100> help<00:01:01.280> it<00:01:01.460> to<00:01:01.640> break<00:01:01.879> down<00:01:02.120> the

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
you have to help it to break down the

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.090 
you have to help it to break down the
only<00:01:02.629> way<00:01:02.750> you<00:01:02.840> can<00:01:02.960> break<00:01:03.199> it<00:01:03.230> down<00:01:03.559> is<00:01:04.039> to

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
only way you can break it down is to

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.950 
only way you can break it down is to
give<00:01:04.489> it<00:01:04.580> something<00:01:04.820> that<00:01:04.970> will<00:01:05.210> decompose<00:01:05.690> it

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
give it something that will decompose it

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.080 
give it something that will decompose it
and<00:01:06.050> that's<00:01:06.170> something<00:01:06.500> is<00:01:06.800> simply<00:01:07.190> to<00:01:07.880> mix

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
and that's something is simply to mix

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.290 
and that's something is simply to mix
together<00:01:08.330> a<00:01:08.840> can<00:01:09.530> of<00:01:09.649> ordinary<00:01:09.979> Cola<00:01:10.300> remember
