00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
looks dorky but it works

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.149 
looks dorky but it works
my<00:01:13.119> hands<00:01:13.390> are<00:01:13.479> still<00:01:13.720> cold<00:01:13.890> because<00:01:14.890> it's

my hands are still cold because it's

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.789 
my hands are still cold because it's
cold<00:01:15.400> outside<00:01:15.580> and<00:01:16.150> I<00:01:16.869> can<00:01:17.170> still<00:01:17.409> feel<00:01:17.590> the

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
cold outside and I can still feel the

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.590 
cold outside and I can still feel the
wind<00:01:18.040> but<00:01:18.369> it's<00:01:18.549> not

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
wind but it's not

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.640 
wind but it's not
not<00:01:21.170> as<00:01:21.320> bad<00:01:21.500> as<00:01:21.530> normal<00:01:22.100> that's<00:01:22.580> for<00:01:22.850> sure

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
not as bad as normal that's for sure

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:32.130 
not as bad as normal that's for sure
this<00:01:24.650> is<00:01:24.830> nice<00:01:25.040> huh<00:01:25.759> you<00:01:26.540> guys<00:01:26.750> liking<00:01:27.049> this

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.020 

I<00:01:32.200> was<00:01:32.979> afraid<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.370> wind<00:01:33.550> was<00:01:33.700> going<00:01:33.820> to<00:01:33.880> come

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
I was afraid the wind was going to come

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.730 
I was afraid the wind was going to come
over<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.330> top<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:34.750> get<00:01:34.870> the<00:01:34.960> top<00:01:35.170> of<00:01:35.350> my<00:01:35.470> hand

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
over the top and get the top of my hand

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.120 
over the top and get the top of my hand
so<00:01:36.670> i'm<00:01:37.240> using<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.990> zip<00:01:38.170> ties<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.560> angle<00:01:38.860> it<00:01:38.950> up

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
so i'm using the zip ties to angle it up

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.430 
so i'm using the zip ties to angle it up
quite<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:39.790> bit<00:01:40.030> and<00:01:40.750> I'm<00:01:40.930> realizing<00:01:41.200> now

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
quite a bit and I'm realizing now

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.130 
quite a bit and I'm realizing now
actually<00:01:42.250> what<00:01:42.400> I<00:01:42.430> needed<00:01:42.729> was<00:01:43.240> underneath<00:01:43.840> is

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
actually what I needed was underneath is

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.270 
actually what I needed was underneath is
where<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.380> wind<00:01:44.560> comes<00:01:44.680> from

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.830 

of<00:01:47.700> course<00:01:47.909> maybe<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.240> would<00:01:48.330> have<00:01:48.450> come<00:01:48.630> from

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
of course maybe it would have come from

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.350 
of course maybe it would have come from
under<00:01:49.020> come<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.470> top<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:50.040> had<00:01:50.549> mangled<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.150> so

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
under come on top I had mangled it up so

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.500 
under come on top I had mangled it up so
much

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
much

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:01.670 
much
but<00:01:53.110> they're<00:01:53.230> not<00:01:53.380> moving<00:01:53.530> in<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:53.890> wind

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680
