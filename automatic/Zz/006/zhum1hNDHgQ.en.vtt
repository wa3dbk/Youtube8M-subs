natural<00:01:53.270> spray<00:01:54.270> tan<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.880> anyway<00:01:57.210> she<00:01:57.329> went

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
natural spray tan and so anyway she went

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.730 
natural spray tan and so anyway she went
to<00:01:57.540> avenge<00:01:57.780> she<00:01:57.990> got<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> spray<00:01:58.350> tan<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.530> was<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
to avenge she got a spray tan I was the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.219 
to avenge she got a spray tan I was the
first<00:01:58.920> time<00:01:59.070> she's<00:01:59.340> done<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.060> then<00:02:00.509> she

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
first time she's done this and then she

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.139 
first time she's done this and then she
found<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.310> had<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.640> unexpected

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
found that it just had this unexpected

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.050 
found that it just had this unexpected
benefit<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.110> guess<00:02:04.500> she<00:02:04.799> had<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.969> know

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
benefit that I guess she had you know

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.819 
benefit that I guess she had you know
she<00:02:06.210> was<00:02:06.450> unlike<00:02:06.719> many<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.079> us<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.500> habit

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
she was unlike many of us in the habit

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.359 
she was unlike many of us in the habit
of<00:02:08.009> obsessing<00:02:08.729> over<00:02:08.849> her<00:02:09.149> skin

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
of obsessing over her skin

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.700 
of obsessing over her skin
so<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:11.300> know<00:02:11.390> staring<00:02:11.930> in<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.050> mirror<00:02:12.140> and

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
so you know staring in the mirror and

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.110 
so you know staring in the mirror and
picking<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.130> imperfection<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:13.880> was<00:02:14.060> a

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
picking it imperfection it was a
