00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.700
 do not 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.150
 I have transformed this old cellar into a 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.360
 secret lab to demonstrate to the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.450
 world that I am the best scientist of 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.099
 all the times with my invention 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.769
 the man will travel at speeds 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.679
 unimaginable the unsuccessful many times 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.869
 so this network can not fail 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:27.599
 good morning teacher thank you for having 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.120
 activated the furius baco system I am a 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.060
 your service today is the big day 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.340
 everything is ready the system has elaborated 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.080
 the calculations the accelerator tension 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.240
 has been adapted to the required force 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.950
 today on the launch pad for 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.880
 check that everything is in place and 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.880
 good teacher 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.010
 let's see one last simulation as you wish 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.420
 teacher 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.610
 excellent and now let's focus on the 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.010
 passengers the volunteers are ready 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.020
 you have performed all the analyzes by 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.850
 supposed teacher we have made a 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.110
 very meticulous selection and we have only 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.270
 chosen the best 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.370
 the strength of the furius baco is very intense 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.110
 and not all candidates met 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.550
 the suitability characteristics do not 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.310
 teach the results the test 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.170
 satisfied the process if some passengers 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.770
 very brave are about to reach 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.780
 a historical feat I'm going to 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.210
 elaborate the parameters of the experiment 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.210
 strength and acceleration target of 0 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.369
 135 kilometers per hour in 3 seconds 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.220
 trajectory and radius of curvature in mode 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:39.100
 automatic the system is ready the 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.479
 attraction is at the maximum output level in 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.850
 5 seconds 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.780
 good luck teacher good luck 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.780
 furius baco 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.720
 speed reached in 135 km in 3 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.450
 seconds 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.030
 the experiment has been a successful teacher 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.490
 I'm receiving the data all are 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.710
 in excellent conditions the passengers 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:51.910
 they are extraordinary we have achieved 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.980
 we have achieved it with people like 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.490
 this tool we have got our 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.160
 objective a long time professor if 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.720
 let's bring our parameters to the limit 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.120
 they think we would find others 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:10.470
 volunteers yes I think so 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.470
 enjoy dad dad
