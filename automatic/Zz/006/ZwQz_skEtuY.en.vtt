you see in the very back and I wasn't
happy<00:00:40.629> with<00:00:40.780> them<00:00:40.930> because<00:00:40.960> they<00:00:41.410> more<00:00:41.710> or

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
when you're landscaping you really need

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.509 
when you're landscaping you really need
to<00:00:49.210> break<00:00:49.420> away<00:00:49.570> from<00:00:49.750> that<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:51.160> we've<00:00:51.340> had<00:00:51.460> a

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
to break away from that so we've had a

00:00:51.519 --> 00:01:01.689 
to break away from that so we've had a
lot<00:00:51.790> of<00:00:51.820> curbs<00:00:55.949> as<00:00:56.949> you<00:00:57.160> can<00:00:57.340> see

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
and it continues down the sidewalk which

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:04.780 
and it continues down the sidewalk which
you<00:01:03.980> probably<00:01:04.129> can't<00:01:04.400> see<00:01:04.580> from<00:01:04.699> here

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:10.249 

the<00:02:03.729> whole<00:02:03.969> line

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.229 

and<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:11.009> just<00:02:11.250> basically<00:02:11.430> gives<00:02:12.120> you
