00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
rules based on the fact that we only can

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.540 
rules based on the fact that we only can
use<00:03:33.370> a<00:03:33.550> white<00:03:34.540> grape<00:03:34.959> like<00:03:35.650> Chardonnay<00:03:36.160> and

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
other two production so in this case we

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.720 
other two production so in this case we
have<00:03:45.160> a<00:03:45.480> lower<00:03:46.480> quantity<00:03:47.050> of<00:03:47.700> carbon<00:03:48.700> dioxide

more delicate this line we could say is

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.330 
more delicate this line we could say is
