00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.150
 round because it affects optically they look more basic and that 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.730
 also 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.639
 they will be so small subjects of everything everything for example we are going to use lines 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:11.910
 horizontal in the part of the race 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.410
 as well as cuts either for example the newspaper pillbox interest the subject in 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.080
 this evening of aquino yes 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.130
 We will not use it because it is marking a horizontal line 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.730
 we protest 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.740
 to which we are deceiving that it is still broader what really 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.550
 we have 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.369
 We will not use or in my bag 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.250
 no ornaments those sophisticated for the holidays for example when we go to 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.370
 some night of gala we take some dolls around here there are things we got 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.210
 we will accept because otherwise we are increasing volume in these areas what 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.880
 that we are going to use we are going to use enveloping bullets 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.819
 the rocket tipped listed soda 

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:50.259
 of the soft ones like the case of the rigid ones like low like india with 

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:53.289
 pavers to emphasize the waist because usually this type of 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.539
 figure the one of mus the redonditos also care ladies with the trousers to the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.530
 time they get them not very tight when the thighs or not those 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.360
 You should not put your pants too tight otherwise you have to 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.240
 use some folds Suarez do not stiffen them because that makes us so 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.870
 intense and so sensibly 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.780
 the care with the prints also in this case we are going to try not to 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.130
 use prints 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.480
 because they increase the volume both in the race and in the taste aha 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.710
 then in this list of figures and it was done 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.560
 let's go to the next figure that is the la the oac the round one could be 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.240
 tell 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.060
 this type of figure st usually this career waist the bust redondito 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.350
 the waist is not defined is for people who are totally filled 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.950
 clinics 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.270
 here, then, we are not going to use, for example, shiny or untidy fabrics 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.079
 because that also increases the volume and we also want to know 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.009
 what it is and how it is being used right now because they wanted it is tuned 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.560
 All that increases the volume a lot 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.950
 do not use belts if we do not have a well-defined waist 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.540
 In this case, what we are going to do is also lengthen the figure by 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.569
 of very relaxed long jackets that do not reach the race because also 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.170
 We have a hidden hip so they go from the hip down 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.280
 because it is very very this of very many fabrics with a lot of fluidity 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.719
 so thin that in that they are not present do not increase the volume 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:24.609
 crime very cool three principles then this one kind of figure let's go 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:29.180
 to deal with everything that is vertical that you leave us oryzae is going to 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.169
 lengthen the figure that is our objective to take the accounts forward 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:34.940
 But do not worry about everything, mark us and make cuts 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.650
 whether with neck sande of course not used or part rooms 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.679
 By the neck 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:43.369
 and everything that goes perfectly vertical ticket pérez and if we do not want to commit 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:47.019
 viper for the next epa - trawlers that almost did not finish the 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.209
 time but we hope that in the file these figures are the 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.749
 keys of thanks to that they went in atenas next week gilberto hernández
