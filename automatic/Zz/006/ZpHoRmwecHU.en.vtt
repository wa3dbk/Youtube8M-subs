00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
control well carpenter ants come in all

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.440 
control well carpenter ants come in all
different<00:00:10.410> sizes<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.160> shapes<00:00:11.219> but<00:00:12.030> basically

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
different sizes and shapes but basically

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.049 
different sizes and shapes but basically
they're<00:00:12.750> all<00:00:12.870> in<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.920> same<00:00:13.950> category<00:00:14.730> and

they're all in the same category and

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.390 
they're all in the same category and
everybody<00:00:15.929> thinks<00:00:16.139> they<00:00:16.529> eat<00:00:16.710> wood<00:00:16.980> well

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
everybody thinks they eat wood well

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.240 
everybody thinks they eat wood well
that's<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.270> big<00:00:18.480> misconception<00:00:19.260> they<00:00:19.710> live<00:00:20.010> in

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
that's a big misconception they live in

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.340 
that's a big misconception they live in
wood<00:00:20.490> they<00:00:21.180> burrow<00:00:21.449> into<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.810> wood<00:00:22.050> and

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
wood they burrow into the wood and

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.170 
wood they burrow into the wood and
create<00:00:23.220> their<00:00:23.369> home<00:00:23.519> they're<00:00:23.850> actually

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
create their home they're actually

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.420 
create their home they're actually
protein<00:00:24.570> eaters<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.740> how<00:00:25.890> do<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.070> kill<00:00:26.279> them

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
protein eaters so how do you kill them

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.189 
protein eaters so how do you kill them
well<00:00:26.730> you're<00:00:27.060> going<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.210> need<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.720> protein

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
well you're going to need a protein

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.169 
well you're going to need a protein
based<00:00:28.529> bait<00:00:29.070> if<00:00:29.340> you're<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.670> try<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> bait

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
based bait if you're going to try a bait

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.540 
based bait if you're going to try a bait
now<00:00:30.900> I've<00:00:31.080> found<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.740> there<00:00:31.980> they're<00:00:32.250> really

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
now I've found it there they're really

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.840 
now I've found it there they're really
adverse<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.210> baits<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:34.410> know<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.160> might<00:00:35.579> get

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
adverse to baits you know you might get

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.630 
adverse to baits you know you might get
one<00:00:36.840> type<00:00:37.079> that'll<00:00:37.410> take<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.649> bait<00:00:37.980> but<00:00:38.250> more

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
one type that'll take the bait but more

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.250 
one type that'll take the bait but more
often<00:00:38.879> than<00:00:39.149> not<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.329> doesn't<00:00:39.840> wipe<00:00:39.960> out<00:00:40.140> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
often than not that doesn't wipe out the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.819 
often than not that doesn't wipe out the
colony<00:00:40.700> so<00:00:41.700> what<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:41.969> do<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.899> use<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.379> couple<00:00:43.770> of

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
colony so what I do is I use a couple of

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.700 
colony so what I do is I use a couple of
different<00:00:44.160> sprays<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.969> dusts<00:00:45.510> okay<00:00:46.289> if<00:00:46.530> you

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
different sprays and dusts okay if you

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.700 
different sprays and dusts okay if you
can<00:00:46.860> find<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.520> trail<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.390> them<00:00:48.600> that's<00:00:49.140> perfect

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
can find a trail of them that's perfect

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.470 
can find a trail of them that's perfect
you<00:00:50.039> got<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.219> trail<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.030> dust<00:00:51.239> that

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
you got a trail and you can dust that

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.700 
you got a trail and you can dust that
trail<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.930> they're<00:00:52.020> traipsing<00:00:52.469> through<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
trail and they're traipsing through the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.979 
trail and they're traipsing through the
trail<00:00:52.949> ants<00:00:53.370> are<00:00:54.059> constantly<00:00:54.690> cleaning

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
trail ants are constantly cleaning

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.750 
trail ants are constantly cleaning
themselves<00:00:55.530> if<00:00:55.800> they<00:00:55.949> get<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.280> dust<00:00:56.550> on

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
themselves if they get that dust on

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.520 
themselves if they get that dust on
their<00:00:56.910> antennas<00:00:57.390> which<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:57.930> another<00:00:58.199> set

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
their antennas which is like another set

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.439 
their antennas which is like another set
of<00:00:58.620> eyes<00:00:58.739> they're<00:00:59.609> going<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.820> be<00:00:59.910> constantly

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
of eyes they're going to be constantly

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.910 
of eyes they're going to be constantly
cleaning<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.079> they<00:01:01.140> get<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.469> dust<00:01:01.710> in

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
cleaning that and they get that dust in

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.429 
cleaning that and they get that dust in
their<00:01:02.280> system<00:01:02.760> now<00:01:03.449> there's<00:01:03.629> some<00:01:03.750> safe<00:01:03.989> dusts

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
their system now there's some safe dusts

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.200 
their system now there's some safe dusts
you<00:01:04.650> can<00:01:04.799> use<00:01:04.920> botanically<00:01:05.580> based<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:06.180> can

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
you can use botanically based you can

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.600 
you can use botanically based you can
use<00:01:06.450> mineral<00:01:06.720> based<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.500> boric<00:01:07.950> acid<00:01:08.100> and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
use mineral based like boric acid and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.460 
use mineral based like boric acid and
that<00:01:09.240> all<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.420> those<00:01:09.689> work<00:01:09.869> really<00:01:09.900> really

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
that all of those work really really

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.500 
that all of those work really really
well<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.860> fact<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.549> lot<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.939> baits<00:01:12.180> have

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
well in fact a lot of the baits have

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.440 
well in fact a lot of the baits have
boric<00:01:13.020> acid<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.560> them<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:14.820> other<00:01:14.939> thing<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.240> use

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
boric acid in them the other thing I use

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.740 
boric acid in them the other thing I use
is<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> synthetic<00:01:16.380> outside<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.340> house<00:01:17.750> any

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
is a synthetic outside of the house any

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.630 
is a synthetic outside of the house any
termiticide<00:01:19.229> actually<00:01:20.070> will<00:01:20.220> work<00:01:20.430> really

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
termiticide actually will work really

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.300 
termiticide actually will work really
good<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.150> ants<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.590> make<00:01:22.710> sure<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:23.100> you

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
good on ants so just make sure that you

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.310 
good on ants so just make sure that you
read<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.000> label<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.630> follow<00:01:24.900> all<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
read the label and you follow all the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.160 
read the label and you follow all the
safety<00:01:25.530> practices<00:01:26.479> carpenter<00:01:27.479> ants<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:28.110> of

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
safety practices carpenter ants one of

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.569 
safety practices carpenter ants one of
the<00:01:28.229> best<00:01:28.409> ways<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.619> take<00:01:28.979> care<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.250> them<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.490> to

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
the best ways to take care of them is to

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.280 
the best ways to take care of them is to
spray<00:01:29.880> up<00:01:30.030> underneath<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.479> eaves<00:01:30.659> they<00:01:31.170> have

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
spray up underneath the eaves they have

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.719 
spray up underneath the eaves they have
a<00:01:31.350> tendency<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.740> coming<00:01:32.100> up<00:01:32.250> getting<00:01:32.579> in

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
a tendency of coming up getting in

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.940 
a tendency of coming up getting in
through<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.150> Attic<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.600> back<00:01:33.750> down<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.200> then

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
any places where they can get in you

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.469 
any places where they can get in you
want<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.990> seal<00:01:37.200> those<00:01:37.380> up<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.850> multi-pronged

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
want to seal those up so a multi-pronged
