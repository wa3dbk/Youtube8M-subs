00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
problems but this was really bad during

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.540 
problems but this was really bad during
playing<00:00:58.320> games<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> deal-breaker<00:00:59.430> for

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
playing games and the deal-breaker for

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.340 
playing games and the deal-breaker for
me<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.270> got<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.449> second<00:01:00.840> one<00:01:00.899> which<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.079> why<00:01:01.320> I

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
me so I got a second one which is why I

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.319 
me so I got a second one which is why I
have<00:01:01.680> two<00:01:01.980> here<00:01:02.250> because<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.879> thought<00:01:03.000> maybe<00:01:03.210> it

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
have two here because I thought maybe it

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.549 
have two here because I thought maybe it
was<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.570> problem<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> one<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.229> had

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
and it's the same issue on both so I'll

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.950 
and it's the same issue on both so I'll
show<00:01:08.310> them<00:01:08.400> side<00:01:08.640> by<00:01:08.670> side<00:01:08.790> they<00:01:09.659> are<00:01:09.689> hooked

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
setting causes it to be really bad

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.830 
setting causes it to be really bad
that's<00:03:07.350> this<00:03:07.590> game-mode<00:03:08.040> right<00:03:08.640> here<00:03:08.940> I'll

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
that's this game-mode right here I'll

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.460 
that's this game-mode right here I'll
disable<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.560> game<00:03:10.770> mode<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.880> it<00:03:12.840> also<00:03:12.990> seems

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
disable the game mode and it also seems

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.170 
disable the game mode and it also seems
to<00:03:13.590> have<00:03:13.770> to<00:03:13.890> do<00:03:14.010> with<00:03:14.130> being<00:03:14.280> in<00:03:14.430> 1440p

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.930 
to have to do with being in 1440p
resolution<00:03:15.660> as<00:03:16.290> well<00:03:16.370> so<00:03:17.370> when<00:03:17.520> I<00:03:17.550> turn<00:03:17.790> the

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
resolution as well so when I turn the

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:31.970 
resolution as well so when I turn the
game<00:03:18.210> mode<00:03:18.510> off<00:03:19.430> it's<00:03:20.430> not<00:03:22.190> nearly<00:03:23.190> as<00:03:26.090> bad<00:03:30.980> but

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
game mode off it's not nearly as bad but

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.070 
game mode off it's not nearly as bad but
it<00:03:32.250> will<00:03:32.490> occur<00:03:35.240> let's<00:03:36.240> see<00:03:36.390> if<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.570> can<00:03:36.750> make<00:03:36.930> it

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
it will occur let's see if I can make it

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:48.790 
it will occur let's see if I can make it
happen<00:03:37.230> again<00:03:37.530> on<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.070> left<00:03:38.310> one

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.230 

not<00:03:49.800> noticing<00:03:50.280> right<00:03:50.430> now<00:03:50.640> but<00:03:50.880> it<00:03:51.060> will

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
not noticing right now but it will

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:58.040 
not noticing right now but it will
happen<00:03:53.390> also<00:03:54.390> going<00:03:54.960> into<00:03:55.140> 1080p<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:57.050> game

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
happen also going into 1080p and game

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.900 
happen also going into 1080p and game
mode<00:03:58.260> off<00:03:58.410> seems<00:03:58.770> to<00:03:58.890> resolve<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.310> completely

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
mode off seems to resolve it completely

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.830 
mode off seems to resolve it completely
I<00:03:59.940> haven't<00:04:00.420> noticed<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:01.020> doing<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.350> at<00:04:01.470> all<00:04:01.560> but

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
I haven't noticed it doing it at all but

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.350 
I haven't noticed it doing it at all but
1440p<00:04:03.980> with<00:04:04.980> game<00:04:05.280> mode<00:04:05.490> off<00:04:05.640> it<00:04:05.910> will<00:04:06.060> still

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
1440p with game mode off it will still

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.310 
1440p with game mode off it will still
occur<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.020> also<00:04:07.740> 1080p<00:04:08.670> with<00:04:09.660> game<00:04:09.900> mode<00:04:10.110> on

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
occur and also 1080p with game mode on

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:17.420 
occur and also 1080p with game mode on
it<00:04:10.950> will<00:04:11.940> also<00:04:12.060> occur<00:04:15.950> not<00:04:16.950> seeing<00:04:17.310> any

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
it will also occur not seeing any

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.940 
it will also occur not seeing any
problems<00:04:17.910> on<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.180> left<00:04:18.360> right<00:04:18.600> now<00:04:18.660> but<00:04:19.200> like

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
problems on the left right now but like

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.010 
problems on the left right now but like
I<00:04:20.040> said<00:04:20.250> it<00:04:20.370> does<00:04:20.580> still<00:04:20.910> Kerch<00:04:21.330> is<00:04:21.570> not<00:04:21.750> nearly

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
I said it does still Kerch is not nearly

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:29.270 
I said it does still Kerch is not nearly
as<00:04:22.260> often<00:04:26.720> so<00:04:27.720> anyways<00:04:27.990> that's<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.920> reason

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
as often so anyways that's the reason

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.710 
as often so anyways that's the reason
why<00:04:29.430> I'm<00:04:29.520> returning<00:04:29.790> both<00:04:30.060> these<00:04:30.300> monitors

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
why I'm returning both these monitors

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.940 
why I'm returning both these monitors
and<00:04:30.870> getting<00:04:31.050> a<00:04:31.110> completely<00:04:31.770> different

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
and getting a completely different

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.220 
and getting a completely different
monitor<00:04:32.520> something<00:04:33.450> else<00:04:33.690> it's<00:04:33.930> sad<00:04:34.110> because

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
monitor something else it's sad because

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.330 
monitor something else it's sad because
it<00:04:34.440> is<00:04:34.560> a<00:04:34.590> good<00:04:34.770> looking<00:04:34.890> monitor<00:04:36.080> but<00:04:37.080> I<00:04:37.530> just

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
it is a good looking monitor but I just

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.160 
it is a good looking monitor but I just
can't<00:04:38.580> deal<00:04:38.790> with<00:04:38.820> that<00:04:39.090> for<00:04:39.270> gaming<00:04:39.600> maybe

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
can't deal with that for gaming maybe

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.870 
can't deal with that for gaming maybe
for<00:04:40.470> productivity<00:04:40.950> this<00:04:41.220> monitor<00:04:41.610> might<00:04:41.760> be

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
for productivity this monitor might be

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.150 
for productivity this monitor might be
good<00:04:42.030> for<00:04:42.060> people<00:04:42.890> anyways

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
good for people anyways

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.350 
good for people anyways
any<00:04:44.700> other<00:04:44.850> questions<00:04:45.210> let<00:04:45.360> me<00:04:45.420> know<00:04:46.280> so
