00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.990 
and here then I go up again it's all in
the<00:00:57.000> same<00:00:57.149> thing<00:00:57.420> all<00:00:57.570> right<00:00:58.820> basically<00:00:59.820> this

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the same thing all right basically this

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.680 
the same thing all right basically this
is<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:01.140> root<00:01:01.290> note<00:01:02.269> you're<00:01:03.269> setting<00:01:03.570> is

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
is the the root note you're setting is

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.660 
is the the root note you're setting is
two<00:01:03.840> notes<00:01:04.050> like<00:01:04.979> doing

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
two notes like doing

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.600 
two notes like doing
but<00:01:07.119> it<00:01:07.210> had<00:01:07.390> to<00:01:07.540> stretch<00:01:07.840> a<00:01:07.900> lot<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:09.250> I<00:01:09.280> figure

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
but it had to stretch a lot so I figure

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
but it had to stretch a lot so I figure
out<00:01:09.759> to<00:01:09.909> do<00:01:10.030> it<00:01:10.119> like<00:01:10.240> this<00:01:12.299> you're<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.420> same

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
out to do it like this you're the same

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.490 
out to do it like this you're the same
thing<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.820> but<00:01:16.240> it's<00:01:16.840> impossible<00:01:17.049> to<00:01:17.290> do<00:01:17.470> so

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
thing so but it's impossible to do so

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.770 
thing so but it's impossible to do so
you<00:01:17.680> have<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:17.950> do<00:01:18.040> it<00:01:18.100> like<00:01:18.220> this<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:19.450> basically

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
you have to do it like this so basically

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.440 
you have to do it like this so basically
I'm<00:01:19.930> digging<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.380> 6th<00:01:21.250> string<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.850> fourth

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
I'm digging the 6th string the fourth

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.070 
I'm digging the 6th string the fourth
and<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:22.720> source<00:01:22.960> string<00:01:23.640> right<00:01:24.640> know<00:01:25.630> what<00:01:25.960> to

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
and the source string right know what to

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:36.539 
and the source string right know what to
alert<00:01:26.289> something<00:01:26.649> here<00:01:35.039> right<00:01:36.039> it's<00:01:36.280> this

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
alert something here right it's this

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.100 
alert something here right it's this
this<00:01:36.820> idea<00:01:37.180> started<00:01:37.509> with<00:01:37.689> something<00:01:37.990> like

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
this idea started with something like

00:01:38.110 --> 00:02:02.160 
this idea started with something like
this<00:01:38.970> but<00:01:39.970> it<00:01:40.119> didn't<00:01:40.390> fit<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.720> song

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170
