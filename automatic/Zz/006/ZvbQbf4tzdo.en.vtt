00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.960
 the newspaper the robbery were done on the new era 8 and that is right 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.900
 why would you almost forget it was always winning laughs I grab I have one 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.900
 updated 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:17.119
 what I can 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.480
 little has changed 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.429
 that is not necessary 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:22.429
 the desport of the press how still looks and were good too 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:26.310
 the seats are on the short side 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.480
 for the umpteenth time, the French have missed out on a chance 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.480
 further improve seating comfort 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.670
 the big news is for is 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.050
 necessarily 16 kwh that engine with start-stop system 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.580
 you can get an automatic then I found Marathon but stand 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.580
 the bin opens tackled at the wrong time 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.250
 staff also red with 6 bake 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.130
 and then becomes a completely different story 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.550
 a hundred horsepower strong engine has little trouble with these three just bought under 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.170
 the fifteen under revs I have a bit difficult but up there 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.170
 I'm fine 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.030
 9 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.030
 3 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.830
 start-stop system and deserve a compliment that was robbed 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.960
 it is clear that respect 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.119
 I have never experienced this before, it is usually a nuisance 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.830
 growth engine always clearly in the dashboard and digital dislike 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.159
 meter keeps track of how long the motor perget has been out of the current budget 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.229
 that especially cramer vrom how important it is to add a start stop system 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.100
 to fit 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.889
 what the chassis has remained at both 

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:43.060
 this is a good business 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.080
 the beatles has a good mix between dynamics and comfort 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.010
 the memorial still races this car out of the corner that they are ahead of it 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.440
 competitors that are more light-footed 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.940
 Yes 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.240
 the passenger car 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.260
 and I am struggling to cope with newcomers who can still help with the walstraat 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.520
 But this sophisticated appearance and new savings scheme should put it at the forefront 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.260
 being able to break a future in pots is a class 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.560
 it is just a shame that one point six had an engine just a couple 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.030
 newspapers a lot of emissions to meet the current 14 percent additional tax scheme 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.609
 meet 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.339
 to eat the three newspapers as a pre-show 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:18.829
 then this hotel would hold gold
