okay<00:00:01.079> as<00:00:01.469> you<00:00:01.620> know<00:00:01.650> from<00:00:01.829> the<00:00:01.920> last<00:00:02.159> video

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
okay as you know from the last video

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.269 
okay as you know from the last video
what<00:00:02.790> I<00:00:02.820> decided<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.300> do<00:00:03.480> was<00:00:03.750> save<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.859> images

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
what I decided to do was save the images

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.849 
what I decided to do was save the images
as<00:00:05.549> ping<00:00:05.910> files<00:00:06.240> from<00:00:07.049> Photoshop<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.770> then

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
as ping files from Photoshop and then

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.549 
as ping files from Photoshop and then
import<00:00:08.250> them<00:00:08.429> one<00:00:08.610> by<00:00:08.790> one<00:00:08.820> into<00:00:09.660> flash<00:00:10.230> and

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
import them one by one into flash and

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.919 
import them one by one into flash and
that's<00:00:11.340> worked<00:00:11.670> out<00:00:11.790> better<00:00:12.090> than<00:00:12.450> trying<00:00:12.840> to

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
that's worked out better than trying to

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.629 
that's worked out better than trying to
import<00:00:13.290> through<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.920> Photoshop<00:00:14.610> document

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
import through the Photoshop document

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.820 
import through the Photoshop document
I'm<00:00:15.540> not<00:00:15.750> exactly<00:00:15.990> sure<00:00:16.139> what<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.470> was<00:00:16.590> doing

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
I'm not exactly sure what I was doing

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.800 
I'm not exactly sure what I was doing
wrong<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.160> tried<00:00:17.430> doing<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.850> with<00:00:18.060> instead<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.750> a

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
wrong I tried doing it with instead of a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.750 
wrong I tried doing it with instead of a
lossy<00:00:19.230> compression<00:00:19.380> using<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.220> lossless

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
lossy compression using a lossless

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.790 
lossy compression using a lossless
compression<00:00:21.210> but<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.050> still<00:00:22.260> didn't<00:00:22.529> come<00:00:22.619> in

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
compression but it still didn't come in

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.189 
compression but it still didn't come in
very<00:00:22.980> nicely<00:00:23.359> so<00:00:24.359> I'm<00:00:24.630> just<00:00:24.779> gonna<00:00:24.900> stick<00:00:25.140> with

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
very nicely so I'm just gonna stick with

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.810 
very nicely so I'm just gonna stick with
it<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.529> way<00:00:25.710> okay<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.130> time<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.580> make<00:00:26.699> our

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
it this way okay so time to make our

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.599 
it this way okay so time to make our
animation<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.869> what<00:00:28.830> I've<00:00:29.130> done<00:00:29.310> here<00:00:29.490> is

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
animation and what I've done here is

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.009 
animation and what I've done here is
I've<00:00:29.789> set<00:00:29.970> up<00:00:30.000> another<00:00:30.240> layer<00:00:30.510> here<00:00:30.840> so

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
I've set up another layer here so

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.569 
I've set up another layer here so
there's<00:00:31.199> my<00:00:31.320> background<00:00:31.830> layer<00:00:31.920> where<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.369> have

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
there's my background layer where I have

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.790 
there's my background layer where I have
these<00:00:32.759> gray<00:00:33.059> boxes<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.320> I'm<00:00:34.380> gonna<00:00:34.469> lock<00:00:34.770> that

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
these gray boxes so I'm gonna lock that

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.119 
these gray boxes so I'm gonna lock that
layer<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.700> now<00:00:36.120> I'm<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.329> layer<00:00:36.570> two<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.230> I

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
layer and now I'm on layer two and I

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.110 
layer and now I'm on layer two and I
just<00:00:38.340> go<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.460> my<00:00:38.550> library<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:40.160> drag<00:00:41.160> out<00:00:41.340> my

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
just go to my library and drag out my

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.360 
just go to my library and drag out my
first<00:00:42.360> image<00:00:42.780> okay<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.500> I've<00:00:43.980> got<00:00:44.190> this

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
gonna do first thing is notice how the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.860 
gonna do first thing is notice how the
transparency<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.430> quite<00:00:50.640> nice<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.149> I'll

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
transparency is quite nice on it I'll

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.500 
transparency is quite nice on it I'll
just<00:00:52.079> put<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.379> into<00:00:52.469> position<00:00:52.680> all<00:00:53.520> right<00:00:53.579> that

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
just put it into position all right that

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.869 
just put it into position all right that
looks<00:00:54.660> pretty<00:00:54.930> good<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.710> I'm<00:00:56.430> gonna<00:00:56.520> convert

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
looks pretty good and I'm gonna convert

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.049 
looks pretty good and I'm gonna convert
it<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.120> movie<00:00:57.480> clip<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.559> select<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.730> and

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
it to a movie clip so I select it and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.920 
it to a movie clip so I select it and
then<00:01:00.780> modify<00:01:01.649> convert<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.309> symbol<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:03.270> make

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
then modify convert to symbol and make

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.080 
then modify convert to symbol and make
it<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.080> movie<00:01:04.320> clip<00:01:04.439> registration<00:01:05.220> mark<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
it a movie clip registration mark in the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.969 
it a movie clip registration mark in the
upper<00:01:06.270> left-hand<00:01:06.540> corner<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.500> I'll<00:01:07.830> just

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
upper left-hand corner and I'll just

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.359 
upper left-hand corner and I'll just
call<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.250> symbol<00:01:08.670> 1<00:01:08.820> that's<00:01:09.450> fine<00:01:10.040> click<00:01:11.040> OK

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
call it symbol 1 that's fine click OK

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.929 
call it symbol 1 that's fine click OK
and<00:01:11.580> now<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.119> movie<00:01:12.360> clip<00:01:12.479> right<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.939> what

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
and now it's a movie clip right and what

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.370 
and now it's a movie clip right and what
essentially<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.390> want<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.689> happen<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.200> want

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
essentially I want to happen is I want

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.740 
essentially I want to happen is I want
this<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.680> exist<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.430> stage<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.509> what<00:01:18.659> I'm

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
this to exist on the stage so what I'm

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.820 
this to exist on the stage so what I'm
going<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.290> I'll<00:01:19.680> go<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:21.140> let's<00:01:22.140> say<00:01:22.320> 30

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
going to do is I'll go to let's say 30

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.580 
going to do is I'll go to let's say 30
frame<00:01:23.310> 30<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.850> hit<00:01:24.000> f6<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.869> my<00:01:25.049> keyboard<00:01:25.259> to

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
frame 30 and hit f6 on my keyboard to

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.850 
frame 30 and hit f6 on my keyboard to
insert<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.950> keyframe<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.900> my<00:01:28.650> background

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
insert a keyframe and on my background

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.120 
insert a keyframe and on my background
I'm<00:01:29.460> gonna<00:01:29.670> hit<00:01:29.850> f5<00:01:30.299> layer<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.860> now<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
I'm gonna hit f5 layer so that now the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.480 
I'm gonna hit f5 layer so that now the
background<00:01:32.570> exists<00:01:33.570> right<00:01:34.560> at<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.009> same<00:01:35.220> time

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
background exists right at the same time

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.999 
background exists right at the same time
and<00:01:36.060> then<00:01:38.270> right<00:01:39.270> here<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.869> where<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.650> will

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
and then right here is where I will

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.609 
and then right here is where I will
start<00:01:41.250> fading<00:01:41.700> her<00:01:42.180> out<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:43.140> what<00:01:43.290> I'll<00:01:43.380> do<00:01:43.590> is

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
start fading her out so what I'll do is

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.120 
start fading her out so what I'll do is
I<00:01:44.070> will<00:01:44.390> go<00:01:45.390> 10<00:01:45.899> more<00:01:46.110> frames<00:01:46.409> out<00:01:46.649> let's<00:01:46.890> say

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
I will go 10 more frames out let's say

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.260 
I will go 10 more frames out let's say
or<00:01:48.030> let's<00:01:48.299> say<00:01:48.420> 15<00:01:48.869> frames<00:01:49.200> out<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.850> hit<00:01:50.850> f6

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
or let's say 15 frames out and hit f6

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.080 
or let's say 15 frames out and hit f6
and<00:01:51.680> that'll<00:01:52.680> put<00:01:52.799> another<00:01:53.040> keyframe<00:01:53.310> of

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
and that'll put another keyframe of

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.030 
and that'll put another keyframe of
course<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.479> need<00:01:54.540> once<00:01:55.320> again<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.619> add<00:01:55.740> more

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
so right here is where I'll start the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.459 
so right here is where I'll start the
fade<00:02:02.159> out<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:03.290> here<00:02:04.290> we<00:02:04.890> have<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.390> 100%<00:02:06.469> alpha

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
fade out so here we have it 100% alpha

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.460 
fade out so here we have it 100% alpha
and<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.789> next<00:02:09.179> keyframe<00:02:09.390> what<00:02:10.200> I'll<00:02:10.319> do

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
and on this next keyframe what I'll do

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.940 
and on this next keyframe what I'll do
is<00:02:10.619> select<00:02:10.830> her

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
is select her

go down to my property window go to

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.260 
go down to my property window go to
alpha<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:15.430> take<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.090> Alpha<00:02:16.450> down<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:16.900> zero

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
alpha and take the Alpha down to zero

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.680 
alpha and take the Alpha down to zero
okay<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.540> now<00:02:19.840> she's<00:02:20.560> disappeared<00:02:21.120> so<00:02:22.120> now<00:02:22.630> to

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
make it fade from here alpha 100% notice

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.229 
make it fade from here alpha 100% notice
if<00:02:26.830> I<00:02:26.920> go<00:02:27.069> down<00:02:27.099> here<00:02:27.520> click<00:02:27.819> on<00:02:28.239> her<00:02:29.069> alpha

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
if I go down here click on her alpha

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.059 
if I go down here click on her alpha
you'll<00:02:31.239> see<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.600> oh<00:02:31.720> no<00:02:31.959> not<00:02:32.230> zero<00:02:32.560> I<00:02:32.860> want

you'll see that oh no not zero I want
her<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.310> be<00:02:33.400> alpha<00:02:33.730> 100<00:02:34.300> so<00:02:34.900> she's<00:02:35.080> alpha<00:02:35.410> 100

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.050 
her to be alpha 100 so she's alpha 100
here<00:02:36.750> over<00:02:37.750> here<00:02:38.110> she's<00:02:38.650> off<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:38.830> zero<00:02:39.280> now<00:02:39.970> all

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
here over here she's off a zero now all

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.370 
here over here she's off a zero now all
I<00:02:40.150> have<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.300> do<00:02:40.420> is<00:02:40.540> go<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.900> first<00:02:41.110> keyframe

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
I have to do is go to the first keyframe

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.710 
I have to do is go to the first keyframe
between<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.130> two<00:02:42.340> go<00:02:42.940> down<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.150> my<00:02:43.269> property

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
between the two go down to my property

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.740 
between the two go down to my property
window<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.290> say<00:02:44.470> tween<00:02:44.800> motion<00:02:45.580> okay<00:02:46.540> and

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
window and say tween motion okay and

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.410 
window and say tween motion okay and
that<00:02:47.110> sets<00:02:47.410> up<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.650> motion<00:02:48.040> tween<00:02:48.190> whereby<00:02:49.120> she

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
that sets up a motion tween whereby she

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.100 
that sets up a motion tween whereby she
will<00:02:49.540> fade<00:02:49.780> out<00:02:50.370> okay<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:51.549> she<00:02:52.510> exists<00:02:52.900> on<00:02:52.989> the

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
will fade out okay so she exists on the

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.580 
will fade out okay so she exists on the
stage<00:02:53.350> for<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.340> while<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:54.940> then<00:02:55.780> will<00:02:56.230> fade<00:02:56.560> out

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
stage for a while and then will fade out

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.940 
stage for a while and then will fade out
okay<00:02:57.519> so<00:02:57.760> if<00:02:58.480> I<00:02:58.540> hit<00:02:58.720> enter<00:02:59.140> on<00:02:59.410> my<00:02:59.440> keyboard<00:02:59.530> I

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
okay so if I hit enter on my keyboard I

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.770 
okay so if I hit enter on my keyboard I
can<00:03:00.010> play<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.459> you'll<00:03:00.790> see<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.030> yes<00:03:01.480> indeed

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
can play it you'll see that yes indeed

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.330 
can play it you'll see that yes indeed
fades<00:03:02.769> out

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
fades out

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.190 
fades out
okay<00:03:04.030> quite<00:03:04.269> nice<00:03:05.370> so<00:03:06.450> as<00:03:07.450> she<00:03:07.690> fades<00:03:07.989> out

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
okay quite nice so as she fades out

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.020 
okay quite nice so as she fades out
someone<00:03:08.709> else<00:03:08.890> will<00:03:09.040> fade<00:03:09.250> in<00:03:09.459> that<00:03:09.790> type<00:03:10.000> of

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
someone else will fade in that type of

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.530 
someone else will fade in that type of
thing

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
thing

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.809 
thing
and<00:03:10.840> what<00:03:11.440> I<00:03:11.470> need<00:03:11.680> to<00:03:11.799> do<00:03:11.920> is<00:03:12.190> go<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.519> my<00:03:12.610> other

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
and what I need to do is go to my other

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.630 
and what I need to do is go to my other
animation<00:03:13.390> and<00:03:13.540> let's<00:03:13.720> see<00:03:14.019> how<00:03:14.319> many

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
animation and let's see how many

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.729 
animation and let's see how many
keyframes<00:03:15.640> I<00:03:15.819> did<00:03:16.030> this<00:03:16.209> on<00:03:16.420> so<00:03:17.140> I<00:03:17.170> see<00:03:17.530> that

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
keyframes I did this on so I see that

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.170 
keyframes I did this on so I see that
she<00:03:18.430> exists<00:03:18.760> this<00:03:19.000> person<00:03:19.480> existed<00:03:21.000> my<00:03:22.000> other

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
she exists this person existed my other

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.009 
she exists this person existed my other
one<00:03:22.470> they<00:03:23.470> existed<00:03:23.890> for<00:03:24.100> 35<00:03:24.489> frames<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.299> then

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
one they existed for 35 frames and then

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.930 
one they existed for 35 frames and then
fade<00:03:26.350> it<00:03:26.500> out<00:03:26.650> for<00:03:27.750> 30<00:03:28.750> frames<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:29.519> my<00:03:30.519> movie

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
fade it out for 30 frames and my movie

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.780 
fade it out for 30 frames and my movie
was<00:03:31.620> frame<00:03:32.620> rate<00:03:32.859> was<00:03:32.980> at<00:03:33.130> 20<00:03:33.400> frames<00:03:33.519> per

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
was frame rate was at 20 frames per

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.880 
was frame rate was at 20 frames per
second<00:03:34.329> so<00:03:34.390> on<00:03:34.600> my<00:03:34.750> new<00:03:34.870> movie<00:03:35.230> I'll<00:03:35.590> probably

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
second so on my new movie I'll probably

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:36.870 
second so on my new movie I'll probably
do<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.190> other<00:03:36.310> thing<00:03:36.549> because<00:03:36.700> those

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
do the other thing because those

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.729 
do the other thing because those
settings<00:03:37.209> seemed<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:37.540> work<00:03:37.630> out<00:03:37.840> nicely<00:03:38.079> so

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
settings seemed to work out nicely so

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.410 
settings seemed to work out nicely so
I'll<00:03:38.859> click<00:03:39.040> on<00:03:39.220> my<00:03:39.430> background<00:03:39.579> area<00:03:40.299> the

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.910 
click in here and hit f5 make her and
make<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:03.760> last<00:04:04.060> until<00:04:05.190> 65<00:04:06.190> okay<00:04:07.030> on<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:07.569> bottom

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
make it last until 65 okay on the bottom

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.210 
make it last until 65 okay on the bottom
layer<00:04:08.950> I'll<00:04:09.370> hit<00:04:09.579> f5<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.389> add<00:04:10.540> more<00:04:10.720> frames

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
layer I'll hit f5 to add more frames

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.830 
layer I'll hit f5 to add more frames
okay<00:04:12.220> so<00:04:12.280> now<00:04:12.549> I'm<00:04:12.670> mimicking<00:04:13.180> what<00:04:13.480> happened

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
okay so now I'm mimicking what happened

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.349 
okay so now I'm mimicking what happened
and<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:13.989> other<00:04:14.139> one<00:04:14.350> so<00:04:14.670> there<00:04:15.670> we<00:04:15.819> go<00:04:15.850> she'll

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
and the other one so there we go she'll

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.069 
and the other one so there we go she'll
be<00:04:16.479> there

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
be there

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.420 
be there
and<00:04:17.260> then<00:04:17.769> she'll<00:04:17.950> fade

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
and then she'll fade

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.540 
and then she'll fade
okay<00:04:19.269> I'm<00:04:19.600> gonna<00:04:20.109> need<00:04:20.759> probably<00:04:21.759> another

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
okay I'm gonna need probably another

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.060 
okay I'm gonna need probably another
music<00:04:24.550> singer<00:04:24.850> or<00:04:25.090> two<00:04:25.330> and<00:04:25.930> if<00:04:26.500> I'm<00:04:26.620> gonna<00:04:26.770> do

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
music singer or two and if I'm gonna do

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.820 
music singer or two and if I'm gonna do
motion<00:04:28.060> tweens<00:04:28.330> like<00:04:28.630> I<00:04:28.750> did<00:04:28.900> here<00:04:29.229> you<00:04:29.680> can

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
motion tweens like I did here you can

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.129 
motion tweens like I did here you can
only<00:04:29.949> do<00:04:30.160> one<00:04:30.460> motion<00:04:30.910> tween<00:04:31.120> for<00:04:31.360> one<00:04:31.600> sprite

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
only do one motion tween for one sprite

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.960 
only do one motion tween for one sprite
or<00:04:32.199> one<00:04:32.620> character<00:04:33.070> on<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.250> stage<00:04:33.310> per<00:04:33.729> layer

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
or one character on the stage per layer

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.529 
or one character on the stage per layer
so<00:04:34.630> I'll<00:04:34.720> need<00:04:34.900> a<00:04:34.930> new<00:04:35.110> layer<00:04:36.120> so<00:04:37.120> make<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.300> new

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
so I'll need a new layer so make a new

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:45.510 
so I'll need a new layer so make a new
layer<00:04:37.750> go<00:04:38.590> into<00:04:38.800> my<00:04:38.919> library<00:04:39.490> and<00:04:42.389> grab<00:04:44.520> my

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
layer go into my library and grab my

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.990 
layer go into my library and grab my
next<00:04:45.759> character<00:04:46.360> let's<00:04:46.690> say<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:50.789> so<00:04:51.789> we<00:04:51.850> got

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
next character let's say and so we got

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.810 
next character let's say and so we got
Glen<00:04:52.240> Campbell<00:04:52.720> here<00:04:53.220> that<00:04:54.220> might<00:04:54.430> work<00:04:54.580> out

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
Glen Campbell here that might work out

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.480 
Glen Campbell here that might work out
okay<00:04:58.470> what<00:04:59.470> I<00:04:59.500> might<00:04:59.710> want<00:04:59.889> to<00:04:59.919> do<00:05:00.039> with<00:05:00.160> Glen

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
okay what I might want to do with Glen

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.980 
okay what I might want to do with Glen
is<00:05:00.729> flip<00:05:01.120> him<00:05:01.680> modify<00:05:03.539> let's<00:05:04.539> see<00:05:04.780> here

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
is flip him modify let's see here

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.420 
is flip him modify let's see here
transform<00:05:05.880> flip<00:05:06.880> horizontal<00:05:08.100> put<00:05:09.100> him<00:05:09.190> at<00:05:09.310> the

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
transform flip horizontal put him at the

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.969 
transform flip horizontal put him at the
end<00:05:09.610> there<00:05:09.880> sighs<00:05:10.150> shoulder<00:05:10.660> matches<00:05:11.080> up<00:05:11.260> with

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
end there sighs shoulder matches up with

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.930 
end there sighs shoulder matches up with
the<00:05:12.160> end<00:05:12.310> of<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:12.520> movie<00:05:12.880> perhaps<00:05:14.669> okay<00:05:15.669> and

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
the end of the movie perhaps okay and

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.890 
the end of the movie perhaps okay and
then<00:05:16.900> I'll<00:05:17.500> convert<00:05:17.889> him<00:05:18.039> to<00:05:18.280> a<00:05:18.389> movie<00:05:19.389> clip<00:05:19.720> so

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
then I'll convert him to a movie clip so

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.710 
then I'll convert him to a movie clip so
I<00:05:19.960> select<00:05:20.349> him<00:05:20.500> hit<00:05:21.220> f8<00:05:21.729> on<00:05:21.970> my<00:05:22.150> keyboard<00:05:22.389> to

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
I select him hit f8 on my keyboard to

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.600 
I select him hit f8 on my keyboard to
convert<00:05:23.110> to<00:05:23.229> a<00:05:23.260> movie<00:05:23.500> clip<00:05:24.449> right<00:05:26.370> okay<00:05:27.370> there

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
convert to a movie clip right okay there

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.270 
convert to a movie clip right okay there
he<00:05:27.729> is<00:05:28.050> all<00:05:29.050> right<00:05:29.110> so<00:05:29.289> now<00:05:29.680> he's<00:05:29.830> a<00:05:29.889> movie<00:05:30.130> clip

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
he is all right so now he's a movie clip

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.560 
he is all right so now he's a movie clip
and<00:05:30.580> now<00:05:30.669> I<00:05:30.699> could<00:05:30.940> just<00:05:30.970> do<00:05:31.180> the<00:05:31.300> same<00:05:31.330> thing

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
and now I could just do the same thing

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.080 
and now I could just do the same thing
I'll<00:05:32.050> go<00:05:32.199> here<00:05:33.070> and<00:05:33.310> hit<00:05:33.729> f6<00:05:34.599> at<00:05:34.840> 35<00:05:35.610> all<00:05:36.610> right

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
I'll go here and hit f6 at 35 all right

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.350 
I'll go here and hit f6 at 35 all right
scroll<00:05:37.659> over<00:05:38.250> and<00:05:39.250> hit<00:05:39.820> f6<00:05:40.510> at<00:05:40.750> 65<00:05:42.090> all<00:05:43.090> right

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
scroll over and hit f6 at 65 all right

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.990 
scroll over and hit f6 at 65 all right
and<00:05:44.110> then<00:05:44.229> select<00:05:44.650> him<00:05:45.210> and<00:05:46.210> go<00:05:46.630> to<00:05:46.690> alpha<00:05:48.000> and

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
and then select him and go to alpha and

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.850 
and then select him and go to alpha and
take<00:05:49.180> it<00:05:49.300> down<00:05:49.419> to<00:05:49.449> zero<00:05:49.900> go<00:05:50.349> to<00:05:50.409> my<00:05:50.560> previous

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
take it down to zero go to my previous

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.320 
take it down to zero go to my previous
keyframe<00:05:51.840> and<00:05:52.840> do<00:05:53.260> a<00:05:53.289> motion<00:05:53.710> tween<00:05:54.070> so<00:05:54.430> now

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
keyframe and do a motion tween so now

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:02.670 
keyframe and do a motion tween so now
they<00:05:55.979> they<00:05:56.979> both<00:05:58.260> will<00:05:59.729> fade<00:06:00.729> out<00:06:01.229> at<00:06:02.229> the<00:06:02.440> same

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
they they both will fade out at the same

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:09.180 
they they both will fade out at the same
time<00:06:04.139> okay<00:06:05.639> Grimaud<00:06:06.639> frames<00:06:07.060> here<00:06:07.479> I<00:06:08.190> can

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
time okay Grimaud frames here I can

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.870 
time okay Grimaud frames here I can
remove<00:06:09.370> frames<00:06:09.909> here<00:06:10.409> all<00:06:11.409> right<00:06:11.590> so<00:06:12.370> now<00:06:12.550> they

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
remove frames here all right so now they

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.219 
remove frames here all right so now they
both<00:06:13.000> fade<00:06:13.300> out<00:06:13.419> at<00:06:13.510> the<00:06:13.570> same<00:06:13.780> time<00:06:14.020> but

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
both fade out at the same time but

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:15.719 
both fade out at the same time but
there's<00:06:14.409> kind<00:06:14.560> of<00:06:14.680> a<00:06:14.770> gap<00:06:15.010> in<00:06:15.220> between<00:06:15.250> them<00:06:15.669> so

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
there's kind of a gap in between them so

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:18.000 
there's kind of a gap in between them so
I<00:06:15.880> think<00:06:16.000> I'm<00:06:16.240> going<00:06:16.360> to<00:06:16.419> need<00:06:16.570> one<00:06:16.630> more<00:06:17.020> so<00:06:17.979> I

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
I think I'm going to need one more so I

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.450 
I think I'm going to need one more so I
make<00:06:18.250> a<00:06:18.280> new<00:06:18.490> layer<00:06:18.520> and<00:06:19.560> go<00:06:20.560> to<00:06:21.039> my<00:06:21.250> library

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
make a new layer and go to my library

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.700 
make a new layer and go to my library
and<00:06:23.340> I<00:06:24.340> need<00:06:24.490> to<00:06:24.610> find

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
and I need to find

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:32.090 
and I need to find
maybe<00:06:26.610> one<00:06:26.880> other<00:06:27.060> person<00:06:30.740> okay<00:06:31.740> I've<00:06:31.889> got

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
maybe one other person okay I've got

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:38.890 
maybe one other person okay I've got
that<00:06:32.130> looks<00:06:33.120> pretty<00:06:33.300> good

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.779 

I'll<00:06:39.900> probably<00:06:40.139> get<00:06:40.380> another<00:06:40.650> two<00:06:41.100> actually

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:41.789 
I'll probably get another two actually

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:44.600 
I'll probably get another two actually
all<00:06:42.750> right<00:06:42.840> that<00:06:42.990> looks<00:06:43.110> pretty<00:06:43.229> good<00:06:43.440> hit<00:06:43.860> f8

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
all right that looks pretty good hit f8

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.420 
all right that looks pretty good hit f8
to<00:06:44.850> convert<00:06:45.150> it<00:06:45.240> to<00:06:45.300> a<00:06:45.389> movie<00:06:45.660> clip<00:06:46.190> all<00:06:47.190> right

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430
