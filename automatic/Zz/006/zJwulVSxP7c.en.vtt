00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.400 
so that is actually the kind of verified
part<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.800> that<00:03:56.550> it<00:03:56.790> is<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:56.940> hack<00:03:57.330> verified<00:03:58.080> by<00:03:58.230> me

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
part of that it is a hack verified by me

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.110 
part of that it is a hack verified by me
of<00:03:58.440> course<00:03:58.590> but<00:03:59.070> yeah<00:03:59.340> it's<00:03:59.580> saved<00:03:59.850> on<00:04:00.000> the

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
of course but yeah it's saved on the

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.870 
of course but yeah it's saved on the
server<00:04:00.300> so<00:04:00.660> it<00:04:00.750> has<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.110> be<00:04:01.260> real<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:01.820> this<00:04:02.820> is

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
server so it has to be real and this is

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.540 
server so it has to be real and this is
another<00:04:03.540> person<00:04:04.080> not<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.470> Ovid<00:04:05.010> cam<00:04:05.250> from

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
another person not the Ovid cam from

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.120 
another person not the Ovid cam from
Uzbekistan<00:04:06.300> but<00:04:06.870> this<00:04:07.020> guy<00:04:07.230> is<00:04:07.440> using<00:04:07.980> the

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
Uzbekistan but this guy is using the

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.860 
Uzbekistan but this guy is using the
moles<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.730> prototypes<00:04:09.300> I<00:04:09.510> made<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.690> video

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
moles the prototypes I made a video

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.430 
moles the prototypes I made a video
about<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.590> he's<00:04:11.340> using<00:04:11.580> over<00:04:12.120> 500<00:04:12.870> million<00:04:13.110> if

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
about and he's using over 500 million if

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.310 
about and he's using over 500 million if
not<00:04:13.650> more<00:04:14.010> so<00:04:14.420> this<00:04:15.420> is<00:04:15.630> weird<00:04:15.930> this<00:04:15.959> is

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
not more so this is weird this is

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.900 
not more so this is weird this is
actually<00:04:16.650> replay<00:04:16.919> as<00:04:17.100> well<00:04:17.280> this<00:04:17.489> could<00:04:17.760> be

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
actually replay as well this could be

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.170 
actually replay as well this could be
fake<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.450> could<00:04:19.200> be<00:04:19.380> real<00:04:19.620> because<00:04:20.459> you<00:04:20.669> could

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
fake it could be real because you could

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.570 
fake it could be real because you could
mod<00:04:21.480> that<00:04:21.900> you<00:04:22.229> would<00:04:22.710> use<00:04:22.890> it<00:04:23.039> for<00:04:23.070> yourself

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
mod that you would use it for yourself

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.370 
mod that you would use it for yourself
in<00:04:23.729> an<00:04:23.820> offline<00:04:24.120> replay<00:04:24.720> but<00:04:24.930> if<00:04:25.050> it's<00:04:25.260> a

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
in an offline replay but if it's a

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.680 
in an offline replay but if it's a
replay<00:04:25.830> there<00:04:26.760> would<00:04:26.970> be<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.150> normal

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
replay there would be a normal

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.560 
replay there would be a normal
of<00:04:27.960> coops<00:04:28.260> and<00:04:28.530> this<00:04:28.680> guy<00:04:28.830> is<00:04:28.890> even<00:04:29.220> using<00:04:29.850> more

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
of coops and this guy is even using more

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.040 
of coops and this guy is even using more
than<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:31.140> 220<00:04:32.390> 240<00:04:33.390> 270<00:04:34.350> maybe<00:04:34.800> even

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
than the 220 240 270 maybe even

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.300 
than the 220 240 270 maybe even
possibility<00:04:37.050> of<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.590> troops<00:04:37.830> you<00:04:37.950> could<00:04:38.100> use

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
possibility of the troops you could use

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.840 
possibility of the troops you could use
and<00:04:38.520> he's<00:04:38.640> using<00:04:39.620> 827<00:04:40.620> hog<00:04:41.100> riders<00:04:41.550> and<00:04:41.700> that's

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
and he's using 827 hog riders and that's

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.270 
and he's using 827 hog riders and that's
way<00:04:42.150> more<00:04:42.180> than<00:04:42.660> 270<00:04:43.440> you<00:04:43.620> could<00:04:43.800> store<00:04:44.040> in

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
way more than 270 you could store in

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.120 
way more than 270 you could store in
your<00:04:44.520> clan<00:04:44.760> castle<00:04:44.790> in<00:04:45.240> army<00:04:45.480> camps<00:04:45.840> so<00:04:46.830> this

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
your clan castle in army camps so this

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.280 
your clan castle in army camps so this
is<00:04:47.340> another<00:04:47.730> guy<00:04:48.000> that<00:04:48.030> can<00:04:48.450> probably<00:04:48.660> do<00:04:49.050> this

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
is another guy that can probably do this
