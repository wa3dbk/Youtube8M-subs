00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.130
 Originally said to pt plan for a certain period of time Let's understand the present book 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.969
 It was hit by light political affairs 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:10.249
 1 is done 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.809
 Mr. Tsu City will do the interval between songs after 911 jointly next year 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:18.149
 Basically 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.169
 I think that making space is good 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:23.789
 There are some changes 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.130
 High height 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.130
 dbs group 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.739
 Please go above today's high price 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.670
 wrong 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.340
 The front also 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.670
 I'm completely 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.140
 Anyway 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.860
 Pretty new information 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.050
 I'm not doing this 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.050
 But a little notice of that scuff 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.310
 The content is to some extent 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.310
 There is something to say each one 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.670
 Holy child 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.020
 But hey 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.590
 Announced 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.290
 It may be 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.620
 small fish 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.330
 It is up, but with so much 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.170
 It is dirty again 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.100
 Dorian's footprints remain 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.400
 Not only can you get a small result 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 I think that Shunan came on the 22nd 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.530
 I hope each information provider has it 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.970
 By all means 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.590
 Powerful score 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.120
 The current bottom 6,000 kg 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.750
 It is very cute sports driving 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.120
 You can use this feature 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.710
 Offensive voice 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.700
 Appeals when using chipset 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.700
 56 set 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.550
 However, I lost my voice only at such time 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.400
 Once 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.189
 Rear professional supported towards this state of the screen 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.179
 Thickness is tomorrow 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:20.179
 I think sprintnextel 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.139
 But this 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:25.729
 It is in a state of transparency, and you can win little by little 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:26.749
 It was not 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:29.329
 Child care for children 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.329
 I do not like scratches 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.209
 Both mother and child are healthy 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.069
 There was not much play 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.069
 It will be good with the Democratic Party 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:44.719
 Report now 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:45.939
 Not big 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.499
 We perform public offering of February 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.499
 I keep my left and right 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.719
 My family is getting better 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:03.169
 It was revealed 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:04.319
 Joint this 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.099
 Pacemaker available 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.119
 Future plans 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:09.929
 Discipline 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:12.929
 I want you to catch up with the technology 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:17.279
 This is a social activity 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.529
 Kobayashi is pitcher 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:25.529
 Things to change 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.009
 I feel like 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:30.869
 Plunged 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:33.549
 I wonder if the game had water in it 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.549
 It is a main leg shin complex 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:40.699
 Because I think so as a collaboration product 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:42.109
 Tomoyuki Hori 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:43.389
 And so much 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.389
 Estimate 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.459
 We explained that it was easy to use 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:50.539
 With all my energy
