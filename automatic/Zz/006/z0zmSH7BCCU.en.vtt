00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
have the disc right here what that's

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.830 
have the disc right here what that's
doing<00:03:23.160> is<00:03:23.370> basically<00:03:23.550> a<00:03:23.760> virtual<00:03:24.209> drive<00:03:24.360> and

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
doing is basically a virtual drive and

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.550 
doing is basically a virtual drive and
it's<00:03:25.650> basically<00:03:26.520> putting<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:28.140> mic<00:03:28.380> it's

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
it's basically putting the mic it's

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.990 
it's basically putting the mic it's
fully<00:03:28.800> in<00:03:28.950> your<00:03:28.980> computer<00:03:29.490> into<00:03:29.640> thinking

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
fully in your computer into thinking

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
that you know sort of like you have the

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.949 
that you know sort of like you have the
Microsoft<00:03:33.900> Flight<00:03:34.020> Simulator<00:03:34.320> X<00:03:34.590> DVD<00:03:35.220> in<00:03:35.550> your

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
Microsoft Flight Simulator X DVD in your

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.850 
Microsoft Flight Simulator X DVD in your
computer<00:03:36.959> that's<00:03:37.110> basically<00:03:37.530> what<00:03:37.740> it's

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
computer that's basically what it's

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.250 
computer that's basically what it's
doing<00:03:37.920> so<00:03:38.250> it'll<00:03:39.090> start<00:03:39.300> this<00:03:39.600> it'll<00:03:39.810> alkylate

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
doing so it'll start this it'll alkylate

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.990 
doing so it'll start this it'll alkylate
some<00:03:40.440> disk<00:03:40.680> space<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:41.130> stuff<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:41.700> then<00:03:41.850> it'll

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000
