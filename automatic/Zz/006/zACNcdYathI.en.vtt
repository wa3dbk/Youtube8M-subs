00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
 hi guys much better on a 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:03.600
 circulation more men at this point 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.950
 as support for young people threaten m 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.770
 fitness on saint-laurent in montreal 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.450
 to give you bench tips 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.370
 press today the child must 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.019
 revise with you the walls the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.400
 groups that are solicited by the 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.139
 bench press that must be increased three 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.240
 different bench techniques for 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.550
 better target the group of your choice 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.539
 the French band are working too far 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.850
 there mainly this work them 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.800
 pectorals this work the front of the poles 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.779
 which is called the deltoid anterior this 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.699
 work the triceps and then according 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.309
 how do you make your badge press 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.989
 you go if more or less some 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.550
 of these groups the fact that one goes up 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.780
 three techniques at bench the first 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.610
 that I show you here the bench press 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.290
 taken in approach we will look at that 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.570
 so for a take the approached I 'm 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.010
 that you will always miss them well 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.800
 will take me I recommend taking 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.719
 a catch slightly inside the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.239
 shoulders so for me it's going to be pretty 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.100
 sooner or later so of course for taking at 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.600
 bench what I recommend is to go 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.760
 check the same outlet each time that 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.440
 in fact your exercises will be all 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.930
 bars or just about every bale 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.420
 and a barbed wire here at about the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.180
 shoulder width so for me me 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.409
 taken closer is the ring finger here 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.170
 on the barbed wire 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.850
 the mula on the rabelais and according to your 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.979
 money but not soap to send 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.990
 so when I farm inn 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.560
 bring me closer listen will go to 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.810
 interior 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.630
 and I'm going sites still affected at 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.640
 top with there when I do that but 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.920
 costs are inside at the Belgian the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.740
 work is done mainly by the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.689
 pixels so the tiny group that is 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.070
 solicited more with this technique 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.320
 this is the triceps 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.390
 if I want I you not terminal you 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.729
 go see when I go down watch 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.329
 certainly many and fold completely 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.970
 do you see members a fold 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.689
 completely thrown that a good code bend 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.159
 completely if I had it changed kunz 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.740
 the way the various pillars that 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.390
 completely folded like that so when I 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.119
 make a belgian bring together the courses of 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.159
 language when I embarrassed full attitude 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.770
 for the triceps and I ask the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.000
 concept more 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.910
 a variant that is quite popular 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.520
 it's the Belgian press villages on the 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.250
 board you almost always have too 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.800
 rings and rings if you ask 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.350
 the question is the maximum width 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.250
 illegal after jogging for the big 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.170
 motte the kneaders of the rings so my 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.750
 take me wide is the little finger on 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.730
 the ring the little finger on the ring is 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.650
 there when I'm going to do a rehearsal I 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.170
 want to touch the harkat chest and I 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.980
 will go back up like that and the codes 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.830
 usually are going to be over to 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.860
 outside when I 'm bad going 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.040
 like that I go on very likes 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.380
 big pectoralis so the pectorals the 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.050
 in front of pots and - the whole is used otherwise 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.630
 taking the only one on the big pectoral 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.270
 and a little bit more its outer portion 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.900
 by the way kashtan to repeat more 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.500
 large 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.330
 you're going really cool ok this in order to 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.940
 movement look at my club 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.010
 he is not completely looted see 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.920
 you if I ask that on it it's 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.530
 just passed 90 degrees so the habit 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.050
 of movement but not complete for 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.420
 the articulation of code 7 between them for 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.250
 that the elbow the triceps is less 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.590
 solicited in the bench press 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.110
 gryzlov if I compare the Belgian places 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.320
 taken wide so we really absurd 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.489
 here at the bench press take closer 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.820
 see that limpid is much more 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.030
 great 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.820
 approached polar and finally I have the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.700
 tape places taken mean for me that 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.239
 is going to be an inch away from 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.040
 barbed 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.630
 so I put the end of my post on the 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.420
 barbed I sit on both sides I 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.400
 my catch and cash flow bench like that I 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.670
 find myself to be between the two at 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.720
 level of pectoral recruitment and 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.590
 princeps 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.600
 so it's like a compromise between the 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.000
 bench press closer is more 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.540
 be chief he the bench press wide hold 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.370
 it's more like the big pectoral 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.380
 here and the 3 in my experience 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.880
 looks pretty much like the deltoid 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.010
 previous this program thing to do 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.750
 to change without solicitation needed 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.670
 the Belgian according to advice for today 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.590
 thank you guys for listening in a moment 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.350
 the eaters ride some little stuff that 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.270
 I use to cover more water 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.750
 in competition by the facelift my max 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.060
 bargain without competition this 198 a weight 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.840
 of 155 him so it's reasonable I 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.840
 shows my area and that
