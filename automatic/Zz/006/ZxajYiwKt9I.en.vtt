00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.340
 first we're going to cut you the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.450
 pineapple and we could do it here in the middle 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.880
 but to make it look more beautiful 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.280
 let's leave it that way and let's go 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.970
 cut as the shore does not exactly 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.970
 to the half 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:33.879
 our pineapple is very presentable 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:35.799
 and we are going to remove this because we're going 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.540
 to eat obviously but let's put it 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:41.209
 here canceled 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.800
 What we are going to do is take away the 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:48.150
 in the middle of the pineapple 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.570
 and for that we are going to first go through the 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.570
 shore 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.620
 and that's how our pineapple is ready 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.620
 to fill in I know 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.720
 I want to make this pineapple sweet so 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:34.640
 I will occupy pineapple strawberries kiwi grapes 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.640
 apple and blueberries 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.470
 How is this pineapple going to be sweet? 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.230
 occupy yoghurt in this case I'm 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.620
 using Greek without flavors and I made 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.580
 play because it does not add other flavors 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.300
 simply that of fruits and yogurt 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.300
 well, natural 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.830
 Hello 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.699
 and we add our yogurt 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:31.220
 the amounts totally depend on you 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:34.460
 how sweet you want it so much pineapple 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.030

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.030
 in it 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.540
 now I added some natural fruits 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.970
 without yogurt 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.400
 so that it gives a little bit of color and 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.430
 see much more appetizing 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:59.479
 and that's how our rich dessert looks 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:02.270
 our pineapple filled with fruit is something 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:05.000
 super healthy and super cool for this 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.610
