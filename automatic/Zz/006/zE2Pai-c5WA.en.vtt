00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.640
 We were in a field with olive trees the deposit since it laporta reader talmente 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.650
 different from other farms because a super-intensive system has been used 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.759
 of implantation 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.589
 that allows to place more than two thousand olive trees per hectare 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.470
 after being extradited pocito department according to fashion investigations 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.039
 we have four and a half hectares of olive trees 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.600
 i in that end we have a market of these parties from his front efe 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.160
 on the sidewalk in front of the store maría antonia teheran regime 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.480
 the other state composed of another version obtained before 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.480
 and in chamomile 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.589
 this March are present others we can adopt superintensive 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.970
 the 922 plants per hectare 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.970
 and it's multiple where an intensive 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.630
 the system is planned to start with superintensive then jump 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.820
 to an intensive and then at the end sports keaton as a crop 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.820
 traditional 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.130
 the data plantation efe pérez by a means that was palpated today 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.300
 approximately every year 6 7 of life 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.850
 useful then it is brought in the plant started more so it is done by a means 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.630
 useful cultural 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.939
 tulcán tulcán il who then telcel average passes a 6 by 3 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.110
 That's where the intensive power center comes in. This is the whole life based in 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.840
 Idaho 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.670
 then there is another plant a3 volition psoe by sahin there I asked him the 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.670
 traditional cultivation 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.270
 the victim said and over the years 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.719
 of the 2 thousand 222 plants remaining 178 in this farm how will not be in the 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.010
 approaches are hindering or you will have difficulties 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.780
 the working part in pose why we said start with 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.240
 superintensive and the fifth terminal in jump or 10 to 11 years in culture 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.540
 traditional or producer josé 13 from year 2 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:39.000
 the value of the template for intensive intensive cultivation is 504 160 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:40.110
 plants per hectare 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.269
 We will calculate in 13 pesos per plant to plant 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.219
 arévalo who marked action what is bound what is the 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:53.290
 fertilizer gave the plant the value of the ata plant it has posed as a key in 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.719
 atlanta hands 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:57.719
 placed before 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:11.599
 the production of olives with the superintensive system exposed 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.109
 reached 17 thousand kilos per hectare this harvest 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:20.379
 the figure more than interesting if you consider that only 33 months ago 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.379
 that the olive trees were planted in this final 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:33.859
 this is a short-term intensive sector of a month of august in 2006 this apparatus 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.349
 mechanical locomotive 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.129
 Within this year we have done manual process and it is also very acceptable 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:44.109
 because the agent practically my way jose to are reaping a 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.959
 Another side of the floor in no need to use ladder then fmx lopera 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:59.290
 in 2008 we made him good first joseph chiltepec condusef last we got 4 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.329
 193 grams per average plant josé félix pérez had something of 1,100 kilos 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:05.409
 per hectare 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:10.919
 this year and that really the first harvest in total obtained unnim 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:15.859
 average plantet of seven kilos 300 of hidalgo we have spent you say it in the 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.859
 that the foristas 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.820
 with the vote table in little previous seedling and are plants of 39 months and 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.120
 there we have been almost two kilos and a half in coma and portland 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.840
 we x and that we move superintensivos we are already talking about 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.840
 dunga ink put much greater 2 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.349
 12 32 in this stellar moment 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.969
 we have told the time that happened to me they charge us 20 percent in value 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:50.199
 as well as the old one in washington 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.180
 that's the case where 80 percent at 20 kilometers per hour 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.809
 finish 

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:59.809
 finish 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:03.849
 there are other issues that are starting to become superintensive 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:08.610
 and there are people who are coming from outside of Spain who also come 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.210
 to plant your pretension 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.259
 or not 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:19.270
 in culture that enters so far he told promo presentable presentable 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.860
 it's easy to take it 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.840
 if with that labor institute institute jose to 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.750
 the mentality of you also dollars and and you have to put this production 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.060
 inventories and you have to take out kilo in this case put the market to 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.060
 encompass 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.330
 k 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:56.019
 we also live the most important entity is in san juan 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.189
 a book where he most pocketed productions 

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:06.059
 Lastly, in the locality to implement its trajectory that supports results 

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:07.479
 what presidential 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.679
 very well the first public discourse but the world
