00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
to try to go back to that mind step what

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.009 
to try to go back to that mind step what
are<00:00:09.510> you<00:00:09.570> come<00:00:09.690> on

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
I have less than a 15% chance you do get

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.229 
I have less than a 15% chance you do get
the<00:00:46.350> players<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.890> chance<00:00:47.129> yeah<00:00:47.579> that's<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.030> lot

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the players in chance yeah that's a lot

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.150 
the players in chance yeah that's a lot
of<00:00:48.390> people<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.690> less<00:00:48.870> than<00:00:49.070> you<00:00:50.070> remember

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
of people have less than you remember

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.920 
of people have less than you remember
what<00:00:50.430> Ken<00:00:50.640> said<00:00:50.670> you're<00:00:51.059> not<00:00:51.149> taking<00:00:51.510> into<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
what Ken said you're not taking into the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.350 
what Ken said you're not taking into the
equation<00:00:52.379> hope<00:00:52.910> do<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:53.940> think<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.329> a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
equation hope do you think you have a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.330 
equation hope do you think you have a
greater<00:00:54.809> than<00:00:54.899> 15%<00:00:55.289> chance<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.860> qualify<00:00:56.070> for

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
greater than 15% chance to qualify for

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.700 
greater than 15% chance to qualify for
ti5<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.120> think<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.570> 2%<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.289> know<00:00:58.410> it's

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
ti5 I think it's like 2% I know it's

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.349 
ti5 I think it's like 2% I know it's
gotta<00:00:58.920> be<00:00:59.129> like<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.730> gotta<00:00:59.879> be<00:01:00.030> lower<00:01:00.210> than

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
gotta be like it's gotta be lower than

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.270 
gotta be like it's gotta be lower than
2%<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.079> have<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.379> think<00:01:01.710> about<00:01:01.800> than<00:01:02.129> me

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
2% but you have to think about than me

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.359 
2% but you have to think about than me
as<00:01:02.430> my<00:01:03.270> friend<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.960> said<00:01:04.229> less<00:01:04.619> than<00:01:04.769> 15<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.220> mean

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
as my friend I said less than 15 I mean

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.250 
as my friend I said less than 15 I mean
like<00:01:05.610> good<00:01:05.850> will<00:01:06.090> be<00:01:06.240> up<00:01:06.390> realistically

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
like good will be up realistically

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.170 
like good will be up realistically
probably<00:01:07.409> like<00:01:07.740> less<00:01:07.920> than<00:01:07.950> one<00:01:08.400> oh<00:01:08.640> my<00:01:08.939> god

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
probably like less than one oh my god

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.640 
probably like less than one oh my god
really<00:01:09.510> if<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:09.990> think<00:01:10.200> about<00:01:10.409> all<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
really if you just think about all the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.250 
really if you just think about all the
teams<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:10.920> are<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.720> in<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.840> qualifier

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
teams that are in the in the qualifier

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.870 
teams that are in the in the qualifier
just<00:01:13.530> being<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> qualifier<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.670> probably

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
just being in the qualifier you probably

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.700 
just being in the qualifier you probably
have<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.240> 1%<00:01:15.689> chance<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.110> know<00:01:16.229> that's

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
have like a 1% chance you know that's

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.690 
have like a 1% chance you know that's
pretty<00:01:16.860> true<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:18.590> maybe

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
pretty true so maybe

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.780 
pretty true so maybe
maybe<00:01:21.390> 1%<00:01:21.659> that's<00:01:22.560> good<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:23.009> why<00:01:23.430> do<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.640> have

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
maybe 1% that's good on why do we have

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.219 
maybe 1% that's good on why do we have
to<00:01:23.909> like<00:01:24.060> narrow<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.570> down<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.930> lowest

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
to like narrow it down to the lowest

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.109 
to like narrow it down to the lowest
possible<00:01:25.560> number<00:01:25.830> free<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.610> low<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.850> mean

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
possible number free is that low I mean

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.469 
possible number free is that low I mean
like<00:01:27.299> I'm<00:01:27.420> rounding<00:01:27.689> up<00:01:27.950> like<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.270> think

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
like I'm rounding up like so one I think

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.880 
like I'm rounding up like so one I think
is<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:31.110> generous<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:34.729> you<00:01:35.729> know<00:01:35.820> your<00:01:36.450> team

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
is it's generous and you know your team

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.240 
is it's generous and you know your team
pbd<00:01:37.890> was<00:01:38.009> saying<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.640> guys<00:01:38.759> are<00:01:40.250> really
