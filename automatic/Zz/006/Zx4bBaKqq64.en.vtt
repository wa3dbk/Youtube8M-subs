00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.460
 printed matter in one go that back series on

 the market throws with the latest and 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.900
 state of the art Gruyere 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.390
 renault can be found in that area 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.350
 trucks this last brand that they have a euro 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.450
 6 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.840
 must introduce pressure and it does 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.540
 not in a table the blow with a thousand and 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.590
 colleagues from all over europe as 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.410
 witness 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.900
 and that's here 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.500
 not particularly feast for half an hour from 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.350
 the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.329
 expo that are full there are very many 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.890
 engineers to explain to us how we do 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.890
 all that new technology is not 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.010
 this series is the top model of the new 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.220
 renault trucks 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.040
 this model is the successor of the magnum 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.860
 that we have been on our roads for 23 years 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.340
 drive around and have their eyes here 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.400
 again made a very high cabin 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.060
 I'll just show you what's new 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.160
 to the new LED lights in penalty wide 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.780
 for the for if so here you can again 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.050
 towards a truck instead of in 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.050
 a treehouse 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.750
 the new renault t series is for this 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.210
 notice a very nice opportunity to agree 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.890
 just extract significantly 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.020
 this renault they should of course not 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.120
 be as lavishly equipped as theirs 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.350
 big brothers with you but Volvo 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.420
 despite 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.830
 You can do an excellent job with the 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.050
 learn from 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.550
 driver's seat get pleasure in the 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.130
 quickness about a beautiful learning 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.660
 finish of the steering wheel that is allowed 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.700
 while being that is that is all 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.980
 very slick 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.600
 what then stands out is that the 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.970
 used plastic just another one 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.040
 less teeth are anchoring others 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.980
 brands are used to this is one 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.510
 so the renault to be a basic back 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.310
 and tools 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.280
 piece like yesterday in the presentation 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.810
 made clear 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.840
 further year this is quite a bit 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.280
 nice cabin where everything is right 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.920
 where of everything a total of seven to 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.560
 go upstairs and storage compartments 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.390
 then that is not quite hard plastic 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.300
 makes super special 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.330
 the does what it should do and almost never 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.920
 Is that exactly what matters to you? 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.400
 look this way if you have one then 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.590
 stairs to a very very good looking 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.959
 top bed I can remember from 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.790
 previous mobile that actually more 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.989
 Stretcher stand beds were that sounds 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.120
 not for youtube but it was real 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.160
 this really feels like this 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.750
 much better when we go down 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.500
 going up the stairs that looks good 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.270
 in bottom bed is nice and wide and nice 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.120
 I am convinced that an average 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.840
 driver in excellent can spend the night 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.970
 otherwise nice speakers thick 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.720
 coat hangers and I see that there is enough 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.040
 cupboard space is provided under the bed 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.310
 well that was also the case above the 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.100
 windscreen yes and then it really isn't 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.150
 so much more to be desired for the 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.270
 truck driver 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.670
 here they finish the center console 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.990
 all and a very special one 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.670
 handbrake I am you that can be seen 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.209
 brought to know that will get used to 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.010
 to be 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.020
 and that is something that arno deals with 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.030
 distinguishes it from the others 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.000
 if I go left here for a while 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.470
 naturally simple mirror houses 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.930
 makes 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.030
 I think this does inspire confidence 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.860
 soothing as me as a driver 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.650
 look in the mirror here that looks 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.570
 well from logical here also that in this or 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.420
 both brand in that beautiful 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.680
 Roll made that looks good too 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.030
 and it feels solid on one on it 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.710
 at first sight I see a lot of lights 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:25.620
 will have a ceiling like here to read like 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.260
 here near the forward so it looks 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.090
 all look good 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.940
 and that surfaces cabin floor that has 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.900
 an excellent feeling of 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.920
 spaciousness first impression 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.920
 this is a very nice one
