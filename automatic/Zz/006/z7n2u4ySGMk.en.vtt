so your directory structure may look

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.020 
so your directory structure may look
different<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:50.160> important<00:00:50.579> thing<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
different the important thing is the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.790 
different the important thing is the

DCIM<00:00:57.449> may<00:00:57.690> look<00:00:57.809> familiar<00:00:58.020> because<00:00:58.500> that's

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
DCIM may look familiar because that's

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.209 
DCIM may look familiar because that's
also<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.870> directory<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.960> exists<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> lot<00:01:02.100> of
