00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 Hello dear friends with you gents 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.670
 This is a new review of mods and the current mod. 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.130
 add us throwing axes that is 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.170
 Tomahawks will call them so and others 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.230
 items that we can throw 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.350
 there is a diamond there for example brick ingots 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.330
 etc. Coal let's Well 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.359
 let's get down to the review let's open the circle 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.090
 guide we see a couple 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:30.119
 they called here is equal to x 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.340
 Well, something like this is how to craft it 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.920
 let's say throwing ax but we look 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.300
 for this you need some kind of strap 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.750
 Kraft with this way two sticks and leather 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.850
 health is well, in principle, that's well 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.600
 just add let's say 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.420
 any ax and 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.329
 and next to this one is this rope or how it is 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.420
 call it all here and there 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.180
 put this thing and it turns out you 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.079
 throwing ax let's take go 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.739
 axes and try to throw them we take 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.510
 iron and gold we throw as you see all 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.630
 eats very cool 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.740
 as axes ik so spiderman they 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.430
 fall under this spider simple so ok 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.740
 and now from such an ax killed the creeper 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.470
 Excellent that I liked in this fashion 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.840
 then it is as if true that is 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.470
 see let us be able to whip 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.369
 foliage 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.630
 and or the ground of course all diamond ax 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.100
 will be and everything is faster but still ok let's 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.040
 go over there and watch the others 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.000
 things like crafting as well to throw them 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.979
 open again you there and see 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.140
 see our other section already below 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.460
 a little more than ordinary just next too this 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:54.840
 strap here you took let's say yes all this 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.270
 the case now you need these things so 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.340
 now we all remove the diamond 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.990
 charcoal charcoal and 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.299
 gold iron and the fireplace for now 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.569
 let u see we can now 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.849
 throw bricks 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.989
 it turns out bricks bricks in those 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:19.019
 bolt and and killed on it gold 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.530
 iron bars 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:25.280
 and with charcoal and ordinary charcoal 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.940
 Of course, diamonds let's try 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:35.910
 diamonds on the court probably that the skipper 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:39.360
 she diamond rain to you and get not 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.280

 I wanted for a long time to be there 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.650
 let's say even one brick throw 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.629
 it would have been more believable but it 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.200
 even cooler that we can axes others 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.819
