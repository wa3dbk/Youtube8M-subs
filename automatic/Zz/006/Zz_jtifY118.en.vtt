00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.960
 I will not have enough brief is a 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.090
 streak of 12 infected that good just 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.370
 eye with a large enough purpose but not 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.050
 I want to comment nothing about the game, let's go 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.970
 to do the quick things that if not 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.089
 then I roll up and I do not have time 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.699
 to nothing first of all let's look at 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:22.949
 twitter I made an instant draw 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.079
 gaming where you can get a game 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.759
 the one you want from a computer 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:30.630
 you have six to choose from, you can choose 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:33.090
 returning gta 5 or good to a 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.420
 I play that good you have in the in the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.980
 description the link to enter the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.289
 draw you just have to give 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.719
 retweet and stay there is game and not 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.399
 you have not even to follow me like that 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.230
 which is a pretty simple draw and 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.050
 for those that for all that you want 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.399
 then you can enter is not a gift that 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.019
 has offered us and I think it is 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.960
 pretty cool and they are also games that 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.309
 well it costs your money so it's 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.460
 pretty good as it is a gift because 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.609
 I tell you that I find it quite curious and 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.290
 well we have now about 380 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.990
 retweets I would like us to come to 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.110
 thousands would be a good amount for 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.670
 more than anything to thank them for the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.430
 opportunity that has given me power 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.140
 make a milestone draw 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.900
 for all of you so nothing anymore 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.720
 you know in the link you have the 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.910
 little boy and you can go in and give him 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.260
 Retweet and follow them and you can already 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.720
 enter the draw for the game that 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.250
 you want more important things 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.130
 It's Sunday morning at six in the afternoon 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.920
 streaming in tweets of games with 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.420
 subscribers in playstation 4 if you are 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.490
 listening well I know I've been around a lot 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.440
 time without playing in play 4 but tomorrow 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.090
 it's already the day I'm going to play tomorrow with 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.760
 all of you subscribers 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.440
 playstation 4 and you know how always 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.060
 that will not give me time to play with 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.700
 all but I promise that at 6 o'clock 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.500
 late if it is not at 6 will be at six and 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.759
 we will start the game with 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.430
 subscribers we will play mostly 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.410
 private because they fit more people will go 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.330
 changing approximately every three 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.149
 games will give time to play against some 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.790
 80 people so I guess as the 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.350
 previous time you were about 200 it's not going to 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.479
 give everyone time to play so no 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.190
 break your plans to play 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.430
 with me just if you are out there 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.680
 Well, you tell me on twitter that it's also 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.840
 the main road where I invite 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.240
 the people, you tell me 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.280
 Over there 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.080
 let him play with you such that 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.390
 invite and I will invite you all 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.770
 that can another important thing that you 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.600
 I want to comment that you are telling me 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.970
 that I do not answer the vast majority of 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.130
 comments for youtube and basically if 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.030
 I do not answer with text is because the great 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.780
 Most are spam 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.930
 others are criticizing and what I do in 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.820
 way that seems coolest to me is to be 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.070
 united to you through the direct 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.920
 I always do by tweets 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.690
 go out at night for most who 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.670
 you know but I always do more than 5 hours 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.140
 so it's a lot of hours 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.880
 what I do in streaming in tweets not 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.740
 you have re up but on youtube not 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.020
 assigned guys that's all that I 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.090
 I wanted to tell is something very quick but 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.950
 I hope good what 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.330
 as participants in the draw that 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.769
 participate in the battles with 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.300
 subscribers and graphics but that has 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.590
 liked it is like like favorites for more 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.590
 Greetings and see you next time
