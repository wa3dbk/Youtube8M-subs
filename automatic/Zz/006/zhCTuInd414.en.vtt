00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
 today we will talk about goku vs superman 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.590
 first I wonder who was the stupid bastard 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.559
 galloping beast 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.099
 that this was invented 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.099
 now let's talk about these two aliens 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.560
 is an extraterrestrial according to the story comes from the old planet that was the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.810
 strongest planet in the universe his real name is kaka broken they possess the 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.380
 ability to expel energy is super resistant becomes stronger when 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.880
 is about to die has several transformations can be transferred to a 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.590
 place in matters of seconds and some other things superman is a 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.190
 extraterrestrial just like goku comes from the planet krypton his abilities are 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.270
 fly at high speed travel through space super strength able to lift 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.760
 cars airplanes islands and etcetera has vision x-rays 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.440
 vision of heat and one other thing 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.260
 now I will give my opinion I think goku is stronger since we have all seen 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.010
 what is capable in the anime and I do not think superman can stand it for long 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.790
 Goku surpasses in strength and endurance superman 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.430
 superman is a man of steel then that makes you think that goku can not 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.210
 destroy the steel 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.869
 second superman was ever wounded to death by a few blows that goku can 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.330
 exceed them easily 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.740
 then do not be so stupid and do not say that superman is stronger than 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.590
 goku we all know that goku is stronger than superman who does not see what 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.770
 shit is the league of justice 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.580
 superman is a shit that goes to work with some fucking monsters 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.850
 in tuxedo the series that is more bad than magin vukic that makes for 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.520
 compare with goku 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.420
 now they come to take refuge in the comic 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.619
 to the comic I do not give a shit let's talk about who are now goku 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.660
 goes through a lot to fuck that superman 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.530
 what rays do you want to see x-rays or maybe heat vision 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.680
 so many of these tell me that superman's vision of heat is more 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.610
 strong than the average card 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.910
 that stupid bastards of shit are it seems that god put a shit on them 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.080
 instead of a brain in the head or is that they can not take the shit out of their eyes 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.109
 that do not let it see well 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:17.439
 in case the many criticize my idea I put something definitive so that it 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:18.989
 shut up your mouth 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.959
 Goku can call well in Long tells him to kill super shit sorry 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.220
 Superman in case he says no, he asks him to put five kilos of 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:29.139
 Cryptonite where it least fits
