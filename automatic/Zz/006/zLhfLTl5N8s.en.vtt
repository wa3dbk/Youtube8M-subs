00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.619 

one<00:00:05.100> really<00:00:05.430> way<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.580> get<00:00:05.819> your<00:00:05.940> finger

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
one really way to get your finger

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.839 
one really way to get your finger
picking<00:00:06.839> together<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.680> actually<00:00:08.130> start

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
picking together is actually start

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.009 
picking together is actually start
involving<00:00:09.480> cords<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:10.860> let's<00:00:11.519> take<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:12.019> nice

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
involving cords so let's take a nice

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.570 
involving cords so let's take a nice
chord<00:00:13.469> progression<00:00:14.009> here<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.219> very<00:00:14.370> simple

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
chord progression here a very simple

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.640 
chord progression here a very simple
chord<00:00:14.969> progression<00:00:15.000> just<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.960> work<00:00:16.260> out<00:00:16.470> your

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
chord progression just to work out your

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.380 
chord progression just to work out your
patterns<00:00:17.330> using<00:00:18.330> chords<00:00:19.880> let's<00:00:20.880> pick<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.210> key

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
patterns using chords let's pick the key

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.790 
patterns using chords let's pick the key
of<00:00:21.539> D<00:00:21.720> for<00:00:22.230> something<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.529> little<00:00:22.710> bit

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
of D for something a little bit

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.710 
of D for something a little bit
different<00:00:23.100> here<00:00:23.220> today<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:24.449> three

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
different here today and the three

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.240 
different here today and the three
chords<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.170> I'm<00:00:25.260> going<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.470> use<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.949> going<00:00:26.130> to

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
chords that I'm going to use is going to

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.880 
chords that I'm going to use is going to
be<00:00:26.340> D<00:00:27.800> G

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
be D G

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.350 
be D G
and<00:00:30.160> a<00:00:30.840> those<00:00:31.840> chords<00:00:32.580> so<00:00:33.580> let's<00:00:33.940> start<00:00:34.180> off

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
and a those chords so let's start off

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.620 
and a those chords so let's start off
with<00:00:34.630> our<00:00:34.810> first<00:00:35.200> pattern<00:00:35.590> is<00:00:35.860> going<00:00:36.190> to<00:00:36.280> be

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
with our first pattern is going to be

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:53.520 
with our first pattern is going to be
thumb<00:00:37.630> index<00:00:37.960> middle<00:00:38.860> ring

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.730 

so<00:00:54.400> the<00:00:54.520> idea<00:00:54.850> is<00:00:55.000> to<00:00:55.030> to<00:00:55.750> practice<00:00:56.290> it<00:00:56.470> with

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
so the idea is to to practice it with

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.260 
so the idea is to to practice it with
with<00:00:57.100> different<00:00:57.250> chords<00:00:57.850> in<00:00:57.970> a<00:00:58.060> chord

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
with different chords in a chord

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.700 
with different chords in a chord
progression<00:00:58.300> so<00:00:58.840> that<00:00:58.989> you<00:00:59.080> can<00:00:59.260> keep<00:00:59.470> that

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
progression so that you can keep that

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.540 
progression so that you can keep that
flow<00:01:00.130> going

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
flow going

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.370 
flow going
at<00:01:01.420> first<00:01:01.809> it<00:01:02.020> may<00:01:02.050> sound<00:01:02.410> like<00:01:02.530> this

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.380 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.610 

switching<00:01:06.380> to<00:01:06.470> a<00:01:06.500> new<00:01:06.560> corridor<00:01:07.480> and<00:01:08.620> then

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
switching to a new corridor and then

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.370 
switching to a new corridor and then
whoa<00:01:09.890> new<00:01:10.340> cord<00:01:10.730> but<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:11.750> idea<00:01:12.020> is<00:01:12.050> you<00:01:12.110> want

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
whoa new cord but the idea is you want

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:22.710 
whoa new cord but the idea is you want
to<00:01:12.440> make<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:12.740> nice<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:12.920> smooth

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.310 

and<00:01:23.320> then<00:01:23.950> try<00:01:24.340> different<00:01:24.640> patterns<00:01:25.320> I'm

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
and then try different patterns I'm

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.500 
and then try different patterns I'm
going<00:01:26.470> to<00:01:26.530> do<00:01:26.680> something<00:01:26.980> a<00:01:27.370> little<00:01:28.210> different

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
going to do something a little different

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.050 
going to do something a little different
here<00:01:28.600> I'm<00:01:28.660> going<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:28.810> go<00:01:28.960> thumb<00:01:29.650> ring<00:01:30.610> middle

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
here I'm going to go thumb ring middle

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:41.560 
here I'm going to go thumb ring middle
index

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.620 

and<00:01:41.960> then<00:01:42.940> another<00:01:43.940> pattern<00:01:44.390> that<00:01:44.480> we've

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
and then another pattern that we've

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.160 
and then another pattern that we've
talked<00:01:44.900> about<00:01:45.050> before<00:01:45.410> which<00:01:46.370> is<00:01:46.400> thumb<00:01:47.360> index

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
talked about before which is thumb index

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.570 
talked about before which is thumb index
middle<00:01:48.800> ring<00:01:49.840> middle<00:01:50.840> index<00:01:52.150> middle<00:01:53.150> index

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
middle ring middle index middle index

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.560 
middle ring middle index middle index
sounds<00:01:55.580> really<00:01:55.760> complicated<00:01:55.880> but<00:01:56.330> it's<00:01:56.450> not

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
sounds really complicated but it's not

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:08.680 
sounds really complicated but it's not
really<00:01:56.750> that<00:01:56.870> complicated<00:01:57.220> slow

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.080 

now<00:02:09.500> let's<00:02:09.710> try<00:02:09.860> it<00:02:09.980> slowly<00:02:10.100> moving<00:02:10.790> through

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
now let's try it slowly moving through

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:32.380 
now let's try it slowly moving through
that<00:02:11.210> same<00:02:11.480> chord<00:02:11.870> progression

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.020 

try<00:02:33.390> out<00:02:33.540> different<00:02:33.570> patterns<00:02:34.380> uh<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:35.520> maybe

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
try out different patterns uh that maybe

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.050 
try out different patterns uh that maybe
involve<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.750> three<00:02:37.500> feel<00:02:37.890> would<00:02:38.370> be<00:02:38.550> great<00:02:38.820> and

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
involve a three feel would be great and

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.270 
involve a three feel would be great and
try<00:02:39.990> exploring<00:02:40.560> making<00:02:40.950> up<00:02:41.070> your<00:02:41.160> own

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
try exploring making up your own

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.510 
try exploring making up your own
patterns<00:02:41.670> it's<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.120> lot<00:02:42.270> of<00:02:42.300> fun
