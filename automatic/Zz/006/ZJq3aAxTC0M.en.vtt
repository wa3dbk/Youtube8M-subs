especially<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.710> swept<00:03:44.010> week<00:03:44.220> in<00:03:44.370> which<00:03:44.520> swept

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
especially the swept week in which swept

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.910 
especially the swept week in which swept
wing<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.330> flight<00:03:45.600> is<00:03:45.810> very<00:03:46.020> very<00:03:46.170> nice<00:03:46.440> and

wing the flight is very very nice and

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.760 
wing the flight is very very nice and
landing<00:03:47.640> is<00:03:47.790> incredible<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.840> like<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.410> landing

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
landing is incredible I like the landing

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.370 
landing is incredible I like the landing
because<00:03:50.100> it<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.580> comes<00:03:50.910> very<00:03:51.090> slowly<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:52.200> can

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
because it it comes very slowly you can

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.700 
because it it comes very slowly you can
put<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.620> full<00:03:53.340> flaps<00:03:53.580> flaps<00:03:54.060> down<00:03:54.150> for<00:03:54.780> 40<00:03:55.260> flops

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
put a full flaps flaps down for 40 flops

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.420 
put a full flaps flaps down for 40 flops
and<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.970> little<00:03:57.750> pitch<00:03:57.930> down<00:03:58.110> effect<00:03:58.500> is<00:03:58.950> equal

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
and a little pitch down effect is equal

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.820 
and a little pitch down effect is equal
to<00:03:59.550> mix<00:03:59.730> with<00:03:59.850> the<00:03:59.910> elevator<00:04:00.330> and<00:04:01.290> it's<00:04:01.620> very

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
to mix with the elevator and it's very

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:11.160 
to mix with the elevator and it's very
easy<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.160> to<00:04:02.460> to<00:04:02.610> to<00:04:02.640> run
