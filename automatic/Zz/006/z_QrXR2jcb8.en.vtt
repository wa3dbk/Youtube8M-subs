motor doing the water pump on it so
pretty<00:00:13.469> involved<00:00:14.040> job<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.610> think<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.660> book

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
pretty involved job I think the book

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.930 
pretty involved job I think the book
times<00:00:16.139> like<00:00:16.379> five<00:00:16.650> hours<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.220> there<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:17.760> I'm

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
times like five hours on there so I'm

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.420 
times like five hours on there so I'm
doing<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.210> thermostat<00:00:18.720> also<00:00:19.230> set<00:00:19.650> ads<00:00:19.920> think

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
doing a thermostat also set ads think

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.279 
doing a thermostat also set ads think
like<00:00:20.550> another<00:00:20.820> one<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> half<00:00:21.810> hours<00:00:22.170> or

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289

intake plenum both valve covers which
you<00:01:15.330> can<00:01:15.509> see<00:01:15.659> I've<00:01:15.810> already<00:01:16.049> cleaned<00:01:16.500> up

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
you can see I've already cleaned up

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.130 
you can see I've already cleaned up
somewhat<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.610> replaced<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.540> gaskets<00:01:19.350> uh<00:01:21.140> as

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
somewhat and replaced the gaskets uh as

somewhat and replaced the gaskets uh as
you<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:22.350> see<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.770> engines<00:01:23.189> really<00:01:23.759> sludged

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
you can see this engines really sludged

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.810 
you can see this engines really sludged
up<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.840> mean<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.350> pretty<00:01:25.950> nasty<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.670> there

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
up I mean it's pretty nasty in there

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.550 
up I mean it's pretty nasty in there
this<00:01:27.090> thing's<00:01:27.299> probably<00:01:27.570> had<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> stucco

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
this thing's probably had a stucco

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.760 
this thing's probably had a stucco
pathway<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.340> pile<00:01:29.579> back<00:01:29.820> there<00:01:30.090> yuck<00:01:30.770> up

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
pathway that pile back there yuck up

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.319 
pathway that pile back there yuck up
here<00:01:32.720> anyway<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.110> uh<00:01:34.280> you<00:01:35.280> proceeded<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.939> tear

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
here anyway and uh you proceeded to tear

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.749 
here anyway and uh you proceeded to tear
apart<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.689> front<00:01:36.930> end<00:01:37.159> or<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> front<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
apart the front end or the front of the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.410 
apart the front end or the front of the
motor<00:01:38.939> here<00:01:39.799> I'm<00:01:40.799> going<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.040> take<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.420> pulley

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
motor here I'm going to take the pulley

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.020 
motor here I'm going to take the pulley
off<00:01:42.689> here<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.409> one<00:01:43.710> one<00:01:44.159> bolt<00:01:44.430> holding<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.880> on

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
off here it's one one bolt holding it on

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.080 
off here it's one one bolt holding it on
think<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> 21<00:01:46.200> millimeter<00:01:46.850> but<00:01:47.850> it's

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
think it's like a 21 millimeter but it's

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.600 
think it's like a 21 millimeter but it's
a<00:01:48.210> press<00:01:48.450> fit<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.869> there<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.350> need<00:01:49.530> a

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
a press fit on there so you need a

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.310 
a press fit on there so you need a
three-pronged<00:01:50.610> puller<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.270> get<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.540> off<00:01:51.720> as

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
three-pronged puller to get it off as

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.899 
three-pronged puller to get it off as
you<00:01:52.439> can<00:01:52.560> see<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.829> grabs<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.340> backside<00:01:53.880> of

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
you can see it grabs on the backside of

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.190 
you can see it grabs on the backside of
this<00:01:55.219> too<00:01:56.219> bad<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.630> take<00:01:57.899> your<00:01:58.049> time

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
this too bad on that and take your time

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.139 
this too bad on that and take your time
and<00:01:58.409> cover<00:01:58.560> off<00:01:58.829> as<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> dead<00:01:59.430> looks<00:01:59.640> like<00:01:59.880> I've

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
and cover off as a dead looks like I've

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.800 
and cover off as a dead looks like I've
already<00:02:00.299> clean<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.780> up<00:02:00.810> put<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.710> new<00:02:01.829> oil<00:02:02.810> seal

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
already clean that up put a new oil seal

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.600 
already clean that up put a new oil seal
on<00:02:03.960> there<00:02:04.549> um<00:02:05.549> anyway<00:02:06.390> then<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.840> take<00:02:07.200> your

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
on there um anyway then you take your

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.840 
on there um anyway then you take your
timing<00:02:08.610> chain<00:02:08.879> adjuster<00:02:09.330> out<00:02:09.950> tensioner

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
timing chain adjuster out tensioner

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.990 
timing chain adjuster out tensioner
goes<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.270> side<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.690> head<00:02:13.170> here<00:02:14.000> and

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
goes in the side of the head here and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.830 
goes in the side of the head here and
this<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:15.990> what<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.560> looks<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.780> show<00:02:18.780> you

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
this is what that looks like show you

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.750 
this is what that looks like show you
the<00:02:18.990> basics<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:19.710> that<00:02:19.920> real<00:02:20.130> quick<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.550> know<00:02:20.640> I'm

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
the basics on that real quick I know I'm

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.100 
the basics on that real quick I know I'm
kind<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.000> jumping<00:02:21.270> around<00:02:21.360> here<00:02:21.780> but<00:02:21.930> just

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
kind of jumping around here but just

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.290 
kind of jumping around here but just
giving<00:02:22.320> you<00:02:22.380> some<00:02:22.410> tidbits<00:02:23.310> information<00:02:24.120> it's

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
giving you some tidbits information it's

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.410 
giving you some tidbits information it's
a<00:02:25.250> hydraulic<00:02:26.250> tensioner<00:02:26.490> so<00:02:27.090> there's<00:02:27.300> a

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
a hydraulic tensioner so there's a

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.290 
a hydraulic tensioner so there's a
little<00:02:27.750> ball<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:28.830> there<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.250> lift<00:02:29.460> focus<00:02:30.120> on

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
little ball in there and lift focus on

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.540 
little ball in there and lift focus on
that<00:02:30.480> but<00:02:30.810> basically<00:02:31.560> there's<00:02:32.070> a<00:02:32.160> special

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
that but basically there's a special

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.130 
that but basically there's a special
tool<00:02:32.730> you're<00:02:32.880> supposed<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.240> use<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.780> depress

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
tool you're supposed to use you depress

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.040 
tool you're supposed to use you depress
that<00:02:34.380> ball<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.070> then<00:02:35.850> compress<00:02:36.270> this<00:02:36.510> with

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
that ball and then compress this with

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.810 
that ball and then compress this with
your<00:02:37.230> hand<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.950> oil<00:02:38.130> will<00:02:38.280> come<00:02:38.490> out<00:02:38.670> the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
your hand and the oil will come out the

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.500 
your hand and the oil will come out the
backside<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:40.100> then<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.940> reset<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.480> you

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
backside of it and then to reset it you

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.510 
backside of it and then to reset it you
basically<00:02:42.930> push<00:02:43.110> it<00:02:43.260> down<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.830> locks<00:02:44.340> in

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
basically push it down and it locks in

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.080 
basically push it down and it locks in
place<00:02:45.710> when<00:02:46.710> you<00:02:46.740> reinstall<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.910> have

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
place when you reinstall it and you have

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.500 
place when you reinstall it and you have
the<00:02:48.270> engine<00:02:48.600> all<00:02:48.860> properly<00:02:49.860> timed<00:02:50.510> you'll

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
the engine all properly timed you'll

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.600 
the engine all properly timed you'll
actually<00:02:51.720> just<00:02:52.080> push<00:02:52.680> in<00:02:52.890> on<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.040> plunger

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
actually just push in on that plunger

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.550 
actually just push in on that plunger
and<00:02:53.820> it<00:02:53.940> will<00:02:54.150> spring<00:02:54.480> out<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.930> then<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.230> sits

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
and it will spring out and then it sits

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.600 
and it will spring out and then it sits
set<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:55.950> ready<00:02:56.100> to<00:02:56.160> go

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
set and ready to go

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.270 
set and ready to go
it'll<00:02:57.060> get<00:02:57.150> oil<00:02:57.420> pressure<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:58.100> make<00:02:59.100> sure

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
it'll get oil pressure and make sure

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.310 
it'll get oil pressure and make sure
when<00:02:59.490> you<00:02:59.580> look<00:02:59.790> in<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.090> before<00:03:00.720> put<00:03:01.050> it<00:03:01.140> back

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
when you look in it before put it back

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.230 
when you look in it before put it back
in<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:01.710> this<00:03:01.860> ball<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.580> there<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:02.820> seated

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
in that this ball in there is seated

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.180 
in that this ball in there is seated
properly<00:03:03.390> because<00:03:03.990> if<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.680> were<00:03:04.770> to<00:03:04.860> push<00:03:05.040> it

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
properly because if you were to push it

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.730 
properly because if you were to push it
in<00:03:05.280> there<00:03:05.400> too<00:03:05.610> far<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.170> wasn't<00:03:07.290> seated

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
in there too far and it wasn't seated

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.320 
in there too far and it wasn't seated
well<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.190> wouldn't<00:03:08.400> hold<00:03:08.490> oil<00:03:08.790> pressure<00:03:09.060> in

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
well it wouldn't hold oil pressure in

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.480 
well it wouldn't hold oil pressure in
there<00:03:09.840> when<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.230> engine<00:03:10.650> shuts<00:03:10.920> off<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.430> it

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
there when the engine shuts off and it

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.490 
there when the engine shuts off and it
would<00:03:11.580> drain<00:03:11.790> out<00:03:12.030> you'd<00:03:12.720> have<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.930> noisy

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
would drain out you'd have a noisy

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.850 
would drain out you'd have a noisy
timing<00:03:13.920> chain<00:03:14.130> condition<00:03:14.700> when<00:03:14.850> it's<00:03:15.030> cold

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
timing chain condition when it's cold

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.140 
timing chain condition when it's cold
probably<00:03:16.860> up<00:03:16.980> jumping<00:03:17.340> off<00:03:17.460> at<00:03:17.700> some<00:03:17.910> point

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
probably up jumping off at some point

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.280 
probably up jumping off at some point
too<00:03:18.360> so<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:18.810> wouldn't<00:03:19.020> be<00:03:19.080> good

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
too so that wouldn't be good

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.460 
too so that wouldn't be good
this<00:03:20.190> isn't<00:03:20.490> interference<00:03:20.970> engine<00:03:21.390> so<00:03:21.990> anyway

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
this isn't interference engine so anyway

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.010 
this isn't interference engine so anyway
back<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.710> water<00:03:23.070> pump<00:03:23.400> once<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.330> get<00:03:24.510> all<00:03:24.690> that

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
back to water pump once you get all that

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.640 
back to water pump once you get all that
off<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.740> water<00:03:25.980> pump<00:03:26.340> mounts<00:03:27.560> inside<00:03:28.560> the

off the water pump mounts inside the

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.070 
off the water pump mounts inside the
block<00:03:28.860> right<00:03:29.130> there<00:03:29.430> get<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.450> good<00:03:30.600> picture<00:03:30.870> of

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
block right there get a good picture of

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.340 
block right there get a good picture of
all<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.350> poles<00:03:31.590> there<00:03:32.780> this<00:03:33.780> pump<00:03:34.140> was

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
all the poles there this pump was

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.090 
all the poles there this pump was
leaking<00:03:34.910> here's<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.120> old<00:03:36.270> pump<00:03:36.890> it's<00:03:37.890> driven

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
leaking here's the old pump it's driven

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.020 
leaking here's the old pump it's driven
by<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.340> timing<00:03:38.790> chain<00:03:38.820> obviously<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:40.580> so<00:03:41.580> when

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
by a timing chain obviously and so when

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.240 
by a timing chain obviously and so when
this<00:03:42.240> weep<00:03:42.630> hole<00:03:42.930> starts<00:03:43.500> leaking<00:03:43.740> on<00:03:44.070> this

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
this weep hole starts leaking on this

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.310 
this weep hole starts leaking on this
pump<00:03:44.580> it<00:03:44.820> comes<00:03:45.810> down<00:03:46.520> this<00:03:47.520> bore<00:03:48.000> here<00:03:48.330> comes

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
pump it comes down this bore here comes

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.100 
pump it comes down this bore here comes
out<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.680> back<00:03:49.980> side<00:03:50.310> into<00:03:51.060> this<00:03:51.240> port<00:03:51.690> through

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
out the back side into this port through

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.740 
out the back side into this port through
you<00:03:52.260> know<00:03:52.320> through<00:03:52.560> this<00:03:52.650> port<00:03:52.920> here<00:03:53.600> into<00:03:54.600> the

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
you know through this port here into the

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.130 
you know through this port here into the
block<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:57.150> then<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.630> comes<00:03:57.840> out<00:03:57.990> the<00:03:58.110> other

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
block and then it comes out the other

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.620 
block and then it comes out the other
side<00:03:58.320> somewhere<00:03:58.890> down<00:03:59.070> here<00:03:59.100> so<00:03:59.670> it's<00:04:00.420> what

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
side somewhere down here so it's what

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.840 
side somewhere down here so it's what
was<00:04:00.810> leaking<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:01.530> yeah<00:04:02.340> so<00:04:02.580> that's<00:04:02.670> what

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
was leaking and yeah so that's what

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.930 
was leaking and yeah so that's what
we're<00:04:03.000> doing<00:04:04.130> trying<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.190> take<00:04:05.340> anything<00:04:05.610> else

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
we're doing trying to take anything else
