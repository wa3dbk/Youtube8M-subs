00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.900 
gamecube version of the game is actually
a<00:02:22.790> different<00:02:23.090> story<00:02:23.330> though<00:02:24.190> it's<00:02:25.190> really

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
a different story though it's really

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.390 
a different story though it's really

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
stuttering a lot of spots you'll notice

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.130 
stuttering a lot of spots you'll notice
like<00:02:28.700> when<00:02:28.849> playing<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.180> tennis<00:02:29.629> mini<00:02:29.840> game
