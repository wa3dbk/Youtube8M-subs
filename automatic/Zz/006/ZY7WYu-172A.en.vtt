00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
I think he's basically a normal link

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.160 
I think he's basically a normal link
with<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> giant<00:00:41.070> bomb<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.300> regular<00:00:42.780> boomerang

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
that doesn't have any gust on it it's a

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:45.830 
that doesn't have any gust on it it's a
little<00:00:44.879> bit<00:00:45.000> more<00:00:45.210> straightforward

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
little bit more straightforward

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.130 
little bit more straightforward
yeah<00:00:46.050> that's<00:00:46.379> yes<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> job<00:00:47.480> I<00:00:48.480> think

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
yeah that's yes I do have a job I think

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.470 
yeah that's yes I do have a job I think
my<00:00:49.260> pit<00:00:49.530> his<00:00:49.860> upper<00:00:50.190> -<00:00:50.340> like<00:00:50.610> goes<00:00:50.879> further<00:00:51.210> but

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
my pit his upper - like goes further but

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.060 
my pit his upper - like goes further but
he<00:00:51.570> slides<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:52.230> like<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> last<00:00:52.530> half<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.920> it

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
he slides for like the last half of it

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.490 
he slides for like the last half of it
so<00:00:53.250> he's<00:00:53.520> really<00:00:53.670> hard<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.000> control<00:00:54.410> so<00:00:55.410> you're

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500

know yeah it would be better in a bigger
stage<00:04:07.060> but<00:04:07.330> essentially<00:04:07.959> Sasebo<00:04:08.530> works<00:04:08.769> means

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
stage but essentially Sasebo works means

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.250 
stage but essentially Sasebo works means
he<00:04:09.610> moves<00:04:10.000> faster<00:04:10.390> it<00:04:10.540> has<00:04:10.570> better<00:04:10.900> traction

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
he moves faster it has better traction

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:18.140 
he moves faster it has better traction
so<00:04:11.650> he<00:04:11.920> can<00:04:12.070> turn<00:04:12.220> faster<00:04:13.650> no<00:04:14.650> no<00:04:14.860> no<00:04:15.130> no<00:04:15.489> no
