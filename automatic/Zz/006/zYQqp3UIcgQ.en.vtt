00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.349
 the images that we will see next 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.470
 are the first three-dimensional paintings without the need for 

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:30.619
 use glasses 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.649
 As the video recording the image becomes again two-dimensional it has 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.420
 planned the camera so that it can be perceived in the best way possible that in 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.420
 Reality is three-dimensional 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.050
 the search for three-dimensionality in painting goes back to the times of 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.430
 Renaissance 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.840
 when leonardo da vinci establishes in his writings that the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.120
 painting can not represent reality to the ultimate consequences 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.070
 since it presents it as seen by a single eye 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.380
 and tivissa and explains for the first time for the art world 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.700
 as man actually perceives objects in a three-dimensional way to 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.930
 through binocular vision 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.870
 a case of intense search was that of salvador dalÃ­ 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.860
 carr resorted to the outside copy 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.880
 both with the grid of three thousand 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.330
 where he was invited because he could not exceed the size of the postcards 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.630
 as with the method wearing glasses that did not prosper for the same reasons as 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.610
 failed in the cinematograph 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.610
 your discomfort and lack of precision 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.780
 when they award Kameni aborted the Nobel Prize for the invention of the hologram 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.350
 such and summoned him to jointly perform works of art 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.220
 three-dimensional 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.360
 unfortunately the hologram did not develop as I expected there over 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.320
 all in color resolution 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.450
 and this also did not prosper 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.470
 but he tried to take the volitional three-dimensional lunar walk over all the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.230
 figurative painting I do not know that through all the history of art 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.659
 this system allows what was not possible through stereoscopy the 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.989
 exterior graffiti deny achieves trust 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.879
 makes it possible for the images to be three-dimensional without glasses 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.469
 difference from the first 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.719
 without having to put your eyes out of focus as in the second 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:33.239
 and without the need to use laser technology like in the third 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.370
 It also allows a three-dimensional painting with total freedom that 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.329
 execution size 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.899
 no color limits like the hologram 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:45.899
 and without restrictions to produce all kinds of images 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:50.339
 both reproductions of reality and free creations of the artist 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:55.909
 in this case they become three-dimensional both in the images of great realism 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:01.149
 and detail as gestural feature works or simply works heist
