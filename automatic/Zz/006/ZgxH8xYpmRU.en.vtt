00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.879
 with people we are at the heart of the 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:06.040
 fog and I'll show you a new thing 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:08.080
 fields is here in pvp which are the 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.790
 reward routes here you can see the 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.700
 that I have available but if we are going to 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.990
 all come out all there 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.950
 some come out with padlocks because I have not 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.470
 done what I had to do to 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.419
 unlock it but if we put the mouse 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.399
 over we can see that in this case we 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:24.030
 asks that we have complete the mode 

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:25.860
 History of Citadel of the Flame 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.720
 what we're going to get when 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.070
 let's go completing this bar then 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.860
 it will be these chests that we have here 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.500
 up are normal chests of champions 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.360
 and then we have weapons boxes in this 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.250
 case will give because these of the of the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.270
 dungeon the only thing that has let me do 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.970
 is this 25% there yesterday yesterday today 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.530
 you will leave I guess that another other portion 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.180
 up to this point 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.430
 the next day until here and then at 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.949
 final is going to give us a box of armors 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.079
 in this case it will be a box of 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.149
 full armor and we will not have to 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.910
 choose then if we want light weighing or 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.220
 half 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.540
 here we have the baltazar we can go 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.750
 activating as you see as we want 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.610
 complete we can go activating 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.590
 it is indicating for example in this that 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.370
 and this is what I carry in this does not lead 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.370
 absolutely nothing 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.290
 and in this case in the baltazar 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.910
 apart we will not have to take from 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.760
 weapons as we have here we have them 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.770
 other things we also have chests of 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.510
 These champions will also give general 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.250
 dragon and is and empire os fragments by 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.650
 example 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.480
 the last reward that interests us is 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.620
 a baltazar backpack is a design 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.990
 exclusive that is only going to be able 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.610
 get here so if you want it 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.030
 because you will not be forced to 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.860
 do this 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.420
 You can see here that we also have 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.790
 other other stars would be boxes of 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.979
 weapons of honor of the waves and in this 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.890
 case we also have minerals here 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.659
 dragon and is obsidian and this chest is 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.700
 one of the interesting things another if 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.009
 you are doing a legendary because you 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.110
 It gives minerals to the dragon and is obsidian 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.140
 and mystic shamrocks so if not 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.350
 you want to be with the forge trying 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.850
 here you know that they will give you insurance and 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.430
 here you can see that we have a little arrow 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.200
 which he says is repeatable in the case of 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.209
 baltazar is not repeatable it does not have 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.530
 little arrow but in this case if you want 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.900
 repeat as many times as you want 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.380
 Here I show a box of weapons of 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.540
 so you can see what they give you 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.370
 We have here with several stands all 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.019
 corners of the dungeon 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.730
 and then leave us the option to save 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.489
 for later if you do not want to catch 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.769
 since you have to pay attention to what it says 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.620
 the liver in acquisition so with 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.480
 the pj you are going to take the object then 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.010
 will stay linked unlock is the 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.080
 design and you will stay with the weapon 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.700
 well this what I wanted to comment and 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.700
 until the video and until next time
