things<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:26.130> will<00:01:26.280> cause<00:01:26.520> frustration<00:01:26.939> we're

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
things that will cause frustration we're

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.179 
things that will cause frustration we're
talking<00:01:27.990> about<00:01:28.110> one<00:01:28.409> today<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.920> we're<00:01:29.100> gonna

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
talking about one today and we're gonna

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.440 
talking about one today and we're gonna
also<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:29.670> talking<00:01:29.820> about<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.180> other<00:01:30.299> one

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
also be talking about the other one

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.149 
also be talking about the other one
tomorrow<00:01:30.720> but<00:01:31.020> basically<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.680> two<00:01:31.829> things

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
tomorrow but basically the two things

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.550 
tomorrow but basically the two things
are<00:01:32.520> first<00:01:32.970> when<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> champion<00:01:34.110> feels<00:01:34.320> like

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
are first when a champion feels like

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.109 
are first when a champion feels like
there's<00:01:34.740> no<00:01:34.799> counter<00:01:35.430> play<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.970> and

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
there's no counter play to it and

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.450 
there's no counter play to it and
secondly<00:01:36.810> when<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> champion<00:01:37.829> feels<00:01:38.100> like<00:01:38.310> it

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
secondly when a champion feels like it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.370 
secondly when a champion feels like it
doesn't<00:01:38.670> take<00:01:39.030> skill<00:01:39.540> like<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.900> personal

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
doesn't take skill like a personal

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.859 
doesn't take skill like a personal
