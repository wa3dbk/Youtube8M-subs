00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.959 
side you could do both sides if you
wanted<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.200> but<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.740> did<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> broad<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.789> so

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
wanted to but I did on the broad and so

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:53.179 
wanted to but I did on the broad and so
that<00:01:51.119> when<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.270> store<00:01:51.570> them<00:01:51.719> vertically<00:01:52.189> that

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
that when I store them vertically that

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.550 
that when I store them vertically that
choose<00:01:53.460> other<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.630> brush<00:01:54.840> nib<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.140> pointing

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
choose other the brush nib is pointing

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.590 
choose other the brush nib is pointing
down<00:01:55.770> because<00:01:56.100> that's<00:01:56.219> how<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.090> like<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.329> do<00:01:57.509> it

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
down because that's how I like to do it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.789 
down because that's how I like to do it
but<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.780> normally<00:01:58.140> store<00:01:58.380> them<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.649> this

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
but I normally store them like this

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.359 
but I normally store them like this
anyways<00:01:59.250> so<00:02:00.000> yeah<00:02:00.320> this<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.710> my<00:02:01.950> total
