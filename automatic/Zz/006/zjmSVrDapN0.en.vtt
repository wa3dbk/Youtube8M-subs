00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.229
 and 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.969
 very good girls very good guys I am 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:11.309
 what are you doing, I hope you are 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.380
 all very well today I tell you a 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.240
 really spectacular news and that is 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.029
 Japan plans to build a plant 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.779
 giant solar energy around the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.689
 moon the japanese company himizu is 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.720
 proposes to start installing in 2035 the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.240
 solar power plant moon ring in the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.430
 satellite of the earth to start the 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.100
 company plans to build the factories 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.579
 that will produce the solar panels that 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.070
 will ride on the moon shimizu presents 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.129
 your project as a solution for the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.800
 climate crisis will install a group of 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.860
 400-km solar panels 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.649
 width and a length of 11 thousand 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.199
 kilometers in the equator of the moon to 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.480
 produce carbon-free energy that 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.789
 will be delivered in the form of a microwave 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.039
 will adapt the soil so that plants 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.350
 energy of our planet the 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.270
 turn into electricity 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.080
 machinery and equipment are 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.100
 will ride in space and subsequently 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.340
 will land on the surface of the moon 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.950
 where they will be installed is said in the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.350
 proposal the robots will perform in the 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.780
 surface of various tasks like 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.270
 ground leveling and excavation of 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.940
 the hard strata have secured the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.200
 representatives of the company to 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.930
 difference of power plants 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.750
 solar terrestrial solar panels 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.119
 orbitals can generate energy during 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.039
 all day but the cost of the 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.470
 installation of solar panels in orbit 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.850
 would be much higher than that of the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.479
 construction of a power plant 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.270
 photovoltaics on our planet fits 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.149
 remember that the Japanese company shimizu 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.119
 is known for a series of projects 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.119
 little credible among them the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.670
 pyramid cities and the space hotel 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.759
 I do not know what you think but 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.090
 we would really convert the satellite from 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.509
 the earth in an artificial sun but 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.299
 really if it works 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.829
 so forward a little kiss to all guys and 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.239
 see you in another video more of this 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.239
 channel until next time
