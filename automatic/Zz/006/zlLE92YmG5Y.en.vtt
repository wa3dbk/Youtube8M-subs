take you a you know a good seven years

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.550 
take you a you know a good seven years
to<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.860> rest<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.130> your<00:01:53.220> life<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.640> master<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.210> so

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
to the rest of your life to master it so

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.080 
to the rest of your life to master it so
it's<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.740> four<00:01:56.340> minutes<00:01:56.460> out<00:01:56.730> of<00:01:56.790> practice

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
it's just four minutes out of practice

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.630 
it's just four minutes out of practice
so<00:01:57.780> we're<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.260> the<00:01:58.290> infancy<00:01:58.710> but<00:01:58.860> we

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
so we're just in the infancy but we

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.990 
so we're just in the infancy but we
think<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.150> it<00:02:00.390> will<00:02:00.650> stick<00:02:01.650> and<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.100> lasts

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
think that it will stick and and lasts

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.920 
think that it will stick and and lasts
forever<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:04.820> think<00:02:05.820> it's<00:02:06.000> gonna<00:02:06.180> go<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.570> do<00:02:06.630> well

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
forever I think it's gonna go I do well

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.359 
forever I think it's gonna go I do well
I<00:02:06.960> think<00:02:07.110> there's<00:02:07.470> enough<00:02:07.710> interest<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.250> it

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
I think there's enough interest in it

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.940 
I think there's enough interest in it
that<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.700> will<00:02:08.790> when<00:02:09.750> my<00:02:09.899> days<00:02:10.170> are<00:02:10.410> done<00:02:10.890> here

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
that it will when my days are done here

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.040 
that it will when my days are done here
and<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.400> step<00:02:11.640> back<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:12.150> there's<00:02:12.750> going<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.020> be

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
and I step back that there's going to be

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.550 
and I step back that there's going to be
plenty<00:02:13.230> others<00:02:13.650> step<00:02:13.950> in<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.220> take<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.460> over
