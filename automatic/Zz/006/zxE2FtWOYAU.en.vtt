00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
today's episode let's take a look at how

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.410 
today's episode let's take a look at how
you<00:00:04.529> can<00:00:04.589> monitor<00:00:05.130> your<00:00:05.400> MacBooks<00:00:05.940> battery

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
you can monitor your MacBooks battery

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.650 
you can monitor your MacBooks battery
very<00:00:06.990> closely<00:00:10.910> so<00:00:11.910> I've<00:00:12.000> been<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.150> powerbook

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
very closely so I've been a powerbook

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.749 
very closely so I've been a powerbook
and<00:00:12.870> macbook<00:00:13.380> user<00:00:13.590> for<00:00:13.889> years<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.549> one<00:00:14.700> of

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
and macbook user for years and one of

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.010 
and macbook user for years and one of
the<00:00:14.849> things<00:00:15.000> we<00:00:15.150> have<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.389> worry<00:00:15.509> about<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.870> of

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
the things we have to worry about is of

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.450 
the things we have to worry about is of
course<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.410> batteries<00:00:16.770> we<00:00:16.980> got<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.190> replace

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
course the batteries we got to replace

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.429 
course the batteries we got to replace
them<00:00:17.640> every<00:00:17.699> once<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> while<00:00:18.300> monitor<00:00:19.230> their

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
them every once in a while monitor their

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.490 
them every once in a while monitor their
condition<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:19.859> also<00:00:20.699> keep<00:00:21.539> tabs<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:22.170> how<00:00:22.380> much

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
condition and also keep tabs on how much

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.080 
condition and also keep tabs on how much
powers<00:00:22.920> left<00:00:23.100> if<00:00:23.310> we're<00:00:23.430> not<00:00:23.490> plugged<00:00:23.880> into

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
powers left if we're not plugged into

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.570 
powers left if we're not plugged into
the<00:00:24.210> wall<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:25.350> there's<00:00:25.650> actually<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.400> really

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
the wall so there's actually a really

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.740 
the wall so there's actually a really
good<00:00:26.760> way<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.939> do<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.359> most<00:00:27.510> people

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
good way to do this that most people

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.660 
good way to do this that most people
don't<00:00:27.779> know<00:00:28.140> about<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:29.130> system<00:00:29.460> profiler

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
don't know about in the system profiler

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.849 
don't know about in the system profiler
which<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.630> an<00:00:30.810> application<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.380> comes<00:00:31.619> with

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
which is an application that comes with

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.920 
which is an application that comes with
your<00:00:31.980> Mac<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.790> can<00:00:32.940> go<00:00:33.059> ahead<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.329> monitor

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
your Mac you can go ahead and monitor

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.799 
your Mac you can go ahead and monitor
very<00:00:34.079> closely<00:00:34.760> exactly<00:00:35.760> how<00:00:35.880> much<00:00:36.000> power<00:00:36.300> your

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
very closely exactly how much power your

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.840 
very closely exactly how much power your
battery<00:00:36.960> has<00:00:37.410> right<00:00:37.710> now<00:00:37.739> how<00:00:38.340> much<00:00:38.489> total

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
battery has right now how much total

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.869 
battery has right now how much total
capacity<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.809> how<00:00:40.170> much<00:00:40.320> you're<00:00:40.469> using<00:00:40.879> so

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
capacity is and how much you're using so

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.940 
capacity is and how much you're using so
you<00:00:41.969> run<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.329> system<00:00:42.510> profiler<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.290> look<00:00:43.710> for

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
you run the system profiler and look for

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.740 
you run the system profiler and look for
the<00:00:44.070> power<00:00:44.640> settings<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.300> then<00:00:45.390> look<00:00:45.539> for

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
the power settings and then look for

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.110 
the power settings and then look for
battery<00:00:46.140> information<00:00:46.739> under<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.520> that

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
battery information under that and that

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.250 
battery information under that and that
gives<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> whole<00:00:48.750> bunch<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:49.200> different

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
gives you a whole bunch of different

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.170 
gives you a whole bunch of different
information<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.370> use<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:51.059> monitor

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
information that you can use to monitor

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.029 
information that you can use to monitor
your<00:00:51.510> battery<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.530> one<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.829> first<00:00:52.860> things

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
your battery so one of the first things

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.400 
your battery so one of the first things
you<00:00:53.219> want<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.399> look<00:00:53.489> at<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.449> condition<00:00:54.989> now

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
you want to look at is the condition now

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.709 
you want to look at is the condition now
it<00:00:55.649> should<00:00:55.860> say<00:00:56.070> good<00:00:56.399> good<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> standard

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
it should say good good is the standard

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.270 
it should say good good is the standard
it<00:00:57.960> means<00:00:58.320> your<00:00:58.469> batteries<00:00:58.739> operating<00:00:59.100> fine

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
it means your batteries operating fine

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.040 
it means your batteries operating fine
it<00:00:59.399> says<00:00:59.579> anything<00:00:59.789> other<00:01:00.149> than<00:01:00.390> good<00:01:00.570> then

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
it says anything other than good then

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.420 
it says anything other than good then
you<00:01:01.320> probably<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.949> problem<00:01:02.280> with<00:01:02.370> your

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
you probably have a problem with your

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.189 
you probably have a problem with your
battery<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.879> want<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.180> get<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.390> replaced<00:01:03.690> or

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
battery you want to get it replaced or

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.190 
battery you want to get it replaced or
take<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.589> into<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> apple<00:01:05.100> store<00:01:05.450> now<00:01:06.450> next

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
take it into the apple store now next

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.660 
take it into the apple store now next
thing<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.380> want<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.590> look<00:01:07.650> at<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.490> want<00:01:08.640> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
thing you want to look at is you want to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.300 
thing you want to look at is you want to
look<00:01:08.880> at<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.390> remaining<00:01:10.290> charge<00:01:10.740> capacity

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
look at the remaining charge capacity

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.950 
look at the remaining charge capacity
and<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.520> full<00:01:11.820> charge<00:01:12.030> capacity<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.720> full

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
and the full charge capacity so the full

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.600 
and the full charge capacity so the full
charge<00:01:13.170> capacity<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.950> actually<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.340> moving

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
charge capacity is actually a moving

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.880 
charge capacity is actually a moving
number<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.119> telling<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.720> how<00:01:16.409> much<00:01:16.619> charge

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
number it's telling you how much charge

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.770 
number it's telling you how much charge
your<00:01:17.340> computer<00:01:17.729> thinks<00:01:18.030> your<00:01:18.210> battery<00:01:18.540> has

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
your computer thinks your battery has

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.480 
your computer thinks your battery has
when<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.140> fully<00:01:19.320> charged<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.890> as<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.340> better

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
when it's fully charged so as the better

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.800 
when it's fully charged so as the better
gets<00:01:20.670> older<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.180> number<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.540> going<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.689> get

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
gets older this number is going to get

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.749 
gets older this number is going to get
lower<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:23.009> track<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.490> maybe<00:01:23.670> even

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
lower so you can track it maybe even

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.670 
lower so you can track it maybe even
keep<00:01:24.030> notes<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.540> see<00:01:24.659> how<00:01:24.869> your<00:01:25.110> battery<00:01:25.470> is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
keep notes and see how your battery is

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.609 
keep notes and see how your battery is
wearing<00:01:26.640> over<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.360> months<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
wearing over the months and the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.020 
wearing over the months and the
remaining<00:01:28.920> charge<00:01:29.159> capacity<00:01:29.610> tells<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.909> how

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
remaining charge capacity tells you how

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.730 
remaining charge capacity tells you how
much<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.659> there<00:01:30.750> right<00:01:30.869> now<00:01:31.049> now<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.500> this

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
much is in there right now now in this

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.800 
much is in there right now now in this
case<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.250> plugged<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.090> fully<00:01:33.360> charged

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
case it's plugged in and fully charged

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.560 
case it's plugged in and fully charged
so<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> number<00:01:34.470> should<00:01:34.740> match<00:01:35.299> now<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.360> next

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
so the number should match now the next

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.730 
so the number should match now the next
thing<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.900> want<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.140> go<00:01:37.200> ahead<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.500> look<00:01:37.590> at

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
thing you want to go ahead and look at

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.280 
thing you want to go ahead and look at
is<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.310> cycle<00:01:39.299> count<00:01:39.509> now<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.810> cycle<00:01:40.110> count

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
is the cycle count now the cycle count

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.630 
is the cycle count now the cycle count
is<00:01:40.470> basically<00:01:41.040> how<00:01:41.159> many<00:01:41.310> times<00:01:41.490> your

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
is basically how many times your

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.300 
is basically how many times your
battery's<00:01:41.970> been<00:01:42.000> fully<00:01:42.360> charged<00:01:42.840> now<00:01:43.310> apple

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
battery's been fully charged now apple

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.219 
battery's been fully charged now apple
says<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> battery<00:01:45.450> that's<00:01:45.570> been<00:01:45.930> charged

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
says that a battery that's been charged

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.440 
says that a battery that's been charged
about<00:01:46.829> 300<00:01:47.310> times<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.729> starting<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.090> get<00:01:48.210> old

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
about 300 times is starting to get old

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.639 
about 300 times is starting to get old
so<00:01:48.780> you're<00:01:48.899> going<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.049> start<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.409> see

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
so you're going to start to see

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.389 
so you're going to start to see
degradation<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.790> service<00:01:51.149> at<00:01:51.270> about<00:01:51.420> 300<00:01:52.409> if

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
degradation of service at about 300 if

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.639 
degradation of service at about 300 if
your<00:01:53.759> battery<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.240> much<00:01:54.810> much<00:01:55.020> older<00:01:55.170> net<00:01:55.470> you

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
your battery is much much older net you

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.740 
your battery is much much older net you
want<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.920> probably<00:01:56.100> make<00:01:56.399> plans<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.299> start<00:01:57.630> to

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
want to probably make plans to start to

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.020 
want to probably make plans to start to
get<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.930> new<00:01:58.290> one<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:59.460> here's<00:01:59.670> what<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.880> looks

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
get a new one so here's what it looks

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.450 
get a new one so here's what it looks
like<00:02:00.240> when<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.780> unplug<00:02:01.229> your<00:02:01.590> macbook<00:02:02.040> from

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
like when you unplug your macbook from

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.240 
like when you unplug your macbook from
power<00:02:02.780> first<00:02:03.780> thing<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.020> notice<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
power first thing you notice is that the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.639 
power first thing you notice is that the
remaining<00:02:05.939> charge<00:02:06.329> will<00:02:06.750> actually<00:02:07.290> start<00:02:07.500> to

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
remaining charge will actually start to

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.589 
remaining charge will actually start to
decrease<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.280> course<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.670> be<00:02:09.030> less<00:02:09.300> than<00:02:09.539> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
decrease of course and be less than the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.960 
decrease of course and be less than the
full<00:02:09.629> charge<00:02:10.020> as<00:02:10.259> its<00:02:10.470> shown<00:02:10.590> here<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.790> other

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
full charge as its shown here the other

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.550 
full charge as its shown here the other
thing<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.870> the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
thing is that the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.170 
thing is that the
Bridge<00:02:13.739> now<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.250> negative<00:02:14.580> number<00:02:14.849> instead

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
Bridge now is a negative number instead

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.940 
Bridge now is a negative number instead
of<00:02:15.330> power<00:02:15.510> flowing<00:02:15.780> into<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.170> battery<00:02:16.440> power

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
of power flowing into the battery power

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.460 
of power flowing into the battery power
is<00:02:17.190> leaving<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.760> battery<00:02:18.060> now<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:19.290> number

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
is leaving the battery now this number

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.900 
is leaving the battery now this number
is<00:02:19.650> something<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.130> can<00:02:20.370> really<00:02:20.550> closely

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
is something that you can really closely

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.970 
is something that you can really closely
monitor<00:02:21.480> for<00:02:21.810> instance<00:02:22.110> if<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.590> turn<00:02:22.950> down

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
monitor for instance if you turn down

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.620 
monitor for instance if you turn down
the<00:02:23.610> brightness<00:02:23.760> on<00:02:24.090> your<00:02:24.209> computer<00:02:24.510> this<00:02:24.569> is

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
the brightness on your computer this is

system profiler showing and you'll see

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.550 
system profiler showing and you'll see
the<00:02:32.459> number<00:02:32.700> change<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.209> takes<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.900> few<00:02:34.080> seconds

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
the number change it takes a few seconds

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.259 
the number change it takes a few seconds
for<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.980> change<00:02:35.550> have<00:02:35.730> effects<00:02:36.030> on<00:02:36.150> though

for a change have effects on though
which<00:02:36.390> turn<00:02:36.569> your<00:02:36.660> brightness<00:02:36.780> down<00:02:37.140> takes

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
which turn your brightness down takes

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.350 
which turn your brightness down takes
about<00:02:38.069> five<00:02:38.310> or<00:02:38.489> ten<00:02:38.640> seconds<00:02:39.000> for<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.269> see

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
about five or ten seconds for you to see

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.420 
about five or ten seconds for you to see
a<00:02:39.390> new<00:02:39.660> number<00:02:39.690> under<00:02:40.200> amperage<00:02:40.620> but<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.250> cool

a new number under amperage but the cool

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.740 
a new number under amperage but the cool
thing<00:02:41.459> is<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:41.970> can<00:02:42.090> really<00:02:42.300> monitor

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
thing is that you can really monitor

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.290 
thing is that you can really monitor
your<00:02:42.900> battery<00:02:43.650> power<00:02:43.920> usage<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:45.060> for<00:02:45.209> instance

you can see what happens when say you

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.770 
you can see what happens when say you
lower<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.310> brightness<00:02:50.489> what<00:02:51.209> happens<00:02:51.569> if

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
lower the brightness what happens if

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.180 
lower the brightness what happens if

changes<00:03:05.760> take<00:03:05.880> effect<00:03:05.910> then<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.780> can<00:03:06.900> kind<00:03:07.049> of

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
changes take effect then you can kind of

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.570 
changes take effect then you can kind of
figure<00:03:07.290> out<00:03:07.440> an<00:03:07.500> optimum<00:03:07.950> solution<00:03:08.430> for
