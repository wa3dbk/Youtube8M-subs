00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
Genesis seems to be off a little bit

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.600 
Genesis seems to be off a little bit
compared<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.560> standard<00:01:52.740> 6<00:01:53.250> button

compared to the standard 6 button
doesn't<00:01:53.880> seem<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.090> be<00:01:54.180> laid<00:01:54.390> out<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.750> same<00:01:54.990> way

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
doesn't seem to be laid out the same way

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.920 
doesn't seem to be laid out the same way
it<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.799> Wireless<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.490> uses<00:01:56.759> infrared<00:01:57.119> which

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
it is Wireless it uses infrared which

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.810 
it is Wireless it uses infrared which
obviously<00:01:58.290> probably<00:01:58.920> need<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> line<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.579> sight

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
obviously probably need a line of sight

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.370 
obviously probably need a line of sight
for<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.240> work<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.750> never<00:02:00.930> play<00:02:01.110> with<00:02:01.140> my

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
for it to work and I never play with my

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.020 
for it to work and I never play with my
system<00:02:01.770> right<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.009> front<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.310> me<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.909> it's

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
system right in front of me so it's

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.160 
system right in front of me so it's
probably<00:02:03.270> not<00:02:03.420> going<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.689> work<00:02:03.869> for<00:02:03.930> me

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
probably not going to work for me

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.160 
probably not going to work for me
anyways<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:05.040> don't<00:02:05.640> even<00:02:05.729> use<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.270> rollers

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
anyways I don't even use the rollers

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.419 
anyways I don't even use the rollers
that<00:02:07.200> came<00:02:07.439> with<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.009> really<00:02:08.310> don't

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
that came with it so I really don't

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.880 
that came with it so I really don't
worry<00:02:09.030> much<00:02:09.179> about<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.660> my<00:02:10.259> only<00:02:10.410> concern<00:02:10.649> I

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
worry much about that my only concern I

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.730 
worry much about that my only concern I
have<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.220> without

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
have is without

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.830 
have is without
it<00:02:11.890> is<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.130> put<00:02:12.310> games<00:02:12.580> out<00:02:13.270> of<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.630> system

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
it is to put games out of the system

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.090 
it is to put games out of the system
itself<00:02:15.720> when<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.810> using<00:02:17.170> either<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.440> super

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
itself when you using either a super

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.330 
itself when you using either a super
famicom<00:02:18.490> game<00:02:18.700> here<00:02:19.590> which<00:02:20.590> does<00:02:20.890> fit<00:02:21.190> in

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
famicom game here which does fit in

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.940 
famicom game here which does fit in
without<00:02:21.880> any<00:02:22.240> problems<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.380> hardest<00:02:23.770> part

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
without any problems the hardest part

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.400 
without any problems the hardest part
that<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.610> think<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.120> is<00:02:25.150> with<00:02:25.810> using<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.170> system

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
that I think it is with using the system

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.260 
that I think it is with using the system
is<00:02:26.620> just<00:02:26.770> pulled<00:02:26.980> on<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.160> game<00:02:27.310> out<00:02:27.460> it<00:02:28.030> takes

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
is just pulled on the game out it takes

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.690 
is just pulled on the game out it takes
quite<00:02:28.570> a<00:02:28.630> bit<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.900> effort<00:02:29.290> just<00:02:30.070> to<00:02:30.190> get<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.430> game

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
quite a bit of effort just to get a game

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.580 
quite a bit of effort just to get a game
how<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.120> Super<00:02:31.450> Nintendo<00:02:31.570> is<00:02:32.050> even<00:02:32.290> harder

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
how the Super Nintendo is even harder

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.230 
how the Super Nintendo is even harder
because<00:02:32.770> there's<00:02:33.250> little<00:02:33.550> space<00:02:33.850> you<00:02:34.000> can't

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
because there's little space you can't

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.390 
because there's little space you can't
rock<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:34.780> got<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:35.050> go<00:02:35.170> straight<00:02:35.500> up<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:35.980> it

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
rock it you got to go straight up and it

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.300 
rock it you got to go straight up and it
takes<00:02:36.580> quite<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:36.970> bit<00:02:37.090> of<00:02:37.240> effort<00:02:38.100> other<00:02:39.100> than

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
takes quite a bit of effort other than

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.800 
takes quite a bit of effort other than
that<00:02:39.400> I<00:02:39.490> think<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.910> system<00:02:40.300> works<00:02:40.480> really

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
that I think the system works really

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.800 
that I think the system works really
well<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:42.130> saves<00:02:42.610> me<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.820> hassle<00:02:43.210> of<00:02:43.540> having<00:02:43.630> to

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
well it saves me the hassle of having to

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.840 
well it saves me the hassle of having to
hook<00:02:43.960> up<00:02:44.110> so<00:02:44.320> many<00:02:44.440> systems<00:02:44.890> use<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.130> video<00:02:45.520> a

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
hook up so many systems use a video a

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
hook up so many systems use a video a
switch<00:02:46.780> for<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.320> back<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.650> my<00:02:47.710> TV<00:02:47.980> or<00:02:48.720> swap<00:02:49.720> out

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
switch for the back of my TV or swap out

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.480 
switch for the back of my TV or swap out
cables<00:02:50.290> every<00:02:50.500> time<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.680> want<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.070> use<00:02:51.220> one<00:02:51.460> of

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
cables every time I want to use one of

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.360 
cables every time I want to use one of
the<00:02:51.610> older<00:02:51.880> systems<00:02:52.860> puts<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:53.950> lot<00:02:54.130> of<00:02:54.160> less

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
the older systems puts a lot of less

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.980 
the older systems puts a lot of less
where<00:02:54.580> tears<00:02:54.910> obviously<00:02:55.450> I'm<00:02:55.540> not<00:02:55.720> having<00:02:55.960> to

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
where tears obviously I'm not having to

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.720 
where tears obviously I'm not having to
hook<00:02:56.170> those<00:02:56.410> up<00:02:56.470> so<00:02:56.890> they<00:02:57.010> just<00:02:57.220> set<00:02:57.400> up<00:02:57.490> on<00:02:57.610> the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
hook those up so they just set up on the

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.880 
hook those up so they just set up on the
shelf<00:02:58.000> they<00:02:58.180> stay<00:02:58.390> pristine<00:02:58.690> takes<00:02:59.590> all<00:02:59.770> the

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
shelf they stay pristine takes all the

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.760 
shelf they stay pristine takes all the
abuse<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.420> feel<00:03:01.660> I<00:03:01.690> mean<00:03:01.960> with<00:03:02.260> how<00:03:02.350> cheaply

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
abuse and I feel I mean with how cheaply

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.520 
abuse and I feel I mean with how cheaply
it<00:03:03.040> was<00:03:03.520> made<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:04.000> feel<00:03:04.510> it's<00:03:04.660> pretty<00:03:04.990> pretty

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
it was made I feel it's pretty pretty

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.230 
it was made I feel it's pretty pretty
well<00:03:05.770> built<00:03:06.130> for<00:03:06.400> what<00:03:06.520> I<00:03:06.550> paid<00:03:06.790> for<00:03:06.850> it<00:03:07.090> was

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
well built for what I paid for it was

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.080 
well built for what I paid for it was
only<00:03:07.390> 60<00:03:07.840> bucks<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.410> shipping<00:03:09.400> was<00:03:09.670> free<00:03:09.820> so<00:03:10.030> I

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
only 60 bucks and shipping was free so I

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.300 
only 60 bucks and shipping was free so I
didn't<00:03:10.270> have<00:03:10.300> to<00:03:10.390> worry<00:03:10.720> about<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:11.190> but<00:03:12.190> it's

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
didn't have to worry about that but it's

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.280 
didn't have to worry about that but it's
pretty<00:03:12.490> solid<00:03:12.900> doesn't<00:03:13.900> seem<00:03:13.990> like<00:03:14.050> it's

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
pretty solid doesn't seem like it's

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.110 
pretty solid doesn't seem like it's
going<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.440> fall<00:03:14.500> apart<00:03:14.980> on<00:03:15.190> you<00:03:15.250> though<00:03:15.520> the

going to fall apart on you though the

going to fall apart on you though the
packaging<00:03:16.690> actually<00:03:17.020> I'm<00:03:17.140> surprised<00:03:17.650> came

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
packaging actually I'm surprised came

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.740 
packaging actually I'm surprised came
quite<00:03:18.490> well<00:03:18.670> everything<00:03:19.060> had<00:03:19.180> its<00:03:19.210> own<00:03:19.480> spot

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
quite well everything had its own spot

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.990 
quite well everything had its own spot
the<00:03:20.020> Retron<00:03:20.530> set<00:03:20.890> right<00:03:21.100> in<00:03:21.130> their<00:03:21.460> power

right there some of the drawbacks though

much with the vast majority of games
that<00:03:59.170> actually<00:03:59.200> does<00:03:59.860> work<00:04:00.070> with<00:04:00.310> this<00:04:00.460> system

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
that actually does work with this system

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.910 
that actually does work with this system
well<00:04:01.600> you<00:04:01.840> know<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.080> couple<00:04:02.260> games<00:04:02.530> here<00:04:02.800> and

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
well you know the couple games here and

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.410 
well you know the couple games here and
there<00:04:02.980> ain't<00:04:03.400> that<00:04:03.430> much<00:04:03.730> of<00:04:03.910> a<00:04:04.000> bother<00:04:04.210> to

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
there ain't that much of a bother to

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.000 
there ain't that much of a bother to
just<00:04:04.750> hook<00:04:04.840> up<00:04:04.990> an<00:04:05.110> old<00:04:05.260> system<00:04:05.650> if<00:04:05.740> I'm<00:04:05.890> really

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
just hook up an old system if I'm really

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.760 
just hook up an old system if I'm really
that<00:04:06.130> die<00:04:06.550> hard<00:04:06.880> at<00:04:07.030> want<00:04:07.210> to<00:04:07.360> play<00:04:07.570> it<00:04:07.780> again

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
that die hard at want to play it again

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.530 
that die hard at want to play it again
it<00:04:08.920> saves<00:04:09.130> a<00:04:09.250> lot<00:04:09.400> of<00:04:09.459> space<00:04:09.910> you<00:04:10.180> got<00:04:10.270> a<00:04:10.300> lot

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
it saves a lot of space you got a lot

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.240 
it saves a lot of space you got a lot
going<00:04:10.570> on<00:04:10.930> here<00:04:10.990> they<00:04:11.350> put<00:04:11.530> in<00:04:11.650> a<00:04:11.740> nice<00:04:11.890> simple

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
going on here they put in a nice simple

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.490 
going on here they put in a nice simple
package<00:04:12.880> it's<00:04:13.690> easy<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:14.020> use<00:04:14.170> you<00:04:14.290> don't<00:04:14.440> even

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
package it's easy to use you don't even

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.199 
package it's easy to use you don't even
need<00:04:14.740> directions<00:04:15.130> you<00:04:15.490> can<00:04:15.520> take<00:04:15.910> out<00:04:16.060> of<00:04:16.150> a

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
need directions you can take out of a

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.630 
need directions you can take out of a
box<00:04:16.420> and<00:04:16.690> hook<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:16.900> right<00:04:16.959> up<00:04:17.310> but<00:04:18.310> one<00:04:18.489> of<00:04:18.520> the

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
box and hook it right up but one of the

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.640 
box and hook it right up but one of the
drawbacks<00:04:18.820> with<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.239> video<00:04:19.510> though<00:04:19.870> is<00:04:20.140> it

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
drawbacks with the video though is it

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.760 
drawbacks with the video though is it
has<00:04:20.799> this<00:04:20.979> video<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:21.700> the<00:04:21.850> composite

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
has this video and the composite

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.379 
has this video and the composite
unfortunately<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:24.070> end

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
unfortunately the end

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.020 
unfortunately the end
s<00:04:24.509> never<00:04:24.810> had<00:04:25.110> an<00:04:25.289> s-video<00:04:25.620> output<00:04:26.030> capability

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
s never had an s-video output capability

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.360 
s never had an s-video output capability
so<00:04:27.240> in<00:04:27.300> order<00:04:27.389> to<00:04:27.569> use<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.960> s-video<00:04:28.289> you<00:04:29.219> have

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
so in order to use the s-video you have

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.980 
so in order to use the s-video you have
to<00:04:29.550> unhook<00:04:29.729> it<00:04:30.210> when<00:04:30.389> you<00:04:30.479> want<00:04:30.629> to<00:04:30.689> play<00:04:30.870> the

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
to unhook it when you want to play the

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.320 
to unhook it when you want to play the
NES<00:04:31.499> so<00:04:31.919> I<00:04:31.949> just<00:04:32.219> keep<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.580> composite<00:04:33.150> hooked

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
NES so I just keep the composite hooked

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.080 
NES so I just keep the composite hooked
up<00:04:33.509> at<00:04:33.659> all<00:04:33.749> times<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.879> don't<00:04:35.879> even<00:04:35.939> worry

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
up at all times and don't even worry

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.850 
up at all times and don't even worry
about<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.539> the<00:04:36.719> slight<00:04:37.020> little<00:04:37.199> difference<00:04:37.710> in

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
about it the slight little difference in

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.670 
about it the slight little difference in
quality<00:04:38.039> is<00:04:38.610> not<00:04:38.909> going<00:04:39.240> to<00:04:39.300> kill<00:04:39.569> me<00:04:39.749> it's<00:04:40.560> not

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
quality is not going to kill me it's not

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.070 
quality is not going to kill me it's not
that<00:04:40.949> big<00:04:41.099> of<00:04:41.159> a<00:04:41.310> deal<00:04:41.490> to<00:04:41.550> me<00:04:41.939> again<00:04:42.840> this<00:04:42.960> it

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
that big of a deal to me again this it

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.689 
that big of a deal to me again this it
seems<00:04:43.199> to<00:04:43.319> be<00:04:43.439> a<00:04:43.469> well-built<00:04:43.919> system<00:04:44.490> I

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
seems to be a well-built system I

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.640 
seems to be a well-built system I
recommend<00:04:45.300> it<00:04:45.539> to<00:04:45.569> anyone<00:04:45.960> for<00:04:46.289> the<00:04:46.409> price

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
recommend it to anyone for the price
