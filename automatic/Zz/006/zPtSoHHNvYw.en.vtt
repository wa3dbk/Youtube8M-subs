 Hello friends! 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.600
 Today we have in the review a soccer ball Adidas Conext15, which was 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.860
 created on the basis of Adidas Brazuca - the official ball of the Championship 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.370
 World 2014 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.120
 This ball has already been used in Club Championship games. 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.700
 FIFA World, the Spanish Copa del Rey, at various international 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.410
 competitions and will be involved in the Women's World Championship 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.910
 2015 in Canada. 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.630
 The ball is represented as a figure of eight with three 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.290
 colors: green, red and blue, which are on idea 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.030
 symbolize the balance between the three elements of nature. 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.710
 So let's go to the details. 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.400
 The tire consists of six polyurethane panels, 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.370
 which are connected by the method of heat sealing. 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.440
 This provides a more predictable trajectory. 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.650
 ball flight reduces air resistance 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.970
 and prevents moisture absorption. 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.970
 The surface is dotted with convex pimples for a more tenacious 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.780
 contact with football boots, goalkeeper gloves and field coverage. 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.580
 They also improve aerodynamic properties during flight. 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.580
 the ball. 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.689
 Multiple linings and latex chamber 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.479
 provide a great bounce allow the ball 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.590
 instantly regain its shape after a strike 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.439
 and maintain perfect spherical shape. 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.700
 The ball has a FIFA quality mark, implying that 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.759
 he passed all tests and complies with the requirements of the International 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.549
