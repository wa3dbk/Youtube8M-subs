00:00:11.275 --> 00:00:14.275
 There will be many unknowns in this round-the-world flight. 

00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:16.294
 Like the destination airport 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:22.000
 There will be tents or fixed hangars waiting for us at the airport where we plan to arrive. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.435
 But if we change the route because of the weather, land at an unplanned airport? 

00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:33.482
 Then we will use the mobile hangar, which can be quickly built. 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:42.069
 The material of the mobile hangar is similar to that of a sailboat 

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:49.580
 It is waterproof and fireproof, uses plaid fabric, and can be inflated with a gas pump 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:57.380
 We don't need to drive all the air pumps to the maximum when inflating, because this is related to the wind speed. 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.960
 The bigger the wind, the greater the air pressure between the two layers of fabric. 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.940
 Set up the mobile hangar 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.720
 We need about 4 to 5 hours 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.800
 In order to protect the aircraft 

00:01:17.854 --> 00:01:22.894
 It takes 6 to 7 hours to completely close the hangar. 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:30.540
 And to ensure that this hangar can withstand the winds of 100 kilometers per hour 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.060
 We need to spend 10 hours
