rotations more or less and basically
this<00:00:41.820> would<00:00:41.940> take<00:00:42.210> place<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:43.640> you<00:00:44.640> could

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850

activities which were on rotation now to
find<00:00:51.719> these<00:00:51.840> you'll<00:00:52.199> need<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.410> go<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.680> lines

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
find these you'll need to go to lines

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.189 
find these you'll need to go to lines
edge<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.550> look<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.270> map<00:00:54.660> now<00:00:54.960> what<00:00:55.110> you're

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
edge and look on the map now what you're

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.740 
edge and look on the map now what you're
looking<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.430> crossed<00:00:56.730> flag<00:00:57.239> symbol

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750

similar to the box of fun now when you

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.760 
similar to the box of fun now when you
hover<00:01:00.660> over<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.050> you'll<00:01:01.289> want<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.559> see

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
activity and then obviously the activity

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.880 
activity and then obviously the activity
that<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.430> for<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.299> day<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.869> today<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.409> crab

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
achievement points for them again

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.760 
achievement points for them again
now<00:02:13.480> I<00:02:13.660> actually<00:02:13.840> only<00:02:14.140> realized<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.740> I

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
now I actually only realized that I

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.050 
now I actually only realized that I
could<00:02:14.950> get<00:02:15.100> Chifa<00:02:15.310> points<00:02:15.670> for<00:02:15.850> them<00:02:15.970> again

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
could get Chifa points for them again

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.690 
could get Chifa points for them again
when<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:16.720> was<00:02:17.050> looking<00:02:17.290> at<00:02:17.470> some<00:02:18.340> achievement

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
when I was looking at some achievement

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.090 
when I was looking at some achievement
points<00:02:18.820> basically<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.690> want<00:02:19.960> to<00:02:20.050> get<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.350> 7500

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
points basically I want to get to 7500

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.450 
points basically I want to get to 7500
and<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:23.170> went<00:02:23.350> down<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.530> activities<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.190> was<00:02:24.370> like

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
and I went down to activities I was like

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.190 
and I went down to activities I was like
okay<00:02:24.730> well<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:24.910> can<00:02:25.090> do<00:02:25.210> cake<00:02:25.630> ball<00:02:25.810> but<00:02:26.050> then<00:02:26.140> I

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
okay well I can do cake ball but then I

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.230 
okay well I can do cake ball but then I
came<00:02:26.290> down<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.590> these<00:02:26.800> three<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.280> what

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
came down to these three and what

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.210 
came down to these three and what
interests<00:02:28.570> me<00:02:28.660> most<00:02:28.780> was<00:02:29.350> that<00:02:29.410> for<00:02:30.070> the

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
interests me most was that for the

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.160 
interests me most was that for the
repeatable<00:02:30.700> events<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.510> actually<00:02:31.780> get<00:02:31.930> five

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
repeatable events you actually get five

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.570 
repeatable events you actually get five
achievement<00:02:32.620> points<00:02:32.710> and<00:02:33.010> when<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.460> hover

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
achievement points and when you hover

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.840 
achievement points and when you hover
over<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.030> says<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.390> they<00:02:34.780> are<00:02:34.810> infinite

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
over it it says that they are infinite

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.100 
over it it says that they are infinite
which<00:02:36.850> means<00:02:36.880> if<00:02:37.210> you<00:02:37.300> run<00:02:37.450> enough<00:02:37.690> crab<00:02:37.900> toss

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
which means if you run enough crab toss

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.310 
which means if you run enough crab toss
you<00:02:38.740> could<00:02:38.890> get<00:02:39.070> a<00:02:39.420> ton<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.780> achievement

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
you could get a ton of achievement

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.530 
you could get a ton of achievement
points<00:02:41.440> just<00:02:41.920> from<00:02:42.100> doing<00:02:42.250> crab<00:02:42.550> tails<00:02:42.790> so

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
points just from doing crab tails so

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.020 
points just from doing crab tails so
this<00:02:44.050> is<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.530> guess<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:45.070> little<00:02:45.280> bit<00:02:45.490> useful<00:02:45.610> if

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
this is I guess a little bit useful if

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.550 
this is I guess a little bit useful if
you're<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.450> few<00:02:46.780> achievement<00:02:47.140> points<00:02:47.230> away

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
you're a few achievement points away

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.830 
you're a few achievement points away
from<00:02:47.740> your<00:02:47.890> next<00:02:48.280> your<00:02:48.910> next<00:02:49.030> milestone<00:02:49.630> your

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
from your next your next milestone your

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.560 
from your next your next milestone your
next<00:02:50.080> chest<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.610> don't<00:02:51.610> mind<00:02:51.790> going<00:02:52.120> in<00:02:52.360> for<00:02:52.540> a

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
next chest and don't mind going in for a

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.160 
next chest and don't mind going in for a
few<00:02:52.810> cells<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.739> survival<00:02:54.100> games<00:02:54.280> or<00:02:54.580> a<00:02:54.610> few

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
few cells and survival games or a few

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.300 
few cells and survival games or a few
sanctum<00:02:56.170> sprint<00:02:56.800> games

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
sanctum sprint games

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.540 
sanctum sprint games
I<00:02:57.459> think<00:02:58.650> sanctum<00:02:59.650> sprint<00:03:00.040> is<00:03:00.160> probably<00:03:00.430> going

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
I think sanctum sprint is probably going

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.860 
I think sanctum sprint is probably going
to<00:03:00.610> be<00:03:00.700> one<00:03:00.820> of<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.030> quicker<00:03:01.209> ones<00:03:01.450> but<00:03:01.780> you

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
to be one of the quicker ones but you

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.479 
to be one of the quicker ones but you
also<00:03:01.989> still<00:03:02.350> get<00:03:02.530> your<00:03:02.650> loop<00:03:02.890> back<00:03:03.100> so<00:03:03.430> you

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
also still get your loop back so you

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.100 
also still get your loop back so you
that<00:03:03.850> guaranteed<00:03:04.330> rare<00:03:04.570> is<00:03:04.750> there<00:03:04.930> as<00:03:05.080> well

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
that guaranteed rare is there as well

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.560 
that guaranteed rare is there as well
which<00:03:05.530> is<00:03:05.680> really<00:03:05.709> nice<00:03:06.130> but<00:03:07.060> apart<00:03:07.360> from<00:03:07.420> that

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
which is really nice but apart from that

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.570 
which is really nice but apart from that
they're<00:03:08.080> just<00:03:08.290> worth<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.650> few<00:03:09.040> achievement

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
they're just worth a few achievement

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.790 
they're just worth a few achievement
points<00:03:09.820> each<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.209> obviously<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:11.050> daily

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
points each and obviously a daily

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.640 
points each and obviously a daily
completion<00:03:12.400> so<00:03:13.060> just<00:03:13.390> in<00:03:13.510> case<00:03:13.630> anyone<00:03:14.110> was

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
completion so just in case anyone was

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.070 
completion so just in case anyone was
wondering<00:03:14.680> what<00:03:15.489> they<00:03:15.670> were<00:03:15.700> about<00:03:16.080> hadn't

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
wondering what they were about hadn't

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.280 
wondering what they were about hadn't
lion's<00:03:17.830> arch<00:03:18.070> and<00:03:18.660> obviously<00:03:19.660> try<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:19.989> find

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
lion's arch and obviously try to find

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.090 
lion's arch and obviously try to find
your<00:03:20.470> activity<00:03:21.160> with<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.580> crossed<00:03:21.820> flags

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
your activity with the crossed flags

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.890 
your activity with the crossed flags
only<00:03:24.100> one<00:03:24.280> is<00:03:24.400> available<00:03:24.880> per<00:03:25.030> day<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.450> I'm

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
only one is available per day and I'm

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.360 
only one is available per day and I'm
not<00:03:26.049> entirely<00:03:26.350> sure<00:03:26.530> how<00:03:26.860> long<00:03:27.040> this<00:03:27.220> is

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
not entirely sure how long this is

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.370 
not entirely sure how long this is
available<00:03:27.880> for<00:03:28.120> they<00:03:28.750> said<00:03:28.930> it<00:03:29.049> would<00:03:29.140> be<00:03:29.260> on

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
available for they said it would be on

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.070 
available for they said it would be on
rotation<00:03:29.799> so<00:03:30.480> this<00:03:31.480> might<00:03:31.780> end<00:03:31.810> up

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
rotation so this might end up

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.490 
rotation so this might end up
disappearing<00:03:32.590> but<00:03:33.430> I<00:03:33.730> don't<00:03:34.720> know<00:03:35.049> why<00:03:35.260> they'd

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
disappearing but I don't know why they'd

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.130 
disappearing but I don't know why they'd
have<00:03:35.709> in<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.459> activities<00:03:37.000> tab<00:03:37.299> you<00:03:37.690> mean<00:03:37.870> it's

have in the activities tab you mean it's

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.690 
have in the activities tab you mean it's
like<00:03:38.350> it's<00:03:38.590> there<00:03:38.830> with<00:03:39.040> belches<00:03:39.549> buff

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
like it's there with belches buff

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.810 
like it's there with belches buff
incapable<00:03:40.209> which<00:03:40.690> are<00:03:40.870> permanent<00:03:41.820> they're

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
incapable which are permanent they're

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.050 
incapable which are permanent they're
permanent<00:03:43.330> minigames<00:03:44.290> so<00:03:44.769> that<00:03:45.760> kind<00:03:46.000> of

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
permanent minigames so that kind of

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.490 
permanent minigames so that kind of
suggests<00:03:46.209> that<00:03:46.600> they'll<00:03:46.810> stay<00:03:47.049> for<00:03:47.290> either<00:03:47.380> a

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
quite a while all these achievements

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.330 
quite a while all these achievements
will<00:03:50.080> get<00:03:50.230> moved<00:03:50.560> at<00:03:50.709> some<00:03:50.860> point<00:03:51.070> which<00:03:51.220> would

will get moved at some point which would

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.190 
will get moved at some point which would
be<00:03:51.459> disappointing<00:03:52.030> but<00:03:52.239> just<00:03:52.630> in<00:03:52.750> case<00:03:52.900> anyone

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
be disappointing but just in case anyone

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.289 
be disappointing but just in case anyone
hadn't<00:03:53.650> noticed<00:03:53.950> that<00:03:54.010> already<00:03:54.220> is<00:03:54.580> a<00:03:54.940> nice

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
hadn't noticed that already is a nice

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.880 
hadn't noticed that already is a nice
way<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.750> get<00:03:56.049> a<00:03:56.080> different<00:03:56.470> points<00:03:56.709> and

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
way to get a different points and
