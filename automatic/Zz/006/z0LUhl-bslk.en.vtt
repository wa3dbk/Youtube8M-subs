00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.940
 1 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.740
 hello everyone today I 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.920
 find you with another title 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.539
 hairstyle on this double 13 ears of wheat 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.910
 I hope you'll like it 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.769
 you see my natural hair is only 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.810
 not long enough for power and 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.759
 the hairstyle tests and so I'm going 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.640
 lengthen them with my extensions called 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.339
 of the mark of the sea â€‹â€‹as usual 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.870
 usable in clear a dark blonde for 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.190
 this hairstyle is essential 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.440
 brushballs and your hair 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.589
 how are we going to separate them several times 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.390
 they must be sound to probe melee 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.940
 once that brings back your hair 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.739
 on one side for now I'm going 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.159
 stain the shorter strands for 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.509
 do not bother me rund um braiding 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:53.229
 started by creating a small braid 

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:55.070
 normal one back there on the other side 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.589
 then it's the same with those who 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.080
 remain in two equal parts and create 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.210
 an ear spike trace separated a 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.629
 file mr outside the section 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.269
 left 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.350
 ermine and there in the right section in 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.350
 through the seals 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.909
 separated a fine snow outside of 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.040
 the section of watts and bring back the whose 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.220
 the red section going through 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.220
 seals 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.250
 we know by another movie h to 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:29.500
 the outside of the red section and we 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.500
 make rear with straight section 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.960
 we know by a girl macha outside 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:40.240
 from the right section and we pass it to 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.840
 the back in the throat section and so 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.229
 right now 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.590
 we separate 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.590
 a joke 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.240
 we separate 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.009
 and we pass 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.320
 as soon as you get below your 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.940
 shoulders separate a thin wick 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.920
 of hair 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.370
 I want to ride around my little girl 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.370
 stress 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.840
 then I continue to trace as before 

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:14.739
 I know by an image I bring it back from 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.030
 the other side I know by a wick and I 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.030
 bring her back on our side 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.209
 I'm going to separate a bit of 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.900
 this magrets and I kept squeezing 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.900
 as before 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.909
 if you already know how to make a braid ears 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.680
 of classic wheat 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.140
 you will see that the only difference 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.329
 between the xiii the classic wheat ear is 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.359
 reversed and we pass the bad guys 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:45.299
 separates from below and not by dogs 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:47.010
 it is that which is different it is necessary 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.189
 continue to train in this technique 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.170
 to the point I'm also going to tend 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.849
 interest me a little bit and so I 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.639
 gently pulls on the sides of emma 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:03:00.329
 13 or relax him a little bit 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:03.090
 go back to each new I go 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.310
 to separate again a filming drawn my 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.989
 hair to the tips and chop the 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.989
 braid with a small elastic 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.670
 do not forget to loosen your stroke 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.100
 however the tracing now he 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.320
 must create the second so- called route and so 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.870
 i'm going to do my little stress is 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.420
 separate the hair into two parts on 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.280
 knows by a section 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.250
 but we bring it back to the other side 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.940
 we know by a section and bring it back 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.940
 on the other side 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.550
 when I come to the level of the first 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.740
 walked away from the first slice he 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.200
 must be integrated in the second small 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.750
 stress we split them in half and we 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.860
 add these two parties to the arm of our 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.440
 strawberries then in 13 as before 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.889
 take a section and pass it from 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.460
 the other side we take a section 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.289
 and pass it on the other side 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.870
 and so continue to be it's like that 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:28.850
 and you integrate in the second and the 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.460
 third section dropped from the first 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.660
 great distress 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.740
 do not forget to loosen your 13 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.740
 during the very wise 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.940
 and once again we will integrate the 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.210
 small wick dropped the second 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:53.280
 Trace peace then g13 as before I 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:55.730
 take and I cross I take and I 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.730
 cross 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.350
 tied the back together very much with a 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.390
 little elastic and here is your hairstyle 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.950
 is over if you liked it's 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.260
 everything is forgotten by clicking on the button 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.020
 I like and we find myself from my next 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.910
 video of punctures and see you soon 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.140
 but new titles come out every 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.140
 Wednesdays and every Saturday
