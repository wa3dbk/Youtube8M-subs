00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.600
 the third course 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.649
 path of consumption 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:10.319
 route 

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:13.739
 through which we can understand the existing differences 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.390
 between different people 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.470
 what is theirs 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.220
 biological construction 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.199
 because we are different 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.039
 and what diversity like 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.890
 then it manifests itself after he said psychological as I am at home to clean up sta 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:29.800
 behavioral 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.949
 characters 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.610
 gestures 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.160
 and teaches us that 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.230
 through 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.040
 the 7th law we talked about the first course it says 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.980
 to each bipolar system 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.650
 there are 60 4 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.650
 sud systems that all system codes 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.140
 we apply pc cost than on man 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.600
 we celebrate that everyone has codes 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.790
 from this we know only to understand its quality 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.480
 samsung characters 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.550
 his gestures 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.600
 and through this we are already 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.950
 understand how to interact with different people 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.430
 and we can understand 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.960
 the source of the behavior of different people how this manner behaves 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.160
 we also like just one cisp 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.160
 Trace the moment I realized why I better accept the other person 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.690
 because the ace of his behavior is part of his nature 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.470
 it's not strange I'm yours 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.470
 tail if I admit I like you but in the end 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.009
 there is no other possibility that a person behaves in a way that does not 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.380
 is suitable only for the tour 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.460
 pertini to live in peace with herself certainly must 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.550
 Him and her 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.180
 its path flows with its energy frequency 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.370
 be resonance with itself 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.579
 and this leads 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.780
 to the state of well-being 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.640
 at the end 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.870
 if we want to bring for the right person for now I have to understand 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.800
 what kind of 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.250
 you can must eat 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.160
 what kind of area can be good open 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.570
 his journey 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.349
 where to go to travel 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.060
 what the best season to make the trip in this area 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:14.180
 and all this gives us 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.569
 the precise information 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.300
 of the energy frequency and in the resonance between the different systems 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.499
 feel good 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:27.499
 not looking at the face of the person we can determine 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.639
 his codes 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:35.079
 and from this codes we can already derive the key to his unconscious 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.329
 and you will understand 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.559
 why this person behaves this way 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:43.119
 from this key that fatal among the signs 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:44.150
 reciprocate 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.870
 the key to temperament and there are old temperament furnishings 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.840
 11 key to the unconscious and 64 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.840
 codes 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.099
 and then we learn that at each 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.450
 soul doors in the soul divided into three parts 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.439
 animal souls human soul wrote guide 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.469
 has a code 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:12.659
 and we can understand where the internal conflicts within a person sit 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:18.029
 how come you can't find his way on his way because he's inside 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:21.559
 of yourself you feel that I have to go from there but there is a ficino voice 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:26.469
 and he does not understand why all this contrast comes from 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:28.029
 and if we go to account 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:31.159
 that for these three components sometimes 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.109
 they can be bleak favero 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.830
 enel understand this and understand that 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.950
 the course of the republic and the main presence 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.299
 then we must follow the code of the human soul we must follow 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.129
 what you belong to 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.389
 on our way 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.389
 ommiddio say karma august 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:04:00.429
 i know understood this i only understand unsolved life legalize pear 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:02.039
 oc 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:04.959
 an update just so rare grow 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.169
 to evolve 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:08.580
 cost the true purpose of its existence 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.430
 in this life
