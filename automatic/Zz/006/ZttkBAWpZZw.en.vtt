00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
improvement this year that working the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.460 
improvement this year that working the
stone<00:01:42.240> for<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.479> little<00:01:42.689> bit<00:01:42.780> well<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.290> still<00:01:43.409> got

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
stone for a little bit well we still got

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.020 
stone for a little bit well we still got
you<00:01:43.680> more<00:01:43.799> consistency<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.520> passing<00:01:44.909> game

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
you more consistency in the passing game

you more consistency in the passing game
and<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.270> think<00:01:45.450> that's<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:45.689> gonna<00:01:45.899> come<00:01:46.140> with

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
and I think that's just gonna come with

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.679 
and I think that's just gonna come with
more<00:01:46.590> experience<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.399> really<00:01:47.759> getting<00:01:48.119> into

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
more experience and really getting into

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.330 
more experience and really getting into
the<00:01:48.869> rhythm<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.290> playing<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.740> position<00:01:50.159> but

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
the rhythm of playing that position but

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.460 
the rhythm of playing that position but
you<00:01:50.820> saw<00:01:51.000> what<00:01:51.030> he<00:01:51.210> can<00:01:51.360> do<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.869> difference<00:01:52.290> in

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470
