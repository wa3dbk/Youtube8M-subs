00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.010
 hello welcome to my game of the month 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.600
 let's get on the dead board 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.689
 winter the board represents the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.760
 colony because there are a series of cards 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.500
 of large cardboard letters that 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.750
 they will represent other locations but 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.670
 moment we are going to see the central colony 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.050
 here you have one of the two parts 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.210
 leading almost 32 in which we can 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.130
 divide this small board but 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.440
 pretty well structured mediafax 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.989
 winter I will tell you this in parts 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.610
 so you can see it more closely at 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.320
 this forms the left area of ​​the board 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.020
 the first thing we have to have 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.660
 present is this meter from here this 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.309
 Round meter as its name indicates and 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.980
 goes in conjunction with the tab for 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.930
 example the red tab in each game 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.809
 we will have a goal a letter of 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.869
 objective that will tell us how is the 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.420
 preparation and it will tell us how much or how many 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.560
 rounds we have or what then we have 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.630
 to place this round meter is worth 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.550
 for example in this in this letter that 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.680
 we have in our hands the news above that 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.850
 morality collaborates we see it later the 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.040
 Round marker starts at 6 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.080
 so we will put the marker in Rome 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.670
 6 logically in each round already 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.280
 we will see in the turn in the scoreboard 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.950
 round will go down and when it gets to 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.080
 zero you will think that the game is lost 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.640
 but not in this game as I've already 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.350
 said the victory is individual when 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.649
 the roomba meter guides you to the game 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.119
 it ends it's worth it's over and that's where 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.670
 we will have to check has won 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.399
 and has lost if possible with the 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.020
 let's say individual is not that 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.390
 can only win one can win several 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.009
 but each one will have to weigh if he has 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.170
 learned cattle and it is also possible 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.759
 lose all 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.189
 so this lake simply we 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.689
 they marked rice in this part of here 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.549
 we have the indication of the location 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.960
 in which we are had taught us in 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.030
 the content video that there were several 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.220
 the colony is the main the largest 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.980
 and here we have a space to place 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.870
 very useful letters the first one is this 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.040
 main objective precisely the letter 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.470
 that I had the hand that I just 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.090
 teach that tells us that we have to 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.160
 do where we put things and what 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.440
 it is the victory condition of our 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.120
 game also indicated you make a 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.709
 time that is what lasts more or less 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.560
 a game with this with this scenario 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.790
 or with this objective letter is worth but 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.100
 I remember that the back has 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.410
 a few objectives a similar goal but 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.209
 harder because we play without a traitor if 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.030
 we all go on the same side then 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.680
 as when playing without a traitor we all send 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.380
 that we support the shoulder these goals 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.690
 they are more difficult 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.370
 but then we put that letter here in 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.720
 the hollow main objective and so 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.600
 we will have present during all the 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.600
 starting and we will know what is there 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.180
 do in every moment we will know all the 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.099
 special rules of this objective 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.780
 at the bottom it indicates letters 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.060
 of crisis is a gap to place the 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.519
 mallet of crisis letters and bad in 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.370
 conjunction with contributions to the 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.629
 crisis in each round we have the turn 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.379
 we will have to lift one of these letters 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:15.480
 of crisis and uncover what it is 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.730
 what happens all the players will be able to 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.829
 collaborate to try to resolve this 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.349
 crisis with letters from his good way 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.569
 we will also see it and those letters will 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.010
 they will place here when a player takes 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.959
 a letter from your hand and want one or 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.540
 several and want to contribute to the crisis 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.760
 to solve it, place a letter here 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.859
 upside down so that in the end we can see 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.930
 all the letters that have been put and see 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.209
 if the crisis has been resolved because mouth 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.819
 down because logically if we have 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.980
 players who are traitors like them do not 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.980
 concerned that the crisis is resolved 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.810
 crises have a condition of 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.389
 compliance and a penalty if you do not 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.859
 therefore it is possible that some 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.719
 traitor player does not interest you to be 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.819
 comply so the letters get mouth 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:58.859
 down so we do not know what he has put 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.689
 each and thus it can not 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.280
 we can easily guess the traitor 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.480
 but this we will see as I say with more 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.760
 detail in the valeranos 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.700
 only you do not know to engage 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.069
 we have room for the March crisis and 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.959
 place to go placing the letters with 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.260
 what players contribute to that 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.690
 crisis 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.889
 and finally in this section we have a 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.019
 trash can a section called 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.180
 dump because every time a player 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.520
 use a letter a letter to anyone 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.020
 and have to discard it will have to 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.970
 place it here if the letter indicates 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.370
 landfill the letters can indicate 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.930
 several things one of them is this 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.310
 landfill then when it indicates landfill 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.050
 means that the letter is placed in 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.430
 the landfill 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.919
 we are in a colony and fill the 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.570
 landfill is bad it is necessary to throw 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.830
 things to the trash because for example the 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.510
 food cans some we go 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.880
 consuming you have to throw them away 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.410
 but have the dump full so that 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.449
 more zombies come by the smell that 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.030
 have rats there are problems so 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.789
 in addition to everything that needs to be controlled 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.440
 zombies winter a lack of food and 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.120
 some possibly traitor player 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.919
 we have to control that our house 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.690
 be clean and from time to time we will have 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:05.470
 that empty the landfill if we do not want 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.120
 suffer certain penalties and 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.820
 precisely from those penalties os 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.760
 new the board is what opens us this 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.190
 account down here is our moral 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.350
 group is in a difficult situation and 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.610
 therefore it has a measure of fear that 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.189
 begin to 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.740
 with this tab in a box the 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:26.050
 main objective will tell us in what 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.800
 box starts and this tells us that the 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.870
 moral we have it here starts at 6 like this 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.340
 that we will put the moral in 6 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.659
 certain avatars of the game by 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.669
 example being true is very full 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:39.069
 because some letters so indicate the 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:41.229
 moral group or by some crisis the 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:43.120
 Moral group can also descend 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.310
 of course it can increase to this it 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.099
 moves for both sides if the moral 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.990
 reaches zero the game is over 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:51.279
 again and in the and we have to 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.870
 check who has won and who has 

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:55.090
 lost 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.060
 for this whole section that we have here 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.340
 is for the placement of 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.190
 survivors and zombies as 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.960
 that we are finding survivors 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:08.290
 living people who are populating our 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.450
 colony we will be placing your chips in 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.670
 hands up rooms of 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.410
 the colony we have a lot of holes 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.570
 for rooms to place 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.950
 characters we can place them where 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.230
 we want to put them down below so that 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.790
 can see a little the characters are 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.170
 here they simply indicate that they are in the 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.420
 colony and they can interact in the 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.100
 colony 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.590
 we have also taught us some 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.030
 helpless survivor tokens that 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.440
 they will also occupy a place in the colony 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.360
 but we can not move the 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.220
 survivors who are not children or the elderly 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.660
 that are not prepared to fight 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.240
 against the zombies or to search for food 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.920
 so they stay in the colony occupying 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.230
 site and also being a mouths that 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:46.410
 feed without really contributing to 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:48.540
 nothing positive and on this side we will have 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.760
 the tickets the colony has as you see 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.010
 here six very long different entries 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.080
 from 1 to 6 that is where they are going 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.000
 to go placing we will go putting the 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.620
 zombies as they enter the 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.660
 I will explain how they are placed or put on 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.700
 in this one so you can see it better 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.380
 then each entry has a gap for 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.880
 zombies three holes at the moment when 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.250
 there are three zombies in the same entry 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.560
 this entry is infested out there 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.980
 we have a problem way there is a series 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.990
 of rules to follow but we'll talk 

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:19.400
 we will talk about them and say that you are 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:22.320
 Tickets can also place 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.969
 barricades to block the way 

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.559
 some zombies 

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:27.119
 the last detail of the board is the 

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:28.619
 food reserve as we go 

00:07:27.119 --> 00:07:29.849
 getting food 

00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:32.099
 we have to go placing chips 

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:34.079
 food here to be able to give 

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:35.759
 eat those who are in the colony but 

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:37.409
 eye because as we do not have enough 

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:39.269
 food we will have to put one of these 

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:41.380
 Hunger chips and that will lower the 

00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:43.510
 moral 

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.460
 we already know the colony and all its 

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.620
 sections so tomorrow we'll see the 

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.690
 rest of locations that will make up 

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.640
 or they will complete a board on the table 

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:54.870
 where we can move is not the truth 

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.870
 it's thanks for your time
