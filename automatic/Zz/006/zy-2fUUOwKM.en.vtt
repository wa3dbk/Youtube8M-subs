00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
better than going ahead and doing a

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.939 
better than going ahead and doing a

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
going good

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.899 
going good
yeah<00:01:02.510> that's<00:01:02.989> really<00:01:03.170> good<00:01:03.460> okay<00:01:04.460> this<00:01:04.729> is<00:01:04.879> the

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
yeah that's really good okay this is the

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.210 
yeah that's really good okay this is the
part<00:01:05.180> where<00:01:05.300> I'm<00:01:05.420> kind<00:01:05.750> of<00:01:05.810> weirded<00:01:06.080> out

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
part where I'm kind of weirded out

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.380 
part where I'm kind of weirded out
because<00:01:07.220> you<00:01:07.490> know<00:01:07.610> how<00:01:07.909> often<00:01:08.150> do<00:01:08.210> you<00:01:08.240> have

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
because you know how often do you have

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.490 
because you know how often do you have
nachos<00:01:08.930> cold<00:01:10.300> never<00:01:11.300> this<00:01:11.960> is<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.170> first<00:01:12.380> one

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
nachos cold never this is the first one

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.240 
nachos cold never this is the first one
I've<00:01:12.560> ever<00:01:12.590> had<00:01:12.770> not<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.070> cold<00:01:13.340> so

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.550 

it's<00:01:17.670> okay<00:01:17.970> yeah<00:01:18.660> I<00:01:18.840> mean<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.080> figured<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.470> would

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
it's okay yeah I mean I figured it would

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.060 
it's okay yeah I mean I figured it would
be<00:01:19.590> fine<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.820> they<00:01:21.450> salt<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> chips<00:01:22.680> very

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
be fine the they salt the chips very

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.920 
be fine the they salt the chips very
heavily<00:01:23.340> which<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.210> pretty<00:01:24.420> pretty<00:01:24.750> much<00:01:24.900> a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
heavily which is pretty pretty much a

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.510 
heavily which is pretty pretty much a
good<00:01:25.110> idea<00:01:25.320> i<00:01:25.380> guess<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.740> preserve<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.370> over

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
good idea i guess to preserve it over

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.810 
good idea i guess to preserve it over
time<00:01:27.140> what's<00:01:28.140> not<00:01:28.350> bad<00:01:28.560> considering<00:01:29.550> that<00:01:29.729> i

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
time what's not bad considering that i

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.630 
time what's not bad considering that i
