00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.830 

just<00:02:57.519> a<00:02:57.670> little<00:02:57.910> because<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.360> chicken<00:02:58.720> that

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
just a little because the chicken that

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.330 
just a little because the chicken that
we<00:02:58.989> have<00:02:59.200> is<00:02:59.350> already<00:02:59.680> seasoned<00:03:01.769> so<00:03:02.769> we're

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
we have is already seasoned so we're

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.009 
we have is already seasoned so we're
just<00:03:03.370> going<00:03:03.820> to<00:03:03.910> lower<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.390> temperature<00:03:04.570> so

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
just going to lower the temperature so

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.320 
just going to lower the temperature so

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.570 
like that even better but not too dark
you<00:03:54.120> don't<00:03:54.150> want<00:03:54.450> it<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:55.410> be<00:03:55.530> all<00:03:55.680> birds<00:03:55.950> so

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580

and brown now so instead of adding the
chicken<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.780> pot<00:04:04.080> where<00:04:04.380> I<00:04:04.410> have<00:04:04.620> the

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
chicken to the pot where I have the

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.080 
chicken to the pot where I have the
sauce<00:04:05.010> I'm<00:04:05.250> going<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.459> add<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:05.700> sauce<00:04:05.910> over

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
sauce I'm going to add the sauce over

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.000 
sauce I'm going to add the sauce over
here<00:04:06.239> because<00:04:06.750> all<00:04:06.959> these<00:04:07.140> little<00:04:07.410> brown<00:04:07.709> bits

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
here because all these little brown bits

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.500 
here because all these little brown bits
is<00:04:08.310> what's<00:04:09.209> going<00:04:09.599> to<00:04:09.690> flavor<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.680> sauce<00:04:11.510> so

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
is what's going to flavor the sauce so

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.500 
is what's going to flavor the sauce so
I'm<00:04:12.660> just<00:04:12.870> gonna<00:04:13.019> add<00:04:13.290> it<00:04:13.470> here<00:04:13.790> slowly<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.209> I

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
I'm just gonna add it here slowly so I

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.550 
I'm just gonna add it here slowly so I
don't<00:04:16.049> want<00:04:16.200> anything<00:04:16.579> getting<00:04:17.579> messed<00:04:17.910> up

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
don't want anything getting messed up

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.280 
don't want anything getting messed up
because<00:04:19.560> tomato<00:04:20.040> sauce<00:04:20.310> does<00:04:20.609> stain<00:04:21.000> I<00:04:21.290> think

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
because tomato sauce does stain I think
