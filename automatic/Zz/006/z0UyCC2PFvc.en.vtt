it's all the bits I'm going to cut the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.820 
it's all the bits I'm going to cut the
map<00:01:01.379> right<00:01:01.620> out<00:01:01.890> for<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.280> finished<00:01:02.520> product

all<00:01:10.260> good<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:11.460> puts<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.850> bit<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.090> visual<00:01:12.630> aid<00:01:12.720> in

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
all good it puts a bit of visual aid in

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.350 
all good it puts a bit of visual aid in
there<00:01:13.049> now<00:01:13.260> as<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.530> starts<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.890> dry<00:01:13.979> off<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
there now as it starts to dry off the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.359 
there now as it starts to dry off the
key<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.780> keep<00:01:15.960> moving<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.530> bag<00:01:19.369> don't

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.859 
overcook don't put too much pressure on
it<00:01:22.350> we'll<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.560> split<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.509> just<00:01:24.509> get<00:01:24.659> right

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
it we'll just split and just get right

is<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.740> fairly<00:01:38.100> well<00:01:38.369> mapped<00:01:39.119> out<00:01:39.390> very

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
is a fairly well mapped out very

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.760 
is a fairly well mapped out very
decorated<00:01:40.970> authentic<00:01:41.970> map<00:01:42.420> with<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.470> little

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
decorated authentic map with a little

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.980 
decorated authentic map with a little
bit<00:01:43.890> more<00:01:44.119> than<00:01:45.119> what<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.390> started<00:01:45.450> now

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
bit more than what you started now

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.670 
bit more than what you started now
that's<00:01:47.270> in<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.360> nutshell

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.999 

pretty<00:01:52.680> much<00:01:54.200> we're<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.259> today<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.650> what<00:01:55.920> I've

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
pretty much we're on today so what I've

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.910 
pretty much we're on today so what I've
done<00:01:56.189> here<00:01:57.140> now<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.409> pretty<00:01:58.590> much<00:01:58.710> cut

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
done here now is that pretty much cut

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.010 
done here now is that pretty much cut
into<00:01:59.130> all<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.369> grains<00:01:59.610> it's<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.540> few<00:02:00.750> more<00:02:00.840> bits

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
into all the grains it's a few more bits

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.780 
into all the grains it's a few more bits
I'm<00:02:01.140> not<00:02:01.290> happy<00:02:01.560> with<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:01.979> I'm<00:02:02.580> going<00:02:02.759> to

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
I'm not happy with so I'm going to

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.460 
I'm not happy with so I'm going to
quickly<00:02:03.000> go<00:02:03.210> over<00:02:03.240> those<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.170> I'm<00:02:04.290> going<00:02:04.409> to

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
quickly go over those and I'm going to

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.370 
quickly go over those and I'm going to
cut<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:05.450> now<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.509> key<00:02:06.750> with<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.020> map<00:02:07.200> that

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
cut that out now the key with a map that

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.499 
cut that out now the key with a map that
this<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.860> also<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.520> do<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.819> opposite<00:02:09.270> sides

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
this is also to do the opposite sides

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.870 
this is also to do the opposite sides
although<00:02:09.810> I've<00:02:10.020> done<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.350> site<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:11.039> now<00:02:11.730> going

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
although I've done this site I now going

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.180 
although I've done this site I now going
to<00:02:11.970> quickly<00:02:12.150> do<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.540> opposite<00:02:12.930> side<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.950> I'll

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
to quickly do the opposite side and I'll

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.680 
to quickly do the opposite side and I'll
probably<00:02:14.340> do<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.760> after<00:02:15.209> this<00:02:15.360> is<00:02:15.510> finished

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
probably do that after this is finished

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.180 
probably do that after this is finished
now<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:15.989> next<00:02:16.290> step<00:02:16.470> for<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:16.739> is<00:02:16.800> fairly

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
now the next step for this is fairly

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.890 
now the next step for this is fairly
simple<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:17.819> take<00:02:18.209> this<00:02:18.390> map<00:02:18.630> at<00:02:18.780> this

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
simple I just take this map at this

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.220 
simple I just take this map at this
point<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:20.160> would<00:02:20.700> do<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.360> opposite<00:02:21.660> side<00:02:21.930> so

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
point I would do the opposite side so

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.360 
point I would do the opposite side so
let's<00:02:22.440> let's<00:02:22.680> do<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:22.950> for<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.130> actually

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
let's let's do that for you actually

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.780 
let's let's do that for you actually
let's<00:02:23.489> do<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.730> now<00:02:24.260> grab<00:02:25.260> another<00:02:25.440> bag<00:02:25.790> give

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
let's do that now grab another bag give

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.910 
let's do that now grab another bag give
it<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:27.000> very<00:02:27.269> liberal<00:02:27.630> spike<00:02:28.410> right<00:02:28.530> on<00:02:28.680> there

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
it a very liberal spike right on there

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.820 
it a very liberal spike right on there
okay<00:02:29.459> don't<00:02:29.730> worry<00:02:30.060> about<00:02:30.420> being<00:02:30.630> too<00:02:31.170> perfect

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
okay don't worry about being too perfect

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.350 
okay don't worry about being too perfect
it's<00:02:32.640> not<00:02:32.850> important<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:35.150> what<00:02:36.150> you've<00:02:36.330> got

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
it's not important and what you've got

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.490 
it's not important and what you've got
is<00:02:36.900> paper<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.739> begins<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.400> change<00:02:39.500> color

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
is paper that begins to change color

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.500 
is paper that begins to change color
quite<00:02:41.160> rapidly<00:02:41.549> let's<00:02:41.819> get<00:02:42.000> against<00:02:42.239> the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
quite rapidly let's get against the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.080 
quite rapidly let's get against the
grain<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.750> little<00:02:42.959> bit<00:02:43.170> here<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:43.760> know<00:02:44.760> I'm<00:02:44.940> gonna

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
grain a little bit here I know I'm gonna

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.520 
grain a little bit here I know I'm gonna
be<00:02:45.239> cutting<00:02:45.600> out<00:02:45.720> I've<00:02:45.930> got<00:02:46.049> to<00:02:46.140> be<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.230> little

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
be cutting out I've got to be a little

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.080 
be cutting out I've got to be a little
bit<00:02:46.620> careful<00:02:46.799> don't<00:02:47.160> know<00:02:47.250> this<00:02:47.489> but<00:02:47.670> doesn't

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
bit careful don't know this but doesn't

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.640 
bit careful don't know this but doesn't
matter<00:02:48.360> if<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.720> actually<00:02:48.930> ripple<00:02:49.440> up<00:02:49.530> the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
matter if you actually ripple up the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.590 
matter if you actually ripple up the
paper<00:02:50.069> again<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.910> just<00:02:51.090> adds<00:02:51.330> to<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
paper again it just adds to the

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.479 
paper again it just adds to the
authenticity<00:02:51.989> so<00:02:52.650> don't<00:02:52.860> worry<00:02:52.980> always<00:02:53.340> don't

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
authenticity so don't worry always don't

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:54.949 
authenticity so don't worry always don't
put<00:02:53.640> too<00:02:53.819> much<00:02:53.970> pressure<00:02:54.180> on<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.480> won't<00:02:54.600> tear

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
put too much pressure on you won't tear

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.039 
put too much pressure on you won't tear
it<00:02:55.110> it<00:02:55.680> will<00:02:55.829> be<00:02:55.920> dead<00:02:56.100> but<00:02:56.280> it'll<00:02:56.430> be<00:02:56.489> okay<00:02:57.049> and

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
it it will be dead but it'll be okay and

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.500 
it it will be dead but it'll be okay and
I've<00:02:58.470> just<00:02:58.560> got<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.829> make<00:02:58.860> sure<00:02:59.480> that<00:03:00.480> I

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
I've just got to make sure that I

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.930 
I've just got to make sure that I
covered<00:03:01.110> off<00:03:01.230> all<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.100> bits<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.430> like<00:03:02.579> to<00:03:02.760> get

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
covered off all the bits I like to get

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.150 
covered off all the bits I like to get
cut<00:03:03.209> off<00:03:03.470> so<00:03:04.470> that's<00:03:04.650> gonna<00:03:04.860> be<00:03:05.040> more

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
cut off so that's gonna be more

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.800 
cut off so that's gonna be more
important<00:03:05.549> than<00:03:05.670> anything<00:03:05.850> else<00:03:06.060> right<00:03:07.370> now

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
important than anything else right now

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.509 
important than anything else right now
looks<00:03:09.810> pretty<00:03:09.900> much<00:03:10.320> all<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.590> money<00:03:10.769> we<00:03:11.370> can

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
looks pretty much all the money we can

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.890 
looks pretty much all the money we can
finish<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:11.790> off<00:03:11.910> anyway<00:03:12.299> later<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.780> whole

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
finish that off anyway later the whole

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.410 
finish that off anyway later the whole
armful<00:03:13.200> big<00:03:13.500> deal<00:03:13.739> it's<00:03:14.609> very<00:03:14.790> quickly<00:03:15.090> roll

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
armful big deal it's very quickly roll

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.050 
armful big deal it's very quickly roll
it<00:03:15.709> I'm<00:03:16.709> not<00:03:16.890> gonna<00:03:17.040> put<00:03:17.340> too<00:03:17.609> much<00:03:17.760> pressure

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
it I'm not gonna put too much pressure

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.170 
it I'm not gonna put too much pressure
on<00:03:18.359> it<00:03:19.370> quickly<00:03:20.370> roll<00:03:21.769> as<00:03:22.769> such<00:03:23.519> you<00:03:23.880> can<00:03:24.030> see

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
on it quickly roll as such you can see

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.680 
on it quickly roll as such you can see
the<00:03:24.269> cover<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.660> paper<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:27.390> then<00:03:27.570> I'm

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
the cover of the paper and then I'm

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.390 
the cover of the paper and then I'm
going<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.900> pop<00:03:28.140> that<00:03:28.170> straight<00:03:28.799> in<00:03:29.070> the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
going to pop that straight in the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.599 
going to pop that straight in the
microwave<00:03:29.850> which<00:03:30.060> I've<00:03:30.209> got<00:03:30.329> over<00:03:30.510> here<00:03:31.430> if<00:03:32.430> it

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
microwave which I've got over here if it
