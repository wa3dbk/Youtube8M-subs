little<00:00:22.560> bit<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.800> frost<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.340> some<00:00:23.520> of<00:00:23.610> my<00:00:23.669> gear

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
little bit of frost on some of my gear

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.109 
little bit of frost on some of my gear
that<00:00:24.090> left<00:00:24.329> out<00:00:24.509> overnight<00:00:25.759> we<00:00:26.759> didn't<00:00:26.939> quite

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
that left out overnight we didn't quite

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.179 
that left out overnight we didn't quite
make<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.660> our<00:00:28.019> intended<00:00:28.650> destination

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
make it to our intended destination

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.909 
make it to our intended destination
yesterday<00:00:29.609> but<00:00:30.119> that's<00:00:30.480> all<00:00:30.630> right<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:31.080> think

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
yesterday but that's all right I think

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.040 
yesterday but that's all right I think
we're<00:00:32.099> probably<00:00:32.220> a<00:00:32.400> mile<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.879> half<00:00:33.059> shy<00:00:33.360> or

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
we're probably a mile and a half shy or

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.009 
we're probably a mile and a half shy or
we<00:00:34.260> needed<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.620> be<00:00:34.910> but<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.449> was<00:00:36.600> getting<00:00:36.750> kind

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
we needed to be but it was getting kind

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:39.200 
we needed to be but it was getting kind
of<00:00:37.110> dark<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.650> it<00:00:38.550> was<00:00:38.610> probably<00:00:38.970> the<00:00:39.089> best

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
of dark and it was probably the best

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.869 
of dark and it was probably the best

move to set up camp in a really high
area<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.479> we<00:00:43.409> felt<00:00:43.650> was<00:00:43.769> a<00:00:43.799> pretty<00:00:44.309> good<00:00:44.430> spot

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
area that we felt was a pretty good spot

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.390 
area that we felt was a pretty good spot
the<00:00:46.019> fall<00:00:46.199> color<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.589> progressing<00:00:47.040> quite<00:00:47.190> nice

and<00:00:59.699> along<00:01:00.479> the<00:01:00.659> way<00:01:00.780> we'll<00:01:00.989> see<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.379> cascade

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
and along the way we'll see that cascade

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.370 
and along the way we'll see that cascade
that<00:01:02.189> we're<00:01:02.640> hoping<00:01:02.790> to<00:01:02.939> shoot

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.090 

you<00:01:07.189> know<00:01:07.340> I<00:01:07.610> gotta<00:01:08.000> say<00:01:08.080> it<00:01:09.080> is<00:01:09.439> a<00:01:09.470> little

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
you know I gotta say it is a little

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.330 
you know I gotta say it is a little
rough<00:01:10.280> carrying<00:01:11.030> a<00:01:11.270> 90<00:01:11.930> pound<00:01:12.049> pack<00:01:12.350> full<00:01:13.220> of

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
rough carrying a 90 pound pack full of

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.930 
rough carrying a 90 pound pack full of
large<00:01:13.580> for<00:01:13.820> Mike<00:01:14.000> here<00:01:14.350> but<00:01:15.640> if<00:01:16.640> that<00:01:16.790> shot

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
large for Mike here but if that shot

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.920 
large for Mike here but if that shot
turns<00:01:17.180> out<00:01:17.530> it's<00:01:18.530> all<00:01:18.740> worth<00:01:18.920> it<00:01:19.690> this<00:01:20.690> is<00:01:20.899> a

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
turns out it's all worth it this is a

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.130 
turns out it's all worth it this is a
beautiful<00:01:21.409> beautiful<00:01:21.530> area<00:01:22.750> okay<00:01:23.750> I'll<00:01:23.930> get

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
beautiful beautiful area okay I'll get

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.920 
beautiful beautiful area okay I'll get
times<00:01:24.380> but<00:01:24.799> I<00:01:25.479> think<00:01:26.950> if<00:01:27.950> we<00:01:28.190> have<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.930> window

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
times but I think if we have the window

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.170 
times but I think if we have the window
here<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:31.430> fall<00:01:31.640> color<00:01:31.909> and<00:01:32.320> clear<00:01:33.320> skies<00:01:34.180> this

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
here the fall color and clear skies this

00:01:35.180 --> 00:02:27.230 
here the fall color and clear skies this
could<00:01:35.390> make<00:01:35.570> for<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:36.080> pretty<00:01:36.530> good<00:01:36.680> shot

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.510 

so<00:02:28.240> I<00:02:28.270> got<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.450> decently<00:02:29.410> early<00:02:29.710> start<00:02:30.490> this

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
so I got a decently early start this

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.970 
so I got a decently early start this
morning<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:31.890> hiked<00:02:32.890> up<00:02:33.040> Canyon<00:02:33.490> and<00:02:33.640> pass<00:02:34.510> by

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
morning and hiked up Canyon and pass by

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.930 
morning and hiked up Canyon and pass by
coyote<00:02:35.980> Natural<00:02:36.310> Bridge<00:02:36.490> which<00:02:36.640> was<00:02:36.790> pretty

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
coyote Natural Bridge which was pretty

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.030 
coyote Natural Bridge which was pretty
cool<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.600> then<00:02:38.290> made<00:02:38.500> our<00:02:38.530> way<00:02:38.710> up<00:02:38.740> to<00:02:38.950> the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
cool and then made our way up to the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.810 
cool and then made our way up to the
Cascade<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:41.380> Cascade<00:02:41.920> was<00:02:42.220> was<00:02:42.520> pretty

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
Cascade and the Cascade was was pretty

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.820 
Cascade and the Cascade was was pretty
good<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.630> tree<00:02:43.930> was<00:02:44.050> a<00:02:44.080> little<00:02:44.290> past<00:02:44.470> prime

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
good the tree was a little past prime

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.940 
good the tree was a little past prime
but<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:45.430> think<00:02:46.330> with<00:02:46.480> Bellavia<00:02:47.140> that<00:02:47.800> will

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
but I think with Bellavia that will

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.340 
but I think with Bellavia that will
actually<00:02:48.160> look<00:02:48.400> pretty<00:02:48.460> decent<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.510> the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
actually look pretty decent and the

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.570 
actually look pretty decent and the
thing<00:02:50.530> that's<00:02:50.620> pretty<00:02:50.860> cool<00:02:50.980> about<00:02:51.130> that<00:02:51.460> is

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
thing that's pretty cool about that is

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.000 
thing that's pretty cool about that is
that<00:02:51.610> glow<00:02:52.030> his<00:02:52.540> constant<00:02:53.140> stays<00:02:53.380> like<00:02:53.680> the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
that glow his constant stays like the

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.310 
that glow his constant stays like the
same<00:02:54.250> way<00:02:54.430> all<00:02:54.640> day<00:02:54.790> long<00:02:55.030> so<00:02:55.930> there<00:02:56.080> was<00:02:56.170> no

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
same way all day long so there was no

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.510 
same way all day long so there was no
real<00:02:56.560> rush<00:02:56.800> to<00:02:56.980> shoot<00:02:57.220> it

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
real rush to shoot it

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.390 
real rush to shoot it
I<00:02:57.600> took<00:02:58.600> three<00:02:59.020> exposures<00:02:59.350> to<00:02:59.590> out<00:03:00.010> of<00:03:00.100> Elvia

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
I took three exposures to out of Elvia

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.640 
I took three exposures to out of Elvia
50<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.030> then<00:03:01.300> another<00:03:01.450> one<00:03:01.660> on<00:03:01.750> act<00:03:01.960> are<00:03:02.170> for

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
50 and then another one on act are for

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.600 
50 and then another one on act are for
color<00:03:02.920> night<00:03:03.190> film<00:03:03.430> was<00:03:03.550> a<00:03:03.750> safety<00:03:04.750> night

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
color night film was a safety night

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.970 
color night film was a safety night
after<00:03:06.610> shooting<00:03:06.790> we<00:03:07.540> head<00:03:08.290> up<00:03:08.410> Canyon<00:03:08.830> and

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
after shooting we head up Canyon and

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.980 
after shooting we head up Canyon and
checked<00:03:09.550> out<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.700> exit<00:03:10.090> point<00:03:10.300> which<00:03:10.510> is<00:03:10.720> the

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
checked out the exit point which is the

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.170 
checked out the exit point which is the
place<00:03:11.710> driven<00:03:12.010> climb<00:03:12.190> up<00:03:12.310> this<00:03:12.430> big<00:03:12.640> sandstone

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
place driven climb up this big sandstone

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.390 
place driven climb up this big sandstone
monolith<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:13.930> work<00:03:14.830> your<00:03:14.950> way<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.220> top

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
monolith and work your way to the top

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.280 
monolith and work your way to the top
and<00:03:15.700> then<00:03:15.880> it's<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.150> short<00:03:16.180> two-mile<00:03:16.870> hike<00:03:17.080> back

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
and then it's a short two-mile hike back

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.990 
and then it's a short two-mile hike back
to<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.530> car

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
to the car

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.400 
to the car
yeah<00:03:19.000> I<00:03:19.030> think<00:03:19.240> they<00:03:19.480> understated<00:03:20.140> it<00:03:20.260> a

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
yeah I think they understated it a

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.040 
yeah I think they understated it a
little<00:03:20.680> bit<00:03:20.920> you<00:03:21.520> know<00:03:21.610> that<00:03:21.790> or<00:03:22.000> or<00:03:22.450> idiots<00:03:22.870> to

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
little bit you know that or or idiots to

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.170 
little bit you know that or or idiots to
carry<00:03:23.290> 90<00:03:23.620> pound<00:03:23.800> packs<00:03:24.010> in<00:03:24.190> here<00:03:24.340> but<00:03:24.490> I<00:03:24.670> don't

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
carry 90 pound packs in here but I don't

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.520 
carry 90 pound packs in here but I don't
really<00:03:25.480> think<00:03:25.600> it's<00:03:25.900> gonna<00:03:26.020> be<00:03:26.140> very<00:03:26.230> possible

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
really think it's gonna be very possible

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.680 
really think it's gonna be very possible
to<00:03:26.830> get<00:03:27.070> out<00:03:27.190> that<00:03:27.430> way<00:03:27.550> it<00:03:28.120> was<00:03:28.240> a<00:03:28.300> little

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
to get out that way it was a little

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.630 
to get out that way it was a little
little<00:03:28.990> challenging<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:29.800> with<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.220> 90<00:03:30.520> pound

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
little challenging and with a 90 pound

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.360 
little challenging and with a 90 pound
pack<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:32.290> may<00:03:32.500> be<00:03:32.560> slightly<00:03:32.860> on<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.070> dangerous

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
pack it may be slightly on the dangerous

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.640 
pack it may be slightly on the dangerous
side<00:03:33.550> so<00:03:34.080> we're<00:03:35.080> gonna<00:03:35.170> head<00:03:35.350> back<00:03:35.380> down

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
side so we're gonna head back down

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.620 
side so we're gonna head back down
canyon<00:03:36.010> and<00:03:36.160> because<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:36.790> that<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:37.240> it<00:03:37.450> takes

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
canyon and because of that and it takes

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.480 
canyon and because of that and it takes
a<00:03:37.690> long<00:03:37.780> time<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:38.080> get<00:03:38.170> down<00:03:38.260> canyon<00:03:38.680> means

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
a long time to get down canyon means

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.460 
a long time to get down canyon means
that<00:03:39.640> we<00:03:39.730> are<00:03:39.850> going<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.120> have<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.750> head<00:03:41.440> back

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
that we are going to have to head back

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.740 
that we are going to have to head back
to<00:03:41.650> fit<00:03:41.920> airily<00:03:42.220> so<00:03:42.730> I'll<00:03:43.060> shoot<00:03:43.240> tomorrow

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
to fit airily so I'll shoot tomorrow

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.750 
to fit airily so I'll shoot tomorrow
and<00:03:44.440> then<00:03:44.590> head<00:03:44.770> down<00:03:44.800> canyon<00:03:45.280> as<00:03:45.340> far<00:03:45.550> as<00:03:45.670> we

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
and then head down canyon as far as we

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.640 
and then head down canyon as far as we
can<00:03:46.210> Sep<00:03:46.420> camp<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:46.990> then<00:03:47.080> head<00:03:47.230> out<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.530> day

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
can Sep camp and then head out the day

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.270 
can Sep camp and then head out the day
after<00:03:47.860> that

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
after that

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.000 
after that
so<00:03:49.120> hopefully<00:03:50.020> the<00:03:50.230> shot<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:50.560> got<00:03:50.710> today<00:03:50.890> was
