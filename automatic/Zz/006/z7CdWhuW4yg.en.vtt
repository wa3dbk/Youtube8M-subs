00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
cables and stuff so this is quite a

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.979 
cables and stuff so this is quite a
useful<00:00:38.470> exercise<00:00:39.730> you<00:00:40.730> can<00:00:40.910> see<00:00:41.210> that<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:41.780> top

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
useful exercise you can see that the top

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.530 
useful exercise you can see that the top
cup<00:00:42.199> of<00:00:42.379> plaster<00:00:42.800> has<00:00:42.920> come<00:00:43.160> off<00:00:43.340> so<00:00:43.940> we're

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
cup of plaster has come off so we're

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.820 
cup of plaster has come off so we're
going<00:00:44.629> to<00:00:44.720> need<00:00:44.840> to<00:00:45.020> fill<00:00:45.230> that<00:00:45.260> out<00:00:45.500> the

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
going to need to fill that out the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.280 
going to need to fill that out the
problem<00:00:46.190> that<00:00:46.370> that<00:00:46.550> we<00:00:46.970> come<00:00:47.180> across<00:00:47.210> is<00:00:47.989> that

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
problem that that we come across is that

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.229 
problem that that we come across is that
if<00:00:48.440> you<00:00:48.620> don't<00:00:48.890> fill<00:00:49.250> it<00:00:49.340> out<00:00:49.489> properly<00:00:50.000> if<00:00:50.149> you

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
if you don't fill it out properly if you

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.960 
if you don't fill it out properly if you
fill<00:00:50.420> it<00:00:50.510> out<00:00:50.600> too<00:00:50.980> too<00:00:51.980> thin<00:00:52.370> then<00:00:52.670> you<00:00:52.790> can

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
fill it out too too thin then you can

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.850 
fill it out too too thin then you can
see<00:00:53.210> it<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:53.570> if<00:00:53.930> you<00:00:54.079> fill<00:00:54.350> it<00:00:54.440> out<00:00:54.530> too<00:00:54.829> much

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
see it and if you fill it out too much

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.830 
see it and if you fill it out too much
then<00:00:55.430> you're<00:00:55.579> going<00:00:55.700> to<00:00:55.790> put<00:00:56.000> a<00:00:56.030> big<00:00:56.239> bulge<00:00:56.570> in

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
then you're going to put a big bulge in

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.990 
then you're going to put a big bulge in
the<00:00:56.960> wall<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:57.649> I'm<00:00:57.890> going<00:00:58.040> to<00:00:58.070> show<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:58.730> that

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
the wall so I'm going to show you that

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.410 
the wall so I'm going to show you that
we<00:00:59.120> can<00:00:59.149> carefully<00:01:00.190> fill<00:01:01.190> it<00:01:01.309> in<00:01:01.489> all<00:01:01.670> right<00:01:01.760> so

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
we can carefully fill it in all right so

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.210

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.820 
it out again what most important part of
it<00:02:10.310> you<00:02:11.000> step<00:02:14.710> and<00:02:15.710> we<00:02:15.860> keep<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:16.220> edges<00:02:16.520> clean

it you step and we keep the edges clean

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.560 
it you step and we keep the edges clean
like<00:02:18.830> this<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:19.550> you<00:02:19.610> can<00:02:19.850> still<00:02:20.120> see<00:02:20.150> these

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.950 
like this so you can still see these
edges<00:02:21.020> okay<00:02:22.000> see<00:02:23.000> that<00:02:23.030> with<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.600> front<00:02:23.870> of

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
edges okay see that with the front of

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.230 
edges okay see that with the front of
the<00:02:24.050> trail<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:25.400> make<00:02:25.610> sure<00:02:25.820> that<00:02:25.850> you<00:02:26.060> can

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
the trail and you make sure that you can

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.760 
the trail and you make sure that you can
still<00:02:26.480> see<00:02:26.510> these<00:02:26.870> edges<00:02:27.320> so<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:30.260> blends<00:02:30.560> in

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
still see these edges so it blends in

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:39.040 
still see these edges so it blends in
with<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.010> wall<00:02:36.490> like<00:02:37.490> this<00:02:37.640> all<00:02:38.420> right<00:02:38.600> and

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
with the wall like this all right and

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.660 
with the wall like this all right and
you<00:02:39.170> still<00:02:39.530> see<00:02:39.830> this<00:02:39.980> one<00:02:40.220> or<00:02:40.340> two<00:02:40.430> it<00:02:40.610> will

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
you still see this one or two it will

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.140 
you still see this one or two it will
hold<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:41.570> stage<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:42.320> little<00:02:42.530> bit<00:02:43.150> wet

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
hold and this stage is a little bit wet

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.430 
hold and this stage is a little bit wet
some<00:02:44.660> will<00:02:45.080> just<00:02:46.720> move<00:02:47.720> that<00:02:47.960> down<00:02:48.140> a<00:02:48.200> little

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
some will just move that down a little

00:02:48.440 --> 00:03:00.610 
some will just move that down a little
bit<00:02:51.220> they<00:02:52.220> dry<00:02:52.550> out<00:02:52.580> a<00:02:52.760> little<00:02:53.000> bit<00:02:57.640> okay<00:02:59.620> and

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
bit they dry out a little bit okay and

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.440 
bit they dry out a little bit okay and
put<00:03:01.130> another<00:03:01.250> coat<00:03:01.670> on<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.940> in<00:03:02.030> just<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.330> minute

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
oh okay so that we know that the

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.660 
oh okay so that we know that the
plasters<00:03:05.810> in<00:03:05.959> Normandy<00:03:06.470> existing<00:03:06.980> with<00:03:07.580> the

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
existing plaster work here we use one of

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.220 
existing plaster work here we use one of
these<00:03:10.580> which<00:03:10.910> is<00:03:11.090> called<00:03:11.390> a<00:03:11.540> feather<00:03:11.810> edge<00:03:12.020> or

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
these which is called a feather edge or

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.740 
these which is called a feather edge or
a<00:03:12.290> straight<00:03:12.620> edge<00:03:12.850> as<00:03:13.850> it<00:03:13.910> comes<00:03:14.270> down<00:03:14.480> to<00:03:14.690> a

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
a straight edge as it comes down to a

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.070 
a straight edge as it comes down to a
point<00:03:15.020> we<00:03:15.709> put<00:03:15.920> this<00:03:16.040> on<00:03:16.220> like<00:03:16.790> this<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.300> we

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
point we put this on like this and we

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.550 
point we put this on like this and we
move<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:18.470> up<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.800> down<00:03:18.830> slowly<00:03:19.310> like<00:03:19.610> this

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
move it up and down slowly like this

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.810 
move it up and down slowly like this
that<00:03:21.560> tells<00:03:21.920> us<00:03:22.270> where<00:03:23.270> we<00:03:23.450> need<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.720> film<00:03:24.820> that

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
that tells us where we need to film that

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.550 
that tells us where we need to film that
we<00:03:25.910> need<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.239> fill<00:03:26.450> in<00:03:26.600> your<00:03:26.810> check<00:03:27.140> where<00:03:27.410> it's

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
we need to fill in your check where it's

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.070 
we need to fill in your check where it's
touching<00:03:27.850> that<00:03:28.850> this<00:03:29.300> means<00:03:29.570> you<00:03:29.780> don't<00:03:29.900> need

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
touching that this means you don't need

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.990 
touching that this means you don't need
to<00:03:30.230> fill<00:03:30.410> it<00:03:30.500> there<00:03:30.680> but<00:03:30.830> where<00:03:30.980> it<00:03:31.100> misses<00:03:31.550> we

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
to fill it there but where it misses we

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.970 
to fill it there but where it misses we
need<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.330> fill<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.770> notice

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.980 

and<00:03:39.980> use<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.400> feather<00:03:40.670> edge<00:03:40.880> again<00:03:41.240> once

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
and use the feather edge again once

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:56.620 
and use the feather edge again once
again<00:03:42.460> to<00:03:43.690> make<00:03:44.690> sure<00:03:44.840> we<00:03:44.990> fill<00:03:45.230> get<00:03:45.410> out<00:03:55.630> when

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
again to make sure we fill get out when

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.600 
again to make sure we fill get out when
that<00:03:56.750> dries<00:03:56.990> up<00:03:57.260> a<00:03:57.290> little<00:03:57.590> more<00:03:57.770> we<00:03:58.130> can<00:03:58.340> trail

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
that dries up a little more we can trail

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.100 
that dries up a little more we can trail
that<00:03:58.790> in<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.270> it<00:03:59.450> will<00:03:59.480> make<00:03:59.720> that<00:03:59.900> nice<00:04:00.080> and

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
that in and it will make that nice and

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.130 
that in and it will make that nice and
smooth<00:04:00.650> okay
