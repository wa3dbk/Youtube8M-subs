00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:09.660
 hello after commitment hello you 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.730
 are visceral surgery approved by 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.309
 the hospital of the adhuc and users of the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.980
 robotic system davinci since how much 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.960
 of time perished you with a dress or 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.720
 so I started in 2003 I followed 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.820
 a training module in paris and i 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.810
 started my first operations in 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.960
 a clinic that had done 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.699
 the acquisition in Geneva of the robot davinci 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.669
 and so it is from 2003 that I have 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.730
 carried out my first operations for 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.320
 what type of intervention is it indicated 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.840
 then their avicii goal is indicated in 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.980
 several interventions concerning 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.399
 different specialties 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.050
 as far as my specialty is concerned it is 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.809
 useful for rectal surgery 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.360
 especially the deep rectum where access 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.350
 is difficult and thanks to this device we 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.570
 can have easier access to this 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.879
 anatomical site 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.620
 to perform this operation in between 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.090
 eaters use it especially for the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.309
 lease because we realize in people 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.049
 obese or need to make sutures and 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.110
 rest allows futures to be very 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.659
 precise and diminish others 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.700
 complications compared to the 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.080
 classic method charge surgery 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.630
 pure laparoscopic for this type 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.310
 operating outside of it like you 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.020
 probably know the robot is very 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.920
 used especially for the ablation of the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.330
 prostate 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.950
 because the prostate is located like the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.579
 deep rectum at a very 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.530
 difficult to access and so this robot us 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.030
 allows access to it with great 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.070
 security and high accuracy 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.180
 obviously other specialties 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.939
 are interested in this technology the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.290
 gynecological surgery of surgery 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.729
 orl and cardiovascular surgery 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.610
 what are the benefits for the 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.040
 Chinese 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.070
 then the benefits to the surgeon 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.979
 firstly its are located at the level 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.780
 of vision we have a 3d vision 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.370
 while in appearance standard copy 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.290
 we have a given vision like that 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.570
 when you watch TV and 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.119
 the thanks to two optical channels in the 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.540
 camera we get a 3d vision so a 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.640
 very very high precision and comfort 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.230
 visual that makes operations less 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.930
 tiring in more than you can the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.170
 see here I'm sitting at the foot of this 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.840
 console and my arms are rested and 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.550
 I operate my controllers in a 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.350
 much more ergonomic position than 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.600
 the one we have when we do 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.370
 laparoscopic surgery my standard and 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.200
 sometimes in very visual positions 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.530
 very vicious and very tiring for them 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.170
 arm but for the back the hospital is 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.970
 studied this system since 2008 already 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.650
 but it's the first the only one 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.540
 profit private institution in care 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.150
 French-speaking Switzerland to acquire at all 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.250
 latest model the fixed dai-ichi robot 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.100
 what is your opinion on this 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.580
 investment so I think that in 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.900
 2008 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.750
 actually when we did 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.940
 the acquisition of the first robot in 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.590
 this clinic 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.940
 a few years later came out the 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.380
 next model and you know it's a 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.080
 like tablets and 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.370
 smartphones buy you the last 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.000
 model is the following already in 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.010
 preparation 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.019
 I believe that the tower hospital has 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.299
 not to invest in the model 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.500
 next that was not a big plus 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.180
 compared to the model we 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.739
 owned up to now by cons 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.470
 this is not the case with the model xxi 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.610
 currently that allows that offers 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.870
 greatly additional possibilities 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.850
 compared to the in relation to 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.470
 last generations who was on the 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.420
 market so I think it's a very 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.239
 good idea to have a crucible for this 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.280
 new model lately a report 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.600
 of the show present time has put in 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.390
 light the risks associated with the use 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.100
 surgeries have not got enough 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.150
 driven 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.370
 does he know at the tower hospital in 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.810
 this subject so I think this 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.120
 issue raised very points 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.519
 important with regard to 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.560
 the surgeons to my knowledge with 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:58.269
 everything at the tower all follow 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.920
 training modules and are closely 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:05.019
 framed by the mother house who she 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.340
 same product and delivers his devices 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.629
 why because for the parent company 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.400
 it's very important that it's not 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.930
 complication the least possible I believe 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.390
 that the show you're doing 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.790
 reference to emphasize I think of 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.320
 human errors of the surgeon and not 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.690
 no machine so you really have to 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.020
 to prepare and be the best possible 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:28.310
 trained to this type of device 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:32.000
 and then some have already proposed 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.220
 make certificates to repeat in 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.340
 the time every six months or every 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.010
 years with simulators and revalidate to 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.630
 every time his his level of training 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.750
 I think we'll get there and it's very 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.750
 important
