going to kind of do a sixteenth notes

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.400 
going to kind of do a sixteenth notes
displacement<00:00:27.599> it's<00:00:27.810> really<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.170> going<00:00:28.349> to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
displacement it's really just going to

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.570 
displacement it's really just going to
be<00:00:28.470> an<00:00:28.560> embellishment<00:00:28.949> but<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.340> phrased

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
be an embellishment but it's phrased

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.939 
be an embellishment but it's phrased
that<00:00:29.730> way<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:31.320> best<00:00:31.500> way<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.740> go<00:00:31.920> about

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
that way so the best way to go about

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.830 
that way so the best way to go about
doing<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.460> first<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.420> get<00:00:33.570> rid<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.719> all

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
doing this first is to get rid of all

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.410 
doing this first is to get rid of all
the<00:00:33.960> extra<00:00:34.200> notes<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.730> mean<00:00:35.969> get<00:00:36.239> rid<00:00:36.329> of

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the extra notes and so I mean get rid of

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.450 
the extra notes and so I mean get rid of
the<00:00:36.570> ghost<00:00:36.780> notes<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.440> get<00:00:38.219> rid<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.090 
the ghost notes and get rid of the
hi-hat<00:00:38.790> displacement<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.559> beat<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.920> its

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
hi-hat displacement so the beat on its

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
it line up that's the only real way to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.020 
it line up that's the only real way to
make<00:01:26.100> sure<00:01:26.220> you're<00:01:26.340> doing<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.700> properly

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
make sure you're doing this properly

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.999 
make sure you're doing this properly
when<00:01:27.360> you're<00:01:27.479> just<00:01:27.720> learning<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.829> is

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
when you're just learning it this is

00:01:29.009 --> 00:02:02.970 
when you're just learning it this is
what<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.220> sounds<00:01:29.310> like<00:01:29.520> nice<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.060> slow

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.080 

make<00:02:03.980> sure<00:02:04.010> you<00:02:04.190> get<00:02:04.310> real<00:02:04.490> comfortable<00:02:04.700> with

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
make sure you get real comfortable with

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.310 
make sure you get real comfortable with
that<00:02:05.210> before<00:02:05.510> you<00:02:05.600> try<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.810> next<00:02:06.050> part

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
that before you try the next part

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.930 
that before you try the next part
because<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.710> next<00:02:06.890> section<00:02:07.310> when<00:02:07.460> we<00:02:07.550> open

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
because the next section when we open

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.820 
because the next section when we open
the<00:02:08.030> hi-hats<00:02:08.480> is<00:02:08.750> where<00:02:09.170> it<00:02:09.260> gets<00:02:09.320> real<00:02:09.530> tough

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
the hi-hats is where it gets real tough

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.470 
the hi-hats is where it gets real tough
because<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.430> beat<00:02:10.670> for<00:02:10.970> that<00:02:11.180> we're<00:02:11.300> not

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
because that beat for that we're not

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.600 
because that beat for that we're not
playing<00:02:11.810> on<00:02:12.020> we<00:02:12.470> have<00:02:12.560> an<00:02:12.650> open<00:02:12.950> hi-hat<00:02:13.160> going

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
playing on we have an open hi-hat going

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.630 
playing on we have an open hi-hat going
over<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.210> so<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.890> got<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.100> make<00:02:16.250> sure<00:02:16.280> that<00:02:16.490> it

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
over it so you got to make sure that it

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.080 
over it so you got to make sure that it
closes<00:02:17.030> on<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.570> e<00:02:18.020> of<00:02:18.380> for<00:02:18.680> not<00:02:19.010> beat<00:02:19.250> for<00:02:19.280> nice

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
closes on the e of for not beat for nice

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.260 
closes on the e of for not beat for nice
and<00:02:20.300> slow<00:02:20.450> sounds<00:02:20.960> like<00:02:21.050> this
