right<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.290> clay<00:02:16.290> balls<00:02:16.560> earth<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:17.099> a<00:02:17.129> male

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
right to is a clay balls earth is a male

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.259 
right to is a clay balls earth is a male
and<00:02:17.700> then<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.599> have<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:19.019> cut<00:02:19.349> down<00:02:20.340> this<00:02:20.970> side

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
and then you have to cut down this side

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.360 
and then you have to cut down this side
of<00:02:21.420> his<00:02:21.510> tallywhacker<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.290> then<00:02:23.099> you<00:02:23.220> also

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
of his tallywhacker and then you also

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.540 
of his tallywhacker and then you also
have<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.670> do<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.849> same<00:02:24.060> thing<00:02:24.510> down<00:02:24.989> this<00:02:25.200> side

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
have to do the same thing down this side

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.339 
have to do the same thing down this side
then<00:02:26.550> my<00:02:26.700> next<00:02:26.849> step<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.720> I'll<00:02:27.989> cut<00:02:28.319> it

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
then my next step is is I'll cut it

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.009 
then my next step is is I'll cut it
across<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:29.160> back<00:02:29.400> right<00:02:29.819> behind<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.810> rear
