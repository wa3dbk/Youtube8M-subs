00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.570 
but I really do love their stuff I mean
it's<00:00:26.460> great<00:00:26.789> it's<00:00:27.439> economical<00:00:28.439> but<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.429> mean

it's great it's economical but I mean

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.769 
it's great it's economical but I mean
the<00:00:29.670> only<00:00:29.699> downside<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.570> guess<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
the only downside is I guess the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.560 
the only downside is I guess the
shipping<00:00:31.700> sometimes<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.820> hear<00:00:33.000> like<00:00:33.239> shipping

shipping sometimes I hear like shipping

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.270 
shipping sometimes I hear like shipping
is<00:00:33.780> really<00:00:34.020> bad<00:00:34.200> for<00:00:34.620> people<00:00:34.800> out<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
is really bad for people out of the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.990 
is really bad for people out of the
country<00:00:35.460> but<00:00:36.890> so<00:00:37.890> yeah<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.129> really<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
country but so yeah I really like the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.410 
country but so yeah I really like the
elf<00:00:39.270> ones<00:00:39.540> because<00:00:40.280> it's<00:00:41.280> kind<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.300> a

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
elf ones because it's kind of a

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.150 
elf ones because it's kind of a
substitute<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:42.960> my<00:00:43.230> mac<00:00:43.440> ones<00:00:43.680> because<00:00:44.010> I

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049

don't recommend the concealer brush

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.690

size<00:03:44.349> that<00:03:44.650> is<00:03:44.830> and<00:03:45.160> then<00:03:46.030> if<00:03:46.630> I<00:03:46.810> go<00:03:46.840> like<00:03:47.080> that

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
size that is and then if I go like that

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:54.000 
size that is and then if I go like that
look<00:03:48.280> at<00:03:48.430> it's<00:03:48.580> like<00:03:48.670> flat<00:03:50.550> so<00:03:51.550> that<00:03:53.010> compared

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
look at it's like flat so that compared

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.040 
look at it's like flat so that compared
to<00:03:54.130> that<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:55.000> I<00:03:55.890> have<00:03:56.890> used<00:03:57.400> this<00:03:57.670> and<00:03:58.000> I<00:03:58.720> only

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
to that so I have used this and I only

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.290 
to that so I have used this and I only
use<00:03:59.260> it<00:03:59.410> once<00:03:59.650> and<00:04:00.040> I<00:04:00.220> felt<00:04:00.520> like<00:04:00.700> this<00:04:00.940> was

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
use it once and I felt like this was

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.440 
use it once and I felt like this was
just<00:04:01.630> a<00:04:01.840> normal<00:04:02.170> sponge<00:04:02.709> nothing<00:04:03.250> special

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.509 

it's<00:04:07.450> very<00:04:07.720> soft<00:04:08.080> actually<00:04:08.890> it's<00:04:09.250> actually

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
it's very soft actually it's actually

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.830 
it's very soft actually it's actually
softer<00:04:10.180> than<00:04:10.360> this<00:04:10.510> probably<00:04:11.019> it<00:04:12.010> is<00:04:12.660> but<00:04:13.660> I

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
softer than this probably it is but I

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.199 
softer than this probably it is but I
just<00:04:13.930> feel<00:04:14.410> like<00:04:14.470> this<00:04:15.069> does<00:04:15.459> nothing<00:04:15.640> to<00:04:16.060> help

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
just feel like this does nothing to help

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.449 
just feel like this does nothing to help
you<00:04:16.870> know<00:04:16.989> apply<00:04:17.320> my<00:04:17.470> foundation<00:04:17.500> any<00:04:18.190> better

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
you know apply my foundation any better

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.599 
you know apply my foundation any better
than<00:04:18.760> any<00:04:19.060> other<00:04:19.299> type<00:04:20.049> of<00:04:20.160> applicator<00:04:21.160> like<00:04:21.430> a

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
than any other type of applicator like a

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.300 
than any other type of applicator like a
sponge<00:04:22.000> or<00:04:22.360> something<00:04:22.810> like<00:04:22.960> that<00:04:23.020> so<00:04:23.380> I<00:04:23.740> mean

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
sponge or something like that so I mean

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.070 
sponge or something like that so I mean
this<00:04:24.460> does<00:04:24.760> cover<00:04:25.090> your<00:04:25.330> area<00:04:25.660> but<00:04:25.840> I<00:04:25.900> feel

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
this does cover your area but I feel

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.750 
this does cover your area but I feel
like<00:04:26.110> blending<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:26.889> it<00:04:27.100> just<00:04:27.130> starts<00:04:27.669> to

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
like blending it and it just starts to

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.290 
like blending it and it just starts to
streak<00:04:28.270> so<00:04:28.600> I<00:04:28.810> don't<00:04:29.169> let<00:04:29.500> that<00:04:29.710> brush<00:04:30.010> and<00:04:30.340> the

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
streak so I don't let that brush and the

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.230 
streak so I don't let that brush and the
last<00:04:31.540> one<00:04:31.780> that<00:04:31.810> I<00:04:31.960> have<00:04:32.229> is<00:04:32.500> this<00:04:32.800> um<00:04:33.240> ones

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
last one that I have is this um ones

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.330 
last one that I have is this um ones
that<00:04:34.389> called<00:04:34.570> angled<00:04:35.020> bronzing<00:04:35.680> brush<00:04:35.710> and

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
that called angled bronzing brush and

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.820 
that called angled bronzing brush and
it's<00:04:37.300> angled<00:04:37.840> at<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.050> tip<00:04:38.290> so<00:04:38.530> I<00:04:38.560> guess<00:04:38.800> it's

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
it's angled at the tip so I guess it's

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.800 
it's angled at the tip so I guess it's
good<00:04:39.160> for<00:04:39.340> like<00:04:39.460> applying<00:04:39.970> bronzer<00:04:40.210> or<00:04:40.660> your

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
good for like applying bronzer or your

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.800 
good for like applying bronzer or your
contour<00:04:41.260> color<00:04:41.470> or<00:04:41.770> like<00:04:42.040> cheeks<00:04:42.370> and<00:04:42.669> I<00:04:43.479> don't

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
contour color or like cheeks and I don't

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.390 
contour color or like cheeks and I don't
like<00:04:43.960> this<00:04:44.080> brush<00:04:44.410> because<00:04:44.680> it's<00:04:45.039> very

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
like this brush because it's very

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.550 
like this brush because it's very
scratchy<00:04:46.210> and<00:04:46.770> it<00:04:47.770> does<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.460> bleed<00:04:49.330> red<00:04:50.140> dye

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
scratchy and it does a bleed red dye

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.740 
scratchy and it does a bleed red dye
whenever<00:04:51.460> you<00:04:51.610> first<00:04:51.850> wash<00:04:52.090> it<00:04:52.360> and<00:04:52.570> I've

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
whenever you first wash it and I've

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.840 
whenever you first wash it and I've
watched<00:04:52.990> this<00:04:53.140> like<00:04:53.350> 10<00:04:53.710> times<00:04:53.979> and<00:04:54.370> I've

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
watched this like 10 times and I've

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.460 
watched this like 10 times and I've
never<00:04:54.880> used<00:04:55.270> it<00:04:55.590> um<00:04:57.750> it<00:04:58.750> doesn't<00:04:58.960> have<00:04:59.200> a<00:04:59.229> smell

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
never used it um it doesn't have a smell

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.770 
never used it um it doesn't have a smell
but<00:05:00.010> I<00:05:00.220> just<00:05:00.729> don't<00:05:00.880> use<00:05:01.090> it<00:05:01.210> because<00:05:01.240> it's<00:05:01.600> too

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
but I just don't use it because it's too

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.650 
but I just don't use it because it's too
scratchy<00:05:02.110> and<00:05:02.650> it's<00:05:03.460> too<00:05:03.760> like<00:05:04.060> small<00:05:04.510> look

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
nothing there compared to my essence of

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.260 
nothing there compared to my essence of
beauty<00:05:09.729> one<00:05:10.440> this<00:05:11.440> is<00:05:11.590> like<00:05:11.770> the<00:05:12.039> same<00:05:12.270> concept

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
beauty one this is like the same concept

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.659 
beauty one this is like the same concept
it's<00:05:13.450> a<00:05:13.539> contour<00:05:14.020> brush<00:05:14.890> and<00:05:15.250> then<00:05:15.280> look<00:05:15.550> at

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
it's a contour brush and then look at

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.160 
it's a contour brush and then look at
how<00:05:15.789> dense<00:05:16.180> that<00:05:16.450> is

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.170 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:25.200 

compared<00:05:21.170> to<00:05:21.770> this<00:05:22.660> look<00:05:23.660> at<00:05:23.810> that

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
compared to this look at that

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.230 
compared to this look at that
it's<00:05:25.930> like<00:05:26.050> fluffy<00:05:26.639> so<00:05:27.639> yeah<00:05:27.880> I<00:05:27.910> don't

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
it's like fluffy so yeah I don't

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.939 
it's like fluffy so yeah I don't
recommend<00:05:28.479> this<00:05:28.750> because<00:05:28.930> it's<00:05:29.229> scratchy<00:05:29.530> and

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949
