00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.740
 what's up with people zero tv and with one 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.210
 new video destiny some people 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.840
 write us on youtube and facebook 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.940
 on 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.530
 What exactly did we say as 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.320
 we analyzed the trailer 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.330
 regarding where it is exotic 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.650
 weapon because if you still have the analysis 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.880
 have not seen the check in the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.160
 description off because there we have 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.920
 said that we think that 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.689
 fallen there the waffle place on where it 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.429
 holding in the hand that was a very 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.349
 interesting thing in the look 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.149
 because the thing looks almost identical 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.250
 off and the interesting thing is that the front 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.600
 flames coming from the mouth and then 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.340
 we just said that could be the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.800
 that would be very interesting if it were 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.660
 that's because it has solar damage and yes 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.280
 come out in front stop and then flames 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.620
 have just asked some what is that 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.969
 Anyway, you have no idea what 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.350
 the animal here is we talking 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.329
 as if we've known that for a while 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.610
 you have no idea and yes the weapon 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.640
 was from stats and something has already been 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.079
 laid a few months ago but there 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.460
 apparently not everyone knows what we have there 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.770
 we would have meant exactly that here 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.870
 still to declare as an addition 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.519
 There is currently no German 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.470
 Names for this weapon you still remember 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.119
 not how to get this weapon somewhere 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.340
 receives what we know but is that 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.619
 only recently on his idea b 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.030
 this weapon is taken out of the assortment 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.970
 what does that mean for you or 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.009
 for us it's clear that ib always has 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.619
 items that have been placed so everything 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.240
 what is currently in the game in it 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.340
 you in your database and you can do it 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.810
 There are then mostly marvel 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.549
 that too, you do not even date that data 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.320
 from the band got public and 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.189
 there you can read it was 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.750
 but taken out 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.570
 that's why we now refer to 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.659
 planet destiny's statistics so the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.920
 weapon has solar that we have just 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.810
 already said that's right 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.820
 interesting just paired with the infos 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.189
 from the trailer what would have been seen there 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.530
 then you can say that she has 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.180
 a higher rate of fire than the felling 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.560
 Winter's lie is nothing 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.780
 Bad is yes a shotgun if you 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.939
 then it is not necessary to be fit 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.700
 fire rate because a bullet is enough 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.040
 we have a slightly higher fire rate 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.560
 then we have some damage in it 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.479
 but we see the biggest problem completely 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.479
 clear in the range because that is 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.979
 at 5 points this is just momentary 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.319
 very little if you fell them 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.330
 Winters lie in pvp or in pvp 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.250
 you can almost shoot like that 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.680
 New construction opposite drive straight now 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.810
 but felt 40 50 meters is the enemy 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.940
 removed and ultimately with one 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.290
 shot away that may be it here 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.450
 not possible is the problem also 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.160
 already at the fourth rider had because 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.500
 This also a very good weapon 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.120
 but the range is missing because of that 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.709
 The weapon is right in front of the nose 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.560
 must and that is not the sense of 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.959
 thing if there are legendary better weapons 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.239
 But you can reach if 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.500
 you want to use the ruler 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.720
 compensatory and by a whole five 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.310
 points which again adds ten points 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.000
 reach and compare to the 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.500
 fei winters standard 20 points so here 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.480
 it could be a big problem with the 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.700
 reach but the interesting 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.769
 is definitely here 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.890
 we can shoot from the hip 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.900
 thereby more precision and the weapon has 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.180
 a very own ability that calls 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.790
 currently still devils touch and the 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.489
 is quite interesting because when you get up 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.650
 Enemies shoot then there is a chance 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.239
 that the enemies are going up in flames 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.489
 is quite interesting of course for 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.620
 larger opponents, for example, minotaurs 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.650
 or in any case pv adversary 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.510
 but of course in the pvp if you have the 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.700
 Opponent not with a show with two 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.959
 then kill it by the effect 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.400
 namely come that is quite interesting 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.590
 though one or the other certainly 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.659
 think a pump gun should be 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.849
 anyway by the damage one shot be 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.310
 quite clear problems with the weapon 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.140
 definitely that's just an exotic one 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.360
 weapon is with little reach and there 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.920
 There are currently still better 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.319
 alternatives such as the precipitation 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.909
 Winter flights also cause solar damage 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.340
 you can have you forging around 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.980
 leave to arco solar or teach 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.480
 new skills and that can be very 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.349
 be interesting and it will be natural 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.000
 no exotic space occupied but it is 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.500
 Of course, a general tasty 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.209
 Everyone probably wants this weapon 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.010
 somehow somehow just now 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.989
 the collectors want you to have and 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.620
 we are definitely looking forward to seeing you 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.360
 get this weapon from the second dlc 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.980
 how are your thoughts though for 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.870
 writes it out in the comments, we 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.269
 will be having a bit of a discussion because 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.040
 it would be a very interesting topic 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.509
 the choice is lost for you what says 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.190
 her to the statistics 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.449
 otherwise I would say we are through 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.100
 People like to thumb up 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:28.620
 because if the video is informative 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.330
 and if you are none of our daily 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.790
 Destiny videos want to miss more 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.780
 subscribe to our youtube channel 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.780
