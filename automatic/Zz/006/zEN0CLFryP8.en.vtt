00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.760
 they get videos 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.830

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.520

 20,000 euros on it that he might be more maybe less 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:25.109
 it contains hollywood other things used to but it goes on 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.049

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.049
