00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
this is the right way we

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.070 
this is the right way we
so<00:02:08.980> you<00:02:09.040> highlight<00:02:09.490> all<00:02:09.790> of<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.090> peas<00:02:10.270> you

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
so you highlight all of the peas you

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.620 
so you highlight all of the peas you
drag-and-drop<00:02:12.060> I'm<00:02:13.060> not<00:02:13.210> sure<00:02:13.360> if<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:13.570> is

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
drag-and-drop I'm not sure if this is

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.240 
drag-and-drop I'm not sure if this is
the<00:02:13.720> right<00:02:13.870> way<00:02:14.050> but<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.530> tried<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.100> in<00:02:15.190> the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
the right way but I tried it in the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.830 
the right way but I tried it in the
works<00:02:15.460> son<00:02:16.120> then<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.360> highlight<00:02:16.660> all<00:02:16.810> of

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
works son then you highlight all of

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.890 
works son then you highlight all of
these<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:19.000> drag<00:02:19.240> and<00:02:19.420> drop

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
these and you drag and drop

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.140 
these and you drag and drop
