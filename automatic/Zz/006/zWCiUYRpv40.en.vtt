00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.529
 Here's hottie with one again 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.090
 another gameplay commentary from me 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.000
 even though it is not a whole 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.060
 It's a street where I'm real 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.730
 gone bad though that were not 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:34.330
 only evil that was much more accurate 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.030
 it was actually one 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.769
 live recording he at least the beginning 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.870
 I'm totally unnerved after 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:44.290
 So we did not give up because we did not 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.059
 but would have won the own team there 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.280
 were there people so I have something 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.020
 not seen before when to 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.250
 first time in your life 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:56.770
 controller in the hand 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.539
 So I'm pretty frustrated 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.960
 it can not be true 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.719
 his 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.280
 you better do that alone against the 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.470
 other six play that there is 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.630
 we were not alone at all 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.360
 a two man martin await the 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.990
 other 4 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.720
 but as you can see or I do not see 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.149
 here my goodness of the dead 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.280
 but that's just what you want 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.110
 I experiment a bit 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.090
 here with four kilt flies that you can 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.280
 yes here at once word who choose 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.330
 how many kills do you fix with the woman? 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:37.750
 no takeaway was one or two 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:39.970
 or three in all cases , thanks 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.739
 Do you take paper with you of course 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.709
 somehow save his points because 

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:46.959
 my 13 points you spend so 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:49.390
 How to assemble your class 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:52.090
 and I have decided to go here 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.940
 in this gameplay that they are on mine 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.190
 beloved oneself and and now 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.619
 it comes to the topic for this comment 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.869
 actually on my ex ability 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.670
 somehow waived yes I have him 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.739
 otherwise always extreme where you have such a 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.050
 Regenerated a bit faster and at the same time 

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:09.910
 thought is really useful me 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.940
 do not really know 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.610
 Therefore, my question to you is required 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.170
 in these abilities we can only do it 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.940
 they really work 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.470
 we do not have enough skill there 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.080
 so i have to say for example i 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.480
 I've played a round dominance that 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.790
 was awakened awakens a car flag 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.790
 by taking over the 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.510
 driver is hovering so I have him 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.620
 not seen 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.750
 The hole waited there as floating 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.360
 yes that is used tactically 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.890
 Now the question we can with the game 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.290
 we can not even do it here with rw 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.660
 handle it correctly or is that what 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.239
 have built just one 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.880
 Anyhow, new people around the world like that too 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.380
 here we have new and exciting 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.780
 in reality, that does not help 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.400
 That's the question for you, I'm up 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.860
 I appreciate your comments 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.420
 me over every thumbs up her 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.430
 see me get mad 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.420
 she always tells me my friend and me 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.420
 hope to see you again
