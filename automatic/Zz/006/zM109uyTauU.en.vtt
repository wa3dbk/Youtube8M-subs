quarterback<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:50.160> don't<00:01:50.220> know<00:01:50.369> how<00:01:50.430> it's

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
quarterback so I we don't know how it's

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.859 
quarterback so I we don't know how it's
going<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.729> go<00:01:50.789> over<00:01:50.910> right<00:01:51.149> now<00:01:51.210> we're<00:01:51.840> just

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
