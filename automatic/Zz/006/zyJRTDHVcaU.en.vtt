00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
reason for them want nuclear energy they

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.240 
reason for them want nuclear energy they
got<00:01:33.810> more<00:01:34.079> they're<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.439> primary<00:01:34.890> source<00:01:35.100> of

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
got more they're the primary source of

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.340 
got more they're the primary source of
energy<00:01:35.340> for<00:01:35.520> everybody<00:01:35.820> else<00:01:36.079> they<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.200> no

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.839 
mile range we think but the point and
that<00:02:22.540> means<00:02:23.049> that<00:02:23.109> Iran<00:02:23.469> has<00:02:23.709> also<00:02:24.280> has<00:02:24.579> a<00:02:24.609> good

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
that means that Iran has also has a good

it hits a wire it sets up a magnetic a
current<00:06:19.640> in<00:06:19.700> the<00:06:19.760> wire<00:06:19.910> that<00:06:20.600> is<00:06:20.720> so<00:06:20.840> intense

current in the wire that is so intense

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.080 
current in the wire that is so intense
it'll<00:06:21.590> fry<00:06:21.830> the<00:06:21.890> equipment<00:06:22.490> at<00:06:22.580> both<00:06:22.730> ends<00:06:23.000> of

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
it'll fry the equipment at both ends of

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.320 
it'll fry the equipment at both ends of
the<00:06:23.120> wire<00:06:23.360> and<00:06:24.610> so<00:06:25.610> what's<00:06:25.850> that<00:06:25.940> what's<00:06:26.210> the

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
the wire and so what's that what's the

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.180 
the wire and so what's that what's the
implication<00:06:26.480> well<00:06:26.990> if<00:06:27.350> you<00:06:27.560> took<00:06:27.740> the<00:06:27.890> United

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
implication well if you took the United

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.940 
implication well if you took the United
States<00:06:28.430> and<00:06:28.940> you<00:06:29.840> took<00:06:29.960> a<00:06:30.020> nominal<00:06:30.530> warhead

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 
States and you took a nominal warhead

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.490 
States and you took a nominal warhead
about<00:06:31.580> a<00:06:31.610> hundred<00:06:31.820> and<00:06:32.030> forty<00:06:32.450> miles<00:06:32.720> above

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
about a hundred and forty miles above

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.590 
about a hundred and forty miles above
the<00:06:33.560> United<00:06:33.980> States<00:06:34.190> it<00:06:34.970> would<00:06:35.150> generate<00:06:35.540> a

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 
the United States it would generate a

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.630 
the United States it would generate a
magnetic<00:06:35.900> pulse<00:06:36.470> that<00:06:37.370> would<00:06:37.490> go

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:37.640 
magnetic pulse that would go

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.820 
magnetic pulse that would go
coast-to-coast

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
coast-to-coast

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.890 
coast-to-coast
that<00:06:39.370> pulse<00:06:39.670> would<00:06:40.060> disable<00:06:40.450> your

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
that pulse would disable your

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.260 
that pulse would disable your
telecommunications<00:06:41.740> and<00:06:41.980> your<00:06:42.790> power<00:06:42.970> grid

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
telecommunications and your power grid

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.570 
telecommunications and your power grid
just<00:06:43.540> for<00:06:43.690> starters<00:06:43.920> your<00:06:44.920> partner<00:06:45.370> does

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
just for starters your partner does

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.300 
just for starters your partner does
depend<00:06:45.790> on<00:06:46.060> telecommunications<00:06:46.420> by<00:06:46.990> the<00:06:47.050> way

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
depend on telecommunications by the way

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.240 
depend on telecommunications by the way
but<00:06:48.310> the<00:06:48.720> scary<00:06:49.720> part<00:06:50.050> about<00:06:50.260> this<00:06:50.500> is<00:06:50.560> is<00:06:51.040> that

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
but the scary part about this is is that

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.130 
but the scary part about this is is that
it<00:06:51.400> would<00:06:51.550> disable<00:06:52.030> it<00:06:52.360> not<00:06:52.630> for<00:06:52.840> a<00:06:52.870> few<00:06:52.930> hours

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.140 
it would disable it not for a few hours

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.070 
it would disable it not for a few hours
or<00:06:53.620> a<00:06:53.650> few<00:06:53.680> days<00:06:53.950> a<00:06:54.010> few<00:06:54.130> months<00:06:54.370> permanently
