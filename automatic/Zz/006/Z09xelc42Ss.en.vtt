 in a rude way the law is arnaud 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.700
 Then we will cut 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.700
 butter in pieces the regular 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.550
 we are going to drop it 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.550
 in a stainless steel basin 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.130
 and we are going to do it for us risk obama 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.550
 at the same time 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.980

 chocolate 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.520
 here it's about chocolate drop 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.970
 but if you do not have one 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.650
 beforehand catch the chocolate and the father for us risk obama 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.390
 one-way setting 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.250
 flour 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.330
 break 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.320
 the omd in a basin 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.600
 added 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.120
 a pinch of salt 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.300
 drain energetically 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.300
 then added the caster sugar 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.260
 whitewash 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.930
 ie withers 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.530
 so mr j -c 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.530
 until what the mixture becomes 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.790
 once this is done 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.060
 we will resume the melted chocolate 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.690
 and add 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.300
 author 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.319
 which is also provided 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.749
 we will mix 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:13.749
 using a spatula 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:23.269
 Then we will add the mixture 1 p sugar

 that we have whitened just now 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.189
 and mix 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.149
 always with a spatula 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:35.469
 with time I am angry 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.519
 all these operations will be done fairly quickly 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.839
 so that chocolate does not harden 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:43.929
 it would then be possible 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:46.929
 to mix the ingredients 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:52.259
 now add the flour sift 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.749
 mix them up 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:59.749
 also using the spatula 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.269
 we just have to add

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.209
 roughly just now 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.959
 once this operation is completed 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.889

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.319
 of bronislaw in the frame 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.499
 and spread it 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:34.499
 on a thickness of about 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.499
 one and a half centimeters 

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:45.629
 and then 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.209

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.079
 to check the cooking 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:12.389
 for that we are going to plant a knife blade 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.389
 in the center of Gaullism but it must stand out 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:21.989
