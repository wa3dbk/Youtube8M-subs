00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.710
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.870
 another video 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.779
 Today I want to show you how you are 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.670
 So you can start your minecraft server 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.860
 that your friends play on it too 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.130
 First of all, I can only get on the side 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.850
 four points come and is here 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.140
 to sing 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:34.660
 clayton account 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.489
 and create us here account debus 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.379
 Here you could enter what you want 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.379
 you give it the first time 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.910
 so 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:54.540
 now freezing fruits I would have 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.540
 still have to go 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.640
 so now probably my activation code per 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.020
 mail sent 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.760
 after you have collectivized one 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.500
 then usually came to the 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.369
 page 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.960
 since I provide this but or 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.860
 I have to have done wrong browser 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.860
 Log in again 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.130
 not in there now 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.630
 I also already have a domain but would like 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.409
 now another confident 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.409
 on about horst 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.590
 then here as the domain should be called in 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.399
 puncto and hierarchy debus for example 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.659
 and then enter the ip address here 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.759
 was according to is getting the ip address 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.409
 if not then taken 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:45.500
 can you look again at how 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.670
 is my punkt.de you see then 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.010
 also yapi again or she could 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.960
 then copy 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:55.040
 and then there's a movie 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.320
 then click on add 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.090
 and in a few minutes is yours 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.170
 address ready 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.410
 I can handle that with me here 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.710
 but I also have 2 now 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.500
 Well 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.060
 Next , it would be useful to the 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.860
 lines to download 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.060
 v 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.060
 and just download here 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.250
 and then install that then you have 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.800
 that here you get at the end of such a 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:34.320
 You can then window your account 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.320
 velen also-actebis at web.de so 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.480
 now I am with the kontron can 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.890
 select which hosts all saved 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.580
 the two will be safe and then 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.270
 every five minutes the two addresses 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.150
 it can always be that updated 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.670
 The IP address changes when I turn on 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.060
 kurfess clique becomes the ip-address 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.550
 matched with that of my computer 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.330
 and then saved there that you always 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.330
 can access it 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.920
 But that is also without a process 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.780
 we have to work next 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.080
 via the webinterface of our good 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.200
 log in 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.420
 in my case it is the here 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.700
 Of course it can also be with everyone 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.660
 others may be red or maybe 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.480
 it would not have to enter 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.910
 maybe that's how it goes 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.959
 So either you have to speed point 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:32.050
 enter or fritz box with what you have 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.050
 Has 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:40.640
 then i enter my password here i 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:44.170
 I am already doing so well in there now 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.170
 continue on firefox then you go on 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.170
 network 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:55.040
 then open on nad and port rules there 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.210
 and there you have to fix all new ones 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.820
 I already have a rule 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.160
 defined that is the port 25 565 the 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.770
 is the standard minecraft there namely 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.040
 open or simply enter the Sun 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.310
 tcp protocol very important or does one have 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.310
 the 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.770
 the second thing you have to do 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.799
 is a dynamic the first to 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:22.150
 then determine the image 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:24.699
 If you choose the one with which here and 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.400
 Here then the host on the run 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:30.060
 such life time org and 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.060
 the e- mail address 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.270
 then you have the password 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:38.040
 Enter what you recorded time 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:42.130
 has determined or just a point com 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.110
 So now you have to save it 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.710
 could be 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:50.080
 For safety's sake, I'll click here wrong 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.880
 like that and start minecraft server now 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.880
 so the service started 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.770
 and now i would have to via archimedes 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.479
 point by point org from all the others 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.419
 Computers can still access the problem 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.770
 This computer is not 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.729
 So I can show it too bad 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.449
 I can continue using localhost on it 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.919
 access 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:14.990
 but others only hold over 1,000 points 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:18.020
 or to another address the one 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.539
 I'm sure I could 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.900
 help you with this video and see you through 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.900
 next time
