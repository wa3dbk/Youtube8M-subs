this is what I wasn't going to do this
video<00:00:42.239> originally<00:00:42.960> because<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.590> more<00:00:43.829> or

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
video originally because this is more or

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.920 
video originally because this is more or
less<00:00:43.980> just<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.789> GV<00:00:45.120> supreme<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.719> only

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
less just like the GV supreme the only

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.869 
less just like the GV supreme the only
difference<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.590> do<00:00:46.950> not<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.520> reboot

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
difference is you do not have to reboot

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.020 
difference is you do not have to reboot
to<00:00:48.390> enable<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.930> GPRS<00:00:49.559> feature<00:00:49.950> or<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.550> they
