00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.730
 and 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.930
 today 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.350
 no no no no 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.070
 the Mexican video game industry was 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.170
 nonexistent to like for 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.080
 many others it still is until all 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.000
 change for me there is some day left 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.800
 April of 2003 I bought a magazine of 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.410
 gaming and to my surprise inside your 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.770
 content came an article entitled 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.770
 facts in mexico 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.379
 I would not be anthropos adventure games 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.820
 with physical comics which you had to read 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.129
 to understand the history of 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.720
 game and to finish you had to repeat 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.100
 the steps in the next delivery 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.100
 and we did it created 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.610
 the story continues this innovative 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.610
 idea was developed by snake ano 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.890
 so 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.560
 this kind of the pathological 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.740
 also came an article about love 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.170
 a pg love that was developed by 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.970
 radical studies that sought to be the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.350
 first massive multiplayer online game 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.350
 100% in Spanish 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.140
 both were launched with great success 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.420
 Unfortunately they have trophies although it arrived 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.479
 until Russia only gave birth to his second 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.579
 delivery in 2005 and was unable to afford 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.319
 the servers ending up in the 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.319
 Radical separation studies 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.530
 so for more than 10 years 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.720
 mexico began to join from among the 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.760
 shadows to show that there are also 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.620
 talent to grow the industry 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.310
 of video games in the country 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.350
 yes 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.270
 in you 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.700
 that by the way, currently 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.980
 video games are considered one more among 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.610
 the enumeration of the arts 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.610
 good 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.319
 a game that has become a phenomenon 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.849
 total is clear you space program 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.739
 video game that is used by NASA to 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.720
 simulate real problems that can 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.720
 arise when launching a rocket 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.320
 since its dynamics simulate very 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.070
 approximately the difficulties of 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.070
 real space 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.890
 a pretty interesting game 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.250
 advisable that you can write in 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.010
 steam for only 22 points 99 dollars that 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.780
 they are approximately 300 pesos and that 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.909
 It can also be used as a tool 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.099
 for education thus proving that 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.530
 it does not need to be boring 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.700
 absolute and that schools in Mexico are 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.700
 they are falling behind 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.330
 and 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.880
 there are currently quite a few companies that 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.100
 they are dedicated to develop or be part of 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.500
 of the development of video games as a larva 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.830
 game musicization studios like 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.770
 voltaic studies of ge and as follows ball 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.220
 game design as you indÃºstries and 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.220
 hidden face dedicated to crowdsourcing 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.220
 baguette 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.470
 also several schools have opened 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.289
 specializations to unleash 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.419
 to the Mexican ingenuity of the people who 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:24.090
 want to be part of this adventure of 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.490
 life that represents being a designer and 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.770
 video game developer the 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.710
 University of Morelia is part of 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.110
 these than it is planning to 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.960
 get a video game going through the 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.150
 going through the development phase 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.919
 prototyping until culminating with the 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.280
 intellectual property by applying 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:47.220
 technologies like juniti because chivas 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.270

 always heading towards the future 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.740
 development of applications with 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.180
 cutting-edge technology and gÃ¡dor for 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.340
 10 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.720
 I have been a gamer since 17 and 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.910
 tell of the people who are already 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.800
 making quite a lot of noise on their way and 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.599
 that also serve as inspiration for their 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.870
 iconic activity on social networks 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:16.139

 so before going back to doubt about 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.440
