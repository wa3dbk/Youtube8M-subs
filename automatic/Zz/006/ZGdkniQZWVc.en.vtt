00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
that was another kokanee all right let's

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.710 
that was another kokanee all right let's
do<00:03:57.019> this<00:03:57.110> one<00:03:57.290> more<00:03:57.319> time<00:03:57.500> okay<00:03:58.569> we're<00:03:59.569> going

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720

do this one more time okay we're going
to<00:03:59.780> go<00:03:59.900> back<00:04:00.050> down<00:04:00.290> to<00:04:00.319> 40<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:01.569> let's<00:04:02.569> see<00:04:02.750> if

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
to go back down to 40 and let's see if

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.290 
to go back down to 40 and let's see if
we<00:04:02.959> can<00:04:03.080> track<00:04:03.350> that<00:04:03.590> sonic<00:04:04.250> baitfish<00:04:04.430> again

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.280 

you<00:04:08.300> notice<00:04:08.480> we<00:04:09.080> primarily<00:04:09.380> use<00:04:09.730> single<00:04:10.730> hooks

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
you notice we primarily use single hooks

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.680 
you notice we primarily use single hooks
attached<00:04:12.290> to<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.620> tail<00:04:13.150> they<00:04:14.150> work<00:04:14.390> a<00:04:14.510> lot

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
attached to the tail they work a lot

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.659 
attached to the tail they work a lot
better<00:04:14.870> than<00:04:15.170> a<00:04:15.200> syst<00:04:15.500> hooks<00:04:15.769> and<00:04:15.980> it<00:04:16.130> hooks

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
better than a syst hooks and it hooks

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.940 
better than a syst hooks and it hooks
anywhere<00:04:17.060> else<00:04:17.269> and<00:04:17.590> they're<00:04:18.590> a<00:04:18.620> lot<00:04:18.769> more

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
we have a fish that's tracking see how

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.620 
we have a fish that's tracking see how
it<00:05:36.110> came<00:05:36.320> up<00:05:36.380> there<00:05:36.740> and<00:05:37.669> staging<00:05:38.270> right<00:05:38.300> there

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
it came up there and staging right there

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.860 
it came up there and staging right there
and<00:05:38.690> a<00:05:38.750> lot<00:05:38.870> of<00:05:38.930> times<00:05:39.229> I'll<00:05:39.409> just<00:05:39.440> stop<00:05:39.919> it

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
and a lot of times I'll just stop it

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.950 
and a lot of times I'll just stop it
it's<00:05:41.870> like<00:05:42.050> so

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.420 

just<00:05:45.960> because<00:05:46.260> I'm<00:05:46.500> holding<00:05:46.680> it<00:05:46.920> still<00:05:47.160> that

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
just because I'm holding it still that

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.620 
just because I'm holding it still that
doesn't<00:05:47.580> necessarily<00:05:47.790> mean<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:48.330> lures<00:05:48.510> are

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
doesn't necessarily mean the lures are

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.690 
doesn't necessarily mean the lures are
not<00:05:48.720> moving<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.860> current<00:05:50.190> down<00:05:50.340> there<00:05:50.580> is

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
not moving the current down there is

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.290 
not moving the current down there is
rotating<00:05:51.360> that<00:05:51.630> ler<00:05:51.930> and<00:05:52.320> it<00:05:53.220> imitates<00:05:53.700> a<00:05:54.030> fish

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
rotating that ler and it imitates a fish

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.820 
rotating that ler and it imitates a fish
that's<00:05:54.480> still<00:05:54.750> alive<00:05:54.960> but<00:05:55.170> in<00:05:55.260> the<00:05:55.320> process<00:05:55.740> of

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
that's still alive but in the process of

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.700 
that's still alive but in the process of
dying<00:05:56.100> and<00:05:57.030> this<00:05:57.210> is<00:05:57.390> even<00:05:57.870> further<00:05:58.110> magnify

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
dying and this is even further magnify

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.140 
dying and this is even further magnify
it<00:05:58.770> out<00:05:58.980> in<00:05:59.130> the<00:05:59.220> ocean<00:05:59.340> where<00:05:59.700> you<00:05:59.790> have<00:05:59.910> tide

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
movement where that ler is really really

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.880 
movement where that ler is really really
doing<00:06:03.510> its<00:06:03.660> thing<00:06:03.870> down<00:06:04.110> there<00:06:04.350> even<00:06:04.770> if

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890
