00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
hey guys what's going on welcome to a

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.430 
hey guys what's going on welcome to a
guide<00:00:02.159> on<00:00:02.340> how<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.520> unlock<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:03.090> times<00:00:03.600> for<00:00:04.049> red

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
guide on how to unlock the times for red

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.349 
guide on how to unlock the times for red
brick<00:00:04.680> stood<00:00:05.190> multiplier<00:00:05.640> in<00:00:05.879> Lego<00:00:06.150> The

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
brick stood multiplier in Lego The

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.570 
brick stood multiplier in Lego The
Hobbit<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:06.839> so<00:00:07.589> this<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:08.010> another<00:00:08.189> one<00:00:08.550> of

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
Hobbit and so this is another one of

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.190 
Hobbit and so this is another one of
them<00:00:08.790> red<00:00:09.059> bricks<00:00:09.330> which<00:00:09.570> require<00:00:09.960> you<00:00:10.170> to

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
them red bricks which require you to

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.770 
them red bricks which require you to
create<00:00:11.130> something<00:00:11.670> using<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.360> design

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
create something using a design

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.740 
create something using a design
schematic<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.380> give<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.790> person<00:00:15.330> who's

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
schematic and give it to a person who's

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.260 
schematic and give it to a person who's
asking<00:00:16.139> for<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.789> so<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.970> design

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
asking for it and so the design

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.810 
asking for it and so the design
schematic<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:18.960> question<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.590> there<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
schematic in question is there on the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.109 
schematic in question is there on the
map<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:22.160> I<00:00:23.160> was<00:00:23.519> actually<00:00:23.820> running<00:00:23.970> around

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
map and I I was actually running around

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.970 
map and I I was actually running around
the<00:00:24.539> whole<00:00:24.720> area<00:00:25.019> for<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> while<00:00:25.470> cuz<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:25.949> just

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
the whole area for a while cuz I just

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.769 
the whole area for a while cuz I just
could<00:00:26.550> not<00:00:26.699> figure<00:00:26.939> out<00:00:27.090> how<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.330> get<00:00:27.480> even

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
could not figure out how to get even

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.600 
could not figure out how to get even
near<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.289> place<00:00:28.640> to<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.910> schematic<00:00:30.449> but

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
near to the place to the schematic but

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.889 
near to the place to the schematic but
eventually<00:00:32.610> now<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.000> have<00:00:33.180> figured<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.809> it

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
eventually now you have figured that it

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.780 
eventually now you have figured that it
was<00:00:34.050> actually<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.469> door<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.219> need<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.460> get<00:00:35.610> to

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
was actually the door you need to get to

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.270 
was actually the door you need to get to
you<00:00:36.300> need<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.480> get<00:00:36.660> through<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> door<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.380> so

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
you need to get through the door and so

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.740 
you need to get through the door and so
when<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.670> first<00:00:38.850> come<00:00:39.059> towards<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.510> door

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
when you first come towards the door

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.810 
when you first come towards the door
there<00:00:40.079> will<00:00:40.200> be<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.350> poem<00:00:40.680> or<00:00:40.980> riddle<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
there will be a poem or riddle to the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.150 
there will be a poem or riddle to the
left<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.719> will<00:00:42.780> basically<00:00:43.020> say<00:00:43.500> follow

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
left and it will basically say follow

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.580 
left and it will basically say follow
the<00:00:44.430> light<00:00:44.809> essentially<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.140> it'll<00:00:46.379> say

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
the light essentially and it'll say

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.709 
the light essentially and it'll say
where<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.190> darkness<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.850> avoid<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.570> or

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
where the darkness is avoid it or

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.200 
where the darkness is avoid it or
something<00:00:49.460> essentially<00:00:50.460> what<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.610> means<00:00:50.910> is

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
something essentially what that means is

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.000 
something essentially what that means is
follow<00:00:52.199> these<00:00:52.500> yellow<00:00:52.980> arrows<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.809> do<00:00:55.320> not<00:00:55.559> go

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
follow these yellow arrows and do not go

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.260 
follow these yellow arrows and do not go
where<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.059> purple<00:00:57.930> arrows<00:00:58.230> say<00:00:58.820> in<00:00:59.820> fact<00:01:00.120> it

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
where the purple arrows say in fact it

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.930 
where the purple arrows say in fact it
does<00:01:00.420> say<00:01:00.660> if<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.410> purple<00:01:01.920> arrow<00:01:02.039> shows<00:01:02.399> up<00:01:02.609> just

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
does say if a purple arrow shows up just

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.369 
does say if a purple arrow shows up just
kill<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> opposite<00:01:03.539> way<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.899> where<00:01:04.019> that

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
kill the opposite way of where that

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.830 
kill the opposite way of where that
arrow<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.920> pointing<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.689> once<00:01:06.689> you've

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
arrow is pointing and once you've

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.179 
arrow is pointing and once you've
followed<00:01:07.049> them<00:01:07.290> all<00:01:07.380> it'll<00:01:07.650> bring<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.920> back

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
followed them all it'll bring you back

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.399 
followed them all it'll bring you back
round<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.760> door<00:01:08.790> yeah<00:01:09.479> which<00:01:09.689> was<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> bit

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
round to the door yeah which was a bit

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.000 
round to the door yeah which was a bit
of<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> pointless<00:01:10.830> exercise<00:01:11.090> but<00:01:12.170> this<00:01:13.170> digging

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
of a pointless exercise but this digging

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.130 
of a pointless exercise but this digging
thing<00:01:14.430> will<00:01:14.700> appear<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.210> you'll<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:15.869> able<00:01:15.960> to

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
thing will appear and you'll be able to

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.399 
thing will appear and you'll be able to
use<00:01:16.320> Sam<00:01:16.799> or<00:01:17.070> someone<00:01:17.520> else<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.330> dig<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.960> get

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
use Sam or someone else to dig and get

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.890 
use Sam or someone else to dig and get
the<00:01:19.530> key<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.850> then<00:01:20.970> obviously<00:01:21.150> use<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> key<00:01:21.780> on

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
the key and then obviously use a key on

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:43.830 
the key and then obviously use a key on
the<00:01:22.020> door<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.500> then<00:01:23.220> head<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.430> in

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.390 

now<00:01:44.840> I<00:01:44.869> kind<00:01:45.229> of<00:01:45.350> morphed<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:45.890> because<00:01:46.159> I<00:01:46.280> had

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
now I kind of morphed it because I had

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.920 
now I kind of morphed it because I had
to<00:01:46.520> come<00:01:46.640> back<00:01:46.909> because<00:01:47.210> I<00:01:47.659> could<00:01:47.840> not

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
to come back because I could not

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.810 
to come back because I could not
actually<00:01:48.200> have<00:01:48.320> enough<00:01:48.560> resources<00:01:48.979> for<00:01:49.460> these

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
actually have enough resources for these

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.219 
actually have enough resources for these
different<00:01:50.619> results<00:01:51.619> things<00:01:52.220> which<00:01:52.580> want<00:01:53.229> your

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
different results things which want your

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.609 
different results things which want your
resources<00:01:54.619> well<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.580> one<00:01:55.700> is<00:01:55.880> 20<00:01:56.360> emeralds<00:01:57.050> 20

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
resources well the one is 20 emeralds 20

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.810 
resources well the one is 20 emeralds 20
rupees<00:01:58.159> and<00:01:58.670> 20<00:01:59.600> dem<00:02:00.290> or<00:02:01.250> is<00:02:01.369> it<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.610> blue

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
rupees and 20 dem or is it the blue

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.320 
rupees and 20 dem or is it the blue
stuff<00:02:02.090> it's<00:02:02.960> gone<00:02:03.140> well<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.380> blue<00:02:03.500> stuff<00:02:03.710> is<00:02:03.830> M

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
stuff it's gone well the blue stuff is M

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.940 
stuff it's gone well the blue stuff is M
but<00:02:05.330> yeah<00:02:05.479> you<00:02:05.630> basically<00:02:05.960> need<00:02:06.140> 20<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:06.860> now<00:02:06.920> I

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
do not have enough so if you do if you

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.350 
do not have enough so if you do if you
don't<00:02:10.070> have<00:02:10.220> enough<00:02:10.429> either<00:02:10.610> why<00:02:10.850> I<00:02:10.880> recommend

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
don't have enough either why I recommend

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.800 
don't have enough either why I recommend
is<00:02:11.600> replaying<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.440> first<00:02:12.920> mission<00:02:13.489> and

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
is replaying the first mission and

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.300 
is replaying the first mission and
getting<00:02:14.810> up<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:15.019> the<00:02:15.110> point<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.980> unveil

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
getting up to the point of the unveil

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.870 
getting up to the point of the unveil
and<00:02:16.519> it's<00:02:17.239> smashing<00:02:17.690> up<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.870> different

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
and it's smashing up the different

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.580 
and it's smashing up the different
resource<00:02:19.880> boxes<00:02:20.390> which<00:02:20.810> are<00:02:21.050> in<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:21.230> level

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
resource boxes which are in that level

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.630 
resource boxes which are in that level
because<00:02:21.680> there's<00:02:22.040> actually<00:02:22.130> quite<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.550> few

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
because there's actually quite a few

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.360 
because there's actually quite a few
you'll<00:02:23.209> get<00:02:23.450> like<00:02:23.630> five<00:02:23.959> each<00:02:24.200> time<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:25.340> I

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
you'll get like five each time and so I

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.880 
you'll get like five each time and so I
have<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:25.610> do<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:25.880> like<00:02:26.090> three<00:02:26.420> times<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:27.620> get

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
have to do that like three times to get

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.540 
have to do that like three times to get
the<00:02:28.130> Louise<00:02:28.940> asses<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:30.010> but<00:02:31.010> anyway<00:02:31.280> if<00:02:31.430> you

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
the Louise asses and but anyway if you

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.370 
the Louise asses and but anyway if you
have<00:02:31.790> enough<00:02:32.180> resources<00:02:32.630> again<00:02:32.870> then<00:02:33.140> just

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
have enough resources again then just

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.949 
have enough resources again then just
throw<00:02:33.680> them<00:02:33.890> in<00:02:33.980> here<00:02:34.150> white<00:02:35.150> tells<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:35.780> to

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
mountains like in the high pass earlier

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.190 
mountains like in the high pass earlier
and<00:03:48.920> it<00:03:49.760> is<00:03:49.850> our<00:03:50.000> red<00:03:50.240> question<00:03:50.480> mark<00:03:50.720> right

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
and it is our red question mark right

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.530 
and it is our red question mark right
there<00:03:51.830> in<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.160> middle<00:03:52.310> so<00:03:53.210> we're<00:03:53.330> going<00:03:53.450> to

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
there in the middle so we're going to

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.350 
there in the middle so we're going to
fast<00:03:53.780> travel<00:03:54.020> to<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.440> nearest<00:03:54.770> and<00:03:55.360> fast

fast travel to the nearest and fast
travel<00:03:56.690> station<00:03:57.050> and<00:03:57.580> then<00:03:58.580> we're<00:03:58.760> just<00:03:58.790> going

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
travel station and then we're just going

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.180 
travel station and then we're just going
to<00:03:59.120> follow<00:03:59.300> the<00:03:59.510> path<00:03:59.690> and<00:04:00.020> I<00:04:00.710> mean<00:04:00.980> you<00:04:01.070> can

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
to follow the path and I mean you can

to follow the path and I mean you can
always<00:04:01.310> mark<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:01.970> like<00:04:02.620> mark<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.920> question

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
always mark it like mark the question

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.940 
always mark it like mark the question
mark<00:04:04.550> on<00:04:05.300> your<00:04:05.510> map<00:04:05.630> and<00:04:05.810> it'll<00:04:06.380> be<00:04:06.560> a<00:04:06.590> trail

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
mark on your map and it'll be a trail

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.670 
mark on your map and it'll be a trail
which<00:04:07.280> will<00:04:07.520> show<00:04:07.790> you<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:08.060> way<00:04:08.240> so<00:04:09.110> that<00:04:09.320> does

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
which will show you the way so that does

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.570 
which will show you the way so that does
help<00:04:09.709> quite<00:04:10.220> a<00:04:10.250> bit

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
help quite a bit

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.220 
help quite a bit
which<00:04:10.940> I<00:04:11.060> do<00:04:11.120> here<00:04:11.390> so<00:04:11.540> you<00:04:11.690> can<00:04:12.020> place<00:04:12.200> a

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
which I do here so you can place a

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.330 
which I do here so you can place a
marker<00:04:12.940> and<00:04:13.940> it<00:04:14.240> will<00:04:14.330> show<00:04:14.480> you<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:14.750> way<00:04:14.870> and

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
marker and it will show you the way and

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.259 
marker and it will show you the way and
so<00:04:16.340> you<00:04:16.430> actually<00:04:16.519> need<00:04:16.880> to<00:04:16.910> follow<00:04:17.150> it

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
so you actually need to follow it

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.170 
so you actually need to follow it
closely<00:04:17.390> there's<00:04:17.750> a<00:04:17.810> point<00:04:17.989> where<00:04:18.230> I<00:04:18.260> did<00:04:18.590> like

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
closely there's a point where I did like

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.350 
closely there's a point where I did like
lose<00:04:20.180> it<00:04:20.420> and<00:04:21.340> then<00:04:22.340> kept<00:04:22.580> on<00:04:22.670> line<00:04:22.850> because<00:04:23.300> I

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
lose it and then kept on line because I

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.690 
lose it and then kept on line because I
didn't<00:04:23.570> know<00:04:23.660> where<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:23.840> go<00:04:23.990> but<00:04:24.410> yeah<00:04:25.100> just

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
didn't know where to go but yeah just

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:38.300

actually work out your to go actually

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.220 
actually work out your to go actually
have<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.730> go<00:04:45.850> through<00:04:45.880> that<00:04:46.270> cave<00:04:46.480> so<00:04:46.870> swing

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
have to go through that cave so swing

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.810 
have to go through that cave so swing
across<00:04:47.530> there<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:48.010> you'll<00:04:48.280> actually<00:04:48.400> have<00:04:48.700> to

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
across there and you'll actually have to

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.690 
across there and you'll actually have to
go<00:04:48.910> through<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.210> cave<00:04:49.920> because<00:04:50.920> these<00:04:51.400> stills

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
go through the cave because these stills

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.450 
go through the cave because these stills
were<00:04:51.880> not<00:04:52.090> that<00:04:52.240> obvious<00:04:52.390> for<00:04:52.840> me<00:04:53.250> but<00:04:54.250> just

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
be there and you'll probably know what
