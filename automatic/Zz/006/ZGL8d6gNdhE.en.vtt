 numerous guys and welcome again 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.930
 more to the channel 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.870
 and I hope I teach you 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:15.440
 and of course because I'm not very 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.640
 sure how to cross the walls with 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.810
 jesus is the typical crosses east walls 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.140
 staff that we want to be worth 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:28.400
 in which we are going to practice you have said 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.489
 what to see to see using the minion 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.040
 how can we go for it with the 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:37.120
 and we can jump to the media is worth what 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:41.800
 what to do is paste we watch the movement 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.800
 and normally 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.850
 no other 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.170
 I just finished the program for one is very 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.190
 easy 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.190
 to put it more 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.399
 around here they vary, giving the maximum in 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.940
 walls to throw your w that makes pull 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.940
 in 5 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.409
 let's go we throw the vision and throw 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.909
 with the leads 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.979
 we usually go running and no longer 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.689
 they catch us in friends from where they 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.930
 can do not to say exactly 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:22.869
 from where you can do but go 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.399
 this is the trick plus 5 basic what 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.039
 you have to do is practicing in plan 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.380
 here you can here you can I'm not going to 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.930
 Take the work for example with the plugin 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.650
 we try because look for example this one 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:39.320
 can you say yes 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.320
 it's because it's yes or yes 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.490
 and we hit 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.620
 throw yourself off is that if you can I 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.430
 I understand it for a new dawn 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.680
 bye 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.300
 you just have to put a place without which 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.300
 only less than two minutes 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.750
 in said pegate jaguar uncle I love you 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.750
 skip 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.000
 if you do from here to here was 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.000
 been the bug has appeared 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.830
 in plan 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.140
 and cross the world is worth mothers for the 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.910
 wind 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.020
 realized that I will always have 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.530
 the bayern go through the range always 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.380
 and for example 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.950
 bird 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:45.760
 here we cross this wall check by 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.760
 example with ghosts 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.220
 no no no no but I do not care 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.640
 here yes because 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.200
 and here we're not going to get there that's very 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.200
 Clear 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.690
 here for example in theory if we could 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.230
 arrive 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.620
 but good in principle as you have 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.620
 checked 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.390
 but well I will try to bring all 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.390
 the videos you can call 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.170
 as time goes by for example 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.140
 8 and 20 the same once I record 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.780
 extreme 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.010
 for nothing, thank you very much for watching and 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.010
 instrumentation has used something like that 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.350
 See you later
