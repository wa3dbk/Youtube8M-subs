truffles and see Zoey in action is how
uh<00:05:19.000> it's<00:05:20.000> kind<00:05:20.240> of<00:05:20.270> how<00:05:20.360> Apple<00:05:20.750> learned<00:05:20.900> to<00:05:21.050> do

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
uh it's kind of how Apple learned to do

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.460 
uh it's kind of how Apple learned to do
it<00:05:21.350> I<00:05:21.470> mean<00:05:21.650> he<00:05:21.860> learned<00:05:22.100> on<00:05:22.250> his<00:05:22.370> own<00:05:22.580> but<00:05:23.210> he

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
it I mean he learned on his own but he

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.630 
it I mean he learned on his own but he
really<00:05:24.470> enjoyed<00:05:24.800> our<00:05:24.980> time<00:05:25.010> together<00:05:25.340> in<00:05:25.610> the

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
really enjoyed our time together in the

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.310 
really enjoyed our time together in the
woods<00:05:25.790> with<00:05:25.970> Zoey<00:05:26.150> so<00:05:26.419> we<00:05:26.630> have<00:05:26.810> they<00:05:27.140> have<00:05:27.290> a

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
woods with Zoey so we have they have a

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.620 
woods with Zoey so we have they have a
bond<00:05:27.620> and<00:05:27.950> Eric<00:05:28.310> goes<00:05:28.640> on<00:05:28.790> through<00:05:29.120> that<00:05:29.330> and

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
bond and Eric goes on through that and

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.380 
bond and Eric goes on through that and
it's<00:05:29.810> largely<00:05:30.080> because<00:05:30.590> of<00:05:30.620> Zoey<00:05:31.150> Zoey<00:05:32.150> the

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
it's largely because of Zoey Zoey the

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.900 
it's largely because of Zoey Zoey the
mentor<00:05:32.810> uh<00:05:33.020> he<00:05:34.010> found<00:05:34.190> truffles<00:05:34.550> on<00:05:34.640> the<00:05:34.730> tenth

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.570 
mentor uh he found truffles on the tenth
day<00:05:35.000> that<00:05:35.300> I<00:05:35.330> had<00:05:35.510> him<00:05:35.800> he<00:05:36.800> took<00:05:36.980> to<00:05:37.190> it<00:05:37.280> very

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
day that I had him he took to it very

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.070 
day that I had him he took to it very
naturally

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
naturally

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.170 
naturally
he's<00:05:39.320> really<00:05:39.650> interested<00:05:40.100> in<00:05:40.280> food<00:05:40.520> and<00:05:40.820> he's

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
he's really interested in food and he's

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.620 
he's really interested in food and he's
very<00:05:41.480> motivated<00:05:41.690> by<00:05:42.230> snacks<00:05:42.650> and<00:05:42.830> treats<00:05:42.920> so<00:05:43.310> I

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
very motivated by snacks and treats so I

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.730 
very motivated by snacks and treats so I
took<00:05:44.630> him<00:05:44.720> to<00:05:44.750> a<00:05:44.870> really<00:05:45.140> productive<00:05:45.380> black

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
took him to a really productive black

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.910 
took him to a really productive black
truffle<00:05:46.100> spot<00:05:46.310> on<00:05:46.550> the<00:05:46.940> 10th<00:05:47.150> day<00:05:47.420> and<00:05:47.920> within

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
truffle spot on the 10th day and within

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
truffle spot on the 10th day and within
about<00:05:49.040> a<00:05:49.190> half<00:05:49.430> an<00:05:49.640> hour

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
about a half an hour

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.210 
about a half an hour
he<00:05:50.150> was<00:05:50.330> already<00:05:50.630> find<00:05:50.840> truffles<00:05:51.140> for<00:05:51.470> me<00:05:54.220> it's

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
he was already find truffles for me it's

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.530 
he was already find truffles for me it's
pretty<00:05:55.400> good-sized<00:05:55.700> and<00:05:56.030> it<00:05:56.120> looks<00:05:56.270> like<00:05:56.330> it's

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
pretty good-sized and it looks like it's

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.180 
pretty good-sized and it looks like it's
in<00:05:56.630> good<00:05:56.720> shape

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
in good shape

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.310 
in good shape
as<00:05:58.190> opposed<00:05:58.490> to<00:05:58.580> a<00:05:58.640> tiny<00:05:58.910> one<00:05:59.120> like<00:05:59.300> that<00:05:59.330> black

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
as opposed to a tiny one like that black

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.090 
as opposed to a tiny one like that black
labs<00:06:00.620> are<00:06:01.040> I<00:06:01.490> think<00:06:02.270> that<00:06:02.530> one<00:06:03.530> of<00:06:03.620> the<00:06:03.650> best

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
labs are I think that one of the best

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.280 
labs are I think that one of the best
breeds<00:06:04.460> for<00:06:04.820> this<00:06:05.480> kind<00:06:05.840> of<00:06:05.930> quick<00:06:06.530> learning

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
breeds for this kind of quick learning

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.950 
breeds for this kind of quick learning
this<00:06:09.290> is<00:06:09.470> probably<00:06:09.830> only<00:06:09.980> Leroy's<00:06:10.400> first<00:06:11.330> he's

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
this is probably only Leroy's first he's

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.870 
this is probably only Leroy's first he's
under<00:06:12.200> two<00:06:12.380> months<00:06:12.560> of<00:06:12.890> truffle<00:06:13.310> training<00:06:13.670> and

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
under two months of truffle training and

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.900 
under two months of truffle training and
he<00:06:14.720> is<00:06:14.990> completely<00:06:15.680> got<00:06:16.100> the<00:06:16.250> game<00:06:16.430> so<00:06:16.760> it's

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
he is completely got the game so it's

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.020 
he is completely got the game so it's
it's<00:06:17.510> really<00:06:17.630> exciting<00:06:17.930> to<00:06:18.200> have<00:06:18.230> a<00:06:18.380> dog<00:06:19.030> and

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.020 

squirrels<00:06:54.360> and<00:06:54.720> voles<00:06:55.410> are<00:06:55.740> what

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
squirrels and voles are what

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.100 
squirrels and voles are what
predominantly<00:06:57.030> eat<00:06:57.240> and<00:06:57.419> this<00:06:57.479> is<00:06:57.660> a<00:06:57.690> lot<00:06:57.900> more

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
predominantly eat and this is a lot more

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.830 
predominantly eat and this is a lot more
looser<00:06:58.500> soil<00:06:58.830> you<00:06:59.040> can<00:06:59.100> see<00:06:59.400> a<00:06:59.430> vole<00:07:00.240> there's

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 
looser soil you can see a vole there's

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.090 
looser soil you can see a vole there's
other<00:07:01.050> mole<00:07:01.320> creatures<00:07:02.509> and<00:07:03.590> this<00:07:04.590> is<00:07:04.740> this<00:07:04.949> is

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100 
other mole creatures and this is this is

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.770 
other mole creatures and this is this is
really<00:07:05.280> loose<00:07:05.460> soil<00:07:05.789> so<00:07:05.970> there<00:07:06.060> was<00:07:06.210> something

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 
really loose soil so there was something

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.180 
really loose soil so there was something
right<00:07:07.650> here

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.190 
right here

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.760 
right here
but<00:07:11.190> it's<00:07:11.430> immature<00:07:12.470> because<00:07:13.470> they<00:07:13.590> don't

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:13.770 
but it's immature because they don't
