00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
i I think if well it's my opinion that

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.490 
i I think if well it's my opinion that
it's<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.689> very<00:01:42.930> safe<00:01:43.619> activity<00:01:44.600> but<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:46.020> can<00:01:46.320> be

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
it's a very safe activity but it can be

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.760 
it's a very safe activity but it can be
a<00:01:46.530> very<00:01:46.770> dangerous<00:01:47.009> activity<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.840> all<00:01:49.079> comes

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
a very dangerous activity it all comes

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.840 
a very dangerous activity it all comes
down<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:51.560> practice<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:53.310> comes<00:01:53.579> down<00:01:53.790> to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
down to practice it comes down to

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.780 
down to practice it comes down to
sticking<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.020> rules<00:01:55.520> sticking<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.670> your
