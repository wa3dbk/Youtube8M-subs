okay<00:00:01.709> everybody<00:00:02.570> it's<00:00:03.570> been<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:03.750> little<00:00:03.899> bit

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
okay everybody it's been a little bit

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.650 
okay everybody it's been a little bit
since<00:00:04.259> I<00:00:04.410> posted<00:00:04.589> anything<00:00:05.509> mainly<00:00:06.509> that's

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
since I posted anything mainly that's

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.240 
since I posted anything mainly that's
because<00:00:07.020> I've<00:00:07.170> been<00:00:07.290> working<00:00:07.620> on<00:00:07.680> our<00:00:07.740> project

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
because I've been working on our project

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.540 
because I've been working on our project
with<00:00:08.370> my<00:00:08.519> buddy<00:00:09.230> and<00:00:10.230> I<00:00:10.410> did<00:00:10.590> post<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.429> little

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
with my buddy and I did post a little

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.379 
with my buddy and I did post a little
bit<00:00:11.730> about<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.120> but<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:13.880> was<00:00:14.880> also<00:00:15.089> waiting

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
bit about that but I was also waiting

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.640 
bit about that but I was also waiting
for<00:00:15.920> these<00:00:16.920> things<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.760> come<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.500> these<00:00:19.500> are

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
for these things to come in these are

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.590 
for these things to come in these are
called<00:00:19.859> pogo<00:00:20.250> pins<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:22.100> they're<00:00:23.100> basically

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
called pogo pins and they're basically

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.839 
called pogo pins and they're basically
made<00:00:24.600> for<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:26.630> electrical<00:00:27.710> industry<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:29.699> do

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
made for the electrical industry to do

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.170 
made for the electrical industry to do
like<00:00:30.980> quick<00:00:31.980> testing<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.520> circuit<00:00:32.850> boards<00:00:33.120> and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
like quick testing of circuit boards and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.350 
like quick testing of circuit boards and
stuff<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:34.140> what<00:00:34.230> they<00:00:34.350> do<00:00:34.410> they<00:00:34.649> make<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:35.360> you

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
stuff so what they do they make a you

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.459 
stuff so what they do they make a you
know<00:00:36.450> something<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.930> they<00:00:37.050> needed<00:00:37.320> to

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
know something that they needed to

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.770 
know something that they needed to
provide<00:00:37.680> power<00:00:38.040> or<00:00:38.309> get<00:00:38.460> signal<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:38.969> they<00:00:39.540> make

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
provide power or get signal on they make

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.110 
provide power or get signal on they make
a<00:00:39.809> jig<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.530> went<00:00:41.309> over<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.610> circuit<00:00:41.940> board

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
a jig that went over the circuit board

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.240 
a jig that went over the circuit board
and<00:00:42.300> then<00:00:42.420> they<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:43.350> all<00:00:43.500> these<00:00:43.649> things

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
and then they have all these things

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.940 
and then they have all these things
wired<00:00:44.610> up<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.210> then<00:00:45.809> they<00:00:45.930> would<00:00:46.050> just<00:00:46.260> lower

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
wired up and then they would just lower

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.080 
wired up and then they would just lower
down<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.520> touch<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.899> surface<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.489> I<00:00:50.489> was<00:00:50.910> kind

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
down and touch the surface so I was kind

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.340 
down and touch the surface so I was kind
of<00:00:51.120> looking<00:00:51.239> for<00:00:51.510> something<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:51.930> this

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
of looking for something like this

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.279 
of looking for something like this
and<00:00:52.910> found<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.210> pretty<00:00:54.719> much<00:00:54.809> like

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
and found that this is pretty much like

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.220 
and found that this is pretty much like
the<00:00:55.590> perfect<00:00:56.000> thing<00:00:57.000> for<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:59.600> CNC<00:01:00.600> contact<00:01:01.079> or

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
the perfect thing for a CNC contact or

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.410 
the perfect thing for a CNC contact or
two<00:01:01.379> because<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:01.949> spring-loaded<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.760> has<00:01:02.969> a

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
two because it's spring-loaded it has a

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.509 
two because it's spring-loaded it has a
little<00:01:03.989> over<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.320> quarter<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.129> an<00:01:05.250> inch<00:01:05.339> of

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
little over a quarter of an inch of

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.160 
little over a quarter of an inch of
travel<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:06.119> like<00:01:06.240> point<00:01:06.510> three<00:01:06.720> inches<00:01:06.990> of

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
travel it's like point three inches of

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.100 
travel it's like point three inches of
travel<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.820> something<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:10.020> know

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
travel and it's something that you know

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.359 
travel and it's something that you know
so<00:01:10.619> if<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.220> mill<00:01:11.430> over<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:13.320> yellow<00:01:13.439> momentum

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
so if the mill over the yellow momentum

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.590 
so if the mill over the yellow momentum
carries<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.909> little<00:01:15.119> bit<00:01:15.210> farther<00:01:15.450> than

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
carries it a little bit farther than

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.190 
carries it a little bit farther than
what<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.080> should<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.619> won't<00:01:16.920> damage<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:18.200> Pogo

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
what it should it won't damage the Pogo

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.130 
what it should it won't damage the Pogo
pin<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:21.030> other<00:01:21.180> thing<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.780> does<00:01:21.960> have

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
pin the other thing is that it does have

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.460 
pin the other thing is that it does have
a<00:01:22.170> nice<00:01:22.409> hard<00:01:22.710> stop<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.240> end<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:25.229> should

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
a nice hard stop on the end so it should

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.490 
a nice hard stop on the end so it should
be<00:01:25.500> very<00:01:25.830> repeatable<00:01:27.049> let's<00:01:28.049> see<00:01:28.170> if<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.350> can

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
be very repeatable let's see if I can

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.600 
be very repeatable let's see if I can
show<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.189> little<00:01:29.280> bit<00:01:29.490> better

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
show this to you a little bit better

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.030 
show this to you a little bit better
here<00:01:30.500> there<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.939> it's<00:01:32.939> very<00:01:33.180> simple<00:01:33.570> there's<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
here there is it's very simple there's a

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.270 
here there is it's very simple there's a
pressed<00:01:35.299> cylinder<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.540> pressed<00:01:37.350> ring<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
pressed cylinder a pressed ring in the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.700 
pressed cylinder a pressed ring in the
indentation<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:39.210> there<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.810> there's<00:01:40.409> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
indentation in there and there's a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.740 
indentation in there and there's a
corresponding<00:01:43.880> depression<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.149> diameter

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
corresponding depression in the diameter

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.249 
corresponding depression in the diameter
in<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.610> silver<00:01:47.610> pin<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.360> then<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.659> spring<00:01:49.079> at

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
in the silver pin and then a spring at

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.289 
in the silver pin and then a spring at
the<00:01:49.290> back<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.950> these<00:01:50.700> are<00:01:50.850> designed<00:01:51.210> to

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the back and these are designed to

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.120 
the back and these are designed to
maintain<00:01:51.509> electrical<00:01:52.290> conductivity<00:01:52.619> which

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
maintain electrical conductivity which

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.440 
maintain electrical conductivity which
is<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.549> know<00:01:53.670> another<00:01:53.939> really<00:01:54.240> good<00:01:54.360> thing

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
is you know another really good thing

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.990 
is you know another really good thing
you<00:01:55.259> can<00:01:55.380> get<00:01:55.530> them<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.829> variety<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.250> sizes<00:01:56.520> I

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
you can get them in a variety of sizes I

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.990 
you can get them in a variety of sizes I
chose<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.540> get<00:01:57.659> them<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.110> about<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:59.130> think

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
chose to get them and about I think

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.840 
chose to get them and about I think
there<00:02:00.119> are<00:02:00.180> about<00:02:00.329> 1.3<00:02:00.869> inches<00:02:01.350> long<00:02:02.899> and<00:02:04.820> so<00:02:05.820> I

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
there are about 1.3 inches long and so I

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.389 
there are about 1.3 inches long and so I
think<00:02:06.030> they<00:02:06.119> should<00:02:06.270> work<00:02:06.450> good<00:02:06.799> my<00:02:07.799> idea

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
think they should work good my idea

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.360 
think they should work good my idea
basically<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.750> use<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.920> on<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
basically is to use this on the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.479 
basically is to use this on the
use<00:02:14.270> this<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.569> contact<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:17.530> carriages<00:02:18.530> just

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
use this to contact the carriages just

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.059 
use this to contact the carriages just
like<00:02:19.640> we<00:02:19.790> do<00:02:19.940> when<00:02:20.120> we<00:02:20.239> do<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.480> Z<00:02:20.630> homing

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
like we do when we do the Z homing

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.410 
like we do when we do the Z homing
that's<00:02:22.069> a<00:02:22.160> fairly<00:02:22.430> accurate<00:02:22.550> way<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.150> do

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
that's a fairly accurate way to do

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.680 
that's a fairly accurate way to do
things<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.370> nice<00:02:25.520> thing<00:02:25.550> about<00:02:25.760> this

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
things and the nice thing about this

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.589 
things and the nice thing about this
machine<00:02:27.260> is<00:02:27.709> that<00:02:27.739> every<00:02:28.250> piece<00:02:28.790> of<00:02:28.849> metal<00:02:29.239> in

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
machine is that every piece of metal in

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.030 
machine is that every piece of metal in
the<00:02:29.890> structure<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:31.099> grounded<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:33.500> only<00:02:33.830> need

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
the structure is grounded so I only need

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.690 
the structure is grounded so I only need
to<00:02:34.190> have<00:02:34.459> like<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:35.319> +5<00:02:36.319> volt<00:02:36.590> signal<00:02:36.860> on<00:02:37.250> here

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
to have like a +5 volt signal on here

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.910 
to have like a +5 volt signal on here
with<00:02:38.300> a<00:02:39.459> pull-up<00:02:40.459> resistor<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:41.780> I<00:02:42.530> can<00:02:42.709> make

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
with a pull-up resistor and I can make

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.750 
with a pull-up resistor and I can make
an<00:02:43.040> effective<00:02:43.400> switch<00:02:43.700> with<00:02:44.540> just<00:02:45.380> by

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
an effective switch with just by

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.600 
an effective switch with just by
contacting<00:02:46.760> it<00:02:46.819> anywhere<00:02:47.180> on<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.390> system<00:02:48.610> so

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
contacting it anywhere on the system so

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.840 
contacting it anywhere on the system so
to<00:02:50.049> get<00:02:51.049> that<00:02:51.260> into<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:51.739> system<00:02:52.069> I<00:02:52.459> bought

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
to get that into the system I bought

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.170 
to get that into the system I bought
some<00:02:53.180> of<00:02:53.209> these<00:02:53.390> nylon<00:02:57.280> nylon<00:02:58.280> screws<00:02:58.610> machine

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
some of these nylon nylon screws machine

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.750 
some of these nylon nylon screws machine
screws<00:02:59.540> the<00:03:00.170> quarter-twenty<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:00.980> what<00:03:01.670> I'm

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
screws the quarter-twenty and what I'm

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.910 
screws the quarter-twenty and what I'm
going<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:01.910> do<00:03:02.030> is<00:03:02.150> just<00:03:02.269> bore<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.569> hole<00:03:02.920> through

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
going to do is just bore a hole through

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.030 
going to do is just bore a hole through
the<00:03:03.950> middle<00:03:04.790> of<00:03:05.599> this<00:03:05.720> thing<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.200> then<00:03:06.769> glue

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
the middle of this thing and then glue

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.210 
the middle of this thing and then glue
it<00:03:07.069> in<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.930> before<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.230> glue<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.500> in<00:03:09.620> a<00:03:09.739> solder

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
it in and before I glue it in a solder

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.920 
it in and before I glue it in a solder
or<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.489> wire<00:03:10.700> obviously<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.510> end<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.810> this

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
or a wire obviously to the end of this

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:12.309 
or a wire obviously to the end of this
thing

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
thing

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.910 
thing
and<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:13.580> would<00:03:13.730> be<00:03:13.880> my<00:03:14.150> signal<00:03:14.930> kick<00:03:15.349> carrier

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
and that would be my signal kick carrier

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.180 
and that would be my signal kick carrier
path<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:17.440> so<00:03:18.440> then<00:03:18.560> what<00:03:18.680> I'm<00:03:18.769> going<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:18.920> do<00:03:19.040> is

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
path and so then what I'm going to do is

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.520 
path and so then what I'm going to do is
mount<00:03:19.400> these<00:03:19.549> things<00:03:19.880> up<00:03:21.070> under<00:03:22.070> here<00:03:22.510> and

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
mount these things up under here and

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.580 
mount these things up under here and
allow<00:03:25.120> my<00:03:26.120> cart<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.890> contact<00:03:28.700> them<00:03:29.590> underneath

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
allow my cart to contact them underneath

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.809 
allow my cart to contact them underneath
and<00:03:30.829> that<00:03:30.859> has<00:03:31.069> an<00:03:31.190> advantage<00:03:31.459> because<00:03:31.730> it

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
and that has an advantage because it

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.300 
and that has an advantage because it
gets<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:33.140> sensor<00:03:33.650> out<00:03:33.890> of<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.100> way<00:03:34.250> so

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
gets the the sensor out of the way so

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.300 
gets the the sensor out of the way so
you<00:03:34.670> have<00:03:34.700> less<00:03:35.090> chance<00:03:35.390> of<00:03:35.569> bumping<00:03:36.380> it<00:03:36.709> when

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
you have less chance of bumping it when

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.699 
you have less chance of bumping it when
you're<00:03:37.430> working<00:03:37.850> I<00:03:38.140> kind<00:03:39.140> of<00:03:39.170> protect<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:39.620> a

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
you're working I kind of protect it a

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.039 
you're working I kind of protect it a
little<00:03:39.859> bit<00:03:40.069> so<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:41.329> other<00:03:41.450> nice<00:03:41.660> thing<00:03:41.690> is

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
little bit so the other nice thing is

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.990 
little bit so the other nice thing is
that<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.530> screw<00:03:42.950> is<00:03:43.069> going<00:03:43.160> to<00:03:43.280> provide<00:03:43.549> micro

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
that the screw is going to provide micro

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.509 
that the screw is going to provide micro
adjust<00:03:44.359> ability<00:03:45.200> so<00:03:45.590> that<00:03:45.739> I<00:03:45.769> can<00:03:46.040> squirm<00:03:46.430> like

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
adjust ability so that I can squirm like

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:52.590 
adjust ability so that I can squirm like
Gantry<00:03:47.269> easily<00:03:48.400> as<00:03:49.400> well<00:03:49.639> so<00:03:50.709> that's<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:51.859> plan

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
Gantry easily as well so that's the plan

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.090 
Gantry easily as well so that's the plan
try<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:53.720> work<00:03:53.750> on<00:03:53.959> that<00:03:54.139> today<00:03:54.650> I<00:03:54.680> don't<00:03:55.040> know

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
try and work on that today I don't know

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.539 
try and work on that today I don't know
how<00:03:55.250> far<00:03:55.489> I'll<00:03:55.639> get<00:03:55.850> but<00:03:57.010> give<00:03:58.010> it<00:03:58.100> a<00:03:58.160> shot<00:03:58.340> and

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
how far I'll get but give it a shot and

00:03:58.549 --> 00:03:59.319 
how far I'll get but give it a shot and
see<00:03:58.670> how<00:03:58.880> it<00:03:58.970> goes

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
see how it goes

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.400 
see how it goes
so<00:03:59.889> I'll<00:04:00.889> I'll<00:04:01.760> post<00:04:02.030> again<00:04:02.329> when<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:03.230> thing

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
so I'll I'll post again when the thing

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.720 
so I'll I'll post again when the thing
is<00:04:03.560> up<00:04:03.769> and<00:04:03.920> running<00:04:04.040> I<00:04:04.310> guess<00:04:04.489> so<00:04:04.910> thanks<00:04:05.420> bye
