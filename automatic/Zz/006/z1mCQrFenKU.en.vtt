00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
building but here we go mega Blastoise

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.020 
building but here we go mega Blastoise
obviously<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.130> pokemon<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.490> mega<00:01:38.670> Blastoise

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
obviously the pokemon is mega Blastoise

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.999 
obviously the pokemon is mega Blastoise
the<00:01:39.270> item<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.659> going<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.990> be<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.140> blast<00:01:40.350> blast

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
and then you have the ability mega

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.600 
and then you have the ability mega
launcher<00:01:45.990> what<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.259> ability<00:01:46.649> does<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.430> it

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
launcher what this ability does is it

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.539 
launcher what this ability does is it
increases<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.210> power<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.570> all<00:01:48.780> aura<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:50.070> post

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
increases the power of all aura and post

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.980 
increases the power of all aura and post
moves<00:01:50.880> by<00:01:51.450> 50%<00:01:51.960> um<00:01:53.149> which<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.299> really<00:01:54.540> good<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
moves by 50% um which is really good and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.359 
moves by 50% um which is really good and
basically<00:01:55.590> what<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.860> want<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.070> do<00:01:56.189> with<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
basically what you want to do with the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.010 
basically what you want to do with the
set<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.850> want<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.090> take<00:01:57.210> advantage<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
set is you want to take advantage of the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.630 
set is you want to take advantage of the
fact<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.380> mega<00:01:58.649> launcher<00:01:58.979> boosts<00:01:59.280> all<00:01:59.430> moves

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
fact that mega launcher boosts all moves

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.819 
fact that mega launcher boosts all moves
it<00:01:59.820> basically<00:02:00.210> gives<00:02:00.630> stab<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.229> any<00:02:01.380> unstad

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
it basically gives stab to any unstad

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.789 
it basically gives stab to any unstad
moves<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.790> gives<00:02:02.990> two<00:02:03.990> times<00:02:04.259> stabbed<00:02:04.560> to

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
moves and it gives two times stabbed to

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.990 
moves and it gives two times stabbed to
any<00:02:04.950> stab<00:02:05.130> them<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.460> really<00:02:05.700> quick<00:02:05.880> we're

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
any stab them so really quick we're

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.330 
any stab them so really quick we're
going<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.149> go<00:02:06.329> over<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:07.020> move<00:02:07.619> set<00:02:07.920> but<00:02:08.129> first

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
going to go over the move set but first

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
going to go over the move set but first
thing<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.520> want<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.700> cover<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.970> want<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.270> cover

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
thing I want to cover I want to cover

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.609 
thing I want to cover I want to cover
the<00:02:09.509> second<00:02:09.720> move<00:02:09.810> right<00:02:09.959> there<00:02:10.110> water<00:02:10.379> pulse

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
the second move right there water pulse

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.979 
the second move right there water pulse
I<00:02:10.830> run<00:02:11.520> water<00:02:11.730> pulse<00:02:11.970> water<00:02:12.180> pulse<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.510> weak<00:02:12.720> it

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
I run water pulse water pulse is weak it

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.730 
I run water pulse water pulse is weak it
only<00:02:13.140> has

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
only has

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.400 
only has
60<00:02:14.160> power<00:02:14.340> but<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.330> gets<00:02:15.420> double<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.810> 120<00:02:16.290> which

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
60 power but it gets double to 120 which

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.350 
60 power but it gets double to 120 which
you<00:02:16.590> know<00:02:16.680> what<00:02:16.830> it's<00:02:16.950> not<00:02:17.010> not<00:02:17.430> bad<00:02:17.760> it's<00:02:18.180> not

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
you know what it's not not bad it's not

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.240 
you know what it's not not bad it's not
like<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> one-hit<00:02:18.930> ko<00:02:19.140> but<00:02:19.530> it's<00:02:19.620> not<00:02:19.770> bad<00:02:20.010> um

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
like a one-hit ko but it's not bad um

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.980 
like a one-hit ko but it's not bad um
plus<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:20.970> has<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.120> twenty<00:02:21.420> percent<00:02:21.630> chance<00:02:21.810> to

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
plus it has a twenty percent chance to

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.300 
plus it has a twenty percent chance to
confuse<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.380> target<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:22.740> why<00:02:22.890> don't<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.100> every

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
confuse the target so why don't of every

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.920 
confuse the target so why don't of every
five<00:02:23.460> war<00:02:23.670> pulses<00:02:24.000> will<00:02:24.150> confuse<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.600> target

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
five war pulses will confuse the target

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.550 
five war pulses will confuse the target
which<00:02:25.020> I<00:02:25.110> like<00:02:25.320> um<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:27.150> can<00:02:27.510> instead<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.350> this

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
which I like um you can instead of this

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.940 
which I like um you can instead of this
you<00:02:29.160> can<00:02:29.340> run<00:02:29.520> hydro<00:02:30.000> pump<00:02:30.210> which<00:02:30.990> I<00:02:31.140> believe

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
you can run hydro pump which I believe

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.640 
you can run hydro pump which I believe
gets<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.030> ability<00:02:33.510> gets<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.080> benefits<00:02:34.530> of

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
gets the ability gets the benefits of

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.120 
gets the ability gets the benefits of
mega<00:02:34.950> launcher<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.520> goes<00:02:35.640> from<00:02:35.790> 1<00:02:36.150> 10<00:02:36.510> 2<00:02:37.200> 220

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
mega launcher so it goes from 1 10 2 220

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.490 
mega launcher so it goes from 1 10 2 220
and<00:02:38.310> that's<00:02:38.820> 80<00:02:39.090> accuracy<00:02:39.630> now<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:39.990> don't<00:02:40.230> run

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
and that's 80 accuracy now I don't run

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.320 
and that's 80 accuracy now I don't run
hydro<00:02:40.860> pump<00:02:41.010> because<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.520> choose<00:02:41.760> accuracy

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
hydro pump because I choose accuracy

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.670 
hydro pump because I choose accuracy
over<00:02:42.360> power<00:02:42.690> however<00:02:43.020> if<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.320> want<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.560> choose

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
over power however if you want to choose

to have the darkside move for example

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.680 
to have the darkside move for example
it's<00:03:35.160> perfect<00:03:35.520> against<00:03:35.700> agus<00:03:36.000> lashes<00:03:36.360> you

however dark pulse I will dish a lot of

damage out to an egg / plus it has then
you're<00:03:43.680> probably<00:03:43.830> going<00:03:44.070> to<00:03:44.160> be<00:03:44.220> faster<00:03:44.550> than

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
you're probably going to be faster than

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.830 
you're probably going to be faster than
it<00:03:44.760> if<00:03:44.880> it<00:03:44.970> doesn't<00:03:45.180> go<00:03:45.240> for<00:03:45.360> a<00:03:45.420> shadow<00:03:45.630> sneak

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
it if it doesn't go for a shadow sneak

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.110 
it if it doesn't go for a shadow sneak
so<00:03:46.020> then<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.770> flinch<00:03:46.980> is<00:03:47.100> my<00:03:47.220> payoff<00:03:47.400> that's

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
so then the flinch is my payoff that's

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.490 
so then the flinch is my payoff that's
just<00:03:48.300> one<00:03:48.480> example<00:03:48.510> i'm<00:03:48.930> sure<00:03:49.080> there's<00:03:49.260> others

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
just one example i'm sure there's others

then<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:14.550> run<00:04:14.760> into<00:04:14.940> um<00:04:15.440> this<00:04:16.440> is<00:04:16.590> how<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:16.739> check

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
then you run into um this is how I check

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.260 
then you run into um this is how I check
with<00:04:17.160> ice<00:04:17.280> beam<00:04:17.520> it's<00:04:17.700> definitely<00:04:18.120> a<00:04:18.150> plus

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
with ice beam it's definitely a plus

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.550 
with ice beam it's definitely a plus
sign<00:04:18.420> is<00:04:18.510> ten<00:04:18.660> percent<00:04:18.900> chance<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.140> freeze<00:04:19.350> not

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
sign is ten percent chance to freeze not

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.170 
sign is ten percent chance to freeze not
that<00:04:19.739> I<00:04:19.770> think<00:04:20.100> I<00:04:20.190> only<00:04:20.310> get<00:04:20.549> that<00:04:20.640> like<00:04:20.820> one

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
that I think I only get that like one

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.230 
that I think I only get that like one
every<00:04:21.630> 50<00:04:21.960> days<00:04:22.109> but<00:04:22.470> uh<00:04:22.500> yeah<00:04:23.250> I<00:04:23.490> run<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.120> ice

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
every 50 days but uh yeah I run the ice

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.730 
every 50 days but uh yeah I run the ice
beam<00:04:24.450> because<00:04:24.720> just<00:04:24.960> for<00:04:25.080> coverage<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:25.620> is

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
beam because just for coverage and is

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.900 
beam because just for coverage and is
definitely<00:04:25.890> good<00:04:26.160> to<00:04:26.190> have

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
definitely good to have

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.640 
definitely good to have

pokemon I just like to put that one
extra<00:04:42.450> point<00:04:42.780> more<00:04:43.350> than<00:04:43.380> what<00:04:43.650> I<00:04:43.680> would

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
extra point more than what I would

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.110 
extra point more than what I would
normally<00:04:43.980> so<00:04:44.340> that's<00:04:44.520> what<00:04:44.640> I<00:04:44.670> did<00:04:44.730> with<00:04:44.970> this

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
normally so that's what I did with this

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.150 
normally so that's what I did with this
one<00:04:45.180> I<00:04:45.510> don't<00:04:45.750> know<00:04:45.840> why<00:04:45.990> but<00:04:46.020> I<00:04:46.290> did<00:04:46.500> it<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:46.710> I

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
one I don't know why but I did it and I

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.320 
one I don't know why but I did it and I
love<00:04:47.400> it<00:04:47.490> because<00:04:47.550> I<00:04:47.790> think<00:04:47.850> I've<00:04:48.030> lived<00:04:48.210> at

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
love it because I think I've lived at

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.450 
love it because I think I've lived at
one<00:04:48.540> with<00:04:49.230> mega<00:04:49.410> Blastoise<00:04:49.890> on<00:04:50.070> more<00:04:50.280> than<00:04:50.400> one

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
one with mega Blastoise on more than one

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.780 
one with mega Blastoise on more than one
occasion<00:04:50.580> so<00:04:51.530> then<00:04:52.530> as<00:04:52.680> you<00:04:52.800> go<00:04:52.950> down<00:04:53.250> further

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
occasion so then as you go down further

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.830 
occasion so then as you go down further
you<00:04:54.000> can<00:04:54.030> see<00:04:54.270> that<00:04:54.390> I<00:04:54.420> have<00:04:54.480> a<00:04:54.600> negative

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
you can see that I have a negative

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.540 
you can see that I have a negative
attack<00:04:55.230> nature<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:55.680> a<00:04:55.710> positive<00:04:56.280> special

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
attack nature and a positive special

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.700 
attack nature and a positive special
attack<00:04:56.760> nature<00:04:57.060> I'm<00:04:57.240> modest<00:04:57.780> which<00:04:58.440> means

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
attack nature I'm modest which means

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.620 
attack nature I'm modest which means
that<00:04:58.800> I<00:04:59.100> get<00:04:59.370> a<00:04:59.490> ten<00:04:59.670> percent<00:04:59.760> increase<00:05:00.270> in<00:05:00.300> my

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
that I get a ten percent increase in my

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.600 
that I get a ten percent increase in my
special<00:05:01.020> attack<00:05:01.320> and<00:05:01.920> then<00:05:02.040> ten<00:05:02.310> percent

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
special attack and then ten percent

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.860 
special attack and then ten percent
decrease<00:05:02.910> in<00:05:03.090> my<00:05:03.150> attack<00:05:03.390> which<00:05:03.570> obviously

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
decrease in my attack which obviously

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.390 
decrease in my attack which obviously
doesn't<00:05:04.200> matter<00:05:04.380> that's<00:05:04.620> a<00:05:04.680> decrease<00:05:05.370> in

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
doesn't matter that's a decrease in

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.530 
doesn't matter that's a decrease in
attack<00:05:05.700> doesn't<00:05:05.880> matter<00:05:06.060> because<00:05:06.210> I<00:05:06.330> don't

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
attack doesn't matter because I don't

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.200 
attack doesn't matter because I don't
run<00:05:06.780> any<00:05:07.020> attack<00:05:07.620> site<00:05:07.800> moves<00:05:08.010> so<00:05:08.700> my<00:05:08.910> special

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
run any attack site moves so my special

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.150 
run any attack site moves so my special
