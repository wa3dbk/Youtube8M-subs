watch women in the bathroom but that's

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.230 
watch women in the bathroom but that's
not<00:05:53.860> what<00:05:53.950> this<00:05:54.039> is<00:05:54.100> about<00:05:54.220> we're<00:05:54.729> all<00:05:54.850> against

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
not what this is about we're all against

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.810 
not what this is about we're all against
that<00:05:55.419> but<00:05:55.960> you<00:05:56.050> should<00:05:56.320> be<00:05:56.500> for<00:05:56.800> trans<00:05:57.729> people
