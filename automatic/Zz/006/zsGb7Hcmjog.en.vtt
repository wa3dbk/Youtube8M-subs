finesse<00:00:17.070> fin<00:00:17.279> system<00:00:17.699> now<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:17.940> is

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
finesse fin system now this is

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.150 
finesse fin system now this is
completely<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.810> lyst<00:00:19.050> there<00:00:19.230> are<00:00:19.410> no<00:00:19.740> screws

years okay and now this finis system

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.799 
years okay and now this finis system
there's<00:00:34.440> no<00:00:34.680> screws<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.090> if<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.690> could

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
explain that concepts gonna be kind of

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.549 
explain that concepts gonna be kind of
hard<00:00:38.670> for<00:00:38.760> people<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.239> grasp<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:39.840> I've<00:00:40.140> put<00:00:40.440> my

hard for people to grasp but I've put my

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.959 
hard for people to grasp but I've put my
fins<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:40.980> these<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.460> legit<00:00:41.820> they're

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
fins on these and it's legit they're

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.400 
fins on these and it's legit they're

explain<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.250> our<00:00:44.370> viewers<00:00:44.399> how<00:00:44.940> exactly<00:00:45.450> this

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
explain to our viewers how exactly this

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.479 
explain to our viewers how exactly this
fin<00:00:45.780> system<00:00:46.110> works<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.710> it's<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.920> spring-loaded

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
fin system works so it's a spring-loaded

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.490 
fin system works so it's a spring-loaded
box<00:00:47.879> there's<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.450> spring<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.050> front<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
box there's a spring in the front of the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.560 
box there's a spring in the front of the
box<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.460> push<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.940> front<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.360> fin

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
box that you push the front of the fin

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.910 
box that you push the front of the fin
against<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.530> putting<00:00:52.800> a

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
against and it's just like putting a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.220 
against and it's just like putting a
battery<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.489> remote<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:54.090> your<00:00:54.120> TV<00:00:54.239> push

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
battery in a remote for your TV push

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.930 
battery in a remote for your TV push
against<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.620> spring<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.160> locks<00:00:56.460> back<00:00:56.730> in

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
against a spring and it locks back in

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.580 
against a spring and it locks back in
place<00:00:57.149> against<00:00:57.480> these<00:00:57.660> two<00:00:57.870> locking<00:00:58.140> pins

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
place against these two locking pins

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.010 
place against these two locking pins
right<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.340> when<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.120> put<00:01:00.510> my<00:01:00.539> hands<00:01:00.960> in

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
right here and when I put my hands in

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.260 
right here and when I put my hands in
these<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.770> it's<00:01:02.039> not<00:01:02.489> going<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.789> come<00:01:02.969> out<00:01:03.030> in

serious testing in Hawaii from what I

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.850 
serious testing in Hawaii from what I
understand<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.689> no<00:01:06.810> issues<00:01:07.260> there<00:01:07.290> correct

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
out okay and the force needs to be back

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.700 
out okay and the force needs to be back
and<00:01:12.360> then<00:01:12.450> going<00:01:12.750> forward<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.200> these<00:01:13.290> fins<00:01:13.560> to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
and then going forward on these fins to

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.350 
and then going forward on these fins to
knock<00:01:13.920> him<00:01:14.070> out<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.640> really<00:01:14.700> gonna

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
knock him out so it's not really gonna

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.780 
knock him out so it's not really gonna
happen<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.710> can't<00:01:17.009> just<00:01:17.189> pull<00:01:17.400> up<00:01:17.549> and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
happen and you can't just pull up and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.190 
happen and you can't just pull up and
out<00:01:17.880> on<00:01:18.000> these<00:01:18.090> fins<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.509> tried<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.840> they're

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
out on these fins I tried that they're

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.929 
out on these fins I tried that they're
not<00:01:19.320> coming<00:01:19.650> out<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.799> these<00:01:19.920> boxes<00:01:20.400> now<00:01:20.880> you

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
not coming out of these boxes now you

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.820 
not coming out of these boxes now you
guys<00:01:21.299> were<00:01:21.450> telling<00:01:21.720> me<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.259> boxes

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
guys were telling me that the boxes

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.499 
guys were telling me that the boxes
themselves<00:01:22.979> are<00:01:23.400> lighter<00:01:23.700> correct<00:01:24.180> yeah

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
themselves are lighter correct yeah

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.090 
themselves are lighter correct yeah
absolutely<00:01:24.869> they're<00:01:25.320> lighter<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.979> they're

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
absolutely they're lighter and they're

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.370 
absolutely they're lighter and they're
also<00:01:26.280> structurally<00:01:27.090> smaller<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.200> if<00:01:28.259> you

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
also structurally smaller so if you

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.200 
also structurally smaller so if you
wanted<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.710> go<00:01:28.829> with<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.040> 5in<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.000> really

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
wanted to go with a 5in you can really

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.090 
wanted to go with a 5in you can really
allow<00:01:30.360> yourself<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.049> lot<00:01:31.229> less<00:01:31.470> tail<00:01:31.799> weight

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
allow yourself a lot less tail weight
