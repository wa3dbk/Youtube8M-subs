00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:07.700
 john deere 5,085 m since we had 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.379
 spoken I take this opportunity to make a mini 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.940
 mini video review are here in 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.169
 concessionary 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.169
 we start immediately from the engine block 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:22.990
 nameplate in the front rooms 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.969
 Msgr 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:34.899
 leaves me the tank case of the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.620
 fuel 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.660
 it is called back where we find two 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.000
 only two hydraulic distributors 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:49.300
 here I do n't like these harnesses 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 let yourself be so both to the right and to 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:01:00.489
 left hook mechanical stabilizers 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.860
 of towing or sled that probably yes 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:08.979
 the keys are placed for the elevator sun 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.679
 of the rear lift other headlights of 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:17.500
 cabin lighting towards point 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:25.470
 mechanical wheel in this case mounts and 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:28.470
 the 34 to the right side engine block 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.470
 plate 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:39.420
 of loads 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:44.100
 and then we go into the cabin accessibility 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:50.340
 the cabin is very good and the whole is there 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.840
 battery stack in the cabin we find the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.689
 dashboard that clearly is not a 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:01.049
 level of the r series old steering column of the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.959
 adjustable steering wheel on what we see 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.979
 diesel temperature turns the engine 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:06.979
 water temperature 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:14.370
 then there are various lighting keys 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.989
 in reverse, I find it hard enough 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.940
 I should try it on the bike but so the 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.790
 I spend it seems pretty hard on 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.540
 right console starting from the bottom 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.500
 we find lecce of bottle cigars 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.650
 wiper switch 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.160
 rear an electrical outlet 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.120
 the selector of the pd on the switch 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.840
 of the pd on 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.060
 this selector the lifter 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.810
 mechanical rear with force 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.430
 checked exception of the deduction 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.739
 the accelerator of the car and the two 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.840
 rear hydraulic distributors la 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.670
 shift lever and imposition is comfortable 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.900
 however in this model it does not have 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:58.500
 she even have to shift gear and 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.269
 further back we find the selector for 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.120
 the legs in a really uncomfortable position 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.500
 absolutely the ashtray 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.230
 unusable 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.660
 behind the driver's seat we say that i 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.389
 problems are not done in a way 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.079
 just perfect he could certainly 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:23.760
 do more rear visibility is 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:27.019
 good we say on the tow hook 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.329
 thanks to this rear glass 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.130
 then we say that it still looks good 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.010
 point the tool that we now find 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.400
 housing that radio the controls of the 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.470
 air conditioner manual climate control 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.430
 while on the left we said it remains 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.590
 empty here we eventually have the 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.270
 possibility of supporting a company or 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.250
 some sheets of paper on this port below 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.250
 all should be there and spreadable 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:01.150
 Exactly it is possible as usual these 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.880
 plastics are four ways 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.080
 quite cheap but so much another 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:11.470
 bottle holder the parking trend 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.569
 and then for a possible passenger the 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.769
 pedal pedal victim with the true pedal board 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:20.100
 standard we say as comfortable as normal 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:25.180
 found in every day 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:32.190
 what to say machine certainly not full 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:32.190
 optional weight around 40 quintals 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:39.550
 I see it quite robust and could 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:44.200
 be the right machine for those looking for 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.729
 a sturdy solid tractor and not me 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.360
 I feel confident to say why not 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.390
 trying it no I can't say it is 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.390
 all
