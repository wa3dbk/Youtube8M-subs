MLG<00:00:25.619> variant<00:00:25.650> rules<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.269> little<00:00:27.449> bit

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
MLG variant rules so it's a little bit

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.870 
MLG variant rules so it's a little bit
different<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.990> don't<00:00:28.019> play<00:00:28.410> MLG<00:00:29.189> rules<00:00:29.429> at<00:00:29.820> all

players<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:13.110> dynamics<00:01:13.680> are

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
players it's just that dynamics are

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.830 
players it's just that dynamics are
different<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:14.760> can't<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.689> just

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
different like you just can't you just

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.640 
different like you just can't you just
can't<00:01:16.049> flank<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.500> enemy<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.310> know<00:01:18.650> kill

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
can't flank the enemy and you know kill

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.499 
can't flank the enemy and you know kill
all<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.890> their<00:01:20.189> team<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:21.060> doesn't<00:01:21.240> happen

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
all of their team it just doesn't happen

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.350 
all of their team it just doesn't happen
just<00:01:21.810> because<00:01:21.990> people<00:01:22.439> are<00:01:22.500> more<00:01:22.680> prone<00:01:22.920> to

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
just because people are more prone to

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.240 
just because people are more prone to
call<00:01:24.360> outs<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.960> watching<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.470> mini-map<00:01:25.920> to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
call outs to watching the mini-map to

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.359 
call outs to watching the mini-map to
you<00:01:26.850> know<00:01:27.259> watching<00:01:28.259> their<00:01:28.590> flanks<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.159> just

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
you know watching their flanks it just

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.310 
you know watching their flanks it just
doesn't<00:01:29.729> happen<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:30.900> run<00:01:31.140> right

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
doesn't happen you can just run right

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.649 
doesn't happen you can just run right
into<00:01:31.380> their<00:01:31.680> spawn<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.310> get<00:01:32.540> loads<00:01:33.540> of

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
into their spawn and just get loads of

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.260 
into their spawn and just get loads of
kills<00:01:33.920> but<00:01:34.920> yeah<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.159> just<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.640> just<00:01:35.670> requires

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
kills but yeah it just it just requires

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.649

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
think it's the same day as ml gene and

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.770 
think it's the same day as ml gene and
I'm<00:01:49.950> that's<00:01:50.159> that's<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.729> that's<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.390> draft

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780
