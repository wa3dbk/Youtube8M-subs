00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
the mail the double zero which is in my

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.210 
the mail the double zero which is in my
lip<00:00:10.830> currently<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:12.769> the<00:00:13.849> 7/16<00:00:15.890> if<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:17.010> have<00:00:17.100> a

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
lip currently and the 7/16 if you have a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.350 

in<00:00:28.570> the<00:00:28.750> double<00:00:29.710> zero<00:00:29.830> one<00:00:30.070> more<00:00:30.190> time<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:33.550> had

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
in the double zero one more time I had

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.970 
in the double zero one more time I had
bought<00:00:35.110> the<00:00:35.790> teflon<00:00:36.790> tape<00:00:37.590> just<00:00:38.590> the<00:00:38.860> other

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
bought the teflon tape just the other

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.690 
bought the teflon tape just the other
day<00:00:39.100> yesterday<00:00:39.520> when<00:00:39.910> I<00:00:39.970> met<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.350> video<00:00:41.350> and<00:00:41.710> I

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
day yesterday when I met the video and I

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.010 
day yesterday when I met the video and I
had<00:00:42.940> wrapped<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.510> zero<00:00:44.080> gauge<00:00:44.350> a<00:00:44.730> few<00:00:45.730> times

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
had wrapped the zero gauge a few times

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.600 
had wrapped the zero gauge a few times
and<00:00:47.020> then<00:00:47.320> I<00:00:47.559> you<00:00:47.830> know<00:00:47.920> obviously<00:00:48.130> I<00:00:48.400> had<00:00:48.489> in

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
and then I you know obviously I had in

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.380 
and then I you know obviously I had in
my<00:00:48.730> lip

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
my lip

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.970 
my lip
I<00:00:49.420> checked<00:00:50.080> the<00:00:50.200> mail<00:00:51.840> shortly<00:00:52.840> after<00:00:53.410> and<00:00:53.770> the

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
I checked the mail shortly after and the

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.890 
I checked the mail shortly after and the
new<00:00:54.400> jewelry<00:00:54.790> would<00:00:55.000> end<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.890> I<00:00:56.920> immediately

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
new jewelry would end so I immediately

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.120 
new jewelry would end so I immediately
took<00:00:58.900> the<00:00:58.960> look<00:00:59.740> threat<00:01:00.070> out<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.830> zero<00:01:02.830> gauge

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
took the look threat out the zero gauge

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
took the look threat out the zero gauge
labret<00:01:03.610> out<00:01:03.790> and<00:01:04.380> put<00:01:05.380> in<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:05.650> double<00:01:05.920> zero

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
labret out and put in the double zero

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.240 
labret out and put in the double zero
during<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.300> process<00:01:07.780> of<00:01:07.900> me<00:01:08.080> taking<00:01:08.530> out<00:01:08.800> the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
during the process of me taking out the

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.930 
during the process of me taking out the
zero<00:01:09.940> gauge<00:01:10.360> I<00:01:10.950> actually<00:01:11.950> had<00:01:12.310> a<00:01:12.340> hard<00:01:12.640> time

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
zero gauge I actually had a hard time

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.350 
zero gauge I actually had a hard time
taking<00:01:13.840> out<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:14.530> jewelry<00:01:15.100> it<00:01:15.369> was<00:01:15.550> stuck<00:01:16.090> in

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
taking out the jewelry it was stuck in

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.340 
taking out the jewelry it was stuck in
there<00:01:16.650> from<00:01:17.650> what<00:01:17.860> I<00:01:17.890> have<00:01:18.100> read<00:01:18.550> and<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:20.080> some

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
there from what I have read and in some

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.680 
there from what I have read and in some
forms<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.040> so<00:01:21.220> forth<00:01:21.490> is<00:01:21.700> that<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.060> teflon

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
forms and so forth is that the teflon

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.830 
forms and so forth is that the teflon
tape<00:01:22.899> actually<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.790> kind<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.090> keeps<00:01:25.300> the<00:01:25.540> area

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
tape actually it kind of keeps the area

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.690 
tape actually it kind of keeps the area
dry<00:01:26.320> so<00:01:26.800> it<00:01:26.890> was<00:01:27.040> probably<00:01:27.520> sticking<00:01:28.450> to<00:01:28.600> my<00:01:29.700> my

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
dry so it was probably sticking to my my

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.730 
dry so it was probably sticking to my my
lip<00:01:31.000> was<00:01:31.149> probably<00:01:31.509> sticking<00:01:31.929> and<00:01:32.380> almost

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
lip was probably sticking and almost

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.830 
lip was probably sticking and almost
adhering<00:01:33.250> to<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.520> actual<00:01:33.789> tape<00:01:34.119> so<00:01:34.390> I<00:01:34.420> don't

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
adhering to the actual tape so I don't

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.520 
adhering to the actual tape so I don't
know<00:01:34.960> if<00:01:35.080> I'll<00:01:35.200> be<00:01:35.229> actually<00:01:35.830> using<00:01:36.179> teflon<00:01:37.179> to

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
know if I'll be actually using teflon to

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.680 
know if I'll be actually using teflon to
stretch<00:01:38.530> my<00:01:38.830> labret<00:01:39.190> anymore<00:01:39.580> it<00:01:40.119> definitely

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
stretch my labret anymore it definitely

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.949 
stretch my labret anymore it definitely
was<00:01:40.840> more<00:01:41.050> smooth<00:01:41.530> and<00:01:41.770> easier<00:01:42.130> to<00:01:42.280> put<00:01:42.520> in<00:01:42.959> and

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:43.959 
was more smooth and easier to put in and

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.340 
was more smooth and easier to put in and
more<00:01:44.170> comfy<00:01:44.649> filling<00:01:45.569> but<00:01:46.569> it<00:01:46.720> was<00:01:46.840> definitely

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
more comfy filling but it was definitely

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.639 
more comfy filling but it was definitely
a<00:01:47.410> pain<00:01:47.800> the<00:01:47.920> ass<00:01:47.950> take<00:01:48.520> out<00:01:48.759> and<00:01:49.509> I<00:01:50.110> hurt<00:01:50.440> like

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
a pain the ass take out and I hurt like

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.889 
a pain the ass take out and I hurt like
I<00:01:50.979> heard<00:01:51.369> a<00:01:51.429> lot<00:01:51.640> actually<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.479> actually<00:01:52.750> take

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
I heard a lot actually to actually take

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.690 
I heard a lot actually to actually take
it<00:01:52.929> out<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:53.410> finally<00:01:54.009> got<00:01:54.100> it<00:01:54.250> out<00:01:54.369> so<00:01:54.550> I<00:01:54.580> don't

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
it out I finally got it out so I don't

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.160 
it out I finally got it out so I don't
know<00:01:54.880> if<00:01:55.000> I'll<00:01:55.119> be<00:01:55.149> actually<00:01:55.539> stretching<00:01:56.080> with

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
know if I'll be actually stretching with

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.680 
know if I'll be actually stretching with
that<00:01:56.410> probably<00:01:57.160> stick<00:01:57.369> expect<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.539> the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
that probably stick expect to the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.969 
that probably stick expect to the
electrical<00:01:59.200> tape<00:01:59.380> even<00:01:59.709> though<00:01:59.800> it's<00:01:59.950> a

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
electrical tape even though it's a

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:00.779 
electrical tape even though it's a
little<00:02:00.039> bit<00:02:00.190> more<00:02:00.399> sharp

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
little bit more sharp

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.809 
little bit more sharp
I<00:02:01.209> haven't<00:02:01.660> had<00:02:01.840> problems<00:02:02.340> taking<00:02:03.340> the

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
I haven't had problems taking the

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:09.380 
I haven't had problems taking the
jewelry<00:02:04.179> in<00:02:04.300> or<00:02:04.450> out<00:02:04.709> of<00:02:05.709> my<00:02:06.270> labret<00:02:07.270> piercing

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.580 

so<00:02:10.390> I'll<00:02:10.599> probably<00:02:10.690> stick<00:02:11.110> into<00:02:11.260> that<00:02:11.410> right

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
so I'll probably stick into that right

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.740 
so I'll probably stick into that right
now<00:02:11.770> I'm<00:02:11.950> resting<00:02:12.400> at<00:02:12.520> a<00:02:12.550> zero<00:02:13.150> gauge<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.660> to

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
now I'm resting at a zero gauge and to

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.150 
now I'm resting at a zero gauge and to
just<00:02:13.959> show<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.110> I'm<00:02:14.440> sorry<00:02:14.650> double<00:02:14.950> zero

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
just show you I'm sorry double zero

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.250 
just show you I'm sorry double zero
gauge<00:02:15.370> which<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.730> just<00:02:15.940> showed<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.120> I'll<00:02:17.110> be

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
gauge which I just showed you I'll be

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.990 
gauge which I just showed you I'll be
there<00:02:17.500> for<00:02:17.770> another<00:02:17.860> day<00:02:18.220> or<00:02:18.250> two<00:02:18.370> it's<00:02:18.760> still

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
there for another day or two it's still

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.699 
there for another day or two it's still
a<00:02:19.030> little<00:02:19.209> sore<00:02:19.480> not<00:02:19.750> not<00:02:20.080> too<00:02:20.260> bad<00:02:20.440> at<00:02:20.590> all

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
a little sore not not too bad at all

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.170 
a little sore not not too bad at all
really<00:02:21.190> but<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.980> have<00:02:24.190> not<00:02:24.370> tried<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.730> take<00:02:25.150> it

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
really but I have not tried to take it

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.030 
really but I have not tried to take it
out<00:02:25.420> I've<00:02:25.720> been<00:02:25.870> trying<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.290> wiggle<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.010> a

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
out I've been trying to wiggle it a

other

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
other

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.090 
other
if<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.100> want<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.340> see<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:43.620> it's<00:02:43.770> actually

if you want to see and it's actually

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.060 
if you want to see and it's actually
rubbing<00:02:44.340> on<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.180> webbing<00:02:45.840> on<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.620> inside<00:02:46.920> of

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
rubbing on the webbing on the inside of

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.650 
rubbing on the webbing on the inside of
my<00:02:47.130> lip<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.640> webbing<00:02:48.000> it's<00:02:48.180> kind<00:02:48.360> of<00:02:48.420> hurting

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
my lip the webbing it's kind of hurting

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.760 
my lip the webbing it's kind of hurting
a<00:02:48.720> little<00:02:48.810> bit

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
a little bit

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.930 
a little bit
again<00:02:50.490> not<00:02:51.110> nothing<00:02:52.110> too<00:02:52.320> severe<00:02:52.920> it's<00:02:53.730> still

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
again not nothing too severe it's still

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.210 
again not nothing too severe it's still
pretty<00:02:54.180> comfortable<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:55.530> then<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:55.860> net<00:02:56.070> the

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
pretty comfortable and then the net the

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.100 
pretty comfortable and then the net the
next<00:02:56.490> size<00:02:56.610> actually<00:02:56.910> has<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.180> larger<00:02:57.660> vacuum

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
next size actually has a larger vacuum

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.260 
next size actually has a larger vacuum
so<00:02:58.320> that's<00:02:58.560> going<00:02:58.740> to<00:02:58.800> going<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.340> be<00:02:59.460> my<00:02:59.670> larger

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
so that's going to going to be my larger

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
so that's going to going to be my larger
concern<00:03:00.950> for<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.040> next<00:03:02.310> size<00:03:03.050> probably<00:03:04.050> have

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
concern for the next size probably have

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.280 
concern for the next size probably have
to<00:03:04.410> shave<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.070> down<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.250> little<00:03:05.520> bit<00:03:06.020> and<00:03:07.020> that's

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
to shave it down a little bit and that's

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.570 
to shave it down a little bit and that's
about<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.530> if<00:03:07.860> you<00:03:07.950> have<00:03:08.040> any<00:03:08.190> questions
