00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
is kind of hard to reach and that the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.210 
is kind of hard to reach and that the
audio<00:01:02.670> inputs<00:01:02.969> rather<00:01:03.210> small<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:05.010> side

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220

here<00:01:13.080> just<00:01:13.110> take<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> look<00:01:13.619> at<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.890> front<00:01:14.100> one

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
here just take a look at the front one

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.390 
here just take a look at the front one
of<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> best<00:01:15.119> features<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.869> little

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
of the best features is that little

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.620 
of the best features is that little
cutout<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.759> can<00:01:17.880> see<00:01:18.030> where<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> speakers

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
cutout as you can see where the speakers

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.880 
cutout as you can see where the speakers
are<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.930> i<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.140> found<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.590> make<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.860> a

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
are and i have found it to make it a

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.410 
are and i have found it to make it a
little<00:01:20.009> bit<00:01:20.189> louder<00:01:20.369> as<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> lot<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.119> times<00:01:21.299> when

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
little bit louder as a lot of times when

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.730 
little bit louder as a lot of times when
you're<00:01:21.540> holding<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:21.930> your<00:01:22.020> phone<00:01:22.200> watching<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
you're holding on your phone watching a

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.380 
you're holding on your phone watching a
video<00:01:22.920> you're<00:01:23.580> covering<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> lot<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
video you're covering a lot of the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.270 
video you're covering a lot of the
speakers<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.350> actually<00:01:25.530> fix<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.070> problem

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
speakers so this actually fix a problem

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.249 
speakers so this actually fix a problem
i'm<00:01:26.759> not<00:01:27.060> sure<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> mophie<00:01:27.570> really<00:01:27.810> intended

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
i'm not sure a mophie really intended

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.810 
i'm not sure a mophie really intended
that<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:29.130> definitely<00:01:29.340> very<00:01:29.670> very

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
that but it's definitely very very

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.240 
that but it's definitely very very
effective<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:31.680> one<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> main

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
effective and it's one of the main

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.020 
effective and it's one of the main
features<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.880> my<00:01:33.030> opinion<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.720> case<00:01:35.030> now

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
features in my opinion of this case now

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.550 
features in my opinion of this case now
let's<00:01:36.210> go<00:01:36.329> ahead<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.540> take<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.960> look<00:01:37.140> at<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.439> as

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
let's go ahead and take a look at it as

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.830 
let's go ahead and take a look at it as
