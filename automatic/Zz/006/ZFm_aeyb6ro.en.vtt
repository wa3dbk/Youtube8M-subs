00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.290
 good morning , you actually arrive here 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.230
 we start with a new section via 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.140
 youtube on which we will buy 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.730
 same internet products and 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.710
 we will show if it is true what we 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.439
 say sellers 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.390
 for this first test we have brought a 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:30.250
 crystal screen protector 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:34.540
 tempered for iphone 5 and 5s and 5cm 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.700
 since they are fashionable and we can pay it 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.260
 we do not have a hard 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:44.429
 let's see what the package brings us 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.429
 the screen 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.870
 a sticker that we assume will be for 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.870
 the back part 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.400
 a wipe to clean 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.400
 the glass 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.090
 1 to remove the bubbles 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.520
 Y 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.710
 the lcd which web to clean type 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.000
 wipe of a lifetime to clean 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.050
 hands on seafood 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.050
 and here it appears 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:21.509
 ah 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.509
 the protectors for the main button 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.650
 Now let's test if it's true that the 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.570
 glass holds for now we can see 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.830
 that is turned 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.830
 how can they buy 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.760
 and now we can go to the section 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.440
 test 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.080
 some scissors we go sometimes stripe 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.080
 as you can see it has not been scratched 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.360
 for a little bit of psychosis 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.360
 let's go to power 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.180
 with which we can see that it has not 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.180
 found 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.840
 it's still whole 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.569
 many take out a hammer let's try 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.000
 it has broken us is awesome 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.610
 then say that the Chinese do not 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.370
 they do quality things 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.950
 and with another more interesting test yet 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.950
 which is that of our friend the worker 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:08.380
 you can tell as if you have 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.380
 broken if we passed him a drill 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.719
 we analyze the product 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.870
 if we find that you're not going to go with the 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:21.490
 phone and a drill that can withstand 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.970
 scratches 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:29.810
 slashes impact blows and everything 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.660
 that our advice is worth it 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.960
 for a cell phone as expensive as the iphone 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:39.050
 55 s and 5 cm the buy to avoid 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.850
 we have to pay a high price for the 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.520
 repair the screen and here 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.390
 destroyed the chori lleras we leave you 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.390

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.850
 take the life of the poor and 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.850
 destroyed screen 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.900
 it was pure and hard 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:12.819
 of selection via youtube in which 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.910
 compare products and prove 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.840
 to see if they are reliable or not in the 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.930
 Web pages 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.410

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.280
