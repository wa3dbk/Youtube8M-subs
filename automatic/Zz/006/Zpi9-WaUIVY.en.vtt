into a demo so this is now up on github
you<00:01:13.149> can<00:01:13.270> go<00:01:13.420> to<00:01:13.479> you'll<00:01:14.380> see<00:01:14.439> the<00:01:14.590> URL<00:01:14.799> in<00:01:15.009> a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
you can go to you'll see the URL in a

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.580 
you can go to you'll see the URL in a
bit<00:01:15.329> but<00:01:16.329> you<00:01:16.479> can<00:01:16.600> actually<00:01:16.719> bring<00:01:17.109> up<00:01:17.259> a<00:01:17.380> full

bit but you can actually bring up a full

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.349 
bit but you can actually bring up a full
cluster<00:01:18.039> and<00:01:18.369> go<00:01:19.119> play<00:01:19.299> with<00:01:19.389> it<00:01:19.539> so<00:01:20.170> this<00:01:20.920> is

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359 
cluster and go play with it so this is

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.999 
cluster and go play with it so this is
I'm<00:01:22.359> going<00:01:22.749> to<00:01:22.990> so<00:01:23.289> we<00:01:23.380> just<00:01:23.499> got<00:01:23.649> this<00:01:23.799> working

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
yeah so I've got a zookeeper vm to

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.219 
yeah so I've got a zookeeper vm to
coordinate<00:01:42.250> everything<00:01:42.490> I'm<00:01:43.119> ases<00:01:43.450> master<00:01:43.899> a

coordinate everything I'm ases master a

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.410 
coordinate everything I'm ases master a
masive<00:01:44.770> slave<00:01:45.039> to<00:01:45.700> actually<00:01:45.939> run<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.149> things

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
masive slave to actually run the things

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.910 
masive slave to actually run the things
in<00:01:46.569> the<00:01:46.750> Aurora<00:01:46.990> scheduler<00:01:47.500> which<00:01:47.709> will

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
in the Aurora scheduler which will

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.749 
in the Aurora scheduler which will
actually<00:01:48.329> be<00:01:49.329> what<00:01:49.799> coordinates<00:01:50.799> coordinates

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
actually be what coordinates coordinates

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.139 
actually be what coordinates coordinates
everything<00:01:52.119> so<00:01:52.810> I'm<00:01:53.109> going<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.380> go<00:01:53.530> ahead<00:01:53.560> and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
go into my Aurora scheduler and so I'm

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.809 
go into my Aurora scheduler and so I'm
going<00:01:58.539> to<00:01:58.569> show<00:01:58.720> you<00:01:58.780> how<00:01:58.899> we<00:01:59.170> actually<00:01:59.819> define

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
going to show you how we actually define

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.679 
going to show you how we actually define
services<00:02:01.599> at<00:02:01.899> Twitter<00:02:02.110> so<00:02:02.489> services<00:02:03.489> are<00:02:03.789> the

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
services at Twitter so services are the

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.350 
services at Twitter so services are the
the<00:02:05.610> description<00:02:06.610> of<00:02:06.670> how<00:02:06.789> you<00:02:06.849> run<00:02:07.030> a<00:02:07.090> service

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
the description of how you run a service

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.710 
the description of how you run a service
is<00:02:07.689> just<00:02:07.929> code<00:02:08.110> that<00:02:08.259> you<00:02:08.349> check<00:02:08.560> in<00:02:08.739> we<00:02:09.429> have<00:02:09.579> a

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
is just code that you check in we have a

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.259 
is just code that you check in we have a
Python<00:02:10.720> domain-specific<00:02:11.140> language<00:02:12.269> that

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
Python domain-specific language that

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.330 
Python domain-specific language that
allows<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.959> configure<00:02:14.379> this<00:02:14.739> so<00:02:15.220> this<00:02:15.310> is

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
allows you to configure this so this is

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.530 
allows you to configure this so this is
under<00:02:16.110> examples<00:02:17.110> jobs<00:02:17.530> right<00:02:18.370> here<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:19.390> can

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
under examples jobs right here you can

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
is just a very basic example I'm just

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.599 
is just a very basic example I'm just
going<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.230> have<00:02:29.319> a<00:02:29.349> hello<00:02:29.560> world<00:02:29.650> thing<00:02:30.250> that

going to have a hello world thing that

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.120 
going to have a hello world thing that

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
to run a the way to run everything so

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.039 
to run a the way to run everything so
i'm<00:02:43.000> going<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.239> go<00:02:43.329> ahead<00:02:43.359> and<00:02:43.630> create<00:02:43.840> this

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
i'm going to go ahead and create this

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:51.660 
i'm going to go ahead and create this
job<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:48.299> so<00:02:49.299> that<00:02:49.510> is<00:02:50.190> exampled<00:02:51.190> up<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.519> the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
job and so that is exampled up to the

data<00:02:52.049> fraud<00:02:53.400> hello<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:57.220> so<00:02:57.989> that's<00:02:58.989> going<00:02:59.319> to

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
data fraud hello and so that's going to

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.610 
data fraud hello and so that's going to
create<00:03:00.450> so<00:03:01.450> that's<00:03:01.630> going<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.870> be<00:03:01.959> running<00:03:02.230> in

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
almost almost did it elicited let's see

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.830 
almost almost did it elicited let's see
if<00:03:16.980> my<00:03:17.070> scheduler<00:03:17.520> is<00:03:17.580> actually<00:03:17.940> running<00:03:18.120> not

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
if my scheduler is actually running not

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:26.350 
if my scheduler is actually running not
in<00:03:18.990> there<00:03:19.260> that's<00:03:19.650> why<00:03:19.920> its<00:03:20.760> my<00:03:20.910> slide<00:03:21.210> deck

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
all my scheduler's not running maybe I

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:37.610 
all my scheduler's not running maybe I
should<00:03:29.160> run<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:30.740> it<00:03:31.740> really<00:03:31.860> did<00:03:36.260> let's<00:03:37.260> see<00:03:37.530> if

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
should run it it really did let's see if

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:47.050 
should run it it really did let's see if
that<00:03:38.240> it's<00:03:39.240> already<00:03:39.510> running<00:03:39.750> no<00:03:40.020> it's<00:03:40.170> not

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.490 

let's<00:03:48.060> see<00:03:48.330> if<00:03:48.420> that<00:03:48.450> made<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:48.930> run<00:03:50.209> no<00:03:51.209> oh<00:03:51.570> no

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
let's see if that made it run no oh no

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.030 
let's see if that made it run no oh no
no<00:03:53.070> all<00:03:54.030> right<00:03:54.270> well<00:03:54.570> that's<00:03:55.470> pretty<00:03:55.770> short

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
no all right well that's pretty short

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.940 
no all right well that's pretty short
demo<00:03:56.280> done<00:03:58.430> so<00:03:59.989> I'm<00:04:00.989> not<00:04:01.230> gonna<00:04:01.380> live<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.800> bug

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
demo done so I'm not gonna live to bug

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.760 
demo done so I'm not gonna live to bug
this<00:04:02.160> on<00:04:02.400> stage<00:04:02.790> so<00:04:03.600> instead<00:04:04.380> I'm<00:04:04.500> going<00:04:04.620> to

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
this on stage so instead I'm going to

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.970 
this on stage so instead I'm going to
just<00:04:04.950> tell<00:04:05.160> you<00:04:05.190> what<00:04:05.670> would<00:04:05.760> have<00:04:05.880> happened

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
just tell you what would have happened

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
just tell you what would have happened
so<00:04:08.810> after<00:04:09.810> we<00:04:09.900> submit<00:04:10.200> that<00:04:10.550> the<00:04:11.550> scheduler

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
so after we submit that the scheduler

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.600 
so after we submit that the scheduler
kind<00:04:12.570> of<00:04:12.690> very<00:04:13.140> quickly<00:04:13.440> will<00:04:13.920> send<00:04:14.459> that<00:04:14.580> out

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
kind of very quickly will send that out

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.219 
kind of very quickly will send that out
send<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:15.090> job<00:04:15.269> off<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.600> a<00:04:15.660> slave<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:16.140> be

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
send that job off to a slave to be

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.250 
send that job off to a slave to be
executed<00:04:16.459> we<00:04:17.459> can<00:04:17.609> see<00:04:17.850> hopefully<00:04:18.810> there's<00:04:19.200> a

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
executed we can see hopefully there's a

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.700 
executed we can see hopefully there's a
slave<00:04:19.530> running<00:04:20.450> so<00:04:21.450> that's<00:04:22.200> not<00:04:22.530> what<00:04:22.680> i

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
slave running so that's not what i

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.990 
slave running so that's not what i
wanted<00:04:22.919> to<00:04:22.979> do<00:04:23.390> you<00:04:24.390> go<00:04:24.600> there<00:04:25.610> that's<00:04:26.610> three

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
wanted to do you go there that's three

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.430 
wanted to do you go there that's three
if<00:04:27.900> so<00:04:28.290> this<00:04:28.440> is<00:04:28.560> my<00:04:28.680> maces<00:04:29.040> master<00:04:29.460> right<00:04:29.640> here

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
if so this is my maces master right here

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.469 
if so this is my maces master right here
as<00:04:31.440> steelers<00:04:32.130> a<00:04:32.160> scheduler<00:04:32.610> running<00:04:35.120> so<00:04:36.120> and

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
as steelers a scheduler running so and

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:37.670 
as steelers a scheduler running so and
it<00:04:36.540> looks<00:04:36.660> like<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:36.900> did<00:04:37.020> actually<00:04:37.200> submit

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
it looks like it did actually submit

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.620 
it looks like it did actually submit
that<00:04:37.770> job<00:04:38.040> off<00:04:38.250> so<00:04:38.460> let's<00:04:38.610> just<00:04:38.850> see<00:04:39.090> if<00:04:39.120> we<00:04:39.300> can

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
that job off so let's just see if we can

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.400 
that job off so let's just see if we can
see<00:04:40.410> it<00:04:41.150> maybe<00:04:42.150> I<00:04:42.270> have<00:04:42.510> maybe<00:04:43.110> I<00:04:43.200> have

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
see it maybe I have maybe I have

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.659 
see it maybe I have maybe I have
something<00:04:43.650> after<00:04:44.010> all<00:04:44.780> so<00:04:45.780> we<00:04:45.870> can<00:04:45.990> see<00:04:46.200> the

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:59.999 

double

yeah there it is so I can see I can see
my<00:05:03.159> whole<00:05:03.360> task<00:05:04.360> I<00:05:04.779> can<00:05:05.439> see<00:05:05.650> all<00:05:06.460> the

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
my whole task I can see all the

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.100 
my whole task I can see all the
information<00:05:07.059> about<00:05:07.270> it<00:05:07.419> normally<00:05:07.960> I'd<00:05:08.020> be

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
information about it normally I'd be

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.839 
information about it normally I'd be
able<00:05:08.229> to<00:05:08.289> get<00:05:08.439> through<00:05:08.649> this<00:05:08.800> directly<00:05:09.580> just
