drugstore and it's all right

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.170 
drugstore and it's all right
it<00:00:45.510> does<00:00:45.690> help<00:00:45.870> my<00:00:46.079> makeup<00:00:46.469> stay<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.680> longer

it does help my makeup stay on longer

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.910 
it does help my makeup stay on longer
but<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.510> don't<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.260> see<00:00:49.440> how<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.649> makes<00:00:49.800> my

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
but I don't really see how it makes my

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.610 
but I don't really see how it makes my
skin<00:00:49.980> luminous<00:00:50.579> I'm<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.180> fuse<00:00:51.449> by<00:00:51.809> itself<00:00:52.199> I

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
skin luminous I'm a fuse by itself I

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.799 
skin luminous I'm a fuse by itself I
think<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.489> brightens<00:00:53.850> up<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.030> skin<00:00:54.420> up<00:00:54.570> quite

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
think it brightens up the skin up quite

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.880 
think it brightens up the skin up quite
a<00:00:54.840> bit<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:55.910> other<00:00:56.910> than<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.770> it's<00:00:58.770> pretty

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
a bit but other than that it's pretty

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.410 
a bit but other than that it's pretty
much<00:00:59.190> hidden<00:00:59.430> by<00:00:59.670> your<00:00:59.879> foundation<00:01:00.570> anyway<00:01:00.870> so

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
much hidden by your foundation anyway so

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.370 
much hidden by your foundation anyway so
I<00:01:03.619> use<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> tiny<00:01:04.979> tiny<00:01:05.280> bit<00:01:05.430> because<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.380> hate

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
I use a tiny tiny bit because I hate

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.039
