 hi tip in the series iphone and ipad 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.000
 of the day 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.330
 Today I show how to use the iphone 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.360
 and ipad multitasking means paid 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.130
 Going fast between multiple apps 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.619
 I switch shows that an ipad 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.080
 mini works but on the normal ipad 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.109
 or in the iphone of course just like that 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.140
 get it first and unlock it 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.510
 and then we'll do one 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.349
 classic application case we have 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.590
 an internet page open and we have 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.380
 a note is open and we would like to 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.660
 here running text from the website 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.190
 copy and paste the notes 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.250
 of course we could do it that way 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.350
 always press the button then you are 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.739
 we go to the home screen 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.050
 safari go on the home screen 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.510
 Let's go to the notes and again 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.210
 back that is quite cumbersome 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.649
 especially if you have several pages an eps 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.320
 maybe there was also there 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.699
 and that's why there's a change 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.129
 an easier way 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:10.830
 I copy here on the website 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:15.180
 then press twice on the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.240
 home button then i come into that 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.280
 multitasking menu that means quasi 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.450
 out and I have an overview here 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.860
 all open pages always see that 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.560
 respective app icons with the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.750
 description and above the screen 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.240
 the leaves were open 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.750
 I 'm now here for example to the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.710
 Change notes on the press 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.290
 insert desired note twice again 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.520
 press the home button then I can 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:51.549
 again for safari 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:54.240
 do not copy something new twice 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:58.170
 press the home button on the notes 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.170
 and use that again 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.860
 besides i can work in multitasking apps 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.439
 this is not urgent 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.840
 necessary since the ipad and iphone that 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.030
 Managed automatically but if you have one 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.459
 app crashed you can almost call it 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.720
 Forcibly finish by putting them here like this 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.860
 dirty with the finger upwards 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.400
 After that you can return to normal 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.829
 to open 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.810
 I hope you find the iphone and ipad 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.760

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.099
