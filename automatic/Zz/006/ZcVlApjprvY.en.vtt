think the vast majority of players
should<00:02:54.570> have<00:02:54.660> an<00:02:54.750> opportunity<00:02:54.990> to<00:02:55.290> sound<00:02:55.860> off

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
should have an opportunity to sound off

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.350 
should have an opportunity to sound off
on<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.220> light<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.580> latest<00:02:56.760> offer<00:02:57.030> I

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
on the light and the latest offer I

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.550 
on the light and the latest offer I
don't<00:02:57.600> think<00:02:57.750> it's<00:02:57.870> going<00:02:57.960> to<00:02:58.020> be<00:02:58.080> 30<00:02:58.290> players

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
don't think it's going to be 30 players

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.770 
don't think it's going to be 30 players
I<00:02:58.800> think<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:59.280> 30<00:02:59.520> players<00:02:59.790> are<00:03:00.120> representing

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
I think the 30 players are representing

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.530 
I think the 30 players are representing
the team<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.620> as<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:02.850> know<00:03:02.880> it's<00:03:03.150> not<00:03:03.270> their

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
the team so as you know it's not their

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.210 
the team so as you know it's not their
decision<00:03:03.660> is<00:03:04.140> they're<00:03:04.560> causing<00:03:04.800> their<00:03:05.070> guys

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
decision is they're causing their guys

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.560 
decision is they're causing their guys
on<00:03:05.460> that<00:03:05.580> team<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.970> they're<00:03:06.090> asking<00:03:06.450> them

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
on that team and they're asking them

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.210 
on that team and they're asking them
questions<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.080> they're<00:03:07.260> bringing<00:03:08.130> the

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
questions and they're bringing the

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.280 
questions and they're bringing the
opinion<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:09.060> lot<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.420> guys<00:03:09.570> together<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:10.260> I

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
opinion of a lot of guys together so I

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.900 
opinion of a lot of guys together so I
think<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:10.770> that's<00:03:11.010> fine<00:03:11.310> because<00:03:11.580> it's<00:03:11.790> not

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
think that that's fine because it's not

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.970 
think that that's fine because it's not
going<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.210> just<00:03:12.360> be<00:03:12.540> down<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:13.350> side<00:03:13.560> is<00:03:13.800> going

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
going to just be down the side is going

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.120 
going to just be down the side is going
to<00:03:14.040> be<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.370> know<00:03:14.490> everybody<00:03:14.940> together
