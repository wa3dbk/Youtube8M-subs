little bit about why big houses

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.279 
little bit about why big houses
sometimes<00:00:29.519> aren't<00:00:29.970> quite<00:00:30.330> as<00:00:30.359> satisfying<00:00:30.689> as

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289

sometimes aren't quite as satisfying as
smaller<00:00:32.040> ones<00:00:35.930> it's<00:00:36.930> actually<00:00:37.530> harder<00:00:38.250> to

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
smaller ones it's actually harder to

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.510 
smaller ones it's actually harder to
design<00:00:39.180> something<00:00:39.719> that's<00:00:39.930> small<00:00:40.440> if<00:00:41.370> you

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
design something that's small if you

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.610 
design something that's small if you
think<00:00:41.730> about<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.300> little<00:00:42.690> Chinese<00:00:43.110> puzzle

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
think about a little Chinese puzzle

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.380 
think about a little Chinese puzzle
where<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.309> know<00:00:44.399> everything's<00:00:44.940> got<00:00:45.210> its

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
where you know everything's got its

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.119 
where you know everything's got its
place<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:45.989> pull<00:00:46.200> out<00:00:46.230> one<00:00:46.559> piece<00:00:46.829> and

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
place and you pull out one piece and

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.650 
place and you pull out one piece and
another<00:00:47.340> piece<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.820> then<00:00:47.910> gradually<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.510> all

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
another piece and then gradually it all

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.799 
another piece and then gradually it all
comes<00:00:48.960> apart<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:50.039> care<00:00:50.489> with<00:00:51.149> which<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.600> was

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
comes apart the care with which that was

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.779 
comes apart the care with which that was
made<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.620> thought<00:00:52.949> that's<00:00:53.309> gone<00:00:53.520> into

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
made and the thought that's gone into

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.029 
made and the thought that's gone into
making<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.449> fit<00:00:54.660> together<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.350> really<00:00:55.680> what

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
making it fit together is really what

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.610 
making it fit together is really what
you<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.579> do<00:00:56.840> when<00:00:57.840> you're<00:00:58.170> making

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
you have to do when you're making

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.060 
you have to do when you're making
something<00:00:58.859> small<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.789> beautiful<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:01.140> it's

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
something small and beautiful so it's

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.750 
something small and beautiful so it's
it's<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.910> different<00:01:03.420> kind<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.899> art<00:01:04.199> than<00:01:04.830> just

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
it's a different kind of art than just

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.880 
it's a different kind of art than just
making<00:01:06.030> big<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:07.020> know<00:01:07.140> make<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.590> can<00:01:07.740> make

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
making big you know make you can make

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.179 
making big you know make you can make
big<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.729> will<00:01:08.909> be<00:01:09.090> not<00:01:09.299> very<00:01:09.710> effective<00:01:10.710> or

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
big and it will be not very effective or

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.710 
big and it will be not very effective or
efficient<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.820> various<00:01:12.119> places<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.630> it

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
efficient in various places but it

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.170 
efficient in various places but it
doesn't<00:01:12.990> matter<00:01:13.170> because<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.770> all<00:01:13.920> been<00:01:14.180> so

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
doesn't matter because it's all been so

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.140 
doesn't matter because it's all been so
it<00:01:15.360> sort<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.659> overcomes<00:01:16.380> its<00:01:16.710> problems<00:01:17.220> by<00:01:17.490> by

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
it sort of overcomes its problems by by

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.300 
it sort of overcomes its problems by by
size<00:01:18.590> this<00:01:19.909> building<00:01:20.909> smaller<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.780> better

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
size this building smaller and better

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.620 
size this building smaller and better
requires<00:01:23.360> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
requires the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.380 
requires the
you<00:01:25.409> can't<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.070> mean<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.549> can<00:01:26.729> build<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.180> small

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
you can't I mean you can build a small

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.980 
you can't I mean you can build a small
house<00:01:27.630> badly<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.770> will<00:01:28.979> hate<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:30.509> it

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
house badly but you will hate it so it

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.490 
house badly but you will hate it so it
has<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.710> really<00:01:32.039> have<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.909> attention<00:01:33.720> from

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
has to really have that attention from

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.160 
has to really have that attention from
the<00:01:34.890> first<00:01:35.340> step<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.090> design<00:01:36.450> all<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.049> way

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
the first step and design all the way

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.889 
the first step and design all the way
through<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:38.329> completion<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.689> project

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
through the completion of the project

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.740 
through the completion of the project
the<00:01:40.409> thing<00:01:40.679> about<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.880> way<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.149> most<00:01:42.329> people

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
the thing about the way that most people

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.080 
the thing about the way that most people
think<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.679> the<00:01:43.860> design<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.310> house<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.819> that

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
think of the design of the house is that

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.510 
think of the design of the house is that
we<00:01:45.270> look<00:01:45.509> at<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.990> surface<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.920> another<00:01:47.250> of

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
we look at the surface it's another of

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.249 
we look at the surface it's another of
these<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.939> know<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.360> what<00:01:48.929> what<00:01:49.140> does

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
these you know it's just what what does

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.069 
these you know it's just what what does
it<00:01:49.380> look<00:01:49.500> like<00:01:49.560> from<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> street<00:01:50.250> what<00:01:50.700> we

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
it look like from the street what we

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.779 
it look like from the street what we
neglect<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.259> realize<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.039> you<00:01:53.159> walk<00:01:53.429> two

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
neglect to realize is that you walk two

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.580 
neglect to realize is that you walk two
feet<00:01:53.819> this<00:01:54.240> way<00:01:54.450> or<00:01:54.600> two<00:01:54.750> feet<00:01:54.929> that<00:01:55.170> way<00:01:55.200> and

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
feet this way or two feet that way and

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.190 
feet this way or two feet that way and
it's<00:01:55.950> no<00:01:56.220> longer<00:01:56.579> what<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.539> face<00:01:57.750> looks<00:01:58.110> like

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
it's no longer what that face looks like

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.820 
it's no longer what that face looks like
so<00:01:58.950> we're<00:01:59.340> creating<00:01:59.970> these<00:02:00.119> facades

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
so we're creating these facades

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.100 
so we're creating these facades
literally<00:02:01.830> just<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.429> facade<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:03.090> then<00:02:03.780> there's

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
literally just a facade and then there's

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.169 
literally just a facade and then there's
final<00:02:04.500> siding<00:02:04.920> around<00:02:05.189> every<00:02:05.490> other<00:02:05.640> side<00:02:05.970> and

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
final siding around every other side and

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:07.370 
final siding around every other side and
there's<00:02:06.360> no<00:02:06.539> thought<00:02:06.840> about<00:02:07.049> where<00:02:07.259> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380
