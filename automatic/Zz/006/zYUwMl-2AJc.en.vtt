you know clearing the page file stuff
like<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.829> might<00:00:56.010> require<00:00:56.190> you

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
like that and that might require you

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.209 
like that and that might require you
know<00:00:57.210> writes<00:00:57.930> what<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.590> do<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:59.039> the
