use<00:02:21.230> of<00:02:21.260> maggots<00:02:21.650> well<00:02:22.190> they<00:02:22.430> didn't<00:02:22.700> use

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
use of maggots well they didn't use

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.199 
use of maggots well they didn't use
maggots<00:02:23.360> deliberately<00:02:23.900> haha<00:02:24.970> never<00:02:25.970> run<00:02:26.180> a

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
maggots deliberately haha never run a

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.020 
maggots deliberately haha never run a
case<00:02:26.480> needles<00:02:28.060> but<00:02:30.370> at<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.549> end<00:02:31.579> of<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.849> war

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
case needles but at the end of the war

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.940 
case needles but at the end of the war
they<00:02:32.239> found<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.810> Confederate<00:02:33.530> surgeons

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
they found that the Confederate surgeons

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.740 
they found that the Confederate surgeons
were<00:02:34.069> having<00:02:34.400> fewer<00:02:34.610> complications<00:02:34.880> with<00:02:35.660> the

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
were having fewer complications with the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.600 
were having fewer complications with the
surgery<00:02:35.780> than<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.560> northern<00:02:36.920> surgeons<00:02:37.340> which

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
surgery than the northern surgeons which

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.850 
surgery than the northern surgeons which
didn't<00:02:38.269> make<00:02:38.360> any<00:02:38.569> sense<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:39.049> anybody<00:02:39.290> because

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
didn't make any sense to anybody because

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.710 
didn't make any sense to anybody because
the<00:02:40.250> North<00:02:40.489> had<00:02:40.670> all<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.880> resources<00:02:42.400> well

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
the North had all the resources well

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.870 
the North had all the resources well
they<00:02:44.720> found<00:02:44.959> that<00:02:45.260> because<00:02:45.769> of<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.459> blockade

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
they found that because of the blockade

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.699 
they found that because of the blockade
the<00:02:46.940> south<00:02:47.420> end<00:02:47.660> improvise<00:02:48.140> adapt<00:02:48.590> and

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
the south end improvise adapt and

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.830 
the south end improvise adapt and
overcome<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.340> problems<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.599> Year

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
overcome the problems the Year

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.809 
overcome the problems the Year
restrictions<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:51.769> one<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.400> things<00:02:52.640> that

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
restrictions so one of the things that

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.220 
restrictions so one of the things that
they<00:02:52.940> were<00:02:53.000> doing<00:02:53.450> up<00:02:53.599> north<00:02:53.630> they<00:02:54.079> could

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
they were doing up north they could

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.410 
they were doing up north they could
change<00:02:54.440> with<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.489> dry<00:02:55.670> dressing<00:02:56.150> two<00:02:56.329> to

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
change with the dry dressing two to

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.150 
change with the dry dressing two to
three<00:02:56.600> times<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.989> day<00:02:57.019> down<00:02:57.410> south<00:02:57.769> they<00:02:57.980> went

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
three times a day down south they went

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.069 
three times a day down south they went
two<00:02:58.280> to<00:02:58.400> three<00:02:58.579> days<00:02:58.760> without<00:02:59.239> changing<00:02:59.989> the

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
two to three days without changing the

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.449 
two to three days without changing the
dressing<00:03:00.500> that<00:03:00.590> wound<00:03:00.889> up<00:03:01.010> with<00:03:01.130> maggots

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
dressing that wound up with maggots

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.640 
dressing that wound up with maggots
wrong<00:03:01.700> in<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:01.970> wounds<00:03:02.299> and<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.139> maggots<00:03:03.470> read

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
wrong in the wounds and the maggots read

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.640 
wrong in the wounds and the maggots read
into<00:03:03.920> dead<00:03:04.069> tissue<00:03:04.310> not<00:03:04.639> living<00:03:04.970> tissue

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
into dead tissue not living tissue

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.020 
into dead tissue not living tissue
another<00:03:06.650> thing<00:03:06.920> is<00:03:07.100> I<00:03:07.280> have<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.549> use<00:03:07.730> things

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
another thing is I have the use things

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.720 
another thing is I have the use things
like<00:03:08.120> horsehair<00:03:09.010> eating<00:03:10.010> you<00:03:10.100> see<00:03:10.280> how<00:03:10.370> stiff

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
like horsehair eating you see how stiff

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.000 
like horsehair eating you see how stiff
horsehair<00:03:11.359> is<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:12.230> in<00:03:12.380> order<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.590> make<00:03:12.829> it

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
horsehair is and in order to make it

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.050 
horsehair is and in order to make it
more<00:03:13.489> pliable

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
more pliable

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.050 
more pliable
they<00:03:14.209> had<00:03:14.359> dip<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:14.780> in<00:03:14.900> boiling<00:03:15.290> water<00:03:15.319> and<00:03:16.060> as

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
they had dip it in boiling water and as

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.580 
they had dip it in boiling water and as
since<00:03:17.329> they<00:03:17.450> were<00:03:17.510> sterilizing<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:18.319> needle

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
since they were sterilizing the needle

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.500 
since they were sterilizing the needle
and<00:03:18.680> thread<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.160> there<00:03:19.790> were<00:03:19.880> fewer

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
and thread and there were fewer

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.100 
and thread and there were fewer
complications<00:03:20.750> with<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.590> circuses
