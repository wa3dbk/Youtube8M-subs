00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:20.070
 Hello and welcome to the episode 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:23.689
 Tactics 1 of our little showcase theme 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.580
 today is the value of the different 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.710
 play figures let's look at these 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.630
 position 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.820
 Everything seems to be about the field here 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.630
 Turn on the the gold general of ours 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.450
 opponent stands 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.440
 he is attacked by us have silver 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:45.149
 from our sprenger and from ours 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.450
 he is defended by the baur of our tower 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.590
 opponent of his silver general and 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.230
 from his runners 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.390
 we look at what happens when we 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.260
 We exchange all the figures 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.260
 with the tours 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.350
 He takes back with the farmer 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.510
 first hit with our silver 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.000
 be repulsed his silver 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.880
 Silver with us at the springer and he takes 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.840
 with the runner back now we are looking 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.780
 tell us which characters on the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.530
 Every party has got hand now 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.420
 three figures on hand but 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.210
 they are different figures 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.720
 we have a farmer a gold 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.210
 general and a silver general 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.040
 our opponent has a tower 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.350
 springer and also a silver 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.950
 general 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.020
 who made the better deal now 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.630
 the two silver generals give each other 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.970
 mutually on what the difference 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.850
 Power is the gold general and the farmer 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.640
 on our side and the tower and 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.189
 springer on the other side around this 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.860
 question to be able to answer who 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.340
 now here we have the better 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.740
 can evaluate individual figures 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.920
 what value a figure has always depends 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.869
 from the game situation but in the big 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.039
 and all you can say that the 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.850
 most valuable figure 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.300
 the tower is 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.100
 the runner is relatively equivalent 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:20.620
 These two characters are also difficult 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:23.470
 The figures named next will follow 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.930
 two generals being the gold general 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.500
 something more valuable than the silver 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.350
 General the two generals apply 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.620
 again as more valuable than the two 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.010
 figures springer and lance springer and 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.140
 lanxess roughly equivalent 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.170
 Generally, one says that for these six 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.380
 figures are two figures are always 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.690
 more valuable than a figure itself 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:54.520
 a lance and a springer in common 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:57.010
 are more valuable than a single nature 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.790
 and the figure that is least worth it 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.030
 is the individual farmer but as already 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.250
 previously said the value of the figures hangs 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.780
 very much of the game situation to me 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.150
 that only in a small example 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.810
 let me show you this position 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.320
 look 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.530
 we can open the gold with our tour 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.610
 1 hit 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:23.530
 the tower is withdrawn from silver 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.420
 we have a good one for you now 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.190
 bad trade made normal 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.890
 The tower is more valuable than the gold 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.860
 general , but let's look at what 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.200
 we have a gold now 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.750
 General on the hand and can on the 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.480
 two bets and the opponent 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.150
 king so dull in the 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.630
 So the starting position was clearly the 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.910
 gold generally more valuable than the tower and 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.500
 It was right with the forest general 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.630
 to beat our tours 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.790
 with our newly acquired knowledge 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.310
 Let's look at the position from earlier 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.170
 Once again 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.450
 It is usually cheaper first with the 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.010
 less valuable figure to beat 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.550
 so we'll hit this one with the 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.400
 springer the gold general 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.650
 The farmer takes back if we are now 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.570
 just stop the fight here 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.700
 we see that we have a gold general 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.340
 have won for a springer 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:21.030
 this is usually a good exchange 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.480
 for us we continue silva 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:28.850
 bauer bauer takes the silver general 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.830
 back then we see that we are already 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:36.020
 deteriorate, we propose now 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:39.090
 with the tower and the new one back from him 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.530
 we have exactly the position at the we 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.450
 have asked us before who now 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.970
 has made a better exchange and me 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.420
 think you can easily see that 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.770
 we got away very bad 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.890
 you should have a blow 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.950
 therefore always calculate who at the end of which 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.630
 figures on hand has so now 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.020
 Let's look at the position from earlier 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.270
 once again beaten without the runner 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.060
 here are gold general with tours 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.400
 the farmer takes a back seat with the 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.890
 silver general silver general takes and 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.800
 a blow with the springer have something 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.560
 we are now on hand we have two 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.430
 generals and a farmer so three 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.280
 characters 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.790
 Our opponent has a tour and one 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:27.419
 aim at general two figures 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:31.140
 however, we have a gold general 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:32.250
 and a farmer opposite a tower 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.620
 our opponent has 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.710
 we have a relatively bad one 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.740
 swap now let's have a look 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.570
 what it would look like if we were in 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.400
 in a different order the figures 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.400
 We suggest hitting first with the 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.190
 springer the farmer takes us again 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.040
 beat with the silver general silver 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.950
 general takes back and we fight 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:59.100
 the tower and look at what we have 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:01.830
 now we have on hand then we have 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.770
 still because gold general the farmer 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.080
 and silver general and has been opponents 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.530
 but only one silver general and one 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.910
 springer, we have the tower 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.970
 keep and springer instead 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.310
 given 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:18.110
 in this case we have a clear one 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.540
 better exchange than in the variant 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.850
 done before if so it to one 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.370
 Swap on the board comes 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.800
 we have to analyze how many 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.560
 figures we can pull on the field 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.270
 and with how many figures our opponent 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.640
 can pull on the field 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.220
 we have to think carefully in 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:41.090
 which order we take our figures 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:44.510
 lead into the battle and we have to 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:49.040
 analyze who after the blow 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:50.930
 which figures get on the hand and 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.270
 After all, we have the value of this 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.020
 figures that we and our opponent on the 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.760
 Hand weigh 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.980
 in assessing the value of 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.200
 Let us remember that the figures 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.140
 most valuable figures these are the 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.170
 straight in the position on the board 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.350
 to be used 

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:14.600
 Apart from that we remember it 

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:17.470
 that difficult figures are worth more than 

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:20.780
 generals generals are worth more than 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:23.900
 springer and land and that the farmers 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.360
 the figures are worth the least 

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.730
 to have 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:32.690
 yes , that's what I thought about you 

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:35.690
 value of the characters wanted to say in the 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:39.020
 next we will tactic two 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:41.390
 us the double attack as a motive 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.240
 I look forward to seeing you there 

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:46.870
 have fun while training 

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.870
 See you
