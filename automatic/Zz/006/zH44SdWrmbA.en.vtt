 thyme thyme that happens to grow too 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.219
 in the Alps in the garden you 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.920
 use it with other plants 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.079
 aromatic and full of sun like 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.750
 lic reason lavender like rosemary 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.320
 also and especially in pots it will do 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.539
 wonder 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.850
 first you'll have it near the kitchen 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.590
 or near the barbecue and then if your 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.270
 garden soil and frankly heavy and 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.620
 stay wet the winter it's a 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.690
 situation that will hate 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.180
 you will have it in pot in a good soil 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.060
 well drained and you too will have 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.340
 wonderful walk from home to the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.510
 plant I said well drained so we go 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.659
 put a good layer of beads 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.840
 of clay 5 to 10 cm 2 8 of clay it is 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.950
 perfect I add the felt very 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.600
 important to avoid the loams of 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.070
 go down between the balls and 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.479
 to seal up I'm going to put my potting soil 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.860
 use a light soil and not too much 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.600
 rich as the potting soil for plants 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.299
 Mediterranean or a breeding ground 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.610
 potting here I'm going to plunge him into 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.020
 the water the complexion naturally resist 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.070
 temperatures going down 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.530
 until minus 15 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.119
 so even in pots if it is well drained 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.610
 you can leave out the winter on 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:53.159
 the terrace I will undo a few 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.350
 roots she stops turning on 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.079
 itself and that it is distributed 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.369
 well in the po the complexion will bloom from 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.860

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.110
 October in colors that go into 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.930

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.580

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.340

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.750
 and then after flowering you him 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.310
 make a nice size to keep it 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.130
 very compact as long as possible 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.780
 and interest too you will keep all 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.190
 the branches you cut you 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.050
 the dried expenses and you will be able to 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.290

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.340
 your beds at the foot of the roses by 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.459
 example and then it will be superb also in 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.350
 pot the complexion hates the excess water there 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.180
 However, water it thoroughly 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.270
 planting and then you will watch 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.290
 young plants and potted plants 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.300

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.670

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.150
