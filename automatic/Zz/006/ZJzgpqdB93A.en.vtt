00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:07.000
 let's prepare aubergine cake 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:10.059
 the ingredients that we need are 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.520
 for a mold of 20 x 30 centimeters 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.820
 about 3 large aubergines 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:19.839
 ham or sweet sliced ​​cheese in 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.210
 slices that melts well 3 eggs 250 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:24.939
 Mililiters of milk 3 tablespoons 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.360
 tomato sauce or tomato fried cheese 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:31.490
 Parmesan oil salt and pepper 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.310
 and let's start with our 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.670
 eggplant already clean cutting them the 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:41.530
 tip and cutting the slices very 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:45.550
 finite as a half centimeter 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.820
 and we are going to put them in water with enough 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.820
 Salt 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.130
 to release the bitterness between 10 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.370
 minutes and a half hour 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.820
 We are putting them in a big bowl 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.860
 and even rub a little nothing happens the 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.199
 we put all of them and sink them with the 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.940
 hands, it's about getting wet with 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.150
 the water with salt to release the 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.619
 bitterness once the time has passed and 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.350
 depending on the time we have 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.840
 we are ten minutes for ten 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.500
 minutes we take a couple of cloths 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.509
 clean kitchen and dry them very well 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.020
 now let's heat a pan or 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.780
 iron and with a little oil the 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.110
 let's cook until they're 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.770
 golden 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.869
 you just have to toast them I would say 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.880
 let's take out the second round of 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.880
 Aubergines, we did not fit all 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.890
 and while we go as you see doing the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.340
 grilled aubergines 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.440
 until they are slightly golden them 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.270
 we put a little salt according to the 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.190
 we have the salt on the plate 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.520
 take the water where we re-wet it 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.550
 remove the bitterness do not take it and the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.070
 we are moving to a plate 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.100
 and we are doing by batches all 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.320
 our aubergines can seem like a 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.570
 I'm a bit heavy but I really do not 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.210
 it takes nothing for the aubergines to 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.240
 brown quickly when we have them 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.030
 we all take our mold we put 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.510
 a baking paper and we will place a 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.620
 first layer of aubergines as you see a 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.360
 Tiny superimposed on top of each other 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.640
 but without using too many because we run 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.960
 the danger of not having enough to 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.960
 the layers of our cake 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.770
 are three layers of eggplant that's why 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.020
 we have used dinners three times 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.560
 and now with the help of a brush we're going 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.090
 to spread a little bit of tomato sauce 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.650
 it's just a little bit because this gives you a 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.040
 Special point but it is not the 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.790
 protagonist of the dish 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.099
 we put the slices of ham 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.340
 adapted for a finite layer 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.769
 and the same thing we do with the cheese that in 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.829
 our case we have used acute but as 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.049
 You see I give you enough ideas in the list 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.540
 of the most appropriate cheese ingredients 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.550
 for this dish that simply has 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.400
 than being a cheese that founds well 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.310
 we put another layer of aubergines equal 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.610
 than the previous one and we repaint it 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.500
 with tomato we put another bit of ham 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.500
 york in a thin layer 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.680
 the cheese 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.690
 and finally the aubergines that have 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.690
 left 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.510
 now we take the milk that we have in 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.020
 our measuring jug and as you can see 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.020
 250 milliliters 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:57.030
 we add the eggs and we put a little 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.260
 salt and a little pepper 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:04.480
 we beat it well 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.760
 and we miss everything in our cake 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.000
 little by little so that it absorbs 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.400
 the 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.890
 at this point we have to have the oven 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.890
 preheated to 180 degrees 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.160
 once we have thrown all the mixture of 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.680
 milk and egg we are going to sprinkle with 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.780
 Parmesan cheese or if you have cheese 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.340
 grated by house you can also use it 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.289
 it does not have to be parmesan 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.849
 strictly 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:37.339
 and we're going to put it in the oven between 40 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:39.619
 minutes and an hour we will have to go 

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:41.569
 watching with a skewer and see what is 

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:44.089
 curdled 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:46.580
 Over time I have seen that it has 

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:49.429
 golden well above we took it out and what 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.309
 let's warm a little to be able 

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:54.199
 eat it and ready we have our 

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:56.509
 eggplant cake that as you see 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:59.179
 we can take a little bit more hot or 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:02.240
 a little bit colder that is already to taste of 

00:04:59.179 --> 00:05:04.580
 each one otherwise I recommend 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.649
 that you make this dish and that you do not stop 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.929
 try it since I know that you will love it 

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:14.379
 because as you know I can not say 

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:14.379
 another thing except that it is delicious
