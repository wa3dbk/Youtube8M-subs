00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
because what's the counter-argument

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.750 
because what's the counter-argument
could<00:03:27.900> be<00:03:28.020> we<00:03:28.470> went<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.800> found<00:03:28.860> out<00:03:29.190> that<00:03:29.430> in

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
could be we went and found out that in

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.120 
could be we went and found out that in
public<00:03:30.330> record<00:03:30.720> there<00:03:31.170> is<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.410> person<00:03:31.920> named

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
public record there is a person named

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.250 
public record there is a person named
Lindsay<00:03:32.580> Lohan<00:03:33.090> who<00:03:33.510> ran<00:03:33.990> away<00:03:34.140> from

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
Lindsay Lohan who ran away from

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.280 
Lindsay Lohan who ran away from
paparazzi<00:03:35.190> or<00:03:35.430> was<00:03:35.760> driving<00:03:36.270> crazy<00:03:36.660> all<00:03:37.020> over

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
paparazzi or was driving crazy all over

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.120 
paparazzi or was driving crazy all over
Los<00:03:37.470> Angeles

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
Los Angeles

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.190 
Los Angeles
we<00:03:38.340> took<00:03:38.550> that<00:03:38.760> story<00:03:39.209> from<00:03:39.420> public<00:03:39.840> record

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
we took that story from public record

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.470 
we took that story from public record
change<00:03:40.770> the<00:03:41.040> name<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.489> identity<00:03:42.270> of<00:03:42.360> the

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
change the name and identity of the

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.510 
change the name and identity of the
person<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.260> we're<00:03:43.650> completely<00:03:43.890> in<00:03:44.190> deafness

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
person so we're completely in deafness

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.920 
person so we're completely in deafness
but<00:03:44.610> I<00:03:44.670> guess<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.270> difference<00:03:45.420> would<00:03:45.720> be<00:03:45.840> if

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
but I guess the difference would be if

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.120 
but I guess the difference would be if
it's<00:03:46.080> if<00:03:46.230> it's<00:03:46.380> helping<00:03:46.650> sell<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:46.950> games

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
it's if it's helping sell the games

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.520
