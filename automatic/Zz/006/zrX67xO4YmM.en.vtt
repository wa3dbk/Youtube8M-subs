00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.169
 hi how about my name jesus today 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.609
 we are doing some airbrushing 

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:08.380
 because for me it is not so professional but 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.090
 is shown as an amateur since 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.090
 I'm just starting on this but let's go 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.660
 to explain what I could extend me 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.280
 count during 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.790
 a little time that I carry in this 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.930
 we have made a template we use 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.250
 paper 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.880
 it's a simple pill 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.460
 it has already turned black nothing more 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.029
 indicating not to get lost during the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.680
 drawing 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.110
 let's apply white we are seeing 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.309
 what white color before was a 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.379
 black color background well done a little 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.110
 white very far away and then a little bit of 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.030
 blue at a time just dries to notice 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.780
 this when what we are going to do next 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.780
 so it does not look 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.500
 so you do not see this 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.559
 the marks of the template and that we're going to 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.039
 start making our parts more 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.039
 clear of the drawing 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.990
 let's go with what we see does 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.840
 well here if not all the only 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:41.469
 we are doing is to mark 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.840
 the lights of the drawing is not not something is not 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:47.520
 we are detailing we are still only 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.520
 indicating the clarity of the drawing 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.899
 here it does not matter that the 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.520
 line of the template at the end of accounts 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.520
 we do not want so much that you notice 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.510
 a drawing 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.210
 in fact this drawing is not so 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.220
 complicated can also be done by hand 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.710
 raised what we are good here what 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.120
 I am practicing right now is the use 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.410
 of some 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.420
 templates and that 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.750
 it takes us as tools and serves 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.750
 much 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:52.430
 Well, look, I got it, it happened 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.900
 the white color should not generate a 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.940
 problem do not feel worried anymore 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.890
 that this just barely starts 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.170
 and what happens is that a line or a 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.190
 suddenly one 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.790
 not by hand nothing happens to me 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.300
 we still do not go into detail but I 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.300
 reforms 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.860
 well, we have 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.740
 now I'm going to use a template that 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:05.620
 it says the same but these templates already 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.360
 they sell them and you can find them in 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.460
 in stationery stores that are dedicated to this 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.320
 orography 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.180
 Of course there's nothing like making one 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.250
 but nevertheless the material of 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.030
 those that are originally made is a 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.180
 thinner material but nevertheless 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.250
 it serves 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.470
 that will serve will serve more than anything 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.560
 to do a little bit of effect without so many 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.560
 problems 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.660
 do not 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.250
 The advantage of these templates is that they do not 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.830
 it does not matter if they already did not come back 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.840
 to put there he continues to do his job no 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.580
 it affects so much 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.680
 International to give a little 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:58.490
 happiness 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.490
 they are not so quiet 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.250
 good the total that for example a 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.480
 space I want to put some shoulder something 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.210
 I can do 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.260
 s of clarity so that more a great 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.260
 appetizer as of all 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.060
 this would be more than anything for itself in the 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.800
 spaces 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.340
 the universe if that looks good I'm 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.340
 10 years 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:49.439
 good we continue 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.830
 well here if it has not happened that it 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.170
 is losing the contour line not 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.700
 there's a problem in this, we just go back to 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.400
 the same thing we're just getting into 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.409
 put details and that's no problem 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.449
 that is lost 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:11.219
 and it can not generate any problem 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:11.219
 can scare urgently 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.530
 something else we do not
