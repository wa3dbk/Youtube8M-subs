00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
hair so then what I'm going to do is

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.660 
hair so then what I'm going to do is
just<00:03:18.020> kind<00:03:18.200> of<00:03:18.320> smoothing<00:03:18.890> it<00:03:19.010> out<00:03:19.190> on<00:03:19.490> the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
just kind of smoothing it out on the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.920 
just kind of smoothing it out on the
edges<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.710> then<00:03:21.710> make<00:03:21.950> a<00:03:22.160> very<00:03:22.640> very<00:03:23.180> small

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
edges and then make a very very small

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.310 
edges and then make a very very small
little<00:03:24.650> messy<00:03:25.430> bun<00:03:25.700> I'm<00:03:26.600> just<00:03:26.810> wrapping<00:03:27.050> it

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
little messy bun I'm just wrapping it

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.920 
little messy bun I'm just wrapping it
around<00:03:27.350> my<00:03:27.680> hand<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.250> then<00:03:28.790> I'm<00:03:28.910> going<00:03:29.210> to<00:03:29.270> pin

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
around my hand and then I'm going to pin

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.870 
around my hand and then I'm going to pin
it<00:03:29.960> right<00:03:30.350> in<00:03:30.620> place<00:03:30.890> I<00:03:31.070> think<00:03:31.460> this<00:03:31.580> kind<00:03:31.820> of

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
it right in place I think this kind of

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.490 
it right in place I think this kind of
looks<00:03:32.060> cuter<00:03:32.390> with<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.630> smaller<00:03:32.930> buns<00:03:33.230> like

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
looks cuter with the smaller buns like

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.020 
looks cuter with the smaller buns like
in<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.740> picture<00:03:34.100> but<00:03:34.220> you<00:03:34.340> could<00:03:34.490> also<00:03:34.640> make

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
in the picture but you could also make

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.000 
in the picture but you could also make
these<00:03:35.210> big<00:03:35.570> just<00:03:36.110> kind<00:03:36.290> of<00:03:36.320> do<00:03:36.470> whatever<00:03:36.620> you

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
these big just kind of do whatever you

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.370 
these big just kind of do whatever you
want<00:03:37.250> with<00:03:37.340> them<00:03:40.540> so<00:03:41.540> again<00:03:41.840> I'm<00:03:42.110> just<00:03:42.230> going

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
to kind of smooth out the edges I'm just

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.980
