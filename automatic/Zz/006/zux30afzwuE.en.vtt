 hi to all these beings mistakenly 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.750
 to be today we find ourselves for 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.900
 a little video installation of a 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.500
 fashion on sky nothing so it's about the lady 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.830
 body this mode is to make more 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.109
 beautiful women in the game as you 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.090
 can see it on the screen 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:25.080
 so I want to show you how 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.789
 install it on a cracked version of 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.260
 game but you can do it received a 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.020
 normal version so once you 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.700
 have downloaded presents itself under a 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:44.840
 display to that you can do but 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:50.360
 you do not care you go to the 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:52.920
 data file if he wants to suffer 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.699
 excuse me I have some small bugs 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.930
 with hand smiles nothing very naughty and 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.830
 you can drag and drop 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.260
 in the data file of your 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.860
 installation you will visit 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.150
 your game folder then in data then 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.420
 you will drag these files 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.909
 a class to be extricated one expects from 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.330
 I already installed it so it goes 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.680
 surely ask me to replace them 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.680
 what is likely 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.550
 our classes at school 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.330
 as I told you he asked me 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.330
 to replace them 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.920
 then what you can do to 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:02:00.259
 check that the mode is well and truly 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:05.479
 installed at you can launch your 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:07.850
 mancha you can go into your 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.640
 data files or data file if you 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.320
 crack it like me and there you 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.270
 see that the mode is installed so 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.400

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.540
