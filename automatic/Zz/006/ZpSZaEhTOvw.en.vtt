just trying to keep the helicopter
within<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.950> 6<00:01:56.340> foot<00:01:56.549> or<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.909> square<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.540> airspace

now<00:01:58.619> here's<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.890> test<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.310> one<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.640> go

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
now here's a test of one of the go

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.030 
now here's a test of one of the go
forward<00:02:00.390> buttons<00:02:00.689> here<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.320> start<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.829> and

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
forward buttons here I start it and

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.880 
forward buttons here I start it and
there<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.579> let<00:02:02.790> go<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.210> now<00:02:03.960> I'm<00:02:04.259> just<00:02:04.619> trying

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
there I let go and now I'm just trying

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.649 
there I let go and now I'm just trying
to<00:02:04.920> keep<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.189> under<00:02:05.340> control<00:02:05.790> again<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.479> see

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
to keep it under control again you see

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.449 
to keep it under control again you see
it<00:02:06.689> kind<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.049> goes<00:02:07.229> forward<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.890> then<00:02:08.129> wants

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
it kind of goes forward and then wants

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.609 
it kind of goes forward and then wants
to<00:02:08.640> come<00:02:08.819> back<00:02:09.060> again<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.959> almost<00:02:10.140> acts<00:02:10.379> like

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
to come back again it almost acts like

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.170 
to come back again it almost acts like
it's<00:02:10.830> hanging<00:02:11.220> from<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.520> string<00:02:11.580> on<00:02:12.060> the

it's hanging from a string on the
ceiling<00:02:12.599> and<00:02:12.810> just<00:02:12.840> being

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
ceiling and just being

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.770 
ceiling and just being
around<00:02:13.860> by<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.160> wind<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.880> not<00:02:15.060> really<00:02:15.540> under

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
around by the wind it's not really under

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.490 
around by the wind it's not really under
my<00:02:15.900> control

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500

here's<00:02:16.800> another<00:02:17.100> attempt<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.520> go<00:02:17.640> forward

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
here's another attempt to go forward

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.570 
here's another attempt to go forward
there<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.630> goes<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:18.870> there<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:19.980> comes<00:02:20.190> back

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
there it goes and there it comes back

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
there it goes and there it comes back
hmm

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
hmm
