00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.580
 the so-called third molar is the last 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.550
 tooth that appears in the human being to 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.099
 the 18 years for what is known as 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.919
 wisdom tooth assuming that too 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.740
 at that age a certain sensibility is reached 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:27.050
 often such molars are lacking 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.390
 of space to erupt staying 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.880
 retained and originating numerous 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.370
 problems what makes your precise 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.769
 extraction between the problems 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.920
 frequent serious infections 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:42.170
 of the tissue surrounding your crown and cysts 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.530
 of asymptomatic growth that can 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.469
 reach a large size third parties 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.480
 retained lower molars exert a 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.930
 push that can favor the 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.090
 crowding of the rest of the denture 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.370
 the upper third molars can 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.980
 cause a destructive caries in the 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.469
 molar adjacent to part of processes 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.270
 peronal coronal and tish 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.539
 it is usual for the four third parties 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.759
 molars present a bad position for 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:12.550
 it is most convenient to extract 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.680
 of the four in a single surgical act 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.930
 low 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.030
 this is already local what can be 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.480
 done in less than an hour and without 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.970
 pain or unpleasant sensations the 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.280
 extraction of the third molars is 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.770
 completely different to the extraction 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.229
 of any other tooth since 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.619
 generally involves making a 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.540
 surgical approach but performed by 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.270
 professionals with enough 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.880
 experience that will make a delicate 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.180
 and precise surgery does not involve suffering 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.520
 some this surgical precision will lead 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.100
 rigged an almost an apparent 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.100
 Discomfort-free postoperative
