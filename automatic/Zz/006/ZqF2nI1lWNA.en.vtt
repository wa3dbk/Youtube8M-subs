00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.580 
to the frame right down there and that's
also<00:01:16.740> where<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:16.950> lift<00:01:17.340> cylinders<00:01:17.820> anchored

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
also where the lift cylinders anchored

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
have room to really put it anywhere else

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.830 
have room to really put it anywhere else
it's<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.710> small<00:01:26.420> homemade<00:01:27.420> loader

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.310 

we've<00:01:30.840> got<00:01:32.360> uprights<00:01:33.360> here<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:36.840> can<00:01:36.990> see<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
we've got uprights here you can see the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.070 
we've got uprights here you can see the
lifts<00:01:37.620> on<00:01:37.740> there<00:01:37.950> right<00:01:38.100> there<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.750> had<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.780> make

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
lifts on there right there I had to make

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.790 
lifts on there right there I had to make
up<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:41.180> we<00:01:42.180> put<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.570> down<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.870> little<00:01:43.200> bit<00:01:43.410> you<00:01:43.620> can

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
up a we put it down a little bit you can

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.580 
up a we put it down a little bit you can
see<00:01:43.830> as<00:01:44.160> this<00:01:44.310> goes<00:01:44.550> down<00:01:44.850> there's<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:46.080> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
see as this goes down there's a that the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.220 
see as this goes down there's a that the
tilt<00:01:46.860> cylinder<00:01:47.400> is<00:01:47.550> in<00:01:47.760> there<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.450> I've<00:01:48.930> made

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
tilt cylinder is in there and I've made

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.770 
tilt cylinder is in there and I've made
up<00:01:49.440> a<00:01:52.670> know<00:01:53.670> if<00:01:53.729> it'll<00:01:53.940> till<00:01:54.240> that's<00:01:54.510> pretty

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
up a know if it'll till that's pretty

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.810 
up a know if it'll till that's pretty
cold<00:01:55.050> out<00:01:56.030> not<00:01:57.030> tilting<00:01:57.479> very<00:01:57.720> fast<00:01:58.820> but

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
cold out not tilting very fast but

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.920 
cold out not tilting very fast but
anyway<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.570> cylinder<00:02:00.930> tilts<00:02:01.470> it<00:02:01.650> and<00:02:02.930> lower

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
anyway that cylinder tilts it and lower

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.719 
anyway that cylinder tilts it and lower
it<00:02:04.170> down<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:04.740> maybe<00:02:05.070> see<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.550> a<00:02:05.610> little

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
it down you can maybe see it a little

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.169 
it down you can maybe see it a little
bit<00:02:05.970> better<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.920> there's<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.310> mechanism<00:02:08.580> I

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
bit better and there's a mechanism I

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.740 
bit better and there's a mechanism I
made<00:02:09.540> up<00:02:09.780> at<00:02:09.990> pivots<00:02:10.890> right<00:02:11.100> here<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:12.420> it

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
made up at pivots right here and it

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.530 
made up at pivots right here and it
pushes<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.110> bucket<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.709> tilts<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:15.030> this

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
pushes the bucket and tilts it and this

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.510 
pushes the bucket and tilts it and this
little<00:02:15.870> cylinder<00:02:16.110> right<00:02:16.440> in<00:02:16.650> back<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:17.190> there

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
little cylinder right in back in there

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.150 
little cylinder right in back in there
it's<00:02:18.300> not<00:02:18.420> Center<00:02:19.380> because<00:02:19.590> that's<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:20.040> only

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
it's not Center because that's the only

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.530 
it's not Center because that's the only
place<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.610> had<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.940> put<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.680> right<00:02:22.680> there<00:02:23.540> that

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
place I had to put it right there that

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.240 
place I had to put it right there that
tilts<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.050> bucket<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.590> little<00:02:25.920> cylinder

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
tilts the bucket that little cylinder

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.090 
tilts the bucket that little cylinder
and<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.840> course<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.140> big<00:02:28.320> cylinder<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.890> right

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
and of course the big cylinder is right

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.240 
and of course the big cylinder is right
here<00:02:29.480> man<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.690> didn't<00:02:30.900> make<00:02:30.989> up<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.410> make<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.130> up

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
here man I didn't make up a make it up

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.250 
here man I didn't make up a make it up
special<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:32.940> lift<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:33.660> with<00:02:33.959> everything

it's on the mini sneaker and I've had
inquiries<00:04:37.180> people<00:04:37.600> want<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.930> see<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:38.230> loader

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
inquiries people want to see the loader

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.790 
inquiries people want to see the loader
so<00:04:39.270> it's<00:04:40.270> a<00:04:40.450> simple<00:04:40.720> thing<00:04:41.110> it's<00:04:41.320> just<00:04:41.410> stab

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
so it's a simple thing it's just stab

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.370 
down the front and you have to have some
diagonals<00:04:44.800> here<00:04:45.540> for<00:04:46.540> bracing<00:04:47.020> that<00:04:47.169> goes

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
diagonals here for bracing that goes

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.220 
diagonals here for bracing that goes
down<00:04:47.620> to<00:04:47.800> a<00:04:47.830> heavy<00:04:48.100> this<00:04:48.540> frame<00:04:49.540> on<00:04:49.780> this<00:04:49.960> mini

down to a heavy this frame on this mini

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.540 
down to a heavy this frame on this mini
sneaker<00:04:50.740> is<00:04:50.890> pretty<00:04:51.160> heavy

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
sneaker is pretty heavy

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.330 
sneaker is pretty heavy
it's<00:04:51.730> press<00:04:52.060> quarter-inch<00:04:52.800> they<00:04:53.800> formed<00:04:54.220> it

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
it's press quarter-inch they formed it

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.070 
it's press quarter-inch they formed it
that's<00:04:54.520> quarter-inch<00:04:55.060> piece<00:04:55.330> that's<00:04:55.630> formed

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
is a solid stock quarter-inch and you

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.990 
is a solid stock quarter-inch and you
can<00:05:10.180> lay<00:05:10.390> it<00:05:10.510> out<00:05:10.630> on<00:05:10.690> paper<00:05:11.200> and<00:05:11.880> it's<00:05:12.880> a

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
can lay it out on paper and it's a

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.909 
can lay it out on paper and it's a
compact<00:05:13.510> little<00:05:13.750> lower<00:05:14.020> it<00:05:14.290> doesn't<00:05:14.590> take<00:05:14.740> up

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
compact little lower it doesn't take up

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:19.080 
compact little lower it doesn't take up
too<00:05:15.070> much<00:05:15.100> room<00:05:16.950> and<00:05:17.950> of<00:05:18.490> course<00:05:18.760> it<00:05:18.880> won't

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
too much room and of course it won't

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.030 
too much room and of course it won't
load<00:05:19.240> a<00:05:19.300> dump<00:05:19.600> truck<00:05:19.780> but<00:05:20.169> it<00:05:20.320> does<00:05:20.530> go<00:05:20.680> up<00:05:20.830> high

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
load a dump truck but it does go up high

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.690 
load a dump truck but it does go up high
enough<00:05:21.310> for<00:05:21.550> around<00:05:22.030> the<00:05:22.240> yard<00:05:22.450> and<00:05:23.340> that's<00:05:24.340> it

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
enough for around the yard and that's it

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.250 
enough for around the yard and that's it
it's<00:05:26.700> nothing<00:05:27.700> too<00:05:28.000> much<00:05:28.180> more<00:05:28.479> to<00:05:28.570> say<00:05:28.780> I<00:05:28.810> run

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
it's nothing too much more to say I run

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.090 
it's nothing too much more to say I run
it<00:05:29.410> off<00:05:29.530> from<00:05:29.680> the

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
it off from the

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.370 
it off from the
off<00:05:30.190> like<00:05:30.400> this<00:05:31.740> to<00:05:32.740> spool<00:05:33.160> valve<00:05:33.990> runs<00:05:34.990> it<00:05:35.230> and

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
off like this to spool valve runs it and

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.000 
off like this to spool valve runs it and
that's<00:05:35.500> just<00:05:35.680> in<00:05:36.280> series<00:05:36.820> with<00:05:37.120> the<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:38.830> two

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
that's just in series with the the two

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.040 
that's just in series with the the two
spool<00:05:39.370> valve<00:05:39.490> over<00:05:40.000> there<00:05:40.180> that<00:05:40.390> steers<00:05:40.780> it

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
spool valve over there that steers it

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
spool valve over there that steers it
and<00:05:41.230> is<00:05:41.380> forward<00:05:42.250> and<00:05:42.310> reverse<00:05:43.530> so<00:05:44.530> it's<00:05:44.830> not<00:05:45.010> a

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
and is forward and reverse so it's not a

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.870 
and is forward and reverse so it's not a
real<00:05:46.410> complicated<00:05:47.410> deal<00:05:47.980> I'll<00:05:48.250> go<00:05:48.490> over<00:05:48.580> this

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
real complicated deal I'll go over this

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.670 
real complicated deal I'll go over this
again<00:05:48.940> a<00:05:49.240> little<00:05:49.630> bit<00:05:49.840> the<00:05:52.530> cylinder<00:05:53.530> that

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
again a little bit the cylinder that

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.260 
again a little bit the cylinder that
steers<00:05:54.010> it's<00:05:54.250> down<00:05:54.460> there<00:05:54.760> I've<00:05:55.030> gone<00:05:55.210> over

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
steers it's down there I've gone over

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.620 
steers it's down there I've gone over
this<00:05:55.720> on<00:05:55.930> another<00:05:56.170> video<00:05:56.380> but<00:05:56.860> and<00:05:57.630> there's

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
this on another video but and there's

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.260 
this on another video but and there's
the<00:05:58.810> oil<00:05:58.840> tank<00:05:59.320> for<00:05:59.650> it<00:05:59.830> and<00:06:00.010> the<00:06:00.580> pump<00:06:00.880> is<00:06:01.090> that

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
the oil tank for it and the pump is that

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.660 
the oil tank for it and the pump is that
red<00:06:01.510> thing<00:06:01.540> down<00:06:01.990> there<00:06:02.290> and<00:06:02.620> there's<00:06:03.610> a

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.670 
red thing down there and there's a

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.700 
red thing down there and there's a
hydraulic<00:06:04.360> motor<00:06:04.570> right<00:06:04.990> there<00:06:05.230> that<00:06:05.440> runs

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
hydraulic motor right there that runs

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.880 
hydraulic motor right there that runs
the<00:06:05.920> whole<00:06:06.210> transport<00:06:07.210> mechanism<00:06:07.930> then

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
the whole transport mechanism then

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.510 
the whole transport mechanism then
that's<00:06:09.100> about<00:06:09.370> it<00:06:09.670> and<00:06:09.940> then<00:06:10.270> then<00:06:10.480> the<00:06:10.720> loader

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
that's about it and then then the loader

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.210 
that's about it and then then the loader
so<00:06:12.520> that's<00:06:12.760> it<00:06:13.000> I<00:06:13.650> hope<00:06:14.650> you<00:06:14.800> got<00:06:14.950> something

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
so that's it I hope you got something

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.700 
so that's it I hope you got something
out<00:06:15.370> of<00:06:15.430> this<00:06:15.780> you<00:06:16.780> just<00:06:16.900> got<00:06:17.110> to<00:06:17.230> lay<00:06:17.530> it<00:06:17.590> out

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
out of this you just got to lay it out

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.650 
out of this you just got to lay it out
on<00:06:17.770> paper<00:06:18.190> first<00:06:18.610> figure<00:06:19.030> out<00:06:19.150> what<00:06:19.360> how

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
on paper first figure out what how

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.510 
on paper first figure out what how
you're<00:06:19.840> going<00:06:19.930> to<00:06:19.990> hook<00:06:20.170> it<00:06:20.290> on<00:06:20.470> it's<00:06:21.100> anchored

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
you're going to hook it on it's anchored

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.830 
you're going to hook it on it's anchored
solid<00:06:22.000> on<00:06:22.150> the<00:06:22.270> bottom<00:06:22.710> down<00:06:23.710> there<00:06:23.770> to<00:06:24.190> that

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
solid on the bottom down there to that

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.360 
solid on the bottom down there to that
press<00:06:25.840> quarter-inch<00:06:26.410> frame<00:06:26.770> that's<00:06:27.010> on<00:06:27.190> this

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
press quarter-inch frame that's on this

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.970 
press quarter-inch frame that's on this
mini<00:06:27.640> sneaker<00:06:28.500> so<00:06:29.500> it's<00:06:29.770> on<00:06:29.950> pretty<00:06:30.250> solid<00:06:30.490> I

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:31.980 
mini sneaker so it's on pretty solid I

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.500 
mini sneaker so it's on pretty solid I
will<00:06:32.980> see<00:06:33.220> how<00:06:33.370> it<00:06:33.490> works<00:06:33.640> out<00:06:33.880> but<00:06:34.120> it's<00:06:34.300> just

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510 
will see how it works out but it's just

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:38.760 
will see how it works out but it's just
late<00:06:34.750> duty<00:06:35.490> that's<00:06:36.490> it
