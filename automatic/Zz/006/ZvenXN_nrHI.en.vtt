00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
six gallons by the way we did designed

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.110 
six gallons by the way we did designed
it<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.379> like<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:44.100> fort<00:00:44.340> time<00:00:44.550> but<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.940> is

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
it for like the fort time but this is

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.090 
it for like the fort time but this is
what<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.649> we<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:47.129> satisfied<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:49.170> put<00:00:50.070> a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
what we we we satisfied so we put a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.810 
what we we we satisfied so we put a
castle<00:00:50.640> there<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.210> can't<00:00:51.989> resist<00:00:52.530> putting<00:00:53.399> not

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
castle there I can't resist putting not

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.299 
castle there I can't resist putting not
some<00:00:54.480> little<00:00:54.780> design<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.770> took<00:00:55.890> away<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
some little design so it took away the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.670 
some little design so it took away the
natural<00:00:56.789> look<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.539> think<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.140> okay

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
natural look but I think it's okay

couple more weeks and we'll take care of
these<00:02:39.170> fishes<00:02:39.590> but<00:02:40.060> honestly<00:02:41.060> it's<00:02:41.420> really

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
these fishes but honestly it's really

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:42.699 
these fishes but honestly it's really
cool<00:02:42.170> looking

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
cool looking

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.809 
cool looking
I<00:02:42.739> think<00:02:43.250> our<00:02:43.790> fish<00:02:44.090> tank<00:02:44.329> is<00:02:44.599> complete<00:02:45.819> that

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
I think our fish tank is complete that

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.150 
I think our fish tank is complete that
one<00:02:47.000> over<00:02:47.239> there<00:02:47.360> is<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:47.510> real<00:02:47.780> plant<00:02:48.110> but<00:02:48.590> we'll

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
one over there is a real plant but we'll

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.240 
one over there is a real plant but we'll
get<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.400> better<00:02:49.579> one<00:02:49.940> maybe<00:02:50.180> later<00:02:50.930> on<00:02:51.040> so<00:02:52.040> this

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
get a better one maybe later on so this

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.229 
get a better one maybe later on so this
is<00:02:52.430> our<00:02:52.610> final<00:02:53.049> final<00:02:54.049> design<00:02:54.590> if<00:02:55.069> we<00:02:55.940> change

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
is our final final design if we change

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.240 
is our final final design if we change
it<00:02:56.390> maybe<00:02:56.840> we'll<00:02:57.079> put<00:02:57.319> more<00:02:57.530> rocks<00:02:57.799> make<00:02:58.129> it

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
it maybe we'll put more rocks make it

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.650 
it maybe we'll put more rocks make it
more<00:02:58.870> caves<00:02:59.870> for<00:03:00.200> them<00:03:00.349> but<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.579> think<00:03:02.209> we're

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
more caves for them but I think we're

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.270 
more caves for them but I think we're
really<00:03:02.900> good<00:03:03.230> at<00:03:03.260> it

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
really good at it

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.180 
really good at it
