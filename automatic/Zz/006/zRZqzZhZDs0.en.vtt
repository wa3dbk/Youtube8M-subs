the big picture and you know as we check
it<00:00:03.720> out<00:00:03.840> across<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.470> country<00:00:05.040> we<00:00:05.520> are

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:12.890 
weather and as we zero in you can see
some<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.759> these<00:00:11.880> areas<00:00:12.240> are<00:00:12.540> going<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.750> get

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
some of these areas are going to get

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.870 
some of these areas are going to get
soaked<00:00:13.230> today<00:00:13.500> with<00:00:14.160> some<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.490> rainfall

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
soaked today with some of the rainfall

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.580 
soaked today with some of the rainfall
and<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.150> will<00:00:15.240> be<00:00:15.330> continuing<00:00:15.990> tonight<00:00:16.170> for

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
and that will be continuing tonight for

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.170 
and that will be continuing tonight for
some<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.279> gradually<00:00:17.820> spreading

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
some of you and gradually spreading

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.929 
some of you and gradually spreading
eastward<00:00:18.619> behind<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.980> what<00:00:20.490> this<00:00:20.699> trough

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
eastward behind it what this trough

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.179 
eastward behind it what this trough
indicates<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.810> us<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.529> it's<00:00:22.830> pulling

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
indicates to us is that it's pulling

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.950 
indicates to us is that it's pulling
down<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.640> cooler<00:00:23.910> air<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.449> that's<00:00:24.689> where

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
down that cooler air so that's where

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.839 
down that cooler air so that's where
we're<00:00:25.050> going<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.230> find<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.470> cold<00:00:25.740> air<00:00:25.980> but<00:00:26.670> as

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
we're going to find the cold air but as

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.790 
we're going to find the cold air but as
the<00:00:27.119> system<00:00:27.390> swings<00:00:27.900> eastwards<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.619> will<00:00:28.769> that

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
the system swings eastwards so will that

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.189 
the system swings eastwards so will that
cooler<00:00:29.400> air<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.449> lot<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.929> are<00:00:30.990> going

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
cooler air and so a lot of you are going

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.200 
cooler air and so a lot of you are going
to<00:00:31.289> find<00:00:31.439> your<00:00:31.619> temperatures<00:00:32.160> changing<00:00:33.030> as<00:00:33.180> we

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
to find your temperatures changing as we

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.660 
to find your temperatures changing as we
go<00:00:33.750> through<00:00:34.020> time<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.890> meantime<00:00:35.160> that

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
go through time and in the meantime that

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.270 
go through time and in the meantime that
transition<00:00:36.510> will<00:00:36.899> mean<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.469> we<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:37.890> areas

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
transition will mean that we have areas

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.030 
transition will mean that we have areas
of<00:00:38.610> rain<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.239> even<00:00:39.540> for<00:00:39.989> some<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
of rain and even for some of you on the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.130 
of rain and even for some of you on the
northern<00:00:41.489> tier<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:42.210> we're<00:00:42.660> talking<00:00:43.050> about

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
northern tier here we're talking about

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.560 
northern tier here we're talking about
some<00:00:43.410> snow<00:00:43.770> either<00:00:44.010> mixing<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.850> or<00:00:45.030> changing

ultimately out ahead of our next system

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.230 
ultimately out ahead of our next system
will<00:02:01.770> see<00:02:01.950> some<00:02:02.130> warmer<00:02:02.490> temperatures<00:02:03.000> coming
