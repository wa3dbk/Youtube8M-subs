00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 good video review of this clamp 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.580
 of the manfrotto we go to see immediately 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.309
 the acronym here it is this the initials e 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.980
 this is the settino mall this is the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.850
 little box the solution is called 386 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:22.010
 bike then we see it here as a 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:26.130
 half-inch and 13-octave attack 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.439
 from 13 octaves and let's see how 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.250
 it works is very similar to this one 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.270
 I already had that Chinese but does it 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.130
 his work himself 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.530
 this assisted this way 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.370
 Chinese attacks on any surface a 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.300
 two holes one small one the middle one 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.670
 a 13- inch large thumb and a 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.640
 male male let's see which ones 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.800
 take the moment off for a moment 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.680
 cars 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.600
 the given this approach and let's go to 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.809
 see the band always in case we have to 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.559
 attack a big thing and a male 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.830
 great here a smaller male than here 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.630
 if we go instead we need to attack 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.500
 the female we transform with this 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.119
 adapter or in small attack can 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.439
 attacking him here in a big attack 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.299
 let us take the example that there would not be 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.009
 great attack because instead of 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.759
 camera directly not 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.880
 we want to stick a butt in 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:31.439
 test the photographs then start again 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.840
 right is fine I hold and see how it is 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.350
 we can easily put ours 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.880
 camera up on the railing 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.900
 on any rigid metal support 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.960
 then let's go into this 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.000
 single way the interesting thing is here 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.920
 there is this button with the small button 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.600
 if we also have little maneuverability 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.150
 we can stay in the area because 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.760
 pressing we move forward and then we are 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.490
 back the materials according to manfrotto 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.840
 they are all very resistant 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.060
 how many very good 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.680
 we see that above a support that 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.880
 give me maybe this case put it is done 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.100
 and horizontal 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.959
 we can safely 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.040
 reassemble and mount a head 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.000
 We are going to drink again 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.040
 hold it ok let's take an example that yes 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.830
 squeezes back 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:27.590
 I tighten my syringe and I go to loosen up here and there 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.220
 we see that it has all the rigidity 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.530
 necessary to support to support 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.170
 a camera also of those 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.790
 of the heavy ones 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.590
 for what concerns migrations 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.770
 Chinese will be there 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.630
 in short, this network will do a little 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.630
 all brands tana moussa is what's here 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.390
 c if we are going to remove it, but the 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.489
 material on a little less powerful sees into 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.250
 this case by squeezing I used vendor 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.680
 several times also the arrival of power plant a 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.230
 I'm saying loud though even in 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.549
 this case if the poem is centered 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.350
 when it grabs grappa maybe it's okay not 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.250
 I know if this video wanted to be served 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.620
 to something 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.329
 to discover a gadget that you didn't know 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.140
 televideo ride here is this round to empty 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:17.380
 here it was as long as I had to use macerated 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.030
 for digging this is running empty 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.950
 and it's the Chinese one 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.420
 here he has already have it well 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.220
 fixed with glue 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.829
 so that's why they say it's not good 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.820
 nothing here is what Chinese that 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.070
 Chinese 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.950
 when he squeezed he held tight but he did 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.690
 stopped having squeezed but 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.430
 if anything I throw it takes another thing 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.910
 but no but I will never think of throwing it because 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:45.470
 bye bye to manfrotto instead 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.690
 and good here I was not remembering what 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.370
 but there was something this sense that 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.400
 it is not right that he had convinced me then to 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:58.310
 buy prof 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:04:02.480
 I read the abbreviation 386 b black champ for tube 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:05.900
 for attacked by doubts 13 35 mm is there 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.630
 wrote what you see getting hurt 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.280
 on reading the sentence if the video that 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.280
 served as something put your thumbs up
