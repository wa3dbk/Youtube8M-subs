00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello today we are going to prepare a delicious milkshake 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.500
 satiating chia seeds and yogurt 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.719
 I will also teach you the basic recipe 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.120
 Chia pudding you'll see what so 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.280
 simple the chia seeds have been 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.379
 one of the latest additions to the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.600
 list of ingredients allowed in the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.090
 Dukan diet are rich in vitamins and 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.430
 Easy to digest minerals have 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.650
 a lot of fiber and can absorb up 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.170
 12 times its weight in water so 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.269
 improve intestinal transit and have 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.700
 satiating effect especially when it 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.410
 Take mixed with liquid half an hour 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.320
 before one of the main meals 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.750
 the daily ration of chia seeds is 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.629
 of 1 tablespoon per person per day 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.730
 only from the cruise phase onwards 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.219
 to make the satiating smoothie we're going to 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.260
 Mix a tablespoon of seeds 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.500
 of chia with four tablespoons of milk 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.530
 skimmed stir and let it sit 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.020
 at least for 15 minutes better even if 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.149
 we can let it sit for a few 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.090
 hours saved in the fridge in this other 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.070
 glass I have seeds that mixes some 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.620
 5 hours at the time of desire 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.409
 now the seeds are very soft 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.229
 they have formed a thick gel you see 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.110
 we add a skimmed yogurt without sugar 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.720
 natural or flavors as you like 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.479
 like today in a lot of heat and I feel like 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.400
 something very cool what I've done is put 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.220
 the yogurt in the freezer from the time 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.770
 of breakfast this way the yogurt is 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.960
 ice cream but still creamy and my smoothie 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.810
 satiating will have the consistency of a 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.520
 delicious smoothie crushes using 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.000
 a blender until you have a mixture 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.590
 creamy my blender is not very powerful and 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.350
 the seeds do not disappear completely 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.990
 but even so it has a very texture 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.060
 nice in addition to the smoothie the second 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.180
 proposal that I make today is this 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.670
 chia pudding a rich and silky cream 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.410
 what is achieved is simply mixing 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.630
 Chia seeds with one or two 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.270
 yogurts and keeping the mixture in the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.820
 refrigerator for at least eight hours or 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.039
 better yet for a whole other night 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.350
 simple and delicious way to take advantage 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.690
