00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
first step which will enable to really

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.020 
first step which will enable to really

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.110 
systems in the world it's not only for
Europe<00:04:06.269> it's<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.319> world<00:04:07.560> program<00:04:08.099> that<00:04:08.340> we<00:04:08.970> do

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
Europe it's a world program that we do

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.020 
Europe it's a world program that we do
today<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.799> it's<00:04:10.799> an<00:04:11.130> extremely<00:04:11.580> important

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
today and it's an extremely important

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.110 
today and it's an extremely important
step<00:04:12.120> for<00:04:12.540> our<00:04:12.569> community<00:04:13.290> living<00:04:13.590> i<00:04:13.940> fully<00:04:14.940> is

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
step for our community living i fully is

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.879 
step for our community living i fully is
a<00:04:15.150> complex<00:04:15.569> arrangements<00:04:16.290> where<00:04:16.440> there<00:04:16.650> the

the<00:04:19.979> airport's<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.489> industry<00:04:21.000> need<00:04:21.570> to

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
the airport's the industry need to

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.270 
the airport's the industry need to
interact<00:04:21.959> which<00:04:22.320> is<00:04:22.440> exactly<00:04:22.889> what<00:04:23.070> we<00:04:23.160> do

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
interact which is exactly what we do

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.890 
interact which is exactly what we do
here<00:04:23.520> is<00:04:23.639> the<00:04:23.760> soaring<00:04:24.120> is<00:04:24.210> progress<00:04:24.540> with

here is the soaring is progress with
with<00:04:25.470> this<00:04:25.590> initiative<00:04:25.889> taking<00:04:26.550> here<00:04:26.880> I<00:04:26.910> will

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
with this initiative taking here I will

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.730 
with this initiative taking here I will
see<00:04:27.450> that<00:04:27.479> the<00:04:27.750> first<00:04:27.990> steps<00:04:28.229> will<00:04:28.440> be<00:04:28.470> taken

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
see that the first steps will be taken

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.480 
see that the first steps will be taken
in<00:04:29.490> real<00:04:29.669> life<00:04:29.850> in<00:04:30.090> 2018<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:31.169> then<00:04:31.830> gradually

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
in real life in 2018 and then gradually

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.990 
in real life in 2018 and then gradually
evolving<00:04:33.270> towards<00:04:33.860> full<00:04:34.860> use<00:04:35.040> of<00:04:35.070> 40<00:04:35.580> in<00:04:35.760> the
