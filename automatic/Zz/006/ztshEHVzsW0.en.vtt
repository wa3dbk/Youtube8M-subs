everything this is a super fast install
you<00:03:42.990> you<00:03:43.410> could<00:03:43.560> say<00:03:43.970> really<00:03:44.970> impressed<00:03:45.570> comes

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
you you could say really impressed comes

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.780 
you you could say really impressed comes
right<00:03:46.110> out<00:03:46.140> of<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.410> box<00:03:46.590> cut<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.250> couple<00:03:47.430> things

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
right out of the box cut a couple things

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:55.010 
right out of the box cut a couple things
and<00:03:48.120> it's<00:03:48.270> ready<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.600> go<00:03:51.410> so<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:53.690> piece<00:03:54.690> here

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
and it's ready to go so the piece here

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.790 
and it's ready to go so the piece here
that<00:03:55.050> is<00:03:55.320> broken<00:03:55.740> is<00:03:56.580> this<00:03:56.970> spool<00:03:57.360> holder

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
that is broken is this spool holder

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.610 
that is broken is this spool holder
inside<00:03:58.800> it<00:03:59.040> seems<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.550> have<00:03:59.730> a<00:04:00.860> honeycomb

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
inside it seems to have a honeycomb

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.930 
inside it seems to have a honeycomb
interior<00:04:04.620> for<00:04:04.890> strength<00:04:05.220> well<00:04:05.520> it<00:04:05.700> didn't

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
interior for strength well it didn't

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.820 
interior for strength well it didn't
work<00:04:06.090> out<00:04:06.209> taipei<00:04:06.660> so<00:04:07.070> that<00:04:08.070> might<00:04:08.280> be<00:04:08.310> cool<00:04:08.730> to

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
work out taipei so that might be cool to

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.170 
work out taipei so that might be cool to
put<00:04:10.830> that<00:04:11.010> somewhere<00:04:11.370> where<00:04:11.700> it<00:04:11.820> won't<00:04:11.880> get

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
put that somewhere where it won't get

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.690 
put that somewhere where it won't get
damaged<00:04:13.010> you<00:04:14.010> mentioned<00:04:14.430> it<00:04:14.490> just<00:04:14.520> clips<00:04:14.970> on

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
damaged you mentioned it just clips on

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:23.720 
damaged you mentioned it just clips on
and<00:04:17.700> i<00:04:17.880> won't<00:04:18.420> be<00:04:18.540> using<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:21.590> small<00:04:22.590> pla<00:04:23.520> that

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
and i won't be using the small pla that

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.210 
and i won't be using the small pla that
was<00:04:24.000> provided<00:04:25.370> no<00:04:26.750> school<00:04:27.750> of<00:04:28.080> pla<00:04:28.530> comes<00:04:28.950> with

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
was provided no school of pla comes with

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.760 
was provided no school of pla comes with
the<00:04:29.370> bots<00:04:29.690> you<00:04:30.690> must<00:04:30.960> buy<00:04:31.140> that<00:04:31.350> separately

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
the bots you must buy that separately

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.189 
the bots you must buy that separately
you<00:04:32.130> just<00:04:32.430> buy<00:04:32.640> the<00:04:32.730> printer<00:04:33.270> i<00:04:33.500> bought<00:04:34.500> some

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.129 

so<00:04:39.199> the<00:04:39.529> setup<00:04:40.039> is<00:04:40.159> pretty<00:04:40.339> simple<00:04:40.669> here

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
so the setup is pretty simple here

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.839 
so the setup is pretty simple here
Taipei<00:04:42.139> I<00:04:42.409> give<00:04:42.949> you<00:04:43.039> a<00:04:43.099> thumbs<00:04:43.279> up<00:04:43.520> for<00:04:43.729> this

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 
Taipei I give you a thumbs up for this

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.869 
Taipei I give you a thumbs up for this
idea<00:04:44.240> basically<00:04:44.870> just<00:04:45.529> going<00:04:45.770> to<00:04:45.830> go<00:04:46.009> on<00:04:46.339> to

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:46.879 
idea basically just going to go on to

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:49.570 
idea basically just going to go on to
the<00:04:47.150> spool<00:04:47.659> holder<00:04:47.930> and<00:04:48.379> then<00:04:49.249> a<00:04:49.279> piece<00:04:49.520> of

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
the spool holder and then a piece of

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.140 
the spool holder and then a piece of
filament<00:04:50.210> right<00:04:50.809> through<00:04:51.319> the<00:04:51.439> hole<00:04:52.029> into<00:04:53.029> the

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
filament right through the hole into the

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.600 
filament right through the hole into the
extruder<00:04:53.479> I<00:04:56.889> generally<00:04:57.889> always<00:04:58.129> clip<00:04:58.580> a

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
extruder I generally always clip a

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.459 
extruder I generally always clip a
little<00:04:58.939> bit<00:04:59.059> of<00:04:59.150> filament<00:04:59.569> up<00:04:59.719> whenever<00:05:00.020> I<00:05:00.229> put

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:00.469 
little bit of filament up whenever I put

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:06.129 
little bit of filament up whenever I put
it<00:05:00.589> into<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:00.860> extruder<00:05:04.809> pretty<00:05:05.809> simple

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
it into the extruder pretty simple

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:13.149 
it into the extruder pretty simple
design<00:05:06.669> and<00:05:07.669> it<00:05:07.939> works<00:05:10.659> ok<00:05:11.659> so<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.860> new<00:05:13.009> design

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:13.159 
design and it works ok so the new design

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:17.260 
design and it works ok so the new design
for<00:05:13.520> extrusion<00:05:13.999> filament<00:05:14.719> um<00:05:16.059> removing<00:05:17.059> and

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
for extrusion filament um removing and

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.999 
for extrusion filament um removing and
popping<00:05:18.050> in<00:05:18.169> is<00:05:18.319> really<00:05:18.469> cool<00:05:18.800> these<00:05:18.949> days

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:19.009 
popping in is really cool these days

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:24.189 
popping in is really cool these days
just<00:05:19.460> just<00:05:19.969> the<00:05:20.059> thumb<00:05:20.389> push<00:05:22.930> so<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:24.050> whole

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
just just the thumb push so the whole

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.409 
just just the thumb push so the whole
setup<00:05:24.469> time<00:05:24.800> took<00:05:25.279> about<00:05:25.370> five<00:05:25.819> minutes<00:05:26.120> it's

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
setup time took about five minutes it's

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.129 
setup time took about five minutes it's
really<00:05:26.719> impressive<00:05:28.180> filaments<00:05:29.180> in<00:05:29.360> and<00:05:29.689> now

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
really impressive filaments in and now

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:37.239 
really impressive filaments in and now
the<00:05:30.169> power<00:05:30.499> cords<00:05:30.979> going<00:05:31.279> in<00:05:35.800> there<00:05:36.800> we<00:05:36.949> go<00:05:37.069> the

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:37.249 
the power cords going in there we go the

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:39.279 
the power cords going in there we go the
blue<00:05:37.399> light<00:05:37.669> means<00:05:37.939> the<00:05:38.089> machines<00:05:38.449> on<00:05:38.749> we're

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
blue light means the machines on we're

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.360 
blue light means the machines on we're
going<00:05:39.379> to<00:05:39.439> take<00:05:39.649> the<00:05:40.569> USB<00:05:41.569> to<00:05:42.020> cable<00:05:42.529> here<00:05:42.770> hook

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
going to take the USB to cable here hook

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.100 
going to take the USB to cable here hook
it<00:05:43.490> up<00:05:43.580> to<00:05:43.610> the<00:05:43.759> computer<00:05:43.939> and<00:05:44.449> we're<00:05:44.959> going<00:05:45.080> to

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
it up to the computer and we're going to

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:54.020 
it up to the computer and we're going to
print<00:05:45.379> something

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:02.250
