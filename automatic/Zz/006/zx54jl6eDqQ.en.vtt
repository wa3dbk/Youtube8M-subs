00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.980 
are looking fly fresh to death what's
cool<00:02:00.580> about<00:02:00.640> this<00:02:00.970> is<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.330> students<00:02:01.720> who<00:02:01.840> are

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
cool about this is the students who are

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.169 
cool about this is the students who are
behind<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.619> project<00:02:02.970> accounted<00:02:03.970> for

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
behind the project accounted for

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.169 
behind the project accounted for
engineering<00:02:04.690> and<00:02:05.259> cost<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.979> produce<00:02:06.179> that

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
engineering and cost to produce that

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.150 
engineering and cost to produce that
means<00:02:07.450> this<00:02:07.600> could<00:02:07.840> realistically<00:02:08.319> be<00:02:08.740> built

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
means this could realistically be built

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.360 
means this could realistically be built
if<00:02:09.429> Mercedes<00:02:10.420> likes<00:02:10.960> the<00:02:11.110> idea<00:02:11.170> of<00:02:11.470> course<00:02:11.740> so

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
if Mercedes likes the idea of course so

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.600
