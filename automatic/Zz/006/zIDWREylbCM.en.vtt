hey<00:00:05.400> guys<00:00:05.609> what's<00:00:05.879> going<00:00:06.210> on<00:00:06.359> it's<00:00:06.779> explosions

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
hey guys what's going on it's explosions

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.390 
hey guys what's going on it's explosions
here<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:07.980> have<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:09.059> class<00:00:09.900> setup<00:00:10.410> video<00:00:10.559> for<00:00:11.099> the

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
here I have a class setup video for the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.140 
here I have a class setup video for the
pkp<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.900> one<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.500> just<00:00:14.160> going<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.790> talk<00:00:15.000> about

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
pkp this one is just going to talk about

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.470 
pkp this one is just going to talk about
why<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.049> use<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.830> particular<00:00:17.369> attachment<00:00:17.970> on

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
why I use the particular attachment on

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.279 
why I use the particular attachment on
the<00:00:18.859> pkp<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.100> have<00:00:20.670> 10<00:00:21.300> service<00:00:21.660> stars<00:00:21.930> with<00:00:22.109> it

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
the pkp I have 10 service stars with it

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.349 
the pkp I have 10 service stars with it
so<00:00:22.470> I've<00:00:22.650> definitely<00:00:23.369> put<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.850> lot<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.150> time

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
so I've definitely put a lot of time

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.179 
so I've definitely put a lot of time
into<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.900> gun<00:00:25.880> one<00:00:27.320> let's<00:00:28.320> just<00:00:28.500> dive<00:00:29.010> right

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
into the gun one let's just dive right

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.880 
into the gun one let's just dive right
in<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.400> Sykesville<00:00:30.000> first<00:00:30.689> off<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
in with Sykesville first off with the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.190 
in with Sykesville first off with the
holographic<00:00:32.309> sight<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.880> tend<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.840> use<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
holographic sight I tend to use the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.190 
holographic sight I tend to use the
holographic<00:00:34.620> sight<00:00:35.040> just<00:00:35.280> because<00:00:35.989> the<00:00:36.989> iron

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
holographic sight just because the iron

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.709 
holographic sight just because the iron
sights<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> gun<00:00:38.010> aren't<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.670> good<00:00:39.059> and

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
sights on the gun aren't that good and

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.530 
sights on the gun aren't that good and
it<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.410> gives<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.739> better<00:00:41.149> field<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.360> vision

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
it just gives you better field of vision

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.529 
it just gives you better field of vision
but<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.079> mean<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.469> all<00:00:43.620> up<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.219> personal

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
but I mean it's all up to personal

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.590 
but I mean it's all up to personal
preferences<00:00:45.620> but<00:00:46.620> what<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.399> do<00:00:47.600> definitely

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
preferences but what I do definitely

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.939 
preferences but what I do definitely
recommend<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.950> PT<00:00:50.219> AP<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.969> foregrip

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
recommend on the PT AP is a foregrip

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.650 
recommend on the PT AP is a foregrip
especially<00:00:52.949> for<00:00:53.190> if<00:00:53.550> you're<00:00:54.030> running<00:00:54.329> and

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
especially for if you're running and

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.610 
especially for if you're running and
gunning<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.820> definitely<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.149> helpful<00:00:57.780> because

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
gunning it definitely is helpful because

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.510 
gunning it definitely is helpful because
on<00:00:59.190> the<00:01:00.030> closer<00:01:00.510> range<00:01:00.870> shot<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.649> studies<00:01:02.250> your

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
on the closer range shot it studies your

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.620 
on the closer range shot it studies your
gun<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> little<00:01:03.780> bit<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.630> actually

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
gun a little bit so you can actually

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.730 
gun a little bit so you can actually
suppress<00:01:07.260> an<00:01:07.439> enemy<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.090> just<00:01:09.740> continuously

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
suppress an enemy and just continuously

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.640 
suppress an enemy and just continuously
hold<00:01:11.250> down<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.640> trigger<00:01:11.960> without<00:01:12.960> there

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
hold down the trigger without there

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.429 
hold down the trigger without there
being<00:01:13.680> too<00:01:14.189> much<00:01:14.220> recoil<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.689> bullet<00:01:16.020> spray

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
being too much recoil the bullet spray

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.580 
being too much recoil the bullet spray
does<00:01:16.880> happen<00:01:17.880> quite<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.180> bit<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:18.659> that's<00:01:18.930> one

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
does happen quite a bit but that's one

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.120 
does happen quite a bit but that's one
reason<00:01:19.799> why<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.130> definitely<00:01:20.970> recommend<00:01:21.390> using

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
reason why I definitely recommend using

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.999 
reason why I definitely recommend using
extended<00:01:23.130> mags<00:01:24.200> what<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.470> does<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.979> just

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
extended mags what that does it just

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.749 
extended mags what that does it just
gives<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.640> double<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.689> starting<00:01:28.229> amount<00:01:28.500> of

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
gives you double the starting amount of

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.980 
gives you double the starting amount of
rounds<00:01:29.759> per<00:01:30.540> magazine<00:01:32.180> it's<00:01:33.180> definitely<00:01:33.900> an

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
rounds per magazine it's definitely an

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.530 
rounds per magazine it's definitely an
awesome<00:01:34.140> setup<00:01:34.590> I've<00:01:34.950> done<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.299> large

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
awesome setup I've done the large

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.630 
awesome setup I've done the large
majority<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.200> my<00:01:37.320> kills<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.829> with<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> peak<00:01:38.250> AP

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
majority of my kills and with a peak AP

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.280 
majority of my kills and with a peak AP
use<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.229> setup<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:41.600> when<00:01:42.600> you're<00:01:42.990> playing

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
use in this setup so when you're playing

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.539 
use in this setup so when you're playing
I<00:01:43.590> hope<00:01:44.210> just<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.689> little<00:01:45.930> feedback<00:01:46.549> helps

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
I hope just this little feedback helps

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.920 
I hope just this little feedback helps
out<00:01:47.869> one<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:50.119> squad<00:01:51.119> perks<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.600> I'd

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
out one of the squad perks that I'd

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.520 
out one of the squad perks that I'd
recommend<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.770> either<00:01:53.240> suppression<00:01:54.240> or<00:01:54.530> ammo

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
recommend is either suppression or ammo

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.450 
recommend is either suppression or ammo
just<00:01:56.250> because<00:01:56.750> it<00:01:57.750> definitely<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.860> helpful<00:01:59.310> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
just because it definitely is helpful to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.310 
just because it definitely is helpful to
have<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.820> suppression<00:02:00.210> because<00:02:01.369> then<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.700> mean

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
have the suppression because then I mean

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.679 
have the suppression because then I mean
you<00:02:04.320> end<00:02:04.619> up<00:02:04.969> suppressing<00:02:05.969> your<00:02:06.149> enemy<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> lot

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
you end up suppressing your enemy a lot

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.219 
you end up suppressing your enemy a lot
faster

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
faster

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.000 
faster
and<00:02:09.119> with<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.420> ammo<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:11.080> gives<00:02:11.290> you<00:02:11.470> more<00:02:11.650> ammo

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
and with the ammo it gives you more ammo

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.580 
and with the ammo it gives you more ammo
but<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.430> mean<00:02:12.580> with<00:02:13.569> its<00:02:13.780> ten<00:02:14.019> magazine<00:02:14.530> you

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
but I mean with its ten magazine you

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.930 
but I mean with its ten magazine you
hardly<00:02:14.920> have<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.340> reload<00:02:15.670> at<00:02:15.940> all<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:17.940> that's

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
hardly have to reload at all so that's

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.900 
hardly have to reload at all so that's
basically<00:02:19.840> my<00:02:20.400> class<00:02:21.400> setup<00:02:21.760> for<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.180> pkp<00:02:22.780> I

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
basically my class setup for the pkp I

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.600 
basically my class setup for the pkp I
hope<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.120> guys<00:02:25.330> enjoyed<00:02:26.080> this<00:02:26.230> video<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.860> will
