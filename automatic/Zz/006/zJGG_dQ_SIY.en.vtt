00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 welcome love 413 ultimate 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.770
 friends today for the second in the form of 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.929
 review or the following 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.559
 card after his man of the match 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.719
 version 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.369
 forlan is 33 years old 1 80 tall 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.130
 78 kilo comes from uruguay 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.920
 position is striker or center forward 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.930
 strong foot right working rate in the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.050
 Attack high on the defensive medium 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.660
 weak foot 5 stars special movement 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.700
 three stars, we come to the same 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.530
 physical attributes and mental 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.239
 Attributes these do not look quite so 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.340
 blatantly like what we end up with 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.079
 Expects the physical attributes 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.430
 do not really cool things 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.430
 show except perhaps the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.930
 reaction with 92 the leap with 80 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.969
 and possibly even the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.989
 Strength at 78 which is very very strong 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.879
 can be helpful 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.559
 there are the mental attributes 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.090
 actually a bit better 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.699
 transmitter but exactly what a striker 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.190
 needs or an offensive power 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.440
 position play 86 overview 83 that is 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.140
 perfectly fine and adequate 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.670
 for a player of his vintage 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.630
 if we now have the last attribute 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.439
 namely the ability to look 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:15.090
 Attributes oh shit at control 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:18.810
 92 francs 81 eg 96 dribbling 88 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:25.159
 graduation 93 free kick precision 90 long 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:30.780
 Passes 81 Fernschuss 95 elfmeter 91 85 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:32.700
 firing force 94 and volleys come with 95 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.900
 We now go directly to his in the scenes 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.880
 and I came to be a little bit over 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.759
 say play behavior and what is that 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.979
 first thing you can say to him 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.170
 holy shit what does this guy have for one 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.270
 fuck health care that needs to be done again 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.520
 quite clearly say why is this shot 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.159
 very blatantly because he damned 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.170
 again the 5star ried feeds five 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.630
 star weak foot almost shoots 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.270
 one to one with left with right has 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.759
 a victim card 89 shot stand more 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.110
 or less a second case k where 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.729
 I have to say that with the shot of 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.140
 he likes it a little better than 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.780
 falcao and yes even the three stars 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.370
 Tricks are perfectly adequate and 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.890
 What the outside of the sixteen 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.360
 in sixteen with left and 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.490
 right like no matter if cut 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.200
 He definitely has one 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.850
 to owe something 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.430
 his player trades you can see now 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.650
 bottom right and that is 32 bit of sight 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.470
 trap means as much as he tastes 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.200
 break the offside trap underneath 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.760
 other long shot aker what the just 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.230
 great gau in longchance more or 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.970
 less causes and outside it is called 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.160
 shoots very happy sometimes with the 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.200
 Outsider just that is often the 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.180
 right conclusions and these are the ones 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.300
 Shots from difficult positions 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.160
 Gate sometimes too beech to beat 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.500
 or all this paired with the five 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.239
 star weak foot and then the 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.830
 horny ingame values ​​so I ask you 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.530
 since it probably in my opinion 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.959
 definitely one of the best and strongest 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.320
 mediocrats you actually have 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.780
 can 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.019
 the workplace is decent with media 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.690
 and hey in the attack and in addition 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.070
 relatively solid best fits with 83 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.380
 I have him that he still time this out 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.120
 von schott has also been from time to time 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.940
 really horny passports with you 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.209
 the Aussensrist actually relatively cool 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.070
 of course you have to ask yourself now yes 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.890
 he is relatively slow coming out 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.720
 uruguay from the brazilian league was 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.880
 is the type of value and how much 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.610
 Costs ultimately cost him 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:36.170
 buy 100 pc pc 40 degrees on the 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:39.620
 Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 with 50 50 km 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.510
 everything is relatively decent 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.070
 when you are with such a player 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.019
 rightly so can be found on such 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.790
 player but of course has 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.799
 these too his quirks and exactly on 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.530
 I would like to join you in the 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.790
 or in conclusion, you agree with that 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.140
 also a closer picture of him 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.730
 and I just could not do that 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.980
 a lot of swarms or him if necessary 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.170
 page clearly he has a bomb 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.940
 shot why did I think so 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.070
 Everything was very good to book 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.810
 just the perfect trades too 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.730
 maybe shoot though a lot 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.579
 already been really cool but it 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.100
 is definitely not necessary very much 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.630
 long shot partly also passes the short ones 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.209
 Passes are pretty cool with both 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.650
 left as well as right he that yes 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.870
 just offers a huge number 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.729
 possibilities to refine the game 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.180
 or is simply much wider too 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.740
 pull 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.970
 because you do not have to think about them 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.610
 he now right 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.610
 or left foot then kershaw to the 16er very 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.170
 dangerous from outside as said the 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.390
 finet trade has them again 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.600
 much more dangerous to do so 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.300
 almost perfect medium storm and just that 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.490
 five stars weak foot on the contra 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.110
 Side we have him that he too much 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.730
 Slow is lost like a striker 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.100
 sometimes a lot of battles there a bit 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.020
 Uneasy is not easy on the ball 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.510
 to build the team what it as the 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.510
 uruguayer is or originated from uruguay 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.730
 and in the league threatens league do brasil 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.110
 plays management management now goes 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.180
 But let's start with the slip of the tongue 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.010
 excuses 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.570
 the big advantage or maybe 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.270
 after shows he is not clear 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.530
 better than his mine ovi maps map 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.520
 all his already man of the match 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.530
 own card 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.730
 they do not need to resort to them 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.470
 sees the man of the match card 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.670
 of course, a good piece of horny from the 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.260
 you have to say very clearly the one of the 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.050
 match card is easy for you 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.750
 fancier but in shape is a 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.040
 small piece better and that's exactly what works 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.440
 in my opinion , in the evaluation 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.220
 He gets his thumb up 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.600
 definitely deserves and an evaluation of 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.730
 8.8 which is in my opinion not so 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.140
 high not too low the gates in that way 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.240
 shot a few games for me 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.220
 were all very very cool all purpose 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.390
 meet and you could do so much with that 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.919
 play around that it's really fun 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.540
 I have played with him 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.610
 Among other things, the price is opposite 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.050
 the man of the match card is almost the same 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.270
 then I prefer to reach for a bit 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.040
 stronger card of course if no one 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.390
 It can be critical too 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.520
 Man of the match card 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:58.790
 otherwise it was mine with the in 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.169
 form forlan or even the second in form 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.070
 like you see us again next time 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.050
 next review 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:07.300
 that was it from my side I am 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.300
 your cock until next time
