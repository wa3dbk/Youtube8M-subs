where you put the water in the stand in
the<00:02:28.250> reason<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.790> use<00:02:29.090> so<00:02:29.689> many<00:02:29.930> platforms<00:02:30.640> is

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
the reason I use so many platforms is

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.589 
the reason I use so many platforms is
because<00:02:32.150> these<00:02:32.569> fish<00:02:32.870> do<00:02:33.109> jump<00:02:33.909> the<00:02:34.909> number<00:02:35.510> of

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
because these fish do jump the number of

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.429 
because these fish do jump the number of
platforms<00:02:35.840> keeps<00:02:36.590> your<00:02:37.030> slimes<00:02:38.030> from<00:02:38.629> falling
