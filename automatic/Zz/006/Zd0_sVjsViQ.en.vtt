got another visit with my doctor to see
about<00:02:49.640> my<00:02:49.850> knee<00:02:49.910> I<00:02:50.060> think<00:02:50.390> it's<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.600> meniscus

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
about my knee I think it's a meniscus

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.100 
about my knee I think it's a meniscus
not<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.160> maybe<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.489> tear<00:02:52.760> I<00:02:52.970> don't<00:02:53.120> know<00:02:53.180> well<00:02:54.049> I

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
not to maybe a tear I don't know well I

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.110 
not to maybe a tear I don't know well I
think<00:02:54.200> it's<00:02:54.410> like<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.560> serious<00:02:55.120> cartilage

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
think it's like a serious cartilage

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.699 
think it's like a serious cartilage
issue<00:02:56.330> so<00:02:56.690> I'm<00:02:56.840> gonna<00:02:56.930> keep<00:02:57.140> squatting<00:02:57.410> in<00:02:57.590> bed

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709

lifting with it but I think it's gonna
