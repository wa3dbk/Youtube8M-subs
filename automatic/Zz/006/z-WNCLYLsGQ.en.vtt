off<00:00:56.180> that's<00:00:56.600> a<00:00:56.660> straightforward<00:00:56.930> for<00:00:57.350> blood

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
off that's a straightforward for blood

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.959 
off that's a straightforward for blood
lot<00:00:57.800> there<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:58.460> that's<00:00:58.640> made<00:00:58.820> my<00:00:59.000> loop<00:00:59.239> okay

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
lot there and that's made my loop okay

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.189 
lot there and that's made my loop okay
keeping<00:01:01.969> things<00:01:02.180> too<00:01:02.329> much<00:01:02.420> is<00:01:02.600> simple<00:01:03.050> and

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
keeping things too much is simple and

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.850 
keeping things too much is simple and
then<00:01:03.800> yeah<00:01:04.399> it<00:01:04.610> feels<00:01:05.020> super<00:01:06.020> group<00:01:06.229> don't

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860
