00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.770 
just so much fun it was all about
throttle<00:02:13.890> control<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.180> came<00:02:15.450> into<00:02:15.630> the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
throttle control so it came into the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.010 
throttle control so it came into the
first<00:02:15.960> corner<00:02:16.320> and<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:17.670> was<00:02:17.850> very<00:02:18.060> tight<00:02:18.420> few

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
first corner and it was very tight few

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.990 
first corner and it was very tight few
people<00:02:19.260> spun<00:02:19.500> out<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:20.160> managed<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.910> actually

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
people spun out I managed to actually

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.630 
people spun out I managed to actually
slip<00:02:21.420> around<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.660> side<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.610> stayed<00:02:23.610> in

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.720 
slip around the side and stayed in
sickened<00:02:24.630> for<00:02:25.080> probably<00:02:25.770> about<00:02:25.860> four<00:02:26.220> laps<00:02:26.520> i

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
sickened for probably about four laps i

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.630 
sickened for probably about four laps i
think<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.000> was<00:02:27.150> until<00:02:27.900> i<00:02:28.170> just<00:02:28.460> mesh<00:02:29.460> the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
think it was until i just mesh the

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.460 
think it was until i just mesh the
throttle<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.030> little<00:02:30.210> bit<00:02:30.510> too<00:02:30.660> much<00:02:30.840> which<00:02:31.230> was

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
throttle a little bit too much which was

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.040 
throttle a little bit too much which was
a<00:02:31.500> bit<00:02:32.490> stink<00:02:32.790> betweens<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.330> force<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:33.960> the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
a bit stink betweens that force and the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.990
