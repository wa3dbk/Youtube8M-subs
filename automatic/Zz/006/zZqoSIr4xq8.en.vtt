00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.190 

when<00:00:01.260> you<00:00:01.380> take<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.650> tuning<00:00:02.159> fork<00:00:02.399> and<00:00:02.700> do<00:00:02.850> this

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:03.200 
when you take a tuning fork and do this

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.619 
when you take a tuning fork and do this
the<00:00:04.200> prong<00:00:04.440> of<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.830> fork<00:00:05.100> vibrates<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.970> sets

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
the prong of the fork vibrates and sets

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.680 
the prong of the fork vibrates and sets
up<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.870> sound<00:00:07.109> wave<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.940> when<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.120> sound<00:00:09.450> wave

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
up a sound wave and when this sound wave

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.930 
up a sound wave and when this sound wave
hits<00:00:09.960> your<00:00:10.170> eardrum<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:11.250> can<00:00:11.429> hear<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.730> note

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
hits your eardrum you can hear the note

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.410 
hits your eardrum you can hear the note
that<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:12.269> being<00:00:12.509> played<00:00:12.809> by<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.080> tuning<00:00:13.469> fork

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
that is being played by the tuning fork

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.090 
that is being played by the tuning fork
now<00:00:15.420> it's<00:00:15.599> easy<00:00:15.839> enough<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.199> understand<00:00:16.890> how

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
now it's easy enough to understand how

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.670 
now it's easy enough to understand how
tuning<00:00:17.609> forks<00:00:17.940> make<00:00:18.119> sounds<00:00:18.779> because<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.500> can

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
tuning forks make sounds because you can

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.880 
tuning forks make sounds because you can
see<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.010> vibrations<00:00:20.930> but<00:00:21.930> how<00:00:22.109> do<00:00:22.170> computers

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
see the vibrations but how do computers

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.019 
see the vibrations but how do computers
make<00:00:23.189> sounds

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
make sounds

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.160 
make sounds
they<00:00:24.660> don't<00:00:24.869> vibrate<00:00:25.439> do<00:00:25.619> they<00:00:26.000> no<00:00:27.000> but<00:00:27.300> they

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
they don't vibrate do they no but they

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.160 
they don't vibrate do they no but they
can<00:00:28.230> make<00:00:28.740> other<00:00:28.949> things<00:00:29.279> vibrate<00:00:29.960> every<00:00:30.960> time

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
can make other things vibrate every time

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.080 
can make other things vibrate every time
a<00:00:31.199> computer<00:00:31.619> circuit<00:00:31.980> switches<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:32.730> or<00:00:32.940> off

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
a computer circuit switches on or off

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.020 
a computer circuit switches on or off
there<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> tiny<00:00:34.410> increase<00:00:34.770> or<00:00:35.280> decrease<00:00:35.489> in

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
there is a tiny increase or decrease in

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.110 
there is a tiny increase or decrease in
electric<00:00:36.450> current<00:00:37.160> it's<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> miniature

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
electric current it's like a miniature

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.450 
electric current it's like a miniature
heartbeat<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:40.050> sends<00:00:40.469> out<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> miniature

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
heartbeat that sends out a miniature

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.460 
heartbeat that sends out a miniature
electrical<00:00:42.030> pulse

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
electrical pulse

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.310 
electrical pulse
this<00:00:44.070> pulse<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.700> much<00:00:44.970> too<00:00:45.240> weak<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.840> generate

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
this pulse is much too weak to generate

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.280 
this pulse is much too weak to generate
any<00:00:46.590> sound<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.100> its<00:00:47.340> own<00:00:47.540> but<00:00:48.540> it<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.870> be<00:00:49.050> fed

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
any sound on its own but it can be fed

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.740 
any sound on its own but it can be fed
into<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.530> tiny<00:00:49.920> device<00:00:50.370> called<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.940> transducer

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
into a tiny device called a transducer

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.850 
into a tiny device called a transducer
to<00:00:51.990> produce<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:53.070> tiny<00:00:53.490> sound<00:00:54.380> but<00:00:55.380> if<00:00:55.470> we<00:00:55.560> want<00:00:55.770> a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
to produce a tiny sound but if we want a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.490 
to produce a tiny sound but if we want a
louder<00:00:56.130> sound<00:00:56.600> we<00:00:57.600> must<00:00:57.810> first<00:00:58.080> make<00:00:58.200> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
louder sound we must first make the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.080 
louder sound we must first make the
pulse<00:00:58.740> larger<00:00:59.310> we<00:00:59.670> must<00:00:59.910> amplify<00:01:00.360> it<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:02.670> this

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
pulse larger we must amplify it and this

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.210 
pulse larger we must amplify it and this
is<00:01:03.240> simple<00:01:03.540> to<00:01:03.660> do<00:01:03.840> because<00:01:04.589> our<00:01:04.710> computer

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
is simple to do because our computer

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.210 
is simple to do because our computer
monitor<00:01:05.790> or<00:01:05.970> TV<00:01:06.210> set<00:01:06.690> comes<00:01:07.410> already<00:01:07.860> equipped

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
monitor or TV set comes already equipped

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.330 
monitor or TV set comes already equipped
with<00:01:08.370> an<00:01:08.580> amplifier<00:01:09.090> if<00:01:09.980> we<00:01:10.980> feed<00:01:11.190> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
with an amplifier if we feed the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.000 
with an amplifier if we feed the
computer's<00:01:11.820> pulse<00:01:12.150> into<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.630> amplifier<00:01:13.200> it

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
computer's pulse into this amplifier it

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.070 
computer's pulse into this amplifier it
will<00:01:14.310> then<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:14.640> made<00:01:14.670> large<00:01:15.330> enough<00:01:15.690> to<00:01:15.720> cause

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
will then be made large enough to cause

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.510 
will then be made large enough to cause
a<00:01:16.140> loudspeaker<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:17.250> vibrate

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
a loudspeaker to vibrate

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.179 
a loudspeaker to vibrate
and<00:01:18.610> therefore<00:01:19.210> create<00:01:19.630> a<00:01:19.810> sound<00:01:20.170> wave<00:01:20.439> that

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
and therefore create a sound wave that

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.330 
and therefore create a sound wave that
we<00:01:21.340> can<00:01:21.520> hear<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.409> provided<00:01:24.040> that<00:01:24.189> your

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
we can hear so provided that your

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.639 
we can hear so provided that your
computer<00:01:24.880> is<00:01:24.909> hooked<00:01:25.360> into<00:01:25.659> an<00:01:25.840> amplifier<00:01:26.380> and

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
computer is hooked into an amplifier and

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.370 
computer is hooked into an amplifier and

a loudspeaker simply by turning a
circuit<00:01:29.950> on<00:01:30.130> or<00:01:30.369> off<00:01:30.549> you<00:01:30.909> will<00:01:31.630> be<00:01:31.780> able<00:01:31.899> to

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
circuit on or off you will be able to

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.570 
circuit on or off you will be able to
make<00:01:32.259> a<00:01:32.289> blip<00:01:33.070> sound<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.920> course<00:01:35.920> this<00:01:36.220> blip

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
make a blip sound of course this blip

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.300 
make a blip sound of course this blip
can<00:01:36.970> hardly<00:01:37.210> be<00:01:37.420> called<00:01:37.570> music<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:39.130> if<00:01:39.220> you

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
can hardly be called music but if you

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.399 
can hardly be called music but if you
tell<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.640> computer<00:01:39.850> to<00:01:40.119> switch<00:01:40.509> a<00:01:40.750> circuit<00:01:41.170> on

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
tell the computer to switch a circuit on

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.460 
tell the computer to switch a circuit on
and<00:01:41.710> off<00:01:41.830> more<00:01:42.399> and<00:01:42.670> more<00:01:42.880> rapidly<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:44.259> will

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
and off more and more rapidly it will

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.919 
and off more and more rapidly it will
produce<00:01:44.679> a<00:01:45.070> faster<00:01:45.610> and<00:01:45.850> faster<00:01:46.149> strain<00:01:46.750> of

produce a faster and faster strain of

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.770 
produce a faster and faster strain of
blips<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:48.009> eventually<00:01:48.670> you<00:01:49.179> will<00:01:49.390> hear<00:01:49.630> the

blips and eventually you will hear the

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.949 
blips and eventually you will hear the
musical<00:01:50.200> note<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:51.030> more<00:01:52.030> frequent<00:01:52.569> the<00:01:52.720> blips

musical note the more frequent the blips

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.740 
musical note the more frequent the blips
the<00:01:53.380> higher<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.220> note<00:01:54.369> and<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:55.600> less

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
the higher the note and the less

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
a note is called its frequency

a note is called its frequency
for<00:02:05.229> example<00:02:05.710> if<00:02:05.979> we<00:02:06.220> get<00:02:06.399> the<00:02:06.520> computer<00:02:06.909> to

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
for example if we get the computer to

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.589 
for example if we get the computer to
turn<00:02:07.390> a<00:02:07.420> circuit<00:02:07.930> on<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:08.380> off<00:02:08.500> precisely<00:02:09.599> 440

turn a circuit on and off precisely 440
times<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:11.080> second<00:02:11.580> we<00:02:12.580> will<00:02:12.760> hear<00:02:13.030> 440<00:02:14.020> blips

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
times a second we will hear 440 blips

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.650 
times a second we will hear 440 blips
per<00:02:14.500> second<00:02:14.940> which<00:02:15.940> happens<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.420> be<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
per second which happens to be the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.600 
per second which happens to be the
frequency<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.349> musical<00:02:17.770> note<00:02:17.980> a

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
frequency of the musical note a

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.510 
frequency of the musical note a
and<00:02:19.700> this<00:02:20.420> is<00:02:20.600> exactly<00:02:21.050> how<00:02:21.320> a<00:02:21.350> tuning<00:02:21.890> fork<00:02:22.160> or

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
and this is exactly how a tuning fork or

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.020 
and this is exactly how a tuning fork or
a<00:02:22.580> piano<00:02:23.270> or<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.570> guitar<00:02:23.870> or<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.590> trumpet<00:02:25.030> also

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
a piano or a guitar or a trumpet also

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.600 
a piano or a guitar or a trumpet also
produces<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.630> musical<00:02:27.140> note<00:02:27.350> aid<00:02:27.620> or<00:02:28.040> any

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
produces the musical note aid or any

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.970 
produces the musical note aid or any
other<00:02:28.820> note<00:02:29.060> for<00:02:29.300> that<00:02:29.330> matter<00:02:29.800> it's<00:02:30.800> all

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
other note for that matter it's all

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.690 
other note for that matter it's all
based<00:02:31.280> on<00:02:31.460> vibrations<00:02:32.770> so<00:02:33.770> your<00:02:33.950> computer<00:02:34.460> can

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
based on vibrations so your computer can

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.600 
based on vibrations so your computer can
not<00:02:34.940> only<00:02:35.090> give<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.570> good<00:02:35.930> words<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:37.280> good

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
not only give you good words and good

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.110 
not only give you good words and good
numbers<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.410> good<00:02:39.410> pictures<00:02:39.860> it<00:02:40.700> can<00:02:40.940> also

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
numbers and good pictures it can also

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.160 
numbers and good pictures it can also
give<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.510> good<00:02:42.470> vibrations
