00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.420
 important also that we add a 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.309
 very personal touch because these are going to 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.050

 we conform only with this also they 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.010
 let's add how with this the 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.019
 accessories combine your hairstyle you 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.409
 make up the joke is that we are not 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:58.500
 pretty then of talitas ahead this 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.960
 whatever happens for a casual event or a 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.620
 little formal for example do not leave 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.990
 goodbye is with friends with him 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.470
 you also add that event to 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.560
 this look and good the pike it classified 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.600
 as something home and a bit formal of the 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.820
 two a little and we are going to use the solcito 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.250
 that later the players 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.470
 tutorials so that the checks are going to 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.750
 this one sounds very flirty that I did 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.880
 In a very short time the truth did not take me 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.159
 nothing and I do not spend almost anything 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.810
 the truth was very quick to this army 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.250
 that I am going to add I am going to add 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.470
 a simple white shirt is very basic 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.280
 I believe that in every wardrobe you should not 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.680
 to miss 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.909
 another thing that I want to add is your 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.909
 successes like this 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.040
 if you can see is basic I think the 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.630
 Most have it in their wardrobe and 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.390
 It is also recommended for the veins 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.520
 because because there are little ones that give us 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.180
 as well as one more form of waistline gives 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.070
 then it is also recommended 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.200
 half our sack can we 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.450
 help to see us more formality and more 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.060
 apart from the accessories also a 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.160
 little metallic sounds I love the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.230
 metal accessories but as I told you 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.000
 you can add your touches 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.580
 personal can also add 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.160
 acid colors as I mentioned in this 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.410
 case and they can put it in greater quantity 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.510
 because it's night 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.519
 It must be the same as they are within the 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.170
 colors that we are going to use is active 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.510
 according acidic colors and 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.760
 conversations regarding the amount girls 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.519
 I recommend you use one hand 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.900
 little bag of hands that goes from 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.580
 agreement also with the color and with 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.170
 our accessories then you 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.180
 They can use any type of bag 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.010
 also with the bows as well as the equipment 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.650
 you of liberty experiment and girls 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.610
 then to taste and the ways so free 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.340
 creative about shoes girls yo 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.440
 I dared to wear a pair of heels 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.829
 very high platform test that I 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.829
 find 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:08.220
 but you can use a lot in your 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.040
 closet 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.310
 Then add the hair for the 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.920
 Night party night what recommendable 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.680
 wear my style way can be 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.600
 holding on to the unnatural little 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.910
 you are things in terms of makeup 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.700
 girls here if we are going to be a little bit more 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.400
 pronounced is very fashionable right now 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.290
 which are the very pronounced eyelashes 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.200
 striking these here if we are going to be able 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.060
 use a lot of mask here if we're going to 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.090
 to use what the tabs 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.160
 false here sit free here 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.320
 we are also going to emphasize a lot what 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.750
 which is the basis for the lips 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.480
 from experience let's do little but 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.130
 as I say you do it very much to your 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.810
 style very in its own way 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.489
 this is a suggestion to see it as 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.930
 I can take it but I want to add it 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.930
 something later 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.050
 look 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.920
 and 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.079
 with the good tutorial the truth of the 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.540
 network because I already had and it comes into oblivion 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.300
 and they already want to want it but 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.340
 they said I'm not going to make a knot yourself 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.310
 with this slight add a few taps 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.500
 very personal just like me 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.020
 I would like if you put a touch 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.060
 of his personality and that they send it to me and 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.550
 teach it to me and I would people 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.139
 this is my style as you see but more or 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.449
 unless I'm going to give you some ideas of what 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.720
 who can use the materials we're going 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:46.120

 pliers to pull the studs eyebrow 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.110
 true the bollards can 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.970
 get in any haberdashery and can 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.740

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.740
 Choose the one that you send I chose 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.200
 these great milestones strips to the taste I 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.720
 I chose between these embroidered strips of 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.460
 cotton and then I also chose this but 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.500
 this is like something extra this I want 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.090
 to see that there is a lot of variety in 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.949
 cloth shops in the haberdashery 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.500

 they remain sticky as if they were dashes 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.380
 with each other 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.270
