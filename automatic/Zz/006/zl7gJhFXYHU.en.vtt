nozzle this tank here that you see this

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.119 
nozzle this tank here that you see this
is<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.440> water<00:00:44.100> tank<00:00:44.629> or<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:46.140> my<00:00:46.590> case<00:00:46.620> it's

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
is the water tank or in my case it's

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.760 
is the water tank or in my case it's
going<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.309> be<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> blood<00:00:47.789> tank<00:00:48.140> it's<00:00:49.140> again<00:00:49.739> a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
going to be the blood tank it's again a

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.779 
going to be the blood tank it's again a
three<00:00:50.160> inch<00:00:50.340> tank<00:00:50.700> with<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.530> screw<00:00:52.530> top<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.760> I

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
three inch tank with this screw top so I

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.959 
three inch tank with this screw top so I
can<00:00:54.059> refill<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.539> with<00:00:55.039> the<00:00:56.039> heavy<00:00:56.250> blood<00:00:56.789> that

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
can refill it with the heavy blood that

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.849 
can refill it with the heavy blood that
I<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.829> my<00:00:59.550> valve<00:01:00.680> there's<00:01:01.680> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
I have and in here is my valve there's a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.520 
I have and in here is my valve there's a
bolt<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.030> runs<00:01:03.270> through<00:01:03.600> here<00:01:03.930> with<00:01:04.500> a

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
bolt that runs through here with a

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.420 
bolt that runs through here with a
washer<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.939> piece<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.840> rubber<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.430> only

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
washer and a piece of rubber that only

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.149 
washer and a piece of rubber that only
hangs<00:01:08.790> down<00:01:09.470> about<00:01:10.470> an<00:01:10.650> eighth<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.950> an<00:01:11.070> inch

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
hangs down about an eighth of an inch

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.460 
hangs down about an eighth of an inch
just<00:01:11.340> enough<00:01:11.790> for<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.630> blood<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.049> get<00:01:13.229> through

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
just enough for the blood to get through

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.370 
just enough for the blood to get through
into<00:01:13.950> pool<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.610> bottom<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.060> this

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
into pool and to the bottom of this

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.130 
into pool and to the bottom of this
hopefully<00:01:16.820> water<00:01:17.820> goes<00:01:18.119> pretty<00:01:18.630> quick<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
hopefully water goes pretty quick and

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.620 
hopefully water goes pretty quick and
goes<00:01:19.950> right<00:01:20.280> up<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.640> nozzle<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
goes right up to the nozzle but the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.539 
goes right up to the nozzle but the
blood<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.869> thicker<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.560> I'm<00:01:22.680> hoping<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.280> should

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
blood is thicker so I'm hoping it should

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.330 
blood is thicker so I'm hoping it should
stay<00:01:23.880> right<00:01:24.090> inside<00:01:24.420> there<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.890> bolt<00:01:26.100> comes

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
stay right inside there the bolt comes

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.390 
stay right inside there the bolt comes
up<00:01:26.610> through<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.590> inside<00:01:28.590> here<00:01:29.100> there's<00:01:29.340> a

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
up through and inside here there's a

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.330 
up through and inside here there's a
half-inch<00:01:30.210> piece<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.020> pipe<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.799> narrowed<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
half-inch piece of pipe so I narrowed it

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.340 
half-inch piece of pipe so I narrowed it
down<00:01:32.369> even<00:01:32.729> further<00:01:33.060> with<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.509> quarter<00:01:34.020> twenty

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
down even further with a quarter twenty

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.789 
down even further with a quarter twenty
bolt<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:35.790> wing<00:01:36.000> nut<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.390> top<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.409> can

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
bolt and a wing nut on top that you can

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.120 
bolt and a wing nut on top that you can
adjust<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.150> depth<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.869> have<00:01:40.530> very

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
adjust to the depth so you have very

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.550 
adjust to the depth so you have very
minimal<00:01:41.369> opening<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.659> what's<00:01:43.110> supposed<00:01:43.439> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
minimal opening so what's supposed to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.710 
minimal opening so what's supposed to
happen<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.130> what<00:01:44.520> doesn't<00:01:44.759> with<00:01:45.299> my<00:01:45.450> test

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
happen and what doesn't with my test

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.380 
happen and what doesn't with my test
when<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.680> release<00:01:47.189> your<00:01:47.369> pressure<00:01:47.670> it

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
when you release your pressure it

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.830 
when you release your pressure it
there's<00:01:49.229> already<00:01:49.530> fluid<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.549> here<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
there's already fluid in here and the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.679 
there's already fluid in here and the
valve<00:01:52.140> since<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.610> only<00:01:54.149> got<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.329> small

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
valve since it's it's only got a small

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.249 
valve since it's it's only got a small
travel<00:01:55.369> slam<00:01:56.369> shut<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.060> while<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> pressure

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
travel slam shut and while the pressure

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.280 
travel slam shut and while the pressure
comes<00:01:58.560> out<00:01:58.740> through<00:01:58.950> here<00:01:59.130> rather<00:01:59.729> than<00:01:59.880> back

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
comes out through here rather than back

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.440 
comes out through here rather than back
flowing<00:02:01.290> into<00:02:01.439> your<00:02:01.680> tank<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.240> should

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
flowing into your tank but you should

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.780 
flowing into your tank but you should
always<00:02:03.630> screw<00:02:03.960> your<00:02:04.200> cap<00:02:04.439> down<00:02:04.680> because<00:02:05.549> when

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
always screw your cap down because when

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.839 
always screw your cap down because when
I<00:02:05.820> was<00:02:06.090> doing<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.390> testing<00:02:06.869> my<00:02:07.140> valve<00:02:07.890> failed

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
I was doing the testing my valve failed

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.690 
I was doing the testing my valve failed
that<00:02:09.149> after<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.050> third<00:02:10.289> shot<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.459> stuck

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
that after the third shot and it stuck

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.650 
that after the third shot and it stuck
open<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.300> I

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
open and I

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.010 
open and I
had<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.320> fluid<00:02:13.620> coming<00:02:13.830> out<00:02:14.010> through<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.430> top

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
had the fluid coming out through the top

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.520

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.200 
so hope that's explanatory enough for
you<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.830> if<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:20.790> make<00:02:20.970> one<00:02:21.000> have<00:02:21.870> fun
