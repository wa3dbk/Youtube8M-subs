00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.939
 super trinity 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.160
 very fat folder he looks a bit like 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.510
 15 sec and swans efteling that completely 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.570

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.800
 did a how to play 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.500
 it all pretty clear I think 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.030
 ok what is written here then brown is next 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.579

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.120
 can reach all levels 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.379
 it looks like it must be doable me 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.920
 think it's the first time we have 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.239
 now four 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.809

 the other guy was 80 waist score 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.830
