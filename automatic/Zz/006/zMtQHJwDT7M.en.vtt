00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
is can be mimicked exactly the same if

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.810 
is can be mimicked exactly the same if
you<00:01:43.380> guys<00:01:43.470> are<00:01:43.619> using<00:01:43.649> blue<00:01:44.009> dye<00:01:44.189> magenta<00:01:44.670> dye

you guys are using blue dye magenta dye
pink<00:01:45.119> dye<00:01:45.360> yellow<00:01:45.990> dye<00:01:46.170> green<00:01:46.500> dye<00:01:46.680> whatever

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
pink dye yellow dye green dye whatever

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.249 
pink dye yellow dye green dye whatever
you<00:01:47.579> guys<00:01:47.729> just<00:01:48.000> throw<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.570> exact<00:01:49.020> same

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
you guys just throw in the exact same

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.670 
you guys just throw in the exact same
recipe<00:01:49.920> except<00:01:50.399> for<00:01:50.579> with<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> different<00:01:51.210> dye

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
recipe except for with a different dye

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.929 
recipe except for with a different dye
so<00:01:52.680> there's<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.220> bunch<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.549> different<00:01:53.790> stuff

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
normal dyeing of wood there's the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.870 
normal dyeing of wood there's the
oversaturated<00:01:58.409> wood<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.890> got<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.520> normal

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
oversaturated wood you got just normal

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.219 
oversaturated wood you got just normal
dyeing<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.299> all<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> different<00:02:00.869> things<00:02:00.899> like

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
oversaturated version of that you simply

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.520 
oversaturated version of that you simply
switch<00:02:56.120> it<00:02:56.330> out<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:56.690> instead<00:02:56.900> of<00:02:56.960> a<00:02:57.080> die<00:02:57.260> in<00:02:57.410> the

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
switch it out so instead of a die in the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.230 
switch it out so instead of a die in the
middle<00:02:57.800> you're<00:02:58.130> going<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.400> have<00:02:58.520> a<00:02:58.550> die<00:02:58.910> on<00:02:59.120> the

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
middle you're going to have a die on the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.790 
middle you're going to have a die on the
top<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.630> bottom<00:02:59.720> I<00:02:59.930> just<00:02:59.960> use<00:03:00.230> pink<00:03:00.500> because<00:03:00.740> I

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
top and bottom I just use pink because I

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.800 
top and bottom I just use pink because I
wanted<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:01.100> use<00:03:01.220> pink<00:03:01.400> for<00:03:01.580> this<00:03:01.670> one<00:03:01.850> and<00:03:02.570> if<00:03:02.720> I

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
wanted to use pink for this one and if I

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.540 
wanted to use pink for this one and if I
were<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:02.990> compare<00:03:03.110> those<00:03:03.440> you<00:03:03.620> can<00:03:03.950> see<00:03:03.980> boom

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
were to compare those you can see boom

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.720 
were to compare those you can see boom
and<00:03:05.200> boom<00:03:06.200> so<00:03:06.770> you<00:03:06.890> can<00:03:07.130> see<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:07.490> know<00:03:07.580> the

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
and boom so you can see you know the

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.310 
and boom so you can see you know the
little<00:03:07.880> bit<00:03:08.030> of<00:03:08.090> oversaturated<00:03:08.840> miss<00:03:09.020> that<00:03:09.200> is

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
little bit of oversaturated miss that is

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.720 
little bit of oversaturated miss that is
in<00:03:09.440> this<00:03:09.590> one<00:03:09.800> I<00:03:09.950> kind<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.220> like<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.430> if<00:03:10.640> you

in this one I kind of like it if you

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:11.830 
in this one I kind of like it if you
guys<00:03:10.760> are<00:03:11.000> one<00:03:11.120> make<00:03:11.330> something<00:03:11.630> that<00:03:11.750> you

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
really want to make pop I think that

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.310 
really want to make pop I think that
would<00:03:13.460> definitely<00:03:13.610> be<00:03:13.850> cool<00:03:14.180> from<00:03:14.960> there<00:03:15.110> guys

would definitely be cool from there guys
you<00:03:15.530> can<00:03:15.680> use<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.220> same<00:03:16.880> red<00:03:17.120> planks<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:17.510> I

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
you can use the same red planks that I

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.360 
you can use the same red planks that I
showed<00:03:17.930> you<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:18.410> you<00:03:18.560> use<00:03:18.740> those<00:03:18.950> to<00:03:19.160> craft

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
showed you and you use those to craft

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.920 
showed you and you use those to craft
your<00:03:19.459> slabs<00:03:19.790> just<00:03:20.090> like<00:03:20.209> you<00:03:20.330> would<00:03:20.480> normally

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
your slabs just like you would normally

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.300 
your slabs just like you would normally
same<00:03:21.170> thing<00:03:21.350> goes<00:03:21.500> for<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.800> stairs<00:03:22.070> you<00:03:22.280> can

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
same thing goes for the stairs you can

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.310 
same thing goes for the stairs you can
use<00:03:22.580> your<00:03:22.730> your<00:03:23.090> red<00:03:23.390> planks<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:23.930> make<00:03:23.959> red

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
use your your red planks to make red

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.470 
use your your red planks to make red
stairs<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:24.980> then<00:03:25.310> also<00:03:25.520> for<00:03:25.850> red<00:03:26.000> bookshelves

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
stairs and then also for red bookshelves

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.150 
stairs and then also for red bookshelves
it's<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:26.930> same<00:03:27.140> recipe<00:03:27.290> as<00:03:27.560> before<00:03:27.920> except

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
it's the same recipe as before except

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.740 
it's the same recipe as before except
for<00:03:28.190> now<00:03:28.520> you're<00:03:28.760> going<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:28.940> put<00:03:29.060> a<00:03:29.090> white<00:03:29.390> die

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
for now you're going to put a white die

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.870 
for now you're going to put a white die
drop<00:03:30.350> in<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.830> middle<00:03:31.070> so<00:03:31.190> any<00:03:31.370> of<00:03:31.490> these<00:03:31.640> ones

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
drop in the middle so any of these ones

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.130 
drop in the middle so any of these ones
where<00:03:32.060> it's<00:03:32.209> only<00:03:32.300> you<00:03:32.450> can<00:03:32.600> create<00:03:32.840> a<00:03:32.900> little

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
where it's only you can create a little

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.960 
where it's only you can create a little
bit<00:03:33.260> all<00:03:33.380> you<00:03:33.530> need<00:03:33.709> is<00:03:33.830> a<00:03:33.980> diet<00:03:34.250> drops<00:03:34.700> a

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
bit all you need is a diet drops a

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.449 
bit all you need is a diet drops a
little<00:03:35.810> bit<00:03:35.990> of<00:03:36.110> a<00:03:36.170> glitch<00:03:36.530> in<00:03:36.770> this<00:03:36.980> mod<00:03:37.190> where

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
little bit of a glitch in this mod where

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.449 
little bit of a glitch in this mod where
all<00:03:37.670> of<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.090> different<00:03:38.390> die<00:03:38.810> jobs<00:03:39.380> are<00:03:40.190> called

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
all of the different die jobs are called

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.310 
all of the different die jobs are called
white<00:03:40.790> when<00:03:41.060> in<00:03:41.180> reality<00:03:41.570> this<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:41.750> a<00:03:41.840> red<00:03:42.080> die

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
white when in reality this is a red die

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.350 
white when in reality this is a red die
drop<00:03:42.650> because<00:03:43.220> it's<00:03:43.370> created<00:03:43.730> by<00:03:43.760> two<00:03:43.910> rose

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
drop because it's created by two rose

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.760 
drop because it's created by two rose
red<00:03:44.600> dies<00:03:44.780> right<00:03:45.020> next<00:03:45.320> to<00:03:45.410> each<00:03:45.500> other<00:03:45.650> you

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
red dies right next to each other you

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:46.960 
red dies right next to each other you
can<00:03:45.890> do<00:03:46.070> the<00:03:46.160> same<00:03:46.310> thing<00:03:46.489> with<00:03:46.610> all<00:03:46.760> the

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
can do the same thing with all the

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.720 
can do the same thing with all the
different<00:03:47.450> ones<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.840> you<00:03:48.680> simply<00:03:48.860> just<00:03:49.040> throw

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
different ones and you simply just throw

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.060 
different ones and you simply just throw
the<00:03:49.910> two<00:03:50.300> dies<00:03:50.810> of<00:03:51.110> any<00:03:51.260> color<00:03:51.530> next<00:03:51.800> to<00:03:51.920> each

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
the two dies of any color next to each

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.790 
the two dies of any color next to each
other<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.459> it'll<00:03:52.880> create<00:03:53.209> eight<00:03:53.510> drops<00:03:54.200> so

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
other and it'll create eight drops so

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.410 
other and it'll create eight drops so
I'm<00:03:55.160> gonna<00:03:55.310> show<00:03:55.430> you<00:03:55.520> guys<00:03:55.640> that<00:03:55.790> as<00:03:55.850> well<00:03:56.180> so

would actually be pretty cool you guys
can<00:04:08.000> also<00:04:08.120> use<00:04:08.360> you<00:04:08.660> know<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:08.840> stairs<00:04:09.110> kind<00:04:09.410> of

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
can also use you know the stairs kind of

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.870 
can also use you know the stairs kind of
make<00:04:09.560> everything<00:04:09.860> match<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.520> little<00:04:10.700> bit

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
make everything match a little bit

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.400 
make everything match a little bit
better<00:04:11.060> and<00:04:11.420> it<00:04:11.540> kind<00:04:11.810> of<00:04:11.840> looks<00:04:11.989> pretty<00:04:12.200> cool

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
better and it kind of looks pretty cool

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.790 
better and it kind of looks pretty cool
like<00:04:12.590> that

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
like that

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.630 
like that
also<00:04:13.760> things<00:04:14.030> like<00:04:14.120> slabs<00:04:14.600> so<00:04:15.080> oh<00:04:15.709> that<00:04:16.340> was<00:04:16.609> a

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
also things like slabs so oh that was a

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.449 
also things like slabs so oh that was a
little<00:04:16.880> bit<00:04:17.060> of<00:04:17.150> a<00:04:17.209> glitch<00:04:17.419> there<00:04:17.660> um<00:04:18.230> so<00:04:19.010> you

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
little bit of a glitch there um so you

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.650

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
can as you can use things like these

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.080 
can as you can use things like these
slabs<00:04:20.960> and<00:04:21.320> do<00:04:22.010> all<00:04:22.130> cool<00:04:22.400> stuff<00:04:22.669> like<00:04:22.789> that

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
can also use these oversaturated blocks

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.550 
can also use these oversaturated blocks
to<00:04:32.370> add<00:04:32.460> accents<00:04:33.000> so<00:04:33.210> moving<00:04:34.200> on<00:04:34.290> from<00:04:34.320> there

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
to add accents so moving on from there

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.880 
to add accents so moving on from there
we're<00:04:34.830> going<00:04:35.070> to<00:04:35.220> then<00:04:35.460> talk<00:04:35.730> about<00:04:35.790> the

we're going to then talk about the

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.720 
we're going to then talk about the

these ones actually look pretty cool so
I<00:04:58.770> think<00:04:58.830> I<00:04:59.100> think<00:04:59.310> that<00:04:59.340> could<00:04:59.670> definitely<00:04:59.940> be

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
I think I think that could definitely be

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.450 
I think I think that could definitely be
something<00:05:00.630> that's<00:05:00.900> neat<00:05:01.200> and<00:05:02.100> that<00:05:02.310> in<00:05:02.430> fact

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
something that's neat and that in fact

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.890 
something that's neat and that in fact
the<00:05:02.760> green<00:05:02.940> of<00:05:03.060> any<00:05:03.210> color<00:05:03.450> actually<00:05:03.630> looks

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
the green of any color actually looks

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.720 
the green of any color actually looks
kind<00:05:04.140> of<00:05:04.170> cool<00:05:04.320> so<00:05:04.620> then<00:05:05.100> we<00:05:05.190> got<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:05.460> you<00:05:05.640> know

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
the cobblestone and then chisels

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.980 
the cobblestone and then chisels
chiseled<00:05:08.820> stone<00:05:08.970> which<00:05:09.330> actually<00:05:09.660> these<00:05:09.810> ones

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
chiseled stone which actually these ones

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.420 
chiseled stone which actually these ones
kind<00:05:10.260> of<00:05:10.320> do<00:05:10.440> look<00:05:10.620> neat<00:05:10.800> I<00:05:10.890> really<00:05:11.130> do<00:05:11.250> like

middle ones so again these are these guy
drops<00:05:24.900> are<00:05:25.169> created<00:05:25.530> from<00:05:25.680> the<00:05:25.890> the<00:05:26.190> die

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
drops are created from the the die

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.159 
drops are created from the the die
themselves<00:05:26.880> and<00:05:27.570> now<00:05:27.690> we're<00:05:27.870> going<00:05:27.960> to<00:05:28.020> talk

themselves and now we're going to talk

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.260 
themselves and now we're going to talk
about<00:05:28.290> the<00:05:28.470> red<00:05:28.710> fence<00:05:29.070> the<00:05:29.430> red<00:05:29.700> glow<00:05:30.030> stone

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
about the red fence the red glow stone

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.860 
about the red fence the red glow stone
the<00:05:30.660> pastel<00:05:31.440> colors<00:05:31.490> the<00:05:32.490> red<00:05:32.640> sand<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.450> dye

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
the pastel colors the red sand the dye

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.080 
the pastel colors the red sand the dye
blocks<00:05:34.260> the<00:05:34.710> iron<00:05:35.130> blocks<00:05:35.400> and<00:05:35.669> then<00:05:35.880> the

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
blocks the iron blocks and then the

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.300 
blocks the iron blocks and then the
glass<00:05:36.480> so<00:05:36.930> things<00:05:37.470> like<00:05:37.560> the<00:05:37.680> red<00:05:37.830> fence<00:05:38.100> are

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
glass so things like the red fence are

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.380 
glass so things like the red fence are
just<00:05:38.430> going<00:05:38.520> to<00:05:38.610> be<00:05:38.669> fence<00:05:38.880> around<00:05:39.090> the<00:05:39.240> die

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
just going to be fence around the die

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.240 
just going to be fence around the die
like<00:05:39.690> I<00:05:39.780> showed<00:05:39.960> you<00:05:40.020> earlier<00:05:40.320> the<00:05:40.800> glowstone

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
like I showed you earlier the glowstone

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.980 
like I showed you earlier the glowstone
is<00:05:41.490> just<00:05:41.760> going<00:05:42.270> to<00:05:42.360> be<00:05:42.419> basically<00:05:42.720> how<00:05:42.930> you

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
is just going to be basically how you

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.260 
is just going to be basically how you
would<00:05:43.110> make<00:05:43.650> a<00:05:43.710> normal<00:05:44.340> glow<00:05:44.700> stone<00:05:44.940> except

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
would make a normal glow stone except

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.330 
would make a normal glow stone except
for<00:05:45.390> instead<00:05:45.750> of<00:05:45.810> all<00:05:46.200> four<00:05:46.800> glowstone<00:05:47.280> dust

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
for instead of all four glowstone dust

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.680 
for instead of all four glowstone dust
students<00:05:47.850> you're<00:05:47.970> gonna<00:05:48.090> put<00:05:48.270> a<00:05:48.300> die<00:05:48.419> drop

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
students you're gonna put a die drop

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.390 
students you're gonna put a die drop
there<00:05:48.900> and<00:05:49.020> it'll<00:05:49.110> create<00:05:49.470> one<00:05:49.740> so<00:05:50.250> this<00:05:50.340> is

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
there and it'll create one so this is

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.010 
there and it'll create one so this is
one<00:05:50.640> of<00:05:50.700> the<00:05:50.760> more<00:05:50.850> expensive<00:05:51.120> ones<00:05:51.360> the

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
one of the more expensive ones the

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.409 
one of the more expensive ones the
pastel<00:05:52.590> is<00:05:52.830> simply<00:05:53.250> instead<00:05:53.760> of<00:05:53.850> throwing<00:05:54.120> in

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
pastel is simply instead of throwing in

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.570 
pastel is simply instead of throwing in
two<00:05:54.750> rose<00:05:55.260> red<00:05:55.620> like<00:05:56.040> you<00:05:56.190> did<00:05:56.370> for<00:05:56.400> the

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
two rose red like you did for the

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.070 
two rose red like you did for the
oversaturated<00:05:57.419> one<00:05:57.600> of<00:05:57.690> them<00:05:57.780> is<00:05:57.870> just<00:05:57.990> going

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
oversaturated one of them is just going

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.420 
oversaturated one of them is just going
to<00:05:58.169> be<00:05:58.260> bonemeal<00:05:58.710> and<00:05:58.950> we'll<00:05:59.040> make<00:05:59.160> it<00:05:59.190> like<00:05:59.400> a

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
to be bonemeal and we'll make it like a

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.610 
to be bonemeal and we'll make it like a
lighter<00:05:59.790> sort<00:06:00.090> of<00:06:00.240> color<00:06:00.450> so<00:06:01.020> less<00:06:01.200> intense

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
lighter sort of color so less intense

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.110 
lighter sort of color so less intense
opposed<00:06:02.040> to<00:06:02.190> the<00:06:02.310> oversaturated<00:06:02.910> which<00:06:03.000> is

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
opposed to the oversaturated which is

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.700 
opposed to the oversaturated which is
more<00:06:03.330> intense<00:06:03.570> the<00:06:04.020> sand<00:06:04.260> is<00:06:04.410> just<00:06:04.560> going<00:06:04.650> to

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
more intense the sand is just going to

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.800 
more intense the sand is just going to
be<00:06:04.830> a<00:06:04.860> diet<00:06:05.100> drops<00:06:05.340> rounded<00:06:05.790> by<00:06:05.910> sand<00:06:06.210> kind<00:06:06.750> of

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
be a diet drops rounded by sand kind of

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.300 
be a diet drops rounded by sand kind of
like<00:06:06.930> the<00:06:07.020> other<00:06:07.140> ESPYs<00:06:07.530> then<00:06:07.979> the<00:06:08.130> die<00:06:08.280> block

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
like the other ESPYs then the die block

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.100 
like the other ESPYs then the die block
is<00:06:08.700> just<00:06:08.910> going<00:06:09.030> to<00:06:09.150> be<00:06:09.240> all<00:06:09.390> of<00:06:09.570> the<00:06:09.660> dyes<00:06:09.840> you

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
is just going to be all of the dyes you

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.370 
is just going to be all of the dyes you
can<00:06:10.290> kind<00:06:10.470> of<00:06:10.560> expected<00:06:11.460> that<00:06:11.610> and<00:06:11.820> the<00:06:12.510> red

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
can kind of expected that and the red

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.600 
can kind of expected that and the red
iron<00:06:13.740> block<00:06:13.919> is<00:06:14.040> going<00:06:14.160> to<00:06:14.220> be<00:06:14.280> a<00:06:14.310> little<00:06:14.460> bit

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
iron block is going to be a little bit

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.550 
iron block is going to be a little bit
different<00:06:14.940> you<00:06:15.000> guys<00:06:15.180> will<00:06:15.419> only<00:06:15.720> use<00:06:15.960> four<00:06:16.380> of

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
different you guys will only use four of

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.219 
different you guys will only use four of
them<00:06:16.820> around<00:06:17.820> a<00:06:18.030> rose<00:06:18.270> red<00:06:18.510> dye<00:06:18.660> opposed<00:06:19.020> to

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
them around a rose red dye opposed to

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.380 
them around a rose red dye opposed to
the<00:06:19.440> eight<00:06:19.470> and<00:06:20.010> then<00:06:20.430> finally<00:06:20.820> the<00:06:20.970> glass<00:06:21.150> is

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:21.390 
the eight and then finally the glass is

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.810 
the eight and then finally the glass is
just<00:06:21.419> again<00:06:21.870> eight<00:06:22.080> around<00:06:22.440> a<00:06:22.620> die<00:06:22.800> drop<00:06:23.190> so<00:06:23.580> I

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
just again eight around a die drop so I

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.580 
just again eight around a die drop so I
can<00:06:24.060> show<00:06:24.150> you<00:06:24.210> guys<00:06:24.300> these<00:06:24.570> ones<00:06:24.840> so<00:06:25.229> the

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
can show you guys these ones so the

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.990 
can show you guys these ones so the
glass<00:06:25.800> actually<00:06:26.040> looks<00:06:26.370> pretty<00:06:26.640> interesting

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
glass actually looks pretty interesting

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.690 
glass actually looks pretty interesting
and<00:06:27.570> oh<00:06:27.840> there<00:06:28.590> we<00:06:28.710> go<00:06:28.830> it<00:06:29.160> actually<00:06:29.310> looks<00:06:29.550> ten

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
and oh there we go it actually looks ten

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.040 
and oh there we go it actually looks ten
interesting<00:06:30.210> and<00:06:30.330> depending<00:06:30.630> on<00:06:30.690> the<00:06:30.810> color

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
interesting and depending on the color

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.640 
interesting and depending on the color
this<00:06:31.410> could<00:06:31.620> add<00:06:31.800> you<00:06:32.039> know<00:06:32.160> pretty

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
this could add you know pretty

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.180 
this could add you know pretty
affect<00:06:33.070> your<00:06:33.370> your<00:06:33.970> minecraft<00:06:34.479> game<00:06:35.100> you<00:06:36.100> know

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 
affect your your minecraft game you know

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.890 
affect your your minecraft game you know
throwing<00:06:36.490> up<00:06:36.699> like<00:06:36.850> a<00:06:36.880> rainbow<00:06:37.240> you<00:06:37.810> know

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
throwing up like a rainbow you know

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.870 
throwing up like a rainbow you know
window<00:06:38.350> or<00:06:38.530> something<00:06:38.860> or<00:06:39.040> making<00:06:39.370> you<00:06:39.790> know

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
window or something or making you know

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.580 
window or something or making you know
stained-glass<00:06:40.300> windows<00:06:41.050> or<00:06:41.259> something<00:06:41.530> I

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
stained-glass windows or something I

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.260 
stained-glass windows or something I
definitely<00:06:41.770> think<00:06:42.070> that<00:06:42.160> could<00:06:42.400> be<00:06:42.430> cool<00:06:42.520> I

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
definitely think that could be cool I

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.360 
definitely think that could be cool I
don't<00:06:43.900> really<00:06:44.139> like<00:06:44.380> the<00:06:44.560> iron<00:06:44.770> blocks<00:06:45.160> I

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
don't really like the iron blocks I

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.340 
don't really like the iron blocks I
think<00:06:45.610> you<00:06:45.759> know<00:06:45.910> it<00:06:46.120> it<00:06:46.690> just<00:06:46.840> kind<00:06:47.020> of<00:06:47.139> looks

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350 
think you know it it just kind of looks

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.960 
think you know it it just kind of looks
like<00:06:47.410> a<00:06:47.680> tinted<00:06:48.520> iron<00:06:49.150> block<00:06:50.580> and<00:06:51.580> it's<00:06:51.820> not

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970 
like a tinted iron block and it's not

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.939 
like a tinted iron block and it's not
really<00:06:52.180> changed<00:06:52.509> that<00:06:52.690> much<00:06:52.750> but<00:06:53.289> what<00:06:53.830> can

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:53.949 
really changed that much but what can

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:55.469 
really changed that much but what can
you<00:06:53.979> do<00:06:54.160> I<00:06:54.370> don't

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:55.479 
you do I don't

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:58.439 
you do I don't
again<00:06:55.840> the<00:06:56.169> textures<00:06:56.680> for<00:06:57.190> the<00:06:57.310> the<00:06:57.910> dye

00:06:58.439 --> 00:06:58.449 
again the textures for the the dye

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:00.060 
again the textures for the the dye
blocks<00:06:58.810> I<00:06:58.990> think<00:06:59.199> those<00:06:59.350> could<00:06:59.590> be<00:06:59.680> cooler<00:06:59.919> it

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.070 
blocks I think those could be cooler it

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.439 
blocks I think those could be cooler it
is<00:07:00.190> really<00:07:00.460> cool<00:07:00.610> that<00:07:00.789> you<00:07:00.880> can<00:07:01.000> condense

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:01.449 
is really cool that you can condense

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:03.180 
is really cool that you can condense
them<00:07:01.750> though<00:07:01.900> so<00:07:02.350> you<00:07:02.410> know<00:07:02.620> nine<00:07:02.860> of<00:07:03.039> these

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:03.190 
them though so you know nine of these

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.610 
them though so you know nine of these
into<00:07:03.490> one<00:07:03.669> so<00:07:04.479> you<00:07:04.570> can<00:07:04.720> you<00:07:04.840> know<00:07:04.960> save<00:07:05.440> on

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:05.620 
into one so you can you know save on

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.050 
into one so you can you know save on
space<00:07:05.830> because<00:07:06.250> if<00:07:06.400> you<00:07:06.520> have<00:07:06.699> this<00:07:06.850> mod

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.060 
space because if you have this mod

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.010 
space because if you have this mod
you're<00:07:07.210> probably<00:07:07.360> gonna<00:07:07.539> be<00:07:07.630> collecting<00:07:07.960> a

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020 
you're probably gonna be collecting a

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.140 
you're probably gonna be collecting a
lot<00:07:08.169> of<00:07:08.199> dyes<00:07:08.440> you<00:07:08.979> got<00:07:09.130> the<00:07:09.250> red<00:07:09.460> sand<00:07:09.789> which<00:07:10.030> I

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.150 
lot of dyes you got the red sand which I

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.730 
lot of dyes you got the red sand which I
actually<00:07:10.240> do<00:07:10.570> like<00:07:10.750> I<00:07:10.960> think<00:07:11.139> this<00:07:11.410> is<00:07:11.500> pretty

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:11.740 
actually do like I think this is pretty

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.290 
actually do like I think this is pretty
cool<00:07:12.039> and<00:07:12.729> if<00:07:12.850> you<00:07:12.940> want<00:07:13.090> to<00:07:13.180> make<00:07:13.270> a

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.300 
cool and if you want to make a

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.730 
cool and if you want to make a
multicolored<00:07:13.930> sand<00:07:14.199> floor<00:07:14.410> I<00:07:14.470> think<00:07:14.620> this

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:14.740 
multicolored sand floor I think this

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.620 
multicolored sand floor I think this
looks<00:07:14.919> better<00:07:15.070> than<00:07:15.340> normal<00:07:15.729> sand<00:07:15.970> anyway<00:07:16.389> and

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:16.630 
looks better than normal sand anyway and

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.050 
looks better than normal sand anyway and
then<00:07:17.139> also<00:07:17.560> the<00:07:17.770> glowstone<00:07:18.250> so<00:07:18.430> the<00:07:18.550> sad<00:07:18.880> thing

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:19.060 
then also the glowstone so the sad thing

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.790 
then also the glowstone so the sad thing
about<00:07:19.090> the<00:07:19.330> glowstone<00:07:19.630> is<00:07:19.810> it<00:07:19.960> does<00:07:20.139> not<00:07:20.380> emit

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 
about the glowstone is it does not emit

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.189 
about the glowstone is it does not emit
a<00:07:20.979> red<00:07:21.280> light<00:07:21.610> so<00:07:21.970> you<00:07:22.449> know<00:07:22.600> like<00:07:23.080> normal

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199
