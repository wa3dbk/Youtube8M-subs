00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.290 
ring system so we will say they did
kinda<00:04:53.960> rip<00:04:54.110> that<00:04:54.290> from<00:04:54.640> Nokia<00:04:55.640> but<00:04:55.970> seeing<00:04:56.210> is

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
kinda rip that from Nokia but seeing is

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.970 
kinda rip that from Nokia but seeing is
it's<00:04:56.450> the<00:04:56.540> best<00:04:56.750> system<00:04:56.930> for<00:04:57.140> mobile<00:04:57.440> manual

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
it's the best system for mobile manual

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.640 
it's the best system for mobile manual
controls<00:04:58.370> we've<00:04:58.580> seen<00:04:58.930> softer<00:04:59.930> Lenovo<00:05:00.380> in<00:05:00.560> a

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
controls we've seen softer Lenovo in a

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.100 
controls we've seen softer Lenovo in a
way<00:05:00.800> you<00:05:01.700> can<00:05:02.090> control<00:05:02.450> really<00:05:02.780> really

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
way you can control really really

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.200 
way you can control really really
similar<00:05:03.350> stuff<00:05:03.740> so<00:05:03.980> exposure<00:05:04.700> control

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
similar stuff so exposure control

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.530 
similar stuff so exposure control
exposure<00:05:05.660> control<00:05:06.230> I<00:05:06.410> saw<00:05:06.950> I<00:05:06.980> so<00:05:07.490> focus<00:05:08.180> focus

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
exposure control I saw I so focus focus

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.020 
exposure control I saw I so focus focus
shut<00:05:08.960> speed<00:05:09.260> and<00:05:09.500> white<00:05:09.860> balance<00:05:10.220> if<00:05:10.490> we<00:05:10.820> for

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
shut speed and white balance if we for

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.390 
shut speed and white balance if we for
example<00:05:11.090> lock<00:05:11.600> focus<00:05:11.810> to<00:05:12.440> the<00:05:12.530> closest<00:05:13.010> focal

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
example lock focus to the closest focal

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.010 
example lock focus to the closest focal
range

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
range

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.010 
range
that<00:05:14.349> way<00:05:14.620> we<00:05:15.250> can<00:05:15.430> pull<00:05:16.030> in<00:05:16.210> and<00:05:16.479> take<00:05:16.990> a

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
that way we can pull in and take a

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.700 
that way we can pull in and take a
picture<00:05:17.319> of<00:05:17.470> our<00:05:17.770> Nokia<00:05:18.430> Lumia<00:05:19.240> 930<00:05:19.629> right<00:05:20.530> up

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
picture of our Nokia Lumia 930 right up

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.029 
picture of our Nokia Lumia 930 right up
close<00:05:20.860> so<00:05:21.129> we<00:05:21.250> can<00:05:21.280> see<00:05:21.669> now<00:05:22.590> my<00:05:23.590> hand<00:05:23.889> was

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
close so we can see now my hand was

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.309 
close so we can see now my hand was
shaking<00:05:24.069> pretty<00:05:24.550> crazy<00:05:24.909> there<00:05:25.300> but<00:05:25.810> hopefully

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 
shaking pretty crazy there but hopefully

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.369 
shaking pretty crazy there but hopefully
it<00:05:26.409> still<00:05:26.740> got<00:05:27.220> a<00:05:27.460> decent<00:05:28.060> shot<00:05:28.379> absolutely

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:29.379 
it still got a decent shot absolutely

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:30.300 
it still got a decent shot absolutely
did

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
did

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.430 
did
really<00:05:31.090> really<00:05:31.240> nice<00:05:31.599> sharpness<00:05:32.110> and<00:05:32.169> you<00:05:32.259> can

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
really really nice sharpness and you can

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.610 
really really nice sharpness and you can
see<00:05:32.620> where<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:32.949> focal<00:05:33.659> position<00:05:34.659> lies<00:05:35.289> that

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
see where the focal position lies that

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.460 
see where the focal position lies that
now<00:05:36.069> let's<00:05:36.280> try<00:05:36.490> that<00:05:36.669> with<00:05:36.849> the<00:05:36.879> 930<00:05:37.539> pull<00:05:38.259> out

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
now let's try that with the 930 pull out

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.219 
now let's try that with the 930 pull out
and<00:05:39.659> camera<00:05:40.659> manual<00:05:41.490> flick<00:05:42.490> down<00:05:42.729> and<00:05:43.229> let's

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
and camera manual flick down and let's

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.409 
and camera manual flick down and let's
lock<00:05:44.530> focus<00:05:44.770> on<00:05:45.129> the<00:05:45.220> closest<00:05:45.610> focal<00:05:46.000> distance

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
lock focus on the closest focal distance

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.430 
lock focus on the closest focal distance
and<00:05:47.610> hopefully<00:05:48.610> that's<00:05:49.389> also<00:05:49.780> captured<00:05:50.259> a

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
and hopefully that's also captured a

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.939 
and hopefully that's also captured a
great<00:05:51.130> shot<00:05:51.479> yep<00:05:52.479> it<00:05:52.810> has<00:05:53.169> right<00:05:53.620> there<00:05:53.650> and

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:53.949 
great shot yep it has right there and

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:55.529 
great shot yep it has right there and
again<00:05:54.130> you<00:05:54.190> can<00:05:54.460> see<00:05:54.669> pulling<00:05:55.240> into<00:05:55.419> the

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
again you can see pulling into the

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:57.210 
again you can see pulling into the
closest<00:05:55.930> focal<00:05:56.259> distance<00:05:56.620> will<00:05:56.800> immediately

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
closest focal distance will immediately

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.939 
closest focal distance will immediately
give<00:05:57.580> you<00:05:57.699> a<00:05:57.729> nice<00:05:58.000> blurry<00:05:58.539> background<00:05:59.319> 20

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
give you a nice blurry background 20

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:01.920 
give you a nice blurry background 20

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.290

make<00:06:02.169> some<00:06:02.409> smaller<00:06:02.800> so<00:06:03.340> they're<00:06:03.940> actually

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
make some smaller so they're actually

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.480 
make some smaller so they're actually
around<00:06:04.419> 5<00:06:04.690> megapixels<00:06:05.349> but<00:06:05.530> it<00:06:05.650> grabs<00:06:05.919> more

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
around 5 megapixels but it grabs more

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:07.409 
around 5 megapixels but it grabs more
accurate<00:06:06.849> colors<00:06:07.120> because<00:06:07.300> it

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
accurate colors because it

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:08.820 
accurate colors because it
conglomerate's<00:06:07.960> pictures<00:06:08.289> whereas<00:06:08.740> you've

conglomerate's pictures whereas you've

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.950

actually perform it naturally it'll have

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.100 
actually perform it naturally it'll have

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
to come down to real-world tests so

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.510 
to come down to real-world tests so
hopefully<00:06:17.440> we'll<00:06:17.560> get<00:06:17.650> the<00:06:17.800> vibe<00:06:17.979> shot<00:06:18.219> in<00:06:18.370> to
