00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 behind the world of video games there 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.540
 a long history with ups and downs there 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.519
 good and bad games there 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.650
 developers and sagas that decayed 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.110
 with the passage of time and many, many 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.289
 things more which would be impossible 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.570
 summarize but there are games those games the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.430
 which marked a before and after 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.830
 necessarily in the history of the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.869
 videogames but in each gamer by 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.090
 that today I come to you with a top 15 of the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.580
 best video games in history according to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.740
 I series which will be divided into three 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.800
 parts that I will upload next of his 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.110
 good predecessor without further preamble 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.540
 let's start with the first part and put 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.180
 from this list 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.370
 in position number 15 is found 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.410
 zelda to link to the past a game the 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.510
 which marked a stir among the gamers and 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.970
 fans of the saga after its predecessor 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.880
 zelda 2 which was quite different 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.670
 to the first one going from an aerial view to 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.130
 one in 12 in the style of mario and thus giving 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.660
 a twist to be a saga 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:04.010
 prequel taken for the super nintendo 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.900
 in 1992 the game is great one of the 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.729
 best of the saga and with some great 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.740
 graphics for the time also 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.350
 incorporating the schedule change by 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.810
 first time in the saga the game presents 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.300
 a masterful gameplay and a story 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.700
 excellent in true nintendo style 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.740
 and ethical cell going from dungeon to 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.050
 dungeon to save the princess 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.630
 zelda I will not tell the story of the game 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:30.100
 I only recommend them widely and 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.100
 deserved put in this top 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.920
 the number 14 position is taken by pacman 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.899
 yes pacman that classic of classics a 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.939
 simple game you just have to pick up 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.009
 all the points that appear in the 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.500
 screen trying to avoid the 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.689
 ghosts with an intelligence very well 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.659
 realized which can eat 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.789
 when you take the biggest point 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.039
 simple yes but addictive every level is 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.380
 it's getting harder and it's getting 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.329
 more complicated to take all the objectives 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.129
 of the game taking you to lose it and 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.680
 start again always trying 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:14.470
 break their records because as I said is 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.840
 very addictive deserved put in this top 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.200
 a game that I think everyone knows and 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.200
 They have played 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.659
 at number 13 we have metal 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.569
 gear solid snake eater of ps2 saga 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.670
 metal gear has emblematic titles 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.680
 worthy to admire and metal gear solid 3 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.900
 is not the exception a game that in my 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.930
 opinion is the best of the saga for the 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.870
 amount of things the game offers you 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.579
 camouflages weapons medicines apparatuses 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.069
 etcetera its controls are very accurate 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.260
 they respond very well to every movement and 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.920
 the cinematics of the game are great 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.629
 very long yes but excellent but of course 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.569
 the medal is taken by its gameplay 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.400
 a unique gameplay of metal gear and 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.709
 also his story one of the most 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.590
 catching video games courtesy 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.629
 from hideo kojima its creator a whole 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.459
 I'll play it if you have not played it yet 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.459
 do it you will not regret 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.810
 at number 12 we have a 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.810
 resident evil 3 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.129
 'resident evil' 3 for me is not the best 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:45.409
 of the saga for me what is resident evil 2 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.689
 but like this is a top of games that 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:50.060
 more I liked this game stays in 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:51.980
 the podium in this delivery our 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.049
 protagonist is worth him time of 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.909
 'resident evil' 1 after having passed 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.219
 everything that happened in the mansion while 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.349
 that our main enemy is nemesis 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:02.540
 which will be following us all 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.840
 I play with the intention of killing ourselves 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.120
 every really disturbing moment brings 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.639
 multiple improvements to its predecessor with 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.769
 most intelligent enemies action from 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:15.829
 the first time you play gore and 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:18.019
 much more but undoubtedly the sound 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.940
 it takes a very big recognition already 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.210
 that will get us from the beginning to 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.889
 the end of the game simply upload 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.180
 deserved 2nd place in this top and 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.180
 recommended to anyone 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.669
 at number 11 we find a 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.770
 Metal Slug 2 Arcade This game is without 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.289
 doubt the best shooting game 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.120
 in 2d of all time with everything 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.340
 respect to which is also a 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.800
 I play but I'm left with this one game 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.160
 in which we will have a large armament 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.810
 vehicles sound and much more the game 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.440
 It consists of four main characters 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.599
 which are framework arms the violin to 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.599
 each with his own charisma and 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:08.849
 attitudes however the best thing about this 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:11.340
 game by setting aside his music is his 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:15.240
 armament from machine guns 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.550
 bazookas lasers and much more is impossible 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.530
 summarize everything this game has and 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.470
 its difficulty that will make a moment 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:25.139
 great since it is very high in short 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.569
 for me the best shooting game in 2d 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.970
 which is saying a lot and recommended for 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:32.120
 anyone is ranked 11 in this 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.120
 top 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.719
 well we got to the end of the first 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:42.909
 soon I will be uploading the 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:45.400
