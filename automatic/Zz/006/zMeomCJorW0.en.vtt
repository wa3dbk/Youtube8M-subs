00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
stock pacification I've chosen this case

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.390 
stock pacification I've chosen this case
which<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.820> ID<00:00:21.810> wrong<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.470> drove<00:00:22.859> from<00:00:23.039> EVGA

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
which is the ID wrong I drove from EVGA

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.910 
which is the ID wrong I drove from EVGA
because<00:00:24.000> it's<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.269> small<00:00:24.539> form<00:00:24.810> factor<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.650> I

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
because it's a small form factor and I

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.450 
because it's a small form factor and I
live<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> tiny<00:00:26.519> apartment<00:00:26.779> so<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.460> could

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
live in a tiny apartment so I could

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.600 
live in a tiny apartment so I could
spare<00:00:29.699> some<00:00:29.880> space<00:00:30.710> so<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.769> see<00:00:31.980> it's<00:00:32.130> pretty

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
spare some space so you see it's pretty

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.920 
spare some space so you see it's pretty

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
this home is certified to 2.1 yes but

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.310 
this home is certified to 2.1 yes but
you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.230> overclock<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.070> like<00:00:56.309> 2.4<00:00:57.320> I've

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you can overclock it to like 2.4 I've

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.299 
you can overclock it to like 2.4 I've
seen<00:00:58.559> people<00:00:58.859> doing<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.579> it's<00:00:59.760> very<00:01:00.329> fast

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
seen people doing this so it's very fast

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.969 
seen people doing this so it's very fast
the<00:01:02.309> CPU<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.480> Intel<00:01:04.700> 4770k<00:01:06.229> on<00:01:07.229> which<00:01:07.530> actually

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the CPU is Intel 4770k on which actually

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.920 
the CPU is Intel 4770k on which actually
removed<00:01:08.369> at<00:01:08.820> spider<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:10.250> I<00:01:11.250> put<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> water

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
removed at spider and I put a water

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.980 
removed at spider and I put a water
block<00:01:13.260> directly<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.490> down<00:01:14.729> die<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.330> let<00:01:15.869> you

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
block directly on the down die I let you

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.870 
block directly on the down die I let you
look<00:01:16.170> into<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.500> block<00:01:16.680> for<00:01:16.860> details<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
look into the block for details but the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.480 
look into the block for details but the
good<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.320> remove<00:01:19.590> as<00:01:19.860> many

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
good of this is to remove as many

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.240 
good of this is to remove as many
calories<00:01:20.820> as<00:01:21.150> possible<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:22.590> fast<00:01:22.920> as

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
calories as possible and as fast as

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.399 
calories as possible and as fast as
possible<00:01:23.750> it's<00:01:24.750> good<00:01:24.869> for<00:01:25.049> overclocking

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
possible it's good for overclocking

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:33.410 
possible it's good for overclocking

it for the loops and also I put some

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.870 
it for the loops and also I put some
LEDs<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.750> back<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.310> custom<00:01:44.310> custom

the job pretty well and also they are

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.230 
the job pretty well and also they are
metal<00:02:08.160> which<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.550> right<00:02:08.879> because<00:02:09.060> they<00:02:09.300> are

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
the water clean kid from EVGA and also

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.930 
the water clean kid from EVGA and also
from<00:02:24.680> its<00:02:25.280> power<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:27.280> was<00:02:28.280> wondering<00:02:28.700> if<00:02:28.820> I

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
from its power I was wondering if I

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.120 
from its power I was wondering if I
would<00:02:29.120> put<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.870> click<00:02:30.320> into<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.560> bill<00:02:30.860> but

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
would put I click into the bill but

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.100 
would put I click into the bill but
actually<00:02:31.580> I<00:02:31.610> think<00:02:32.060> it's<00:02:32.390> better<00:02:32.630> a<00:02:32.720> better

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
actually I think it's better a better

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.030 
actually I think it's better a better

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
the case open with Tamara and I did some

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.330 
the case open with Tamara and I did some
like<00:03:10.970> pockets<00:03:11.450> here<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.410> there<00:03:12.470> so<00:03:13.130> if<00:03:13.220> you

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
like pockets here and there so if you

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.620 
like pockets here and there so if you
want<00:03:13.490> to<00:03:13.580> remove<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.150> disc

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
also I put some noise dampening system

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.010 
also I put some noise dampening system
so<00:03:21.110> you<00:03:21.170> literally<00:03:21.890> cannot<00:03:22.190> you<00:03:23.150> know<00:03:23.180> besides

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
I did it here you have the PSU the PSU

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.730 
I did it here you have the PSU the PSU
had<00:03:53.120> been<00:03:53.360> covered<00:03:53.720> also<00:03:54.050> with<00:03:54.200> black<00:03:54.410> ethnic

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
it looks better and I met this peach PSU

modular<00:04:00.800> which<00:04:01.760> is<00:04:01.940> probably<00:04:02.390> not<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:02.870> right

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
modular which is probably not the right

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.470 
modular which is probably not the right
term<00:04:03.440> but<00:04:03.770> what<00:04:04.100> I<00:04:04.130> did<00:04:04.370> is<00:04:04.400> I<00:04:04.550> cut<00:04:04.970> all<00:04:05.360> the

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
term but what I did is I cut all the

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.830 
term but what I did is I cut all the
cables<00:04:05.780> very<00:04:05.990> short<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.470> everything<00:04:07.310> you<00:04:07.460> see

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
cables very short and everything you see

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.640 
cables very short and everything you see
for<00:04:08.840> example<00:04:08.900> these<00:04:09.800> cables<00:04:10.900> for<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.020> GPU<00:04:12.380> are

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
for example these cables for the GPU are

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.180 
for example these cables for the GPU are
extensions<00:04:13.990> all<00:04:14.990> the<00:04:15.200> cables<00:04:15.500> are<00:04:15.620> cut<00:04:16.130> to

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
extensions all the cables are cut to

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.390 
extensions all the cables are cut to

Oh<00:04:17.430> God<00:04:21.290> alright<00:04:22.290> I<00:04:22.320> think<00:04:22.500> that's<00:04:22.800> it<00:04:24.889> so

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889

let's switch it on you can hear the rush
from<00:04:40.289> the<00:04:40.380> fans<00:04:40.889> and<00:04:41.250> pump<00:04:41.910> when<00:04:42.240> you<00:04:42.419> turn<00:04:42.750> on

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
from the fans and pump when you turn on

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.939 
from the fans and pump when you turn on
and<00:04:43.199> after<00:04:44.070> that<00:04:44.190> it's<00:04:44.430> a<00:04:44.610> pretty<00:04:45.030> quiet<00:04:45.949> which
