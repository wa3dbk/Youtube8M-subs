00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.480
 there is no point in the first year here I look at the hospital 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.480
 I myself have transferred again a wintry weather 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:19.409
 this out of it 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:24.259
 a little boy ready made by yourself doesn't matter if I have a rug 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.369
 and you need 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.369
 four colors but a pity 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.400
 to start gradually from dam to open jes and that must be a 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.810
 looking a bit like new, it doesn't have to be very late 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.760
 and then make it a bit moist because it works 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.510
 and what crystal snow crystal stocks have dissolved 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.990
 if you are so far away from it 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.690
 with the part here 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.700
 marzipan at dexia charge from through 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.690
 Kistemaker alcohol that you like 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.880
 in those parts 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.570
 in the same place two 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.910
 yes you can take it further 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.690
 must pay attention that you do not pull too far apart 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:08.680
 afp svm 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.030
 missed the broadcast 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.479
 after the break that little animal has it more because we are going to be now 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.220
 especially the breasts 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.970
 and under the robin is still on twitter that you are 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.660
 actually two hearts 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.660
 go together 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.610
 we put laughs guests fictional is mandatory paler 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.280
 it's the third quarter 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.280
 and the location in the middle of your child 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.150
 now we continue with the main part 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.690
 he has a nice tub 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.910
 and I get you all you just very easily I squeeze you 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.350
 actually that's his head 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.700
 very easy 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.700
 I write to you a bit that it has been left icc 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:11.919
 and then collapse of the upper camp 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.549
 I'll go in again 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.719
 after if you find a nice enough 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.719
 you put a ruin 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:30.839
 that's actually what we call a tree in English 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:33.989
 the shape of a 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.679
 in that you press 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.979
 with that you also push it a bit flat 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.889
 they probably think that is very much against these practices 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.739
 the only thing you need is actually a kitchen knife 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.369
 because you have to cut the few things in the beak teams 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:54.659
 I have seen that they are much too heavy 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.709
 I do everything a little bit differently it is important that they do a job
