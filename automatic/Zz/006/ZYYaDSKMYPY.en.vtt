00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.209
 Hi my friends, I'm good, I'm Diego. 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.160
 We're watching our fishing videos. 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.050
 activity materials and techniques 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.060
 and I come here today to 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.520
 demonstrate to you how to make a 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.380
 fish cracker a torresminho whats up 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.689
 of this technique that the fishermen 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.270
 much know is that with her you 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.309
 It tells you that there is a lot of thorn and 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.170
 you a sound consumes it without 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.579
 worry about the thorn that is very 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.320
 interesting because you can insert 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.329
 these fish even in the feeding of 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.520
 children to provide a more 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.810
 Healthy but without delay let's see the 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.150
 process 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.860
 the first step we need 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.930
 do is fly the fish 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.280
 here it is already clean obvious said kamei 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.230
 that the whole belligerent 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.910
 you wonder how does this process 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.980
 liquer underneath appearing to you 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.440
 access and for this we can 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.350
 use a knife even from 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.420
 kitchen or a financial hint 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.640
 When it was lethal fish use a cloth 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.219
 give you more grip and you can 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.689
 protect your hand and also 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:10.369
 I like wood because it increases the 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.659
 grip also the tax authorities to work 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:21.520
 we have to get around it then it puts 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.520
 here since this part went right there 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.549
 you basically hung up that is part of the 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:27.109
 his head 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.210
 Another part now that we're going to hang up. 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:31.579
 and here in the tail 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:47.959
 It's done now, we'll get around it. 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:52.270
 he notes that the op is this here you 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:52.270
 will bypass his spine 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:12.040
 ok facility with a sharp knife already 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.230
 are you seeing this? 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.690
 here you come in the ribs I'm going to give 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:22.000
 A tip here is basically ready just 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:26.410
 get here in the ribs 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.600
 she in the rib you can withdraw with 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.940
 rib pliers which is a technique that 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.959
 we use three or you can bypass the 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.959
 Here I go around 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:03:02.780
 op she accompanies her curvature 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:08.239
 here made into a filet I'm going to put 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:26.830
 plus one always the same fast process 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:26.830
 now come here and here 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.760
 just bypassing 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.790
 a tip in this one I already made the cup 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.290
 occurs here below 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.640
 in the other at the end 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.629
 comment here you can see that he 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.850
 have this wood 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.729
 you also have to cut here because the 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.860
 meat a hard meat that stays here like 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.780
 We 're going to make good toast this year. 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.010
 fish is the pawn you pass that we love and 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.669
 whenever he has enough thorn in the 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.100
 beef 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.410
 you can see he said it in half or not 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.720
 it is up to each of us to go 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:43.760
 to do is what we call baits that 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:43.760
 is to cut them into small pieces and 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:53.090
 always put a little force because 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.090
 because of the pm he has 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.340
 after listening to the thorns being broken 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.030
 this is almost equal to the technique of 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:10.950
 island without spin that is the countrymen usually 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.930
 talk the team there with the fish done 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.150
 wait 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.840
 I just left for another seasoning what I 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.510
 I used garlic lemon pepper and coarse salt 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.250
 I always use bread in the fish we go 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:29.130
 leave him resting here for a while and 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:31.290
 put the oil to heat the fire 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.770
 Ready to put in to fry in oil 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.770
 very hot 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:44.880
 golden coffin with amy loose here 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.710
 important industrial stove 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.840
 the temperature can not keep wobbling 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.840
 otherwise it's cool in your weakness 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.960
 When it's golden, do it. 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.780
 is ready 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.270
 The secret to this technique is 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.820
 some details among them the thickness 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.789
 you cut the fish can not cut 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.470
 very thick 2 the temperature of the fire 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:17.919
 time you'll leave it too 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:21.190
 You will have to pay the thorn that are 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:23.860
 on the surface of the meat can be 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.900
 roasted fish do not clean 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.199
 saw without talking will not work cool 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.370
 technical after everything is ready and 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:32.169
 my friends, I hope you have 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.789
 I like these techniques and tips that I

 I want to see more videos about 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:37.900
 fishing activities materials and techniques

 survival is just accessing my channel
