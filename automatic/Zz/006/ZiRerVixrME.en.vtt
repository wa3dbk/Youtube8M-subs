hi<00:00:06.950> I'm<00:00:07.100> John<00:00:07.340> Spencer<00:00:07.670> Ellis<00:00:07.970> of<00:00:08.120> John

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:08.389 
hi I'm John Spencer Ellis of John

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.180 
hi I'm John Spencer Ellis of John
Spencer<00:00:08.750> Ellis<00:00:08.990> calm<00:00:09.410> and<00:00:09.650> in<00:00:09.830> this<00:00:09.980> video

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
Spencer Ellis calm and in this video

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.980 
Spencer Ellis calm and in this video
you're<00:00:10.580> going<00:00:10.639> to<00:00:10.879> learn<00:00:10.999> if<00:00:11.509> the<00:00:11.660> pectoralis

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
you're going to learn if the pectoralis

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.289 
you're going to learn if the pectoralis
muscles<00:00:12.709> are<00:00:12.950> involved<00:00:13.400> in<00:00:13.759> the<00:00:13.999> plank

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:14.299 
muscles are involved in the plank

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.950 
muscles are involved in the plank
movement<00:00:15.019> the<00:00:15.589> answer<00:00:16.070> is<00:00:16.400> they<00:00:17.060> are<00:00:17.090> involved

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
movement the answer is they are involved

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.919 
movement the answer is they are involved
to<00:00:18.410> some<00:00:18.710> degree<00:00:19.130> but<00:00:19.550> not<00:00:19.609> as<00:00:19.970> much<00:00:20.269> as<00:00:20.510> say<00:00:20.900> a

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:20.929 
to some degree but not as much as say a

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:23.230 
to some degree but not as much as say a
bench<00:00:21.259> press<00:00:21.619> or<00:00:21.890> a<00:00:21.949> dumbbell<00:00:22.460> fly<00:00:22.789> or<00:00:23.150> a

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
bench press or a dumbbell fly or a

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.660 
bench press or a dumbbell fly or a
push-up<00:00:23.570> and<00:00:24.109> here's<00:00:24.439> why<00:00:24.650> so<00:00:25.039> there's

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
push-up and here's why so there's

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.249 
push-up and here's why so there's
different<00:00:25.759> types<00:00:26.179> of<00:00:26.390> plank<00:00:26.630> motions<00:00:27.050> the

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
different types of plank motions the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.800 
different types of plank motions the
first<00:00:27.470> one<00:00:27.769> is<00:00:28.009> just<00:00:28.970> like<00:00:29.119> doing<00:00:29.330> a<00:00:29.570> push-up

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
first one is just like doing a push-up

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.560 
first one is just like doing a push-up
so<00:00:30.380> I<00:00:30.410> found<00:00:30.710> out<00:00:30.800> my<00:00:30.980> fingers<00:00:31.369> hands<00:00:32.270> directly

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
so I found out my fingers hands directly

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.190 
so I found out my fingers hands directly
under<00:00:32.900> my<00:00:33.050> shoulder<00:00:33.440> is<00:00:33.560> the<00:00:33.590> same<00:00:33.950> with<00:00:35.200> good

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
under my shoulder is the same with good

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.119 
under my shoulder is the same with good
control<00:00:36.739> right<00:00:36.980> here<00:00:37.039> engage<00:00:37.489> the<00:00:37.820> ends<00:00:38.149> so

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
control right here engage the ends so

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.639 
control right here engage the ends so
although<00:00:40.129> my<00:00:40.879> chest<00:00:41.270> is<00:00:41.480> involved<00:00:41.870> some<00:00:42.230> to

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
although my chest is involved some to

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.610 
although my chest is involved some to
hold<00:00:42.860> me<00:00:42.980> up<00:00:43.129> so<00:00:43.670> are<00:00:43.820> my<00:00:43.969> triceps<00:00:44.510> so<00:00:45.440> are<00:00:45.530> my

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
hold me up so are my triceps so are my

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.459 
hold me up so are my triceps so are my
deltoids<00:00:46.129> my<00:00:46.250> shoulders<00:00:46.670> and<00:00:46.850> even<00:00:47.750> the

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
deltoids my shoulders and even the

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.110 
deltoids my shoulders and even the
muscles<00:00:48.920> in<00:00:49.039> my<00:00:49.070> upper<00:00:49.160> back<00:00:49.520> in<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:49.940> lower

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
muscles in my upper back in the lower

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.599 
muscles in my upper back in the lower
back<00:00:50.359> and<00:00:50.629> into<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:50.899> legs<00:00:51.140> to<00:00:51.410> some<00:00:51.590> extent<00:00:52.010> so

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
back and into the legs to some extent so

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.139 
back and into the legs to some extent so
this<00:00:52.850> is<00:00:52.969> a<00:00:53.000> static<00:00:53.629> motion<00:00:54.260> so<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.460> pectoral

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
this is a static motion so the pectoral

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.090 
this is a static motion so the pectoral
muscles<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:56.629> chest<00:00:56.870> muscles<00:00:57.289> are<00:00:57.530> involved

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
muscles the chest muscles are involved

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.360 
muscles the chest muscles are involved
but<00:00:58.250> only<00:00:58.609> at<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.660> given<00:01:00.320> amount<00:01:00.590> and<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.250> will

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
but only at a given amount and you will

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.160 
but only at a given amount and you will
only<00:01:01.609> gain<00:01:02.000> strength<00:01:02.570> at<00:01:03.350> this<00:01:03.920> point<00:01:04.370> of

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
only gain strength at this point of

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.109 
only gain strength at this point of
flexion<00:01:06.170> of<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:06.770> muscle<00:01:07.189> so<00:01:07.369> any<00:01:07.549> static

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
flexion of the muscle so any static

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.080 
flexion of the muscle so any static
exercise<00:01:08.960> that<00:01:09.140> you<00:01:09.290> do<00:01:09.490> you<00:01:10.490> only<00:01:10.729> gain

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
exercise that you do you only gain

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.719 
exercise that you do you only gain
strength<00:01:11.540> and<00:01:11.750> a<00:01:11.810> benefit<00:01:12.290> at<00:01:12.770> that<00:01:13.220> point<00:01:13.580> the

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
strength and a benefit at that point the

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.429 
strength and a benefit at that point the
flexion<00:01:14.119> or<00:01:14.360> extension<00:01:14.869> you<00:01:15.110> know<00:01:15.200> for

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
flexion or extension you know for

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:16.899 
flexion or extension you know for
example<00:01:15.530> with<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.009> bicep<00:01:16.369> curl<00:01:16.400> if<00:01:16.640> I<00:01:16.700> just

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
example with the bicep curl if I just

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.240 
example with the bicep curl if I just
did<00:01:17.030> a<00:01:17.060> static<00:01:17.540> motion<00:01:17.750> here<00:01:18.259> my<00:01:18.920> muscles

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
did a static motion here my muscles

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.980 
did a static motion here my muscles
really<00:01:19.430> only<00:01:19.640> again<00:01:19.880> it<00:01:20.000> gets<00:01:20.090> strong<00:01:20.450> at<00:01:20.720> that

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
really only again it gets strong at that

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.080 
really only again it gets strong at that
point<00:01:21.290> a<00:01:21.409> flexion<00:01:21.829> so<00:01:22.520> you<00:01:22.610> have<00:01:22.700> to<00:01:22.790> keep<00:01:22.939> that

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
point a flexion so you have to keep that

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.810 
point a flexion so you have to keep that
in<00:01:23.270> mind<00:01:23.479> but<00:01:23.990> it<00:01:24.110> is<00:01:24.259> involved<00:01:24.799> another<00:01:25.700> way

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
in mind but it is involved another way

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.390 
in mind but it is involved another way
of<00:01:25.939> doing<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.390> plank<00:01:26.659> is<00:01:26.930> a<00:01:27.680> parallel<00:01:28.189> grip

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
of doing the plank is a parallel grip

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.950 
of doing the plank is a parallel grip
sometimes<00:01:28.820> people<00:01:29.060> like<00:01:29.210> to<00:01:29.329> do<00:01:29.600> it<00:01:29.689> like<00:01:29.720> this

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
sometimes people like to do it like this

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.740 
sometimes people like to do it like this
it's<00:01:30.200> a<00:01:30.290> thumb<00:01:30.530> up<00:01:30.560> position<00:01:31.159> a<00:01:31.450> little<00:01:32.450> easier

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
it's a thumb up position a little easier

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.380 
it's a thumb up position a little easier
to<00:01:32.869> see<00:01:33.049> if<00:01:33.170> I<00:01:33.259> do<00:01:33.320> my<00:01:33.500> thumbs<00:01:33.740> up<00:01:33.920> like<00:01:34.100> this

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
to see if I do my thumbs up like this

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.670 
to see if I do my thumbs up like this
elbows<00:01:35.390> directly<00:01:35.659> under<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.079> shoulders

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
elbows directly under the shoulders

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
elbows directly under the shoulders
and<00:01:37.659> so<00:01:38.659> I<00:01:38.689> hold<00:01:38.990> myself<00:01:39.110> here<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:39.979> of<00:01:40.670> course

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
and so I hold myself here and of course

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.600 
and so I hold myself here and of course
if<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:41.119> need<00:01:41.299> to<00:01:41.509> you<00:01:42.470> can<00:01:42.649> start<00:01:42.979> with<00:01:43.369> a<00:01:43.399> bent

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
if you need to you can start with a bent

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.929 
if you need to you can start with a bent
knee<00:01:43.729> position<00:01:44.090> that's<00:01:44.509> fine<00:01:44.780> as<00:01:44.960> well<00:01:44.990> and

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
knee position that's fine as well and

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.069 
knee position that's fine as well and
then<00:01:46.939> so<00:01:47.149> if<00:01:47.240> I<00:01:47.329> go<00:01:47.450> back<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.750> this<00:01:47.869> position

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
then so if I go back to this position

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.830 
then so if I go back to this position
the<00:01:48.530> third<00:01:48.860> option<00:01:49.130> is<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.579> clasp<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.390> hands

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
the third option is to clasp the hands

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.940 
the third option is to clasp the hands
together<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:52.600> then<00:01:53.600> on<00:01:53.780> this<00:01:53.960> one<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:54.770> can

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
together and then on this one you can

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.800 
together and then on this one you can
slightly<00:01:55.340> squeeze<00:01:55.850> your<00:01:56.030> chest<00:01:56.299> a<00:01:56.509> little<00:01:56.540> bit

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
slightly squeeze your chest a little bit

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.590 
slightly squeeze your chest a little bit
more<00:01:57.009> so<00:01:58.009> out<00:01:58.310> of<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.640> three<00:01:58.939> options<00:01:59.119> this

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
more so out of the three options this

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.120 
more so out of the three options this
would<00:01:59.810> probably<00:02:00.020> work<00:02:00.229> your<00:02:00.590> chest<00:02:00.799> a<00:02:00.979> bit

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
would probably work your chest a bit

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.340 
would probably work your chest a bit
more<00:02:01.340> because<00:02:01.460> I<00:02:01.610> could<00:02:01.759> squeeze<00:02:02.149> in<00:02:02.479> with<00:02:03.200> my

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
more because I could squeeze in with my

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.960 
more because I could squeeze in with my
elbows<00:02:03.740> as<00:02:03.950> well<00:02:04.360> but<00:02:05.360> it's<00:02:05.539> still

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
elbows as well but it's still

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.510 
elbows as well but it's still
only<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.480> minimal<00:02:07.050> amount<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.440> work<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:07.980> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
only a minimal amount of work on the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.190 
only a minimal amount of work on the
chest<00:02:08.759> what's<00:02:09.300> important<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.930> don't<00:02:10.080> want

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
chest what's important is you don't want

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.800 
chest what's important is you don't want
to<00:02:10.259> come<00:02:10.770> forward<00:02:11.130> and<00:02:11.370> collapse<00:02:11.640> here<00:02:11.970> or<00:02:12.630> it

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
to come forward and collapse here or it

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.960 
to come forward and collapse here or it
gets<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.020> rounded<00:02:13.560> like<00:02:13.740> this<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.700> want<00:02:14.880> to

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
gets so rounded like this you want to

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.080 
gets so rounded like this you want to
emphasize<00:02:16.040> straight<00:02:17.040> up<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.340> down<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.790> then

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
emphasize straight up and down and then

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.150 
emphasize straight up and down and then
slightly<00:02:19.190> from<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:20.370> position<00:02:20.820> I'm<00:02:20.970> slightly

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
slightly from this position I'm slightly

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.530 
slightly from this position I'm slightly
retracting<00:02:23.160> pulling<00:02:23.820> back<00:02:24.000> my<00:02:24.180> shoulder

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
retracting pulling back my shoulder

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.930 
retracting pulling back my shoulder
blades<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.340> imagine<00:02:26.340> your<00:02:26.430> shoulder<00:02:26.700> blades

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
blades so imagine your shoulder blades

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.670 
blades so imagine your shoulder blades
here<00:02:27.240> you're<00:02:27.690> pulling<00:02:28.110> them<00:02:28.230> slightly

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
here you're pulling them slightly

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.550 
here you're pulling them slightly
together<00:02:29.070> once<00:02:30.030> I'm<00:02:30.210> in<00:02:30.450> this<00:02:30.630> position<00:02:31.170> to

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
together once I'm in this position to

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.550 
together once I'm in this position to
keep<00:02:31.770> a<00:02:31.980> neutral<00:02:32.250> spine<00:02:32.880> rather<00:02:33.780> than<00:02:34.080> pushing

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
keep a neutral spine rather than pushing

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.550 
keep a neutral spine rather than pushing
myself<00:02:34.710> out<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.400> becoming<00:02:35.820> more<00:02:36.560> rounded

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
myself out and becoming more rounded

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.910 
myself out and becoming more rounded
like<00:02:37.710> that<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:39.450> there<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:39.750> go<00:02:39.930> now<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.590> know

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
like that so there you go now you know

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.010 
like that so there you go now you know
how<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.490> pectoralis<00:02:41.970> muscles<00:02:42.510> are<00:02:42.690> involved

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
how the pectoralis muscles are involved

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.470 
how the pectoralis muscles are involved
