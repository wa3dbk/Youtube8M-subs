started my dash kit install this is how
we<00:00:29.130> came<00:00:29.400> out

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.000 

we<00:00:50.170> would<00:00:50.410> stain<00:00:50.800> pretty<00:00:51.339> close<00:00:51.640> to<00:00:52.859> what<00:00:53.859> the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
we would stain pretty close to what the

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:02.719 
we would stain pretty close to what the
original<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:56.909> plastic<00:01:00.269> now<00:01:01.269> I<00:01:01.300> got<00:01:01.629> to<00:01:01.750> get

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
original is plastic now I got to get

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.340 
original is plastic now I got to get
some<00:01:03.729> decals<00:01:04.210> made<00:01:04.860> with<00:01:05.860> a<00:01:05.890> different

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
some decals made with a different

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.450 
some decals made with a different
switches<00:01:08.350> for<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.710> AC<00:01:09.100> control<00:01:09.310> I<00:01:10.890> know<00:01:11.890> what

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
switches for the AC control I know what

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.940 
switches for the AC control I know what
they<00:01:12.640> are<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:12.850> what<00:01:13.149> they<00:01:13.330> do<00:01:13.390> but<00:01:13.869> I<00:01:14.140> just

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
they are and what they do but I just

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:32.669 
they are and what they do but I just
want<00:01:15.189> to<00:01:15.310> look<00:01:15.869> better<00:01:16.869> I<00:01:31.409> got<00:01:32.409> a<00:01:32.440> little

want to look better I got a little

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:39.210 
want to look better I got a little
something<00:01:33.100> in<00:01:33.159> here<00:01:37.560> working<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.709> build<00:01:38.890> it<00:01:39.100> up

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
something in here working to build it up

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.410 
something in here working to build it up
a<00:01:39.580> couple<00:01:40.569> batteries<00:01:41.049> over<00:01:41.319> there<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:43.270> got

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
a couple batteries over there it's got

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.169 
a couple batteries over there it's got
two<00:01:43.630> Tweel's<00:01:44.020> in<00:01:44.289> here<00:01:44.440> right<00:01:44.649> now<00:01:45.119> me

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.540 

voltages<00:01:50.700> not<00:01:51.700> nearly<00:01:52.000> what<00:01:52.209> it<00:01:52.270> needs<00:01:52.539> to<00:01:52.720> be

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
voltages not nearly what it needs to be

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.510 
voltages not nearly what it needs to be
definitely<00:01:54.550> ultimate<00:01:56.459> high<00:01:57.459> output

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
definitely ultimate high output

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.840 
definitely ultimate high output
and<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.990> haven't<00:02:01.649> done<00:02:01.799> big<00:02:02.159> three<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.790> one

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
and I haven't done big three in this one

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:11.479 
and I haven't done big three in this one
yet<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:05.310> actual<00:02:05.610> kill<00:02:09.860> but<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.069> know<00:02:11.280> this

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
yet so the actual kill but you know this

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.720 
yet so the actual kill but you know this
is<00:02:11.640> basically<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:12.739> video<00:02:13.739> just<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.459> kind<00:02:14.670> of

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
is basically a video just to kind of

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.839 
is basically a video just to kind of
show<00:02:14.840> -<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:17.569> think<00:02:18.569> it<00:02:18.870> came<00:02:19.019> out<00:02:19.200> pretty<00:02:19.260> huge

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
show - I think it came out pretty huge

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.690 
show - I think it came out pretty huge
considering<00:02:20.849> you<00:02:21.030> can't<00:02:21.300> find<00:02:21.780> one<00:02:22.250> 403<00:02:23.250> Ford

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
considering you can't find one 403 Ford

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.259 
considering you can't find one 403 Ford
Taurus<00:02:25.099> at<00:02:26.099> least<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.459> only<00:02:26.640> one<00:02:26.819> that<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.060> did

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
Taurus at least the only one that I did

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.100 
Taurus at least the only one that I did
find<00:02:27.690> had<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.530> digital<00:02:29.489> a/c<00:02:30.000> controls<00:02:30.780> which

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
find had the digital a/c controls which

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:38.110 
find had the digital a/c controls which
won't<00:02:31.620> cook<00:02:31.890> up<00:02:32.180> with<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:35.209> ash<00:02:36.209> would

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
won't cook up with this so ash would

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.059 
won't cook up with this so ash would
prompt<00:02:39.120> me<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.480> best<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.230> make<00:02:40.410> my<00:02:40.590> own<00:02:40.650> I

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.900 

couldn't<00:02:44.069> be<00:02:44.190> happier

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
couldn't be happier

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.430 
couldn't be happier
I<00:02:46.430> later
