00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.170
 in the absence of friends viewers as well 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.849
 followers of my youtube channel i max 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.039
 format and you are watching my rubric 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.869
 channel random case the one in which 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.180
 show improved was on this or that 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.430
 tanks and give it only as much as possible 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.170
 objective assessment but today as already 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.820
 cleaned recently obvious 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.580
 release not formats today we will not 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.440
 talk about in object 140 since the video 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.540
 for this tank just millions on my 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.970
 channel well, I certainly exaggerate guys about 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.620
 5 8 for sure there is on the channel and therefore it was 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.780
 would be absurd to tell anything about him 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.820
 give him some kind of guide to tell 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.010
 what is he cool court to pump it and 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.020
 the world about this already everyone knows even those who 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.789
 no dozens at least once in your life 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.890
 hit the mark at eight know that 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.539
 this is a tank and it just isnâ€™t 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.580
 needs extra in general 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:09.160
 comments today we will talk about 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.009
 absolute friend in general is not just not 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.440
 format on our channel today speech 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.000
 will go about philosophy would be disappointing and about 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.810
 how to treat the game 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.700
 world of tanks 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.590
 the chain I recently started again in 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.630
 play her and in general dedicate to her 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.130
 but maybe an hour maybe half an hour 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.000
 day is enough for u 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.399
 I was bombed 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.890
 and the guys are bombing a lot very often 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.200
 And in general, my farts, he is generally very 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.479
 unstable it encodes periodically i 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.610
 often go home to the server sleep is not 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.140
 gives everyone happens when I have to 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.640
 Generally not so much burned but I 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.630
 of course guys holy joke it all 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.179
 wacky my humor 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.130
 The point is that when you are like 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.020
 how are you trying to drag you 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.000
 Of course, nothing happens very much 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.190
 many today it will be about this 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.429
 combat playing on site 140 and I got on 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.410
 map erlenberg took square g1 to the word 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.319
 saying guys card erlenberg and or right 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.229
 almost five at least not easy 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:04.179
 almost 5 mind there since version 06 there 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.129
 something she we already had this card and 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.050
 there already and shears were not on her 

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:10.119
 the storming on her were the most uprooted 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.980
 old cards but lately guys 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.170
 it was redone very much added here 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.150
 some driveways in squares about something 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.310
 made it more playable precisely for 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.319
 two sides because earlier here with 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.970
 lower cutting was much more interesting to play 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.920
 at all 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.480
 the basics were not there a little bit placed but 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.820
 Yet what is now present 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.890
 myself erlenberg I really like why 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.200
 Richard has already gone about the card because she 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.240
 has an important role in gameplay and 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.370
 generally in the game so immediately I usually 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.810
 start the game and chat start the review 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.940
 own replay with review 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.440
 cards but they we talked and now 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.710
 let's talk about what will happen in this 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.960
 the battle 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.370
 If you look at the trade wind with us naturally 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.950
 big amount for you like this now 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.720
 happens in our randomness and of course 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.520
 we are not enough small rat if 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.800
 what are you now for rand now 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.090
 This is mainly for thousands of tons of this 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.160
 of course st 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.560
 since well write how they play now 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.940
 Probably 40 percent and somewhere percent 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.000
 50 plays on st 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.260
 but in general the essence is not about this 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.240
 our whole team as you can see 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.760
 located out of square target day to 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.470
 j1 concert right flank i have that 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.330
 right side of the card if you look at 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.190
 her on top 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.560
 nobody took nobody went there 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.940
 famous guys i'm from you and i go there 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.730
 shouldn't because right side 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.890
 right flank on this map it is for 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.410
 heavy tanks it is not for ice-t 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.910
 he can not be even partially Fri precisely 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.190
 heavy tanks that can there 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.260
 restrain the enemy naturally need 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.019
 to be a masochist to go there 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.630
 as often as each flank on in 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.489
 allied base on the side of his base he 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.310
 always happy that is if you go 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.080
 in a row would be 9 yes here your here most often 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.120
 will rashit my God I can not show 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.860
 square guys here it is here if you go 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.320
 here you anyway for Rashid drove here 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.360
 for the horns you are such guys gameplay on 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.709
 this map is one of the few maps 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.290
 which is generally done in this way 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.790
 that on each side the team is capable 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.680
 to insist and it all depends on 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.959
 what number of tanks on one or another 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.239
 side stands the most often 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.519
 patricks drop match and d1 and base 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.530
 protect very easily because the base 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.049
 open and because there are no places where 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.459
 the enemy can hide his forehead and more often 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.500
 just manage to shoot down the grip 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.479
 what basically i will do i see our 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.919
 the team is already half merged huge 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.590
 the number of hostel piled up 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.850
 squared b2 just do anything starting 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.860
 just stupid and shoot down the grip 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.080
 because this is all guys efficiency 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.070
 it's all very greatly increases the efficiency of the 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.160
 I have here, for example 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.320
 apple under this something 1730 after that 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.780
 the battlefield became 1735 then a little more 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.880
 manifested for the week dragged by another 40 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.980
 in short guys shoot down and how can 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.960
 more often capture it greatly affects 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.360
 your stats on your rating 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.220
 efficiency as a few p. 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.620
 You are now many looking at win8 us 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.930
 now it's not about getting it 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.490
 splash but I already guys don't think about it I 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.800
 don't even think about that in this we 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.870
 need to win I already did everything from 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.360
 it depended on me a couple times I captured 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.490
 I personally did a lot of damage trying 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.010
 what is there to make me attack Pershin 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.900
 somehow breaks me down at all 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.930
 there would also be pairs of eyes oh that is 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.180
 you yourself understand yes there bbc 170 punch 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.430
 and 180 apologize for breaking through 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.980
 problems punches my forehead yes that is 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.660
 140 strong armor very good armor 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.790
 guys even eight break through 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:23.020
 Naturally this all sarcasm and so give 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:25.510
 54 fast our 54 it hurts takin 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.130
 I take it on this sixth thousand damage but 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.560
 meanwhile the enemy team is already 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.110
 practically took our base remains 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.120
 about 15 seconds of taking chances guys 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.710
 no, we have 4 if your tank they have 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.790
 a whole bunch of tanks from half of which 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.730
 standing on the grip 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.190
 I bring fire shoots capture guys sing 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.080
 no, don't shoot down the grip and this is from 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.370
 gets the base guys not having time to pro 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.830
 holding it was necessary to wait bye 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.660
 actually lit up but I'm not 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.300
 expected our saddle culture to shine 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.820
 if knocked maybe something here and 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.600
 It turned out because this is 4 shot T30 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.760
 shot 171 shot is 8 shot is shorter 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.530
 saying there were some chances but not 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.450
 less in battle plums and need to look 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.370
 results 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.680
 of course we would inevitably lose it 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:12.040
 knowing third degree classes with me 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.650
 caliber support and tankman sniper 1500 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.990
 experience and 100 thousand silver for plum plus 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.570
 45 thousand I did not stand gold 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.670
 command result of almost 7 thousand damage 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.020
 without light there were a couple of shots and 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.120
 so it turned out like this 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.520
 result 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:31.120
 1300 radar forged 1200 according to the light of the beat 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.430
 from 60 capture points passed no matter 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.050
 in short guys i'm trying to you 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.820
 bring here this video I now 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.560
 absolute smile talking about this fight to me 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.320
 it doesn't hurt that we have raki there 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.540
 some were for me an absolute 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.130
 By this, I treat any player only 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.020
 smile to those who are there 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.210
 bad stats trying to bring you 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.220
 guys that you should not take close to 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.770
 heart any left i often notice 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.900
 that to me later in private after such 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.820
 either fighting writes some woman 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.340
 unpleasant things even though 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.410
 My statistics is 12 by 15 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.540
 percent higher than that of the man that 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.490
 I try to relate very positively 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.620
 first of all without trolling with business 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.570
 This excess stress of all who have 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.940
 something needs to be changed often you ask 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.350
 reset so i try calmly 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.720
 treat a game of something and recommend it to you 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.790
 and guys honestly of course give less 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.370
 being a tank I'm whose play is now an hour 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.710
 day and in general then with feeling very 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.900
 well earlier when its 5-6 hours a day 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.850
 i just felt stressed out 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.380
 I just wanted to break my keyboard 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.930
 by the way speaking I changed two or three keyboards 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:33.570
