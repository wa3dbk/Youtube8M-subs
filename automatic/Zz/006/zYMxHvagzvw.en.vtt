00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.609 
and he brought back the moon and these
are<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.030> new<00:01:51.180> moon<00:01:51.450> cycles<00:01:53.060> we've<00:01:54.060> got<00:01:54.350> no<00:01:55.350> a

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
are the new moon cycles we've got no a

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.800 
are the new moon cycles we've got no a
regular<00:01:56.219> circular<00:01:56.790> sort<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.390> give<00:01:57.659> us

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
regular circular sort of like give us

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.859 
regular circular sort of like give us
sort<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.380> don't<00:01:58.439> even<00:01:58.590> know<00:01:59.299> the<00:02:00.299> waxing

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
sort of I don't even know the waxing

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.770 
sort of I don't even know the waxing
waning<00:02:01.140> gibbous<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.280> whatnot<00:02:02.820> stuff<00:02:03.180> well<00:02:03.689> we

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
waning gibbous and whatnot stuff well we

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.389 
waning gibbous and whatnot stuff well we
got<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> circular<00:02:04.530> year<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:04.979> then<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.159> becomes

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
got a circular year and then it becomes

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.969 
got a circular year and then it becomes
like<00:02:05.610> just<00:02:05.850> half<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.180> square<00:02:06.390> more<00:02:07.350> circular

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
like just half a square more circular

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.889 
like just half a square more circular
anus<00:02:08.190> here<00:02:08.640> then<00:02:08.819> we've<00:02:09.179> got<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.479> Eclipse<00:02:09.780> I

really<00:02:10.140> like<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.500> Eclipse<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:11.009> looks

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.410 

interesting<00:02:13.990> I<00:02:14.170> I'm<00:02:14.560> not<00:02:14.860> much<00:02:15.370> into<00:02:15.640> that

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
interesting I I'm not much into that

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.540 
interesting I I'm not much into that
type<00:02:16.630> of<00:02:16.660> art<00:02:17.050> when<00:02:17.590> it's<00:02:17.740> hanging<00:02:17.920> on<00:02:18.220> museum

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.730 
type of art when it's hanging on museum
walls<00:02:18.910> but<00:02:19.540> here<00:02:19.720> looks<00:02:20.020> interesting<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.620> I'd

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
walls but here looks interesting and I'd

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.170 
walls but here looks interesting and I'd
like<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:21.040> see<00:02:21.190> something<00:02:21.460> like<00:02:21.520> this<00:02:21.670> floating

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
like to see something like this floating

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.580 
like to see something like this floating
around<00:02:22.300> through<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.780> sky<00:02:22.990> and<00:02:23.170> maybe<00:02:23.350> have

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
around through the sky and maybe have

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.230 
around through the sky and maybe have
that<00:02:23.770> have<00:02:24.040> some<00:02:24.250> effect<00:02:24.580> on<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.820> gameplay

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
that have some effect on the gameplay

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.300 
that have some effect on the gameplay
and<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.420> spawning<00:02:25.780> rates<00:02:26.080> of<00:02:26.320> different<00:02:26.890> mobs

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
and the spawning rates of different mobs

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.150 
and the spawning rates of different mobs
and<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:28.660> lot<00:02:29.020> of<00:02:29.170> people<00:02:29.500> as<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.800> said<00:02:30.010> before

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
and a lot of people as I said before

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.040 
and a lot of people as I said before
thought<00:02:30.730> that<00:02:30.940> this<00:02:31.090> might<00:02:31.330> bring<00:02:31.540> about<00:02:31.690> some

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
thought that this might bring about some

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.500 
thought that this might bring about some
gameplay<00:02:32.470> changes<00:02:32.860> now<00:02:33.010> as<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.550> now<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:34.150> don't

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
gameplay changes now as of now I don't

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.240 
gameplay changes now as of now I don't
believe<00:02:34.840> this<00:02:35.170> has<00:02:35.380> changed<00:02:35.410> anything<00:02:36.130> in

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
believe this has changed anything in

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.830 
believe this has changed anything in
terms<00:02:36.370> of<00:02:36.640> spawning<00:02:36.940> patterns<00:02:37.510> or<00:02:37.660> anything

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
terms of spawning patterns or anything

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.560 
terms of spawning patterns or anything
like<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:39.060> but<00:02:40.060> there's<00:02:40.270> always<00:02:40.450> that

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
like that but there's always that

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.330 
like that but there's always that
possibility<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.530> future<00:02:41.830> let's<00:02:42.070> let's

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
possibility in the future let's let's

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.820 
possibility in the future let's let's
talk<00:02:42.490> hypotheticals<00:02:43.240> here<00:02:43.300> for<00:02:43.990> one<00:02:44.200> when

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
talk hypotheticals here for one when

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.060 
talk hypotheticals here for one when
we've<00:02:45.010> got<00:02:45.190> full<00:02:45.430> moon<00:02:45.640> there's<00:02:46.540> a<00:02:46.630> whole<00:02:47.070> host

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
we've got full moon there's a whole host

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.340 
we've got full moon there's a whole host

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
of options there in terms of lore and

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.110 
of options there in terms of lore and
mythology<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.160> we<00:02:51.250> can<00:02:51.400> go<00:02:51.550> on<00:02:51.580> that<00:02:51.910> has

mythology that we can go on that has

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.750 
mythology that we can go on that has
stuff<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.570> do<00:02:52.810> with<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.440> full<00:02:53.710> moon<00:02:53.980> so

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
stuff to do with the full moon so

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.910 
stuff to do with the full moon so
there's<00:02:55.180> no<00:02:55.450> there's<00:02:56.020> no<00:02:56.080> lack<00:02:56.530> of<00:02:56.740> options

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
there's no there's no lack of options

there's no there's no lack of options

I don't know lots of ideas to explore
lots<00:03:18.040> of<00:03:18.190> possibilities<00:03:18.850> for<00:03:18.880> notch<00:03:19.210> and<00:03:19.360> I

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
lots of possibilities for notch and I

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.450 
lots of possibilities for notch and I
like<00:03:19.630> that<00:03:19.780> he's<00:03:19.870> taken<00:03:20.260> this<00:03:20.410> in<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.100> direction

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
like that he's taken this in a direction

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.920 
like that he's taken this in a direction
because<00:03:21.610> I<00:03:21.820> feel<00:03:22.030> like<00:03:22.210> this<00:03:22.420> is<00:03:22.540> going<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:22.870> be

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
because I feel like this is going to be

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.020 
because I feel like this is going to be
more<00:03:23.170> than<00:03:23.380> just<00:03:23.650> visual<00:03:23.920> in<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.580> long<00:03:24.760> run

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
more than just visual in the long run

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.210 
more than just visual in the long run
