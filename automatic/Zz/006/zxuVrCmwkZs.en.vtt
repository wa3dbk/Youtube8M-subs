00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
ago with small engine mechanic Mike and

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.060 
ago with small engine mechanic Mike and
I<00:00:11.639> was<00:00:11.759> able<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.969> pick<00:00:12.179> this<00:00:12.330> up<00:00:12.799> it's<00:00:13.799> not<00:00:13.950> an

open crank yeah

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.099 
open crank yeah
but<00:00:16.560> it's<00:00:16.680> good<00:00:17.570> looks<00:00:18.570> like<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.779> only<00:00:18.930> thing

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
but it's good looks like the only thing

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.269 
but it's good looks like the only thing
was<00:00:19.199> missing<00:00:19.910> missing<00:00:20.910> Magneto<00:00:21.619> which<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.800> have

a spare in there and was missing a
trigger<00:00:26.279> mechanism<00:00:26.490> right<00:00:27.119> here<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.570> already

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
trigger mechanism right here I already

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.480 
trigger mechanism right here I already
started<00:00:28.529> working<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.070> had<00:00:29.220> one<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.429> these

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
started working on I had one of these

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.490 
started working on I had one of these
laying<00:00:29.699> around<00:00:29.789> -<00:00:30.240> whoops<00:00:31.669> deal<00:00:33.380> so<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.410> was

laying around - whoops deal so I was

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.000 
laying around - whoops deal so I was
working<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.880> here's<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.649> the<00:00:37.649> Colin

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
working on that this here's a the Colin

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.619 
working on that this here's a the Colin
economy<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.940> was<00:00:39.090> made<00:00:39.300> by<00:00:39.480> Stover<00:00:40.969> but<00:00:41.969> Sears

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
economy it was made by Stover but Sears

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.380 
economy it was made by Stover but Sears
put<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.050> out<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.530> they<00:00:44.190> put<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.610> date<00:00:44.850> they

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
put it out and they put the date they

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.060 
put it out and they put the date they
put<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> economy<00:00:45.899> name<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.559> similar<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
put the economy name on a similar to the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.290 
put the economy name on a similar to the
craftsman<00:00:47.579> brand<00:00:47.700> name<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.300> they<00:00:49.020> use<00:00:49.230> now

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
craftsman brand name that they use now

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.569 
craftsman brand name that they use now
but<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.780> engine<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.530> little<00:00:53.340> different

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
but this is engine a little different

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.299 
but this is engine a little different
than<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:54.199> it's<00:00:55.199> right<00:00:55.680> now<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:55.860> a

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
than what I have it's right now it's a

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.830 
than what I have it's right now it's a
throttle<00:00:56.910> governor<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.360> not<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> hit<00:00:57.719> and

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
throttle governor it's not a hit and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.770 
throttle governor it's not a hit and
miss<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.640> it<00:00:59.640> actually<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.270> starts<00:01:00.629> on

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
miss and it actually it starts on

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.660 
miss and it actually it starts on
gasoline<00:01:02.030> this<00:01:03.030> little<00:01:03.300> hopper<00:01:04.290> here<00:01:04.549> so<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.610> I

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
gasoline this little hopper here so if I

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.469 
gasoline this little hopper here so if I
can<00:01:05.820> open<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.119> fluid<00:01:07.970> you<00:01:08.970> feel<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.299> what

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
can open it fluid you feel that what

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.140 
can open it fluid you feel that what
gasoline<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.350> once<00:01:11.280> again<00:01:11.430> once<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.880> starts

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
gasoline and once again once it starts

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.560 
gasoline and once again once it starts
running

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
running

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.679 
running
it<00:01:13.080> runs<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.439> kerosene<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> little

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
it runs on kerosene so it's a little

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.420 
it runs on kerosene so it's a little
different<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.200> I'm<00:01:16.710> going<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.950> actually<00:01:17.070> turn

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
different but I'm going to actually turn

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.510 
different but I'm going to actually turn
into<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.700> hit-and-miss<00:01:18.030> engine<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:19.520> small

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
into a hit-and-miss engine and small

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.770 
into a hit-and-miss engine and small
engine<00:01:20.729> mechanic<00:01:20.850> Mike's<00:01:21.270> going<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.509> help<00:01:21.659> me

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
engine mechanic Mike's going to help me

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.499 
engine mechanic Mike's going to help me
because<00:01:22.110> he<00:01:22.409> has<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.799> same<00:01:23.580> identical<00:01:24.060> engine

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
because he has the same identical engine

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.660 
because he has the same identical engine
this<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.439> actually<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.799> Stover<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.670> think<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:28.670> c3

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
this is actually a Stover I think a c3

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.649 
this is actually a Stover I think a c3
se<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> CT<00:01:30.720> 3<00:01:30.990> they<00:01:31.170> call<00:01:31.700> it's<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.759> similar<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.630> a

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
se a CT 3 they call it's a similar to a

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.710 
se a CT 3 they call it's a similar to a
coffin<00:01:34.170> top<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.680> notice<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.070> top<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:35.720> this

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
coffin top you notice the top here this

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.310 
coffin top you notice the top here this
this<00:01:37.259> one's<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> little<00:01:37.680> little<00:01:38.189> rounded<00:01:38.549> off

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
this one's a little little rounded off

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.840 
this one's a little little rounded off
but<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.500> Stoffer<00:01:40.890> actually<00:01:41.189> actually<00:01:41.549> looks

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
but the Stoffer actually actually looks

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.770 
but the Stoffer actually actually looks
like<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> coffin<00:01:42.329> top<00:01:42.829> and<00:01:43.829> Mike<00:01:44.640> put<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> video

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
like a coffin top and Mike put a video

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.460 
like a coffin top and Mike put a video
up

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
up

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.160 
up
show<00:01:47.340> me<00:01:47.549> how<00:01:47.700> his<00:01:47.880> trigger<00:01:48.210> mechanism<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.020> so

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
show me how his trigger mechanism is so

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.020 
show me how his trigger mechanism is so
I<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.820> duplicate<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.920> but<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.460> seems<00:01:53.700> me<00:01:53.850> good

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
I can duplicate it but it seems me good

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.310 
I can duplicate it but it seems me good
has<00:01:54.210> great<00:01:54.420> great<00:01:54.630> compression<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.170> mean

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
has great great compression I mean

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.499 
has great great compression I mean
really<00:01:55.520> really<00:01:56.520> good<00:01:56.700> compression<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.270> can't<00:01:57.479> I

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
really really good compression I can't I

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.910 
really really good compression I can't I
came<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.840> turn<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.110> one<00:01:58.229> hand<00:01:58.500> here<00:01:58.740> I'm

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
came to turn on one hand here I'm

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.260 
came to turn on one hand here I'm
holding<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.640> camera<00:02:01.700> but<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.850> only<00:02:03.030> digits

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
holding the camera but the only digits

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.690 
holding the camera but the only digits
between<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> Stover<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.700> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
between this and a Stover is the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.449 
between this and a Stover is the
flywheels<00:02:06.329> Stover<00:02:07.140> has<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.649> think<00:02:07.950> six<00:02:08.220> holes

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
flywheels Stover has I think six holes

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.699 
flywheels Stover has I think six holes
and<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:09.629> point<00:02:09.869> has<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.830> three<00:02:11.220> teardrops

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
and this point has the three teardrops

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.030
