to<00:00:24.939> rise<00:00:25.239> to<00:00:25.570> the<00:00:25.659> occasion<00:00:25.829> well<00:00:26.829> they<00:00:26.980> were

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:27.089 
to rise to the occasion well they were

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.640

very<00:00:28.089> good<00:00:28.329> scoring<00:00:28.779> players<00:00:29.230> and<00:00:29.560> I<00:00:29.619> think

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
very good scoring players and I think

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.979 
very good scoring players and I think
that<00:00:30.099> just<00:00:30.339> by<00:00:30.699> them<00:00:31.149> not<00:00:31.539> being<00:00:31.689> here<00:00:31.929> is

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989 
that just by them not being here is

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:33.479 
that just by them not being here is
allowing<00:00:32.349> other<00:00:32.500> people<00:00:32.590> to<00:00:32.800> step<00:00:33.040> up<00:00:33.220> and

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
allowing other people to step up and

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.790 
allowing other people to step up and
kind<00:00:34.360> of<00:00:34.450> take<00:00:34.660> that<00:00:34.870> role<00:00:35.080> and<00:00:35.380> I<00:00:35.470> think<00:00:35.650> that

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
kind of take that role and I think that

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.080 
kind of take that role and I think that
we're<00:00:35.920> doing<00:00:36.010> good<00:00:36.370> job<00:00:36.550> in<00:00:36.670> doing<00:00:36.880> so<00:00:37.060> I

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
we're doing good job in doing so I

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.300 
we're doing good job in doing so I
thought<00:00:37.510> that<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:37.780> players<00:00:38.080> who<00:00:38.260> played<00:00:38.620> from

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 
thought that the players who played from

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.650 
thought that the players who played from
the<00:00:39.370> start<00:00:39.730> knows<00:00:39.970> that<00:00:40.090> came<00:00:40.240> off<00:00:40.270> the<00:00:40.540> bench

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
the start knows that came off the bench

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.450 
the start knows that came off the bench
contributed<00:00:41.590> in<00:00:41.680> a<00:00:41.740> very<00:00:41.920> positive<00:00:42.070> fashion

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
it just really gives other people an

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.560 
it just really gives other people an

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
really open to our opinions and when we

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.020 
really open to our opinions and when we

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
had

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.000 
had
I<00:01:34.060> think<00:01:34.479> that's<00:01:34.659> a<00:01:34.780> really<00:01:34.810> great<00:01:35.350> better<00:01:35.650> the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
I think that's a really great better the

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.740 
I think that's a really great better the
one<00:01:36.159> constant<00:01:36.430> over<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:36.940> last<00:01:37.119> four<00:01:37.360> years<00:01:37.390> is

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
one constant over the last four years is

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.600 
one constant over the last four years is

them<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.370> victory<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:13.360> think<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.350> our

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
them to victory I think that our

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.040 
them to victory I think that our
coaching<00:02:15.580> staff<00:02:15.610> really<00:02:16.180> brings<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.870> lot<00:02:16.989> to

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
coaching staff really brings a lot to

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.600 
coaching staff really brings a lot to
the<00:02:17.230> table<00:02:17.440> that<00:02:17.680> maybe<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.190> lot<00:02:18.370> of<00:02:18.489> other

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
the table that maybe a lot of other

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.850 
the table that maybe a lot of other
schools<00:02:18.970> don't<00:02:19.180> have<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:20.140> think<00:02:20.620> our

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
schools don't have and I think our

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.100 
schools don't have and I think our
teamwork<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.700> our<00:02:21.790> hard<00:02:22.300> work<00:02:22.510> every<00:02:22.989> single

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
teamwork and our hard work every single

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.530 
teamwork and our hard work every single
day<00:02:23.290> really<00:02:23.950> improves<00:02:24.459> us<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:24.940> makes<00:02:25.209> us<00:02:25.330> one

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
day really improves us and makes us one

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.850 
day really improves us and makes us one
of<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.720> best<00:02:25.870> teams<00:02:26.080> in<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.260> country<00:02:26.319> the

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
of the best teams in the country the

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.250 
of the best teams in the country the
staff<00:02:27.130> is<00:02:27.370> really<00:02:27.730> into<00:02:28.420> making<00:02:28.720> sure<00:02:29.019> that<00:02:29.200> we

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
staff is really into making sure that we

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.500

become good people in the community and

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.670 
become good people in the community and
on<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.750> field<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.260> think<00:02:32.500> that's

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
on the field and I think that's

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.990 
on the field and I think that's
something<00:02:32.830> we<00:02:33.040> can<00:02:33.190> carry<00:02:33.370> over<00:02:33.519> there<00:02:33.940> are
