00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
and we continue that across crocheting

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.760 
and we continue that across crocheting
is<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> nice<00:01:29.280> easy<00:01:29.970> project<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> carry<00:01:31.200> with<00:01:31.500> you

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
is a nice easy project to carry with you

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.410 
is a nice easy project to carry with you
as<00:01:31.890> long<00:01:31.920> as<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.250> project<00:01:32.640> isn't<00:01:32.790> too<00:01:33.119> large

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
as long as the project isn't too large

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.069 
as long as the project isn't too large
it<00:01:33.780> really<00:01:34.259> only<00:01:34.740> requires<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:35.460> hook<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.360> so

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
it really only requires one hook and so

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.179 
it really only requires one hook and so
it<00:01:37.229> makes<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.560> an<00:01:37.710> easy<00:01:38.460> portable<00:01:39.270> project<00:01:40.189> and

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
it makes it an easy portable project and

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.670 
it makes it an easy portable project and
if<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.759> stop<00:01:42.119> crocheting<00:01:42.869> at<00:01:43.049> any<00:01:43.200> time<00:01:43.470> you

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
if you stop crocheting at any time you

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.800 
if you stop crocheting at any time you
can<00:01:43.710> pull<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.220> loop<00:01:44.430> out<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> nice<00:01:45.149> large

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
can pull that loop out to a nice large

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.380 
can pull that loop out to a nice large
loop<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.530> just<00:01:47.310> stuff<00:01:47.549> everything<00:01:47.850> into<00:01:48.270> your

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
loop and just stuff everything into your

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.210 
loop and just stuff everything into your
tote<00:01:48.659> bag<00:01:48.930> without<00:01:49.409> worrying<00:01:49.860> about<00:01:49.950> that

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
tote bag without worrying about that

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.960 
tote bag without worrying about that
loop<00:01:50.490> coming<00:01:50.790> undone<00:01:52.399> alright<00:01:53.399> I'm<00:01:53.579> just

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
loop coming undone alright I'm just

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.090 
loop coming undone alright I'm just
about<00:01:54.210> finished<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.899> single<00:01:55.229> crochets

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
about finished the single crochets

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
chain yarn over and pull through and at

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.690 
chain yarn over and pull through and at
that<00:02:07.850> point<00:02:08.360> we<00:02:08.660> turn<00:02:09.170> our<00:02:09.470> work<00:02:09.770> around<00:02:10.250> again

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
that point we turn our work around again

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.860 
that point we turn our work around again
and<00:02:11.770> since<00:02:12.770> we're<00:02:12.950> doing<00:02:13.160> single<00:02:13.550> crochets<00:02:14.000> we

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
and since we're doing single crochets we

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.680 
and since we're doing single crochets we
create<00:02:15.350> one<00:02:15.800> chain<00:02:16.670> stitch<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:18.490> proceed

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
create one chain stitch and proceed

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.420 
create one chain stitch and proceed
single<00:02:20.690> crochet<00:02:21.200> all<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:22.010> way<00:02:22.100> across<00:02:22.220> the

row<00:02:29.360> so<00:02:30.290> that<00:02:30.320> you'll<00:02:30.709> end<00:02:30.920> up<00:02:31.040> with<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.280> nice

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
row so that you'll end up with a nice

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.190 
row so that you'll end up with a nice
fabric<00:02:33.590> edge<00:02:34.010> otherwise<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:35.180> will<00:02:35.300> draw<00:02:35.570> into

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
fabric edge otherwise it will draw into

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.770 
fabric edge otherwise it will draw into
itself<00:02:37.010> down<00:02:37.310> here<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:37.910> not<00:02:38.090> be<00:02:38.330> nice<00:02:38.510> and

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
itself down here and not be nice and

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.880 
itself down here and not be nice and
flat<00:02:39.400> so<00:02:40.400> that's<00:02:40.790> how<00:02:41.030> we<00:02:41.200> create<00:02:42.200> fabric<00:02:42.770> with

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
flat so that's how we create fabric with

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.990 
flat so that's how we create fabric with
a<00:02:42.920> single<00:02:43.310> crochet<00:02:43.760> now<00:02:44.570> let's<00:02:44.810> move<00:02:45.020> over<00:02:45.230> to

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
a single crochet now let's move over to

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.760 
a single crochet now let's move over to
the<00:02:48.010> half<00:02:49.010> double<00:02:49.459> crochet<00:02:50.140> now<00:02:51.140> remember<00:02:51.650> the

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
the half double crochet now remember the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.530 
the half double crochet now remember the
half<00:02:51.950> double<00:02:52.370> crochet<00:02:52.910> is<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.980> bit<00:02:55.340> taller<00:02:56.209> than

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
half double crochet is a bit taller than

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.020 
half double crochet is a bit taller than
the<00:02:56.660> single<00:02:56.870> crochet<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:58.550> at<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.910> beginning

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
the single crochet so at the beginning

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.720 
the single crochet so at the beginning
of<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.510> row<00:02:59.780> and<00:03:00.170> I'm<00:03:01.070> just<00:03:01.280> going<00:03:01.430> to<00:03:01.520> pull

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
of the row and I'm just going to pull

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.500 
of the row and I'm just going to pull
back<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.270> beginning<00:03:02.420> of<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.810> row<00:03:04.510> instead

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
back to the beginning of the row instead

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.880 
back to the beginning of the row instead
of<00:03:06.400> 1<00:03:07.400> chain<00:03:07.700> stitch<00:03:07.900> we<00:03:08.900> have<00:03:09.049> to<00:03:09.200> create<00:03:09.470> two

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
of 1 chain stitch we have to create two

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.039 
of 1 chain stitch we have to create two
chain<00:03:10.220> stitches<00:03:10.640> to<00:03:11.060> accommodate<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.780> height

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
chain stitches to accommodate the height

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.070 
chain stitches to accommodate the height
of<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.440> row<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:13.730> I've<00:03:14.000> just<00:03:14.360> finished<00:03:14.570> one<00:03:14.840> row

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
of the row so I've just finished one row

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.600 
of the row so I've just finished one row
and<00:03:15.290> I'm<00:03:15.380> getting<00:03:15.560> ready<00:03:15.769> to<00:03:15.920> start<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.430> next

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
and I'm getting ready to start the next

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.890 
and I'm getting ready to start the next
so<00:03:17.480> I<00:03:17.510> have<00:03:17.840> 12<00:03:18.549> chain<00:03:19.549> stitches<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:20.720> that's

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
so I have 12 chain stitches and that's

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.120 
so I have 12 chain stitches and that's
the<00:03:21.049> way<00:03:21.140> it<00:03:21.260> looks<00:03:21.500> they're<00:03:21.680> just<00:03:21.830> kind<00:03:22.040> of

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
the way it looks they're just kind of

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.240 
the way it looks they're just kind of
hanging<00:03:22.370> there<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.560> then<00:03:24.560> we<00:03:24.769> start<00:03:27.070> by<00:03:28.070> going

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
hanging there and then we start by going

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:35.710 
hanging there and then we start by going
in<00:03:28.489> the<00:03:28.580> chain<00:03:30.070> wrapping<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.220> yarn<00:03:31.250> I<00:03:34.720> excuse

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
in the chain wrapping the yarn I excuse

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.740 
in the chain wrapping the yarn I excuse
me<00:03:35.870> we<00:03:36.799> start<00:03:37.100> by<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.370> yarn<00:03:37.910> over<00:03:38.090> first

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
three stitches on our hook we yarn over

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.940 
three stitches on our hook we yarn over
and<00:03:51.430> pull<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.909> hook<00:03:52.629> and<00:03:52.870> yarn<00:03:53.200> through<00:03:53.769> all

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
over through all three stitches I'll do

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.080 
over through all three stitches I'll do
a<00:04:05.140> couple<00:04:05.530> of<00:04:05.620> those<00:04:05.799> so<00:04:06.069> we<00:04:06.220> can<00:04:06.400> see<00:04:06.730> the

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
a couple of those so we can see the

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:15.600 
a couple of those so we can see the
height<00:04:07.330> of<00:04:07.569> the<00:04:07.690> stitches<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:14.129> you<00:04:15.129> can<00:04:15.280> see

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
height of the stitches and you can see

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.650 
height of the stitches and you can see
by<00:04:16.269> doing<00:04:17.260> those<00:04:17.729> two<00:04:18.729> stitches<00:04:19.030> we've

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
by doing those two stitches we've

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.810 
by doing those two stitches we've
brought<00:04:19.989> our<00:04:20.199> yarn<00:04:20.440> up<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.889> the<00:04:21.010> height<00:04:21.310> of<00:04:21.549> the

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.860 
stitch you need to chain 4 chain
stitches<00:04:44.550> because<00:04:45.550> that<00:04:45.789> is<00:04:45.940> much<00:04:46.539> taller

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
stitches because that is much taller

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.760 
stitches because that is much taller
than<00:04:47.289> the<00:04:47.470> single<00:04:47.680> Dublin<00:04:48.570> half-double<00:04:49.770> so

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
than the single Dublin half-double so
