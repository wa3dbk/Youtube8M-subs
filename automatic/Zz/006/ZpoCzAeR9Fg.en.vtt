00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
not the same level and what is European

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.420 
not the same level and what is European
about<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.239> does<00:00:36.719> Adamek<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> chance

to<00:00:38.730> face<00:00:39.469> Vladimir<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:41.309> two<00:00:41.610> thousand

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
to face Vladimir in two thousand

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.819 
to face Vladimir in two thousand
thirteen<00:00:42.480> or<00:00:42.629> fourteen<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:43.379> instance<00:00:43.680> I

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
thirteen or fourteen for instance I

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.209 
thirteen or fourteen for instance I
think<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.640> can<00:00:44.850> never<00:00:45.020> completely<00:00:46.020> right<00:00:46.950> off

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
think you can never completely right off

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.459 
think you can never completely right off
someone<00:00:49.370> let's<00:00:50.370> say<00:00:50.489> tomasz<00:00:51.390> adamek<00:00:51.750> beats<00:00:52.050> a

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
someone let's say tomasz adamek beats a

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.990 
someone let's say tomasz adamek beats a
couple<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.039> top<00:00:54.000> 10<00:00:54.210> fighters<00:00:54.449> shows<00:00:55.260> great

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
couple of top 10 fighters shows great

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.900 
couple of top 10 fighters shows great
performances<00:00:57.000> then<00:00:57.719> he<00:00:58.109> could<00:00:58.289> be<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.469> future

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
performances then he could be a future

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.990 
performances then he could be a future
opponent<00:00:59.910> sure<00:01:00.030> at<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.500> moment<00:01:02.000> it's

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
opponent sure at this moment it's

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.929 
opponent sure at this moment it's
impossible<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.600> see<00:01:03.930> him<00:01:04.080> as<00:01:04.229> an<00:01:04.439> opponent

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
impossible to see him as an opponent

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.090 
impossible to see him as an opponent
because<00:01:05.939> our<00:01:06.240> TV<00:01:06.600> partner<00:01:07.020> rtl<00:01:07.680> would<00:01:07.890> never

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
because our TV partner rtl would never

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.740 
because our TV partner rtl would never
accept<00:01:08.400> him<00:01:08.580> after<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.030> defeat<00:01:09.210> against<00:01:09.630> bit

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
look at his good performance against

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.090 
look at his good performance against
areola<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.299> example<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:34.680> always<00:01:34.979> have

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
areola for example you can always have

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.980 
areola for example you can always have
an<00:01:35.220> off<00:01:35.340> night<00:01:35.369> yeah<00:01:36.150> but<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.540> have<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.810> come

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
an off night yeah but you have to come

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.710 
an off night yeah but you have to come
back<00:01:37.020> regroup<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.009> then<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.430> can<00:01:38.640> knock<00:01:39.509> on

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
back regroup and then you can knock on

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.190 
back regroup and then you can knock on
that<00:01:39.960> wall<00:01:40.799> again<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.310> think<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.570> don't

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
that wall again I think that you don't

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.399 
that wall again I think that you don't
even<00:01:43.470> exclude<00:01:44.130> another<00:01:44.700> fight<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.869> Poland<00:01:46.259> for

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
even exclude another fight in Poland for

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.429 
even exclude another fight in Poland for
instance<00:01:47.030> maybe<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.630> Russell<00:01:48.990> but<00:01:49.140> in

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
instance maybe not in Russell but in

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.830 
instance maybe not in Russell but in
some<00:01:49.649> other<00:01:49.890> city<00:01:50.220> oh<00:01:50.520> absolutely<00:01:50.939> i<00:01:51.390> think<00:01:51.509> we
