00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
you yes I do I've got to see it I've

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:58.370 
you yes I do I've got to see it I've
been<00:01:38.670> waiting<00:01:39.030> for<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> long<00:01:39.689> time

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.650 

the<00:01:59.380> restoration<00:01:59.950> was<00:02:00.130> on<00:02:00.280> both<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:01.030> exterior

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
the restoration was on both the exterior

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.480 
the restoration was on both the exterior
of<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:01.960> book<00:02:02.140> and<00:02:02.410> the<00:02:02.680> paintings<00:02:03.040> wasn't<00:02:03.400> it

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
of the book and the paintings wasn't it

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.900 
of the book and the paintings wasn't it
right<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.420> paintings<00:02:05.260> are<00:02:05.620> taken<00:02:06.460> from<00:02:06.670> the

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
right the paintings are taken from the

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.300 
right the paintings are taken from the
book<00:02:06.960> originally<00:02:07.960> they<00:02:08.260> were<00:02:08.320> not<00:02:08.770> actually

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
book originally they were not actually

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.740 
book originally they were not actually
attached<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.060> pages<00:02:10.510> they<00:02:10.630> were

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
attached to the pages they were

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.780 
attached to the pages they were
interleaved<00:02:11.320> in<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.650> text<00:02:11.980> block<00:02:12.100> and<00:02:12.490> the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
interleaved in the text block and the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.720 
interleaved in the text block and the
paintings<00:02:13.360> used<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:14.170> wood<00:02:14.470> pulp<00:02:14.800> paper<00:02:15.160> that

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
paintings used a wood pulp paper that

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.570 
paintings used a wood pulp paper that
has<00:02:15.940> very<00:02:16.270> very<00:02:16.390> short<00:02:16.930> fibers<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.740> they

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
has very very short fibers and they

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.890 
has very very short fibers and they
which<00:02:18.880> break<00:02:19.210> easily

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
which break easily

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.230 
which break easily
they'll<00:02:20.410> just<00:02:20.710> crack<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:21.430> there's<00:02:21.730> rubber

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
they'll just crack and there's rubber

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.870 
they'll just crack and there's rubber
cement<00:02:22.570> across<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.590> entire<00:02:23.920> back<00:02:24.280> of<00:02:24.580> every

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
cement across the entire back of every

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.030 
cement across the entire back of every
painting<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.810> lot<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.380> paintings<00:02:26.830> were

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
painting so a lot of the paintings were

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.250 
painting so a lot of the paintings were
lifting<00:02:27.610> off<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:28.150> support<00:02:28.660> but<00:02:29.050> they<00:02:29.200> were

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
lifting off the support but they were

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.730 
lifting off the support but they were
glued<00:02:29.770> down<00:02:30.070> on<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.670> begin<00:02:30.820> with<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:32.050> had

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
glued down on to begin with and so I had

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.370 
glued down on to begin with and so I had
to<00:02:32.920> really<00:02:33.280> think<00:02:33.370> are<00:02:34.090> these<00:02:34.420> worth<00:02:34.720> taking

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
to really think are these worth taking

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.740 
to really think are these worth taking
off<00:02:35.590> those<00:02:36.010> supports<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.850> doing<00:02:37.390> something

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
off those supports and doing something

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.990 
off those supports and doing something
about<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.110> adhesive<00:02:38.620> now<00:02:38.800> or<00:02:39.280> letting<00:02:39.820> them

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
about the adhesive now or letting them

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.330 
about the adhesive now or letting them
fall<00:02:40.210> off<00:02:40.270> over<00:02:40.810> time<00:02:41.020> this<00:02:41.500> adhesive<00:02:41.920> is

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
fall off over time this adhesive is

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.420 
fall off over time this adhesive is
gonna<00:02:43.060> fail<00:02:43.390> over<00:02:44.260> time<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:44.770> it's<00:02:44.890> safer

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
gonna fail over time and it's safer

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.970 
gonna fail over time and it's safer
because<00:02:45.850> all<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.390> edges<00:02:46.810> were<00:02:46.960> cracking<00:02:47.380> the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
because all the edges were cracking the

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.940 
because all the edges were cracking the
artists<00:02:48.640> made<00:02:48.910> it<00:02:49.150> not<00:02:49.840> thinking<00:02:50.110> that<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.860> was

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
artists made it not thinking that it was

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.740 
artists made it not thinking that it was
probably<00:02:51.280> gonna<00:02:51.430> be<00:02:51.610> around<00:02:51.880> for<00:02:52.330> this<00:02:52.450> long

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
probably gonna be around for this long

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.130 
probably gonna be around for this long
well<00:02:53.260> let's<00:02:53.380> take<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.560> look<00:02:53.740> okay<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:55.420> made<00:02:55.870> these

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
well let's take a look okay I made these

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.350 
well let's take a look okay I made these
enclosures<00:02:56.800> for<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.490> paintings<00:02:57.940> so<00:02:58.180> that

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
enclosures for the paintings so that

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.410 
enclosures for the paintings so that
when<00:02:58.540> you<00:02:58.660> open<00:02:59.050> them<00:02:59.230> there's<00:02:59.950> another<00:03:00.640> paper

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
when you open them there's another paper

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.610 
when you open them there's another paper
folder<00:03:01.989> inside<00:03:02.380> and<00:03:02.800> there's<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.190> flap<00:03:03.840> but<00:03:04.840> can

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
folder inside and there's a flap but can

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.300 
folder inside and there's a flap but can
be<00:03:05.739> placed<00:03:06.190> down<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:07.030> then<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:08.830> papers

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
be placed down and then the papers

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.699 
be placed down and then the papers
opened<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:10.840> now<00:03:10.959> this<00:03:11.110> is<00:03:11.170> one<00:03:11.470> of<00:03:11.500> my

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
opened so now this is one of my

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.350 
opened so now this is one of my
favorites<00:03:12.220> of<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.459> paintings<00:03:12.880> in<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.150> book

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
favorites of the paintings in the book

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.390 
favorites of the paintings in the book
and<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:14.110> guess<00:03:14.260> that<00:03:14.440> shows<00:03:14.560> an<00:03:14.739> evil<00:03:15.010> side<00:03:15.220> to

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
and I guess that shows an evil side to

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.160 
and I guess that shows an evil side to
me<00:03:15.550> but<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:15.970> love<00:03:16.510> Maleficent's<00:03:17.140> castle

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
me but I love Maleficent's castle

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.530 
me but I love Maleficent's castle
painting<00:03:17.980> here<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.520> I<00:03:18.790> know<00:03:18.850> there<00:03:19.120> was<00:03:19.239> there

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
painting here and I know there was there

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.300 
painting here and I know there was there
was<00:03:19.660> some<00:03:19.690> damage<00:03:19.989> to<00:03:20.350> this<00:03:20.500> what<00:03:20.830> what<00:03:21.100> kind

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
was some damage to this what what kind

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.470 
was some damage to this what what kind
of<00:03:21.340> things<00:03:21.489> did<00:03:21.610> you<00:03:21.670> have<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:21.910> do<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.150> fix<00:03:22.330> this

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
of things did you have to do to fix this

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.979 
of things did you have to do to fix this
one<00:03:22.690> this<00:03:23.320> painting<00:03:24.010> you<00:03:24.430> know<00:03:24.970> obviously<00:03:25.780> has

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
one this painting you know obviously has

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.190 
one this painting you know obviously has
a<00:03:26.020> lot<00:03:26.320> of<00:03:26.350> black<00:03:26.650> paint<00:03:27.040> in<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.550> and<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.930> black

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
a lot of black paint in it and the black

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.580 
a lot of black paint in it and the black
paint<00:03:29.590> especially<00:03:30.400> these<00:03:31.000> squashes<00:03:31.780> they

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
paint especially these squashes they

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.860 
paint especially these squashes they
have<00:03:32.830> carbon<00:03:33.670> particles<00:03:34.300> in<00:03:34.480> them<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.840> make

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
have carbon particles in them to make

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.860 
have carbon particles in them to make
them<00:03:35.050> black<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:36.190> often<00:03:36.820> I'll<00:03:36.970> find<00:03:37.360> the

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
them black and so often I'll find the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.220 
them black and so often I'll find the
black<00:03:38.260> paint<00:03:38.560> flaking<00:03:39.340> so<00:03:39.880> I<00:03:40.180> had<00:03:40.750> to<00:03:40.930> think

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
black paint flaking so I had to think

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.920 
black paint flaking so I had to think
how<00:03:41.650> am<00:03:41.920> I<00:03:42.010> going<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.489> stop<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.480> act<00:03:43.690> of

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
how am I going to stop the act of

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.280 
how am I going to stop the act of
flaking<00:03:44.230> from<00:03:44.590> happening<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.370> so

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
flaking from happening and so

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.780 
flaking from happening and so
conservators<00:03:47.290> really<00:03:47.709> love<00:03:47.920> using<00:03:48.250> this

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
conservators really love using this

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.360 
conservators really love using this
adhesive<00:03:49.420> that's<00:03:49.810> made<00:03:50.019> from<00:03:50.200> a<00:03:50.380> Japanese<00:03:50.860> sea

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
adhesive that's made from a Japanese sea

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
in gold foil something that was never

00:05:57.849 --> 00:05:59.850

meant<00:05:58.210> to<00:05:58.330> be<00:05:58.570> used<00:05:58.599> in<00:05:58.990> book<00:05:59.199> binding<00:05:59.620> at<00:05:59.710> all

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
meant to be used in book binding at all

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.920 
meant to be used in book binding at all
I<00:06:00.159> mean<00:06:00.340> it<00:06:00.490> almost<00:06:00.729> looked<00:06:01.060> like<00:06:01.270> a<00:06:01.300> candy

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
I mean it almost looked like a candy

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.570 
I mean it almost looked like a candy
wrapper<00:06:01.960> it's<00:06:02.800> just<00:06:03.280> not<00:06:03.550> holding<00:06:04.000> up<00:06:04.120> to

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
wrapper it's just not holding up to

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.360 
wrapper it's just not holding up to
test<00:06:04.760> of<00:06:04.970> time<00:06:05.180> so<00:06:05.690> I<00:06:06.020> use<00:06:06.620> the<00:06:07.040> thicker

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
test of time so I use the thicker

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.090 
test of time so I use the thicker
Japanese<00:06:08.120> paper<00:06:08.390> and<00:06:08.900> toned<00:06:09.470> it<00:06:09.680> with<00:06:09.830> acrylic

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
Japanese paper and toned it with acrylic

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.660 
Japanese paper and toned it with acrylic
paint<00:06:10.670> to<00:06:11.180> go<00:06:11.600> back<00:06:11.870> to<00:06:12.230> what<00:06:12.410> it<00:06:12.680> probably<00:06:13.490> had

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:13.670 
paint to go back to what it probably had

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.820 
paint to go back to what it probably had
looked<00:06:13.940> like<00:06:14.030> before<00:06:14.390> when<00:06:15.110> they<00:06:15.260> built<00:06:15.650> this

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
looked like before when they built this

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.190 
looked like before when they built this
as<00:06:16.040> a<00:06:16.400> problem<00:06:16.820> that<00:06:17.030> the<00:06:17.360> plate<00:06:17.630> was<00:06:17.810> actually

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
as a problem that the plate was actually

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.010 
as a problem that the plate was actually
placed<00:06:19.100> and<00:06:19.430> mounted<00:06:19.880> somehow<00:06:20.150> to<00:06:20.570> an<00:06:20.720> actual

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
placed and mounted somehow to an actual

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.100 
placed and mounted somehow to an actual
book<00:06:21.560> and<00:06:22.100> the<00:06:22.400> weight<00:06:22.640> of<00:06:22.850> that<00:06:23.360> cover<00:06:23.720> alone

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
book and the weight of that cover alone

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.810 
book and the weight of that cover alone
is<00:06:24.500> kind<00:06:24.680> of<00:06:24.740> what<00:06:25.010> sped<00:06:25.430> up<00:06:25.550> some<00:06:25.700> of<00:06:25.760> the

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
is kind of what sped up some of the

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.010 
is kind of what sped up some of the
deterioration<00:06:26.210> and<00:06:26.450> the<00:06:26.510> binding<00:06:26.840> is<00:06:26.930> that

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
deterioration and the binding is that

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.410 
deterioration and the binding is that
correct<00:06:27.290> yeah<00:06:27.710> this<00:06:28.040> board<00:06:28.430> is<00:06:28.670> so<00:06:28.880> heavy<00:06:29.150> it's
