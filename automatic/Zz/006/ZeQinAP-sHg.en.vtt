and<00:03:47.050> smooth<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.830> way<00:03:47.950> that<00:03:48.130> I<00:03:48.160> use<00:03:48.459> it<00:03:48.610> is<00:03:48.730> I

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
and smooth so the way that I use it is I

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.820 
and smooth so the way that I use it is I
just<00:03:48.940> take<00:03:49.180> small<00:03:49.690> sections<00:03:49.930> of<00:03:50.380> my<00:03:50.530> hair<00:03:50.560> and

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
just take small sections of my hair and

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.979 
just take small sections of my hair and
wrap<00:03:51.280> it<00:03:51.489> around<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:52.090> wand<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:52.690> then<00:03:52.840> I<00:03:52.930> just

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
wrap it around the wand and then I just

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.170 
wrap it around the wand and then I just
hold<00:03:53.320> it<00:03:53.380> there<00:03:53.470> for<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.950> few<00:03:54.190> seconds<00:03:54.640> and<00:03:54.820> then

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
hold it there for a few seconds and then

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.240 
hold it there for a few seconds and then
let<00:03:55.390> it<00:03:55.420> drop<00:03:55.750> and<00:03:55.930> I<00:03:56.320> like<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.650> alternate<00:03:57.190> the

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
let it drop and I like to alternate the

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.130
