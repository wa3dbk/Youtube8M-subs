ready<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.000> take<00:00:45.180> off<00:00:47.360> if<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.540> look<00:00:48.930> at

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
ready to take off if you just look at

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.319 
ready to take off if you just look at
the<00:00:49.140> economics<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.460> probably<00:00:50.790> makes

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
the economics of it it probably makes

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.959 
the economics of it it probably makes
sense<00:00:51.480> if<00:00:51.870> you're<00:00:52.140> ready<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.890> change<00:00:53.730> your

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
sense if you're ready to change your

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.119 
sense if you're ready to change your
home<00:00:54.149> heating<00:00:54.540> system<00:00:54.989> then<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.770> could<00:00:55.950> look

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
home heating system then you could look

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.639 
home heating system then you could look
at<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.610> furnace<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:58.530> would

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
at the furnace like this and it would

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.069 
at the furnace like this and it would
make<00:00:58.890> sense<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.340> install<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:00.899> to

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
make sense to install it you do have to

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.520 
make sense to install it you do have to
dump<00:01:01.290> the<00:01:01.440> ash<00:01:01.730> you<00:01:02.730> do<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.300> put<00:01:04.259> fuel

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
dump the ash you do have to put fuel

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.149 
dump the ash you do have to put fuel
into<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.799> hopper<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:06.560> you<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.860> store

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
into the hopper and you have to store

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.080 
into the hopper and you have to store
that<00:01:08.340> fuel<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.180> five<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.869> ten<00:01:10.049> minutes<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.530> day

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
that fuel so five to ten minutes a day

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.090 
that fuel so five to ten minutes a day
probably<00:01:12.090> review<00:01:12.270> about<00:01:12.720> all<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.110> need<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
probably review about all you need the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.890 
probably review about all you need the
furnace<00:01:14.430> consists<00:01:14.940> of<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.090> hopper<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.659> three

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
furnace consists of a hopper for three

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.600 
furnace consists of a hopper for three
to<00:01:15.990> four<00:01:16.140> days<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.530> fuel<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.010> an<00:01:17.280> auger<00:01:17.490> that

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
to four days of fuel and an auger that

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.340 
to four days of fuel and an auger that
feeds<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.180> fuel<00:01:18.510> into<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.810> fire<00:01:19.049> chamber

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
feeds that fuel into the fire chamber

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.770 
feeds that fuel into the fire chamber
that<00:01:20.340> auger<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.790> controlled<00:01:21.210> automatically

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
that auger is controlled automatically

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.630 
that auger is controlled automatically
by<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.020> thermostat<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> furnace<00:01:23.520> can

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
by the thermostat so the furnace can

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.850 
by the thermostat so the furnace can
regulate<00:01:24.090> itself<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> natural<00:01:25.680> gas

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860
