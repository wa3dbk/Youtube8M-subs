00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.649
 lath cited or some small cord we're going 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.460
 to occupy scissors and we will occupy 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:01.540
 silicone gun we are going to line 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:05.290
 our role 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.390
 with paper contact 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.120
 in this way to prevent you from getting 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.940
 paste everything I only recommend you alone 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.980
 discover a part and then place 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.970
 on top of a piece of paper 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.970
 well in this way 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.580
 and then go slowly peeling off 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.060
 rest of the paper to finish covering 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.940
 the paper we will do the same with the 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.970
 next paper contact we will put it in 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.479
 the top part good now that I already 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.479
 we have ready 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.520
 marked the outline of this record you 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.170
 You can see the circle with whatever you want 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.409
 I have marked with a red down so that 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.110
 you can see it I have also marked a 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.920
 spiral that I'm going to cut that starts 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.440
 from here and goes to the center we are going to 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.159
 cut everything to the little circle of 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.649
 center here I already have something important 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.810
 what you should remember is that depending on 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.410
 the number of circles that you go to 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.050
 put here in the center between more 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.830
 circles are longer you will be able to 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:21.600
 stay the spiral 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:25.140
 Now the next thing we will do is 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:29.090
 place our sequin so that 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:32.340
 it may be hanging like this 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.780
 this is how we have stayed now 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.780
 there is the spiral 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.630
 here is how you can hang 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.800
 It is very beautiful very easy to do and very 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.800
 fast
