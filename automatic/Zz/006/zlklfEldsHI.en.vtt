00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.550
 pumas is already motivated to get a 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.960
 victory as you see this common party 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.910
 complicated first you have to play the cup 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.360
 the boys have to focus more 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.780
 in what comes tomorrow we know that they are 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.090
 focused are actions are 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.700
 training and everything so focus on 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.640
 that can be technical by finishing that 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.200
 match you will see what the coach said 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.669
 for the game it is obviously that it is 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.900
 a difficult opponent no matter how many 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.430
 come losing I do not think he has 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.690
 great players and put together very well for 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.390
 this tournament but 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.600
 maybe it did not help much in a match that 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.040
 he deserved to win he did not have the victory 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.990
 700 as the man of experience of 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.550
 comes on the team especially for the 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.500
 front you have to you and the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.360
 two games and accumulated how you 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.280
 You feel how you feel to be the reference 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.160
 an offensive in favor 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.699
 I feel good I feel how I feel 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.850
 happy be it working or be the 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.350
 experience is not this that aside if 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.960
 to one when I entered the field you forget 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.510
 everything that made the 400 matches these 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.620
 others have to be demonstrated day by day because 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.170
 if not today how is modern football 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.300
 what do you do that outside there are jaguars for 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.880
 compete to all the teams I think that 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.060
 yes where we showed obviously we had 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.800
 Ups and downs irregularities but 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.040
 we show that we can compete from you to 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.470
 you to anyone except 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.120
 we had calamities against america and 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.070
 against toluca but later I think that you 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.850
 we can compete all those were 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.640
 matches that are once in five years 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.320
 every time I invite about such a 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.840
 case now with people with a draw it 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.940
 rescued pumas the hundred is Saturday's 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.690
 is a team that has here is unbeaten 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.530
 as a base situation 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.540
 all are 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.740
 obviously every game that happens you go to 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.060
 say you can take away I invite you 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.060
 they can remove the mixed one, hopefully not 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.610
 i 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.320
 foam 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.540
 are teams are also a team that 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.570
 A year ago we did not lose the same 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.210
 case but as I said just when 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.010
 you enter the court all the 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.960
 statistics and everything you have are eleven 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.860
 against eleven and the one that does best 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.880
 things 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.940
 the three points I do not know how the 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.940
 match
