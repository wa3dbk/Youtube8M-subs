other they also have been measured for
their<00:01:02.879> volume<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:04.350> as<00:01:04.559> an<00:01:04.710> example<00:01:04.799> if<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.580> were

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
their volume so as an example if I were

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.490 
their volume so as an example if I were
to<00:01:05.820> take<00:01:06.030> Cup<00:01:06.360> number<00:01:06.780> one<00:01:07.490> fill<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.500> fill

to take Cup number one fill it and fill

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.710 
to take Cup number one fill it and fill
it<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.770> second<00:01:11.159> time<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.700> would<00:01:12.150> find<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.540> one

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
it a second time I would find that one

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.460 
it a second time I would find that one
plus<00:01:12.990> one<00:01:13.140> equals<00:01:13.590> two<00:01:14.750> that<00:01:15.750> will<00:01:15.960> work<00:01:15.990> with

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
plus one equals two that will work with

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.999 
plus one equals two that will work with
any<00:01:16.650> combination<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> cups<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.439> fact<00:01:19.439> the
