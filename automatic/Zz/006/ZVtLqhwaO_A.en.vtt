sporting<00:02:55.780> event<00:02:56.110> which<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.160> think<00:02:57.430> will<00:02:57.670> be

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
sporting event which I think will be

second<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.420> none<00:02:58.450> in<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.290> world<00:02:59.500> of

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
second to none in the world of

second to none in the world of
para-cycling<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.600> think<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.560> will<00:03:02.709> stand

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
para-cycling and I think it will stand

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.180 
para-cycling and I think it will stand
out<00:03:03.250> in<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.970> world<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.269> international<00:03:04.540> events
