00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
leading to that direction so that almost

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.580 
leading to that direction so that almost
all<00:01:06.000> important<00:01:06.479> buildings<00:01:06.840> are<00:01:07.020> done<00:01:07.200> by<00:01:07.380> good

would<00:02:02.070> say<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.640> case<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.930> chapel

would say in the case of the chapel

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.700 
would say in the case of the chapel
income<00:02:04.590> p<00:02:05.119> what<00:02:06.119> we<00:02:06.299> found<00:02:06.479> really<00:02:07.229> rewarding

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
income p what we found really rewarding

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.229 
income p what we found really rewarding
is<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.250> combination<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.910> really

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
is that it's a combination of really

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.260 
is that it's a combination of really
traditional<00:02:09.810> techniques<00:02:10.319> like<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:11.550> carpentry

that that leads to into this kind of
enclosed<00:02:47.150> architecture<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:50.510> since<00:02:51.510> that's

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
enclosed architecture and since that's

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.530 
enclosed architecture and since that's
the<00:02:51.810> case<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:53.760> top<00:02:53.970> light<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.390> surrounds

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
the case the top light that surrounds

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.440 
the case the top light that surrounds
the<00:02:55.200> chapel<00:02:56.010> space<00:02:56.280> becomes<00:02:56.700> very<00:02:56.940> important

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
the chapel space becomes very important

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.800 
the chapel space becomes very important
and<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:58.790> also<00:02:59.790> we<00:03:00.030> wanted<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:00.330> there's<00:03:00.630> not

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
and and also we wanted that there's not

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.440 
and and also we wanted that there's not
too<00:03:01.230> much<00:03:01.380> light<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.950> there<00:03:02.220> should<00:03:02.430> be<00:03:02.459> very

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
too much light it there should be very

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.820 
too much light it there should be very
little<00:03:03.810> light<00:03:03.959> so<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.200> there's<00:03:04.530> this<00:03:04.650> kind

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
little light so that there's this kind

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.140 
little light so that there's this kind
of<00:03:05.150> kind<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.269> half<00:03:06.750> dark<00:03:07.340> atmosphere<00:03:08.340> which

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
of kind of half dark atmosphere which

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.059 
of kind of half dark atmosphere which
changes<00:03:10.069> in<00:03:11.069> a<00:03:11.459> subtle<00:03:11.640> way<00:03:11.959> this<00:03:13.069> there's

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
changes in a subtle way this there's

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.460 
changes in a subtle way this there's
never<00:03:14.220> too<00:03:14.700> much<00:03:14.730> light<00:03:15.140> because<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.290> gives

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
never too much light because that gives

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.850 
never too much light because that gives
a<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:18.060> right<00:03:18.239> kind<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:18.630> atmosphere<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.620> oil

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
a the right kind of atmosphere of oil

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.750 
a the right kind of atmosphere of oil
for<00:03:20.160> this<00:03:20.340> silence<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.150> contemplation<00:03:21.930> and

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
for this silence and contemplation and

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.940 
for this silence and contemplation and
we<00:03:23.760> also<00:03:23.910> talked<00:03:24.180> with<00:03:24.510> Kim<00:03:25.350> wanna<00:03:25.650> go<00:03:25.709> quite

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
we also talked with Kim wanna go quite

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.259 
we also talked with Kim wanna go quite
quite<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.459> lot<00:03:26.670> about<00:03:28.220> all<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.700> atmospheres<00:03:30.209> of

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
quite a lot about all the atmospheres of

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.380 
quite a lot about all the atmospheres of
old<00:03:30.630> finished<00:03:31.140> churches<00:03:31.560> when<00:03:31.799> there's<00:03:32.040> like

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
old finished churches when there's like

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.729 
old finished churches when there's like
there<00:03:33.390> are<00:03:33.510> kind<00:03:33.750> of<00:03:33.780> small<00:03:33.930> windows<00:03:34.530> but

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
there are kind of small windows but

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.630 
there are kind of small windows but
there's<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.400> very<00:03:35.489> comfortable<00:03:36.410> comfortable

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
there's a very comfortable comfortable

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.680 
there's a very comfortable comfortable
atmosphere<00:03:38.750> environment<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:40.680> can<00:03:40.709> sense<00:03:41.100> the

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
atmosphere environment you can sense the

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.840 
atmosphere environment you can sense the
small<00:03:42.690> light<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.230> you<00:03:43.769> can<00:03:43.950> sense<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.370> wooden

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
small light and you can sense the wooden

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.240 
small light and you can sense the wooden
material<00:03:45.390> surrounding<00:03:45.630> him<00:03:46.140> so<00:03:46.350> I<00:03:46.560> think<00:03:46.890> that

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
material surrounding him so I think that

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.240 
material surrounding him so I think that
sense<00:03:47.940> atmospheres<00:03:48.840> are<00:03:49.019> we<00:03:49.739> talked<00:03:49.980> quite<00:03:50.220> a

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
sense atmospheres are we talked quite a

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.190 
sense atmospheres are we talked quite a
lot<00:03:50.489> about<00:03:50.519> them<00:03:50.940> under<00:03:51.239> very<00:03:51.420> very<00:03:51.780> important

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
lot about them under very very important

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.520 
lot about them under very very important
to<00:03:52.290> us<00:03:52.320> I<00:03:56.090> think<00:03:57.090> we've<00:03:57.299> learned<00:03:57.329> quite<00:03:58.260> many

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
to us I think we've learned quite many

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.470 
to us I think we've learned quite many
things<00:03:59.480> through<00:04:00.480> experience<00:04:02.150> which<00:04:03.150> we<00:04:03.299> could

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
things through experience which we could

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.810 
things through experience which we could
have<00:04:03.600> avoided<00:04:03.930> if<00:04:04.590> we<00:04:04.950> plant<00:04:05.250> things<00:04:05.549> a<00:04:05.700> bit

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
have avoided if we plant things a bit

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.180 
have avoided if we plant things a bit
better<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.420> mean<00:04:06.870> we<00:04:07.560> were<00:04:07.590> never<00:04:07.829> very<00:04:07.920> good

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
better I mean we were never very good

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.729 
better I mean we were never very good
with<00:04:08.459> business<00:04:08.850> so<00:04:09.239> we<00:04:09.989> made<00:04:10.170> some<00:04:10.350> mistakes

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
with business so we made some mistakes

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.560 
with business so we made some mistakes
which<00:04:11.010> were<00:04:11.970> kind<00:04:12.209> of<00:04:12.269> expensive<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.930> us<00:04:13.130> so<00:04:14.570> if

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
which were kind of expensive to us so if

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.140 
which were kind of expensive to us so if
I<00:04:15.840> would<00:04:16.410> start<00:04:16.709> the<00:04:16.919> business<00:04:17.340> now<00:04:17.700> I<00:04:17.729> would

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
I would start the business now I would

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.719 
I would start the business now I would
plan<00:04:18.870> it<00:04:18.930> better<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:19.769> know<00:04:19.890> talk<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.519> some

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
plan it better and you know talk to some

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.390 
plan it better and you know talk to some
financial<00:04:21.630> advisors<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:22.440> in<00:04:22.770> advance<00:04:23.099> and

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
financial advisors and in advance and

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.089 
financial advisors and in advance and
would<00:04:24.180> probably<00:04:24.630> make<00:04:25.349> your<00:04:25.650> life<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.950> bit

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
would probably make your life a bit

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.210 
would probably make your life a bit
easier<00:04:26.130> but

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
easier but

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.350 
easier but
on<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:29.520> other<00:04:29.610> hand<00:04:29.730> I<00:04:31.760> kind<00:04:32.760> of<00:04:32.790> enjoy<00:04:33.150> the

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
on the other hand I kind of enjoy the

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.120 
on the other hand I kind of enjoy the
way<00:04:33.510> we<00:04:33.720> did<00:04:33.840> it<00:04:33.990> because<00:04:34.170> it's<00:04:34.530> it<00:04:34.770> was<00:04:34.950> very

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
way we did it because it's it was very

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.060 
way we did it because it's it was very
honest<00:04:35.520> and<00:04:35.610> our<00:04:36.440> passion<00:04:37.440> was<00:04:37.560> never<00:04:37.830> in

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
honest and our passion was never in

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.040 
honest and our passion was never in
doing<00:04:38.460> money<00:04:38.730> it<00:04:38.940> was<00:04:39.120> in<00:04:39.240> architecture<00:04:39.810> and

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
doing money it was in architecture and

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.350 
doing money it was in architecture and
and<00:04:40.290> I<00:04:40.920> think<00:04:41.130> that's<00:04:41.730> pretty<00:04:41.970> much<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.180> only

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
and I think that's pretty much the only

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.230 
and I think that's pretty much the only
way<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.800> to<00:04:43.800> achieve<00:04:44.190> good<00:04:44.370> architecture<00:04:44.970> I

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
way to to achieve good architecture I

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.880 
way to to achieve good architecture I
mean<00:04:45.480> if<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:45.900> start<00:04:46.140> to<00:04:46.230> think<00:04:46.260> too<00:04:46.530> much

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
mean if you start to think too much

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.360 
mean if you start to think too much
about<00:04:47.040> money<00:04:47.480> you<00:04:48.480> lose<00:04:48.690> that<00:04:49.020> the<00:04:49.260> main<00:04:50.130> thing

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
about money you lose that the main thing

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:57.820 
about money you lose that the main thing
that<00:04:50.400> you're<00:04:50.700> after<00:04:50.850> I<00:04:55.970> think<00:04:56.970> it's<00:04:57.150> the

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
that you're after I think it's the

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.410 
that you're after I think it's the
obvious<00:04:58.830> answer<00:04:59.130> that<00:04:59.550> any<00:04:59.730> architect<00:05:00.240> should

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
obvious answer that any architect should

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.260 
obvious answer that any architect should
give<00:05:00.630> it<00:05:00.750> it's<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.740> climate<00:05:02.490> change<00:05:02.790> in<00:05:03.030> and

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
give it it's the climate change in and

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.590 
give it it's the climate change in and
and<00:05:04.820> ecology<00:05:05.820> and<00:05:06.030> energy<00:05:06.870> efficiency<00:05:07.380> and

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
and ecology and energy efficiency and

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.820 
and ecology and energy efficiency and
recognition<00:05:09.600> of<00:05:09.690> carbon<00:05:10.110> footprint<00:05:10.530> it's

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
recognition of carbon footprint it's

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.900 
recognition of carbon footprint it's
it's<00:05:11.370> really<00:05:11.930> if<00:05:12.930> an<00:05:13.080> architect<00:05:13.440> doesn't

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
it's really if an architect doesn't

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.910 
it's really if an architect doesn't
recognize<00:05:14.910> this<00:05:15.120> problem<00:05:15.330> then<00:05:15.780> they<00:05:16.110> should

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
recognize this problem then they should

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.340 
recognize this problem then they should
look<00:05:17.160> at<00:05:17.310> them<00:05:17.400> here<00:05:17.550> it's<00:05:18.419> pretty<00:05:18.570> much<00:05:18.780> what

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
look at them here it's pretty much what

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.280 
look at them here it's pretty much what
we<00:05:19.980> think<00:05:20.940> and<00:05:21.030> talk<00:05:21.180> about<00:05:21.360> quite<00:05:21.960> quite<00:05:22.260> a

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
we think and talk about quite quite a

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.680 
we think and talk about quite quite a
lot<00:05:22.500> at<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.740> moment<00:05:23.100> and<00:05:23.280> that<00:05:24.240> is<00:05:24.360> one<00:05:24.510> of<00:05:24.630> the

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
lot at the moment and that is one of the

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.830 
lot at the moment and that is one of the
reasons<00:05:25.050> why<00:05:25.169> we<00:05:27.169> we<00:05:28.169> are<00:05:28.380> looking<00:05:28.650> into<00:05:28.860> would

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
reasons why we we are looking into would

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.600 
reasons why we we are looking into would
even<00:05:30.840> more<00:05:31.020> than<00:05:31.200> we<00:05:31.350> did<00:05:31.530> before<00:05:31.919> because

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
even more than we did before because

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.730 
even more than we did before because
it's<00:05:33.000> pretty<00:05:33.540> much<00:05:33.660> the<00:05:33.720> only<00:05:33.900> material<00:05:34.230> that

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
it's pretty much the only material that

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.460 
it's pretty much the only material that
as<00:05:35.010> a<00:05:35.070> negative<00:05:35.280> carbon<00:05:35.790> footprint<00:05:36.300> so<00:05:36.480> wood

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
as a negative carbon footprint so wood

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.490 
as a negative carbon footprint so wood
has<00:05:37.500> potential<00:05:38.220> to<00:05:38.250> save<00:05:38.460> the<00:05:38.610> world

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500
