about<00:00:05.970> how<00:00:06.930> you<00:00:06.960> can<00:00:07.410> get<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.670> smoother<00:00:08.670> tilt<00:00:09.179> on

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
about how you can get a smoother tilt on

h3<00:00:13.860> 3d<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:15.540> believe<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.619> same<00:00:16.740> principle

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
h3 3d I believe the same principle

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.410 
h3 3d I believe the same principle
applies<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.640> h3<00:00:17.820> 2d<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.890> probably<00:00:19.890> too

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
applies to the h3 2d and probably too

Walker Black Label yes I know it's a
blend<00:00:31.080> but<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.920> know<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.160> still<00:00:32.340> going<00:00:32.520> down

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
blend but you know it's still going down

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:42.880 
blend but you know it's still going down
we're<00:00:32.790> not<00:00:32.940> very<00:00:33.300> nicely<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.840> Cheers<00:00:38.420> right<00:00:39.420> so

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.790 

smooth<00:00:44.629> tilting<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.750> camera<00:00:46.170> now<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.410> don't

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
smooth tilting of the camera now I don't

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.260 
smooth tilting of the camera now I don't
tend<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.129> do<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.370> much<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.850> flight

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
tend to do this much in flight

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.410 
tend to do this much in flight
personally<00:00:49.110> oh<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.879> find<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.059> fisheye

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
personally oh I find that the fisheye

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.260 
personally oh I find that the fisheye
lens<00:00:51.750> if<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.289> if<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.039> have<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> tilting<00:00:53.850> motion

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
lens if you if you have a tilting motion

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.479 
lens if you if you have a tilting motion
and<00:00:54.809> you're<00:00:55.230> watching<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.710> sort<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:55.949> live<00:00:56.190> as

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and you're watching that sort of live as

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.819 
and you're watching that sort of live as
you're<00:00:56.640> flying<00:00:56.910> through<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:58.199> fisheye<00:00:58.559> gives

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
you're flying through the fisheye gives

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.990 
you're flying through the fisheye gives
us<00:00:58.949> sort<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.129> strange<00:00:59.520> distortion<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.600> it

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
us sort of strange distortion as it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.170 
us sort of strange distortion as it
tilts<00:01:03.000> up<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.359> down<00:01:04.430> you<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.460> reduce<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.880> by

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
tilts up and down you can reduce that by

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.580 
tilts up and down you can reduce that by
using<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.600> narrower<00:01:06.930> field<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.320> view<00:01:07.439> obviously

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
using a narrower field of view obviously

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.250 
using a narrower field of view obviously
but<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:07.979> don't<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.610> much<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.390> it's<00:01:09.930> nice

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
but I don't do it much but but it's nice

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.359 
but I don't do it much but but it's nice
to<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> smooth<00:01:11.600> option<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.810> want<00:01:12.990> a

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
to have a smooth option if you want a

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.320 
to have a smooth option if you want a
lot<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.400> people<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.760> said<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.939> me<00:01:15.000> ah<00:01:15.090> you

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
lot of people have said to me ah you

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.600 
lot of people have said to me ah you
know<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.990> slider<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> back<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
know that the slider on the back the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.090 
know that the slider on the back the
actual<00:01:18.180> tilting<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.780> gimbal<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.590> really

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
actual tilting of the gimbal is really

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.429 
actual tilting of the gimbal is really
kind<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.400> sharp<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.939> it's<00:01:21.299> very<00:01:21.780> jerky<00:01:22.080> and

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
kind of sharp and it's very jerky and

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.800 
kind of sharp and it's very jerky and
difficult<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.890> get<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.009> smooth<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:24.299> what<00:01:24.689> I've

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
difficult to get a smooth so what I've

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.380 
difficult to get a smooth so what I've
done<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.020> I've<00:01:25.259> modified<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.850> settings<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.360> my

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
done is I've modified the settings on my

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.010 
done is I've modified the settings on my
gimbal<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.130> give<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.310> result<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.270> if

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
gimbal to give you a result like this if

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.160 
gimbal to give you a result like this if
I'm<00:01:31.140> going<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.590> move<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.829> all<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> way<00:01:32.100> over

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
I'm going to move it all the way over

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.469 
I'm going to move it all the way over
see<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> nice<00:01:34.470> smooth<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.369> damped<00:01:35.939> finish<00:01:36.299> it

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
see a nice smooth and a damped finish it

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.230 
see a nice smooth and a damped finish it
doesn't<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:37.409> still<00:01:37.590> going<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.240> now

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
doesn't it like it's still going and now

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.580 
doesn't it like it's still going and now
it's<00:01:39.390> all<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.630> way<00:01:39.750> let's<00:01:40.079> do<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> little<00:01:40.409> egg

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
it's all the way let's do a little egg

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.929 
it's all the way let's do a little egg
back<00:01:40.829> again<00:01:42.170> I'll<00:01:43.170> pop<00:01:43.439> up<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.189> then<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> chair

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
back again I'll pop up and then a chair

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.230 
back again I'll pop up and then a chair
slows<00:01:45.329> right<00:01:45.659> down<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.500> dumps<00:01:47.430> out<00:01:47.579> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
slows right down and dumps out the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.929 
slows right down and dumps out the
finish<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.930> get<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> very<00:01:49.759> smooth<00:01:50.759> it's

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
finish so you get a very smooth it's

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.690 
finish so you get a very smooth it's
still<00:01:51.119> going<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.600> very<00:01:52.439> gentle<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.579> can

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
still going and very gentle and you can

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.370 
still going and very gentle and you can
even<00:01:53.820> do<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.149> with<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.390> with<00:01:54.720> small<00:01:55.020> movements

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
even do that with a with small movements

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.609 
even do that with a with small movements
let's<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:55.649> move<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.950> move<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:57.530> move<00:01:58.530> it

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
let's just move it move it move it

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.330 
let's just move it move it move it
gently<00:01:58.979> here<00:01:59.280> look

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.010 

and<00:02:04.759> it<00:02:05.000> again<00:02:05.299> damps<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.170> finish<00:02:07.780> so<00:02:08.780> if<00:02:08.899> you

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
and it again damps the finish so if you

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.110 
and it again damps the finish so if you
are<00:02:09.200> wanting<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:09.800> make<00:02:09.979> some<00:02:10.009> very<00:02:10.580> small

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
are wanting to make some very small

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.059 
are wanting to make some very small
adjustments<00:02:11.300> in<00:02:11.930> flight<00:02:12.319> now<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.680> can<00:02:12.920> get<00:02:13.040> a

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
adjustments in flight now you can get a

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:22.350 
adjustments in flight now you can get a
nice<00:02:15.190> smooth<00:02:16.190> finish<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:20.620> how<00:02:21.620> do<00:02:21.680> we<00:02:21.950> do<00:02:22.099> that

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
nice smooth finish so how do we do that

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:31.960 
nice smooth finish so how do we do that
well<00:02:23.650> let's<00:02:24.650> have<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.340> look<00:02:25.370> oh<00:02:29.170> here<00:02:30.170> we<00:02:30.260> go<00:02:30.970> can

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
well let's have a look oh here we go can

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.300 
well let's have a look oh here we go can
we<00:02:32.000> see<00:02:32.330> how<00:02:32.870> probably<00:02:33.319> not<00:02:33.470> let's<00:02:33.890> just<00:02:34.130> move

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
we see how probably not let's just move

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.600 
we see how probably not let's just move
out<00:02:34.519> into<00:02:34.670> focus<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.209> little<00:02:35.360> bit<00:02:35.599> yeah

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
out into focus a little bit yeah

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.690 
out into focus a little bit yeah
probably<00:02:37.630> so<00:02:38.630> if<00:02:38.870> we<00:02:38.989> go<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.580> this<00:02:40.580> is

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
probably so if we go to this is

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
probably so if we go to this is
obviously<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.150> plant<00:02:41.930> assistant<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:44.510> we<00:02:44.600> go

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
obviously the plant assistant and we go

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.400 
obviously the plant assistant and we go
to<00:02:44.780> advanced<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:45.530> Gimbel<00:02:46.840> you've<00:02:47.840> got<00:02:48.049> here

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
to advanced and Gimbel you've got here

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.210 
to advanced and Gimbel you've got here
under<00:02:48.799> the<00:02:48.890> GIMP<00:02:49.099> gimbal<00:02:49.610> config<00:02:52.810> tilt

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
under the GIMP gimbal config tilt

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.559 
under the GIMP gimbal config tilt
control<00:02:55.220> gain<00:02:55.400> horizontal<00:02:56.000> limit<00:02:56.209> vertical

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
control gain horizontal limit vertical

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.720 
control gain horizontal limit vertical
limit<00:02:56.810> what<00:02:57.230> I've<00:02:57.319> done<00:02:57.560> is<00:02:57.709> I've<00:02:57.890> put<00:02:58.250> my<00:02:58.400> tilt

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
limit what I've done is I've put my tilt

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.699 
limit what I've done is I've put my tilt
control<00:02:59.239> gain<00:02:59.450> which<00:02:59.900> is<00:03:00.080> normally<00:03:00.410> way<00:03:00.590> up

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
control gain which is normally way up

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.170 
control gain which is normally way up
here<00:03:01.180> down<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.420> two<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:05.120> that<00:03:05.330> gives<00:03:05.630> you<00:03:05.900> a

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
here down to two and that gives you a

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:15.030 
here down to two and that gives you a
slower<00:03:08.620> speed<00:03:10.180> if<00:03:11.180> I<00:03:11.329> put<00:03:11.510> it<00:03:11.600> back<00:03:11.720> up<00:03:11.930> to

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.150 

where<00:03:16.040> I<00:03:16.100> think<00:03:16.250> it<00:03:16.609> was<00:03:16.820> in<00:03:17.120> defaults<00:03:18.160> which

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
where I think it was in defaults which

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.580 
where I think it was in defaults which
is<00:03:19.310> up<00:03:19.459> at<00:03:19.609> fifty<00:03:20.000> so<00:03:20.569> back<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.780> halfway<00:03:21.049> that's

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
is up at fifty so back to halfway that's

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.309 
is up at fifty so back to halfway that's
have<00:03:21.709> a<00:03:21.739> quick<00:03:21.950> look<00:03:22.900> what<00:03:23.900> that<00:03:24.049> looks<00:03:24.230> like

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
have a quick look what that looks like

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.509 
have a quick look what that looks like
now<00:03:26.140> that's<00:03:27.140> I<00:03:27.380> think<00:03:27.530> what<00:03:27.650> most<00:03:27.829> what<00:03:28.310> most

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
now that's I think what most what most

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:35.410 
now that's I think what most what most
people<00:03:28.910> have<00:03:29.120> in<00:03:29.500> their<00:03:30.819> setup<00:03:31.819> my<00:03:32.209> work<00:03:34.420> so

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
people have in their setup my work so

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.120 
people have in their setup my work so
you<00:03:35.720> can<00:03:35.840> see<00:03:35.930> it<00:03:36.019> very<00:03:36.049> difficult<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.739> get<00:03:36.920> a

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
you can see it very difficult to get a

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.550 
you can see it very difficult to get a
smooth<00:03:37.850> especially<00:03:38.660> fumbling<00:03:39.319> around<00:03:39.380> the

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
smooth especially fumbling around the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.470 
smooth especially fumbling around the
back<00:03:39.680> while<00:03:39.829> you're<00:03:39.950> flying<00:03:40.239> let's<00:03:41.239> change

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
back while you're flying let's change

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.400 
back while you're flying let's change
that<00:03:41.690> back<00:03:41.750> down<00:03:42.170> to<00:03:43.510> two<00:03:44.510> while<00:03:44.989> I'm<00:03:45.170> here

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
that back down to two while I'm here

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.640 
that back down to two while I'm here
just<00:03:46.160> do<00:03:46.310> off<00:03:46.459> shot<00:03:47.049> because<00:03:48.049> I<00:03:48.170> know<00:03:48.319> you<00:03:48.440> will

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
just do off shot because I know you will

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.860 
just do off shot because I know you will
enjoy<00:03:48.680> looking<00:03:49.040> at<00:03:49.250> my<00:03:49.459> hands<00:03:50.420> I'm<00:03:50.540> flashing

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
enjoy looking at my hands I'm flashing

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.640 
enjoy looking at my hands I'm flashing
away<00:03:52.239> three<00:03:53.650> two<00:03:55.540> and<00:03:56.540> now<00:03:56.600> we're<00:03:57.380> back<00:03:57.500> again

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
away three two and now we're back again

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.910 
away three two and now we're back again
let's<00:03:58.160> try<00:03:58.639> it<00:03:58.700> again

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
let's try it again

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.770 
let's try it again
back<00:04:00.920> to<00:04:01.130> that<00:04:01.280> smooth<00:04:03.760> damped<00:04:04.760> finish<00:04:05.540> which

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
back to that smooth damped finish which

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.500 
back to that smooth damped finish which
I<00:04:05.930> really<00:04:06.139> like<00:04:06.319> comes<00:04:06.980> down<00:04:07.280> so<00:04:08.239> there<00:04:08.389> we<00:04:08.480> go

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
I really like comes down so there we go

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.099 
I really like comes down so there we go
that's<00:04:08.870> how<00:04:09.049> you<00:04:09.109> do<00:04:09.380> it<00:04:09.410> you<00:04:09.950> need<00:04:10.130> to<00:04:11.109> plug

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
that's how you do it you need to plug

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.180 
that's how you do it you need to plug
into<00:04:12.379> the<00:04:12.680> phantom<00:04:13.159> assistant<00:04:14.560> advanced

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
into the phantom assistant advanced

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.470 
into the phantom assistant advanced
and<00:04:16.640> go<00:04:16.850> into<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:18.580> going<00:04:19.580> to<00:04:19.670> the<00:04:19.760> gimble<00:04:20.090> tab

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
and go into the going to the gimble tab

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.730 
and go into the going to the gimble tab
and<00:04:20.870> change<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.769> tilt<00:04:22.040> control<00:04:22.700> game<00:04:23.740> not

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
and change the tilt control game not

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.290 
and change the tilt control game not
even<00:04:24.950> sure<00:04:25.130> we<00:04:25.280> can<00:04:25.310> see<00:04:25.610> anything<00:04:25.910> let's<00:04:26.090> come

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
even sure we can see anything let's come

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.920 
even sure we can see anything let's come
in<00:04:26.450> a<00:04:26.480> bit<00:04:26.690> closer<00:04:26.960> sure<00:04:27.700> there<00:04:28.700> we<00:04:29.000> go<00:04:29.330> tilt

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
in a bit closer sure there we go tilt

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.320 
in a bit closer sure there we go tilt
control<00:04:30.410> gain<00:04:30.650> down<00:04:31.070> to<00:04:31.490> 2<00:04:31.790> and<00:04:33.790> that<00:04:34.790> time<00:04:35.300> I

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
control gain down to 2 and that time I

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.790 
control gain down to 2 and that time I
have<00:04:35.540> a<00:04:35.570> go<00:04:35.720> at<00:04:35.870> that<00:04:35.990> experiment<00:04:36.590> you<00:04:36.680> might

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
have a go at that experiment you might

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.080 
have a go at that experiment you might
not<00:04:36.980> want<00:04:37.160> it<00:04:37.280> that<00:04:37.430> slow<00:04:37.670> you<00:04:37.730> might<00:04:37.880> want<00:04:38.060> to

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
not want it that slow you might want to

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.540 
not want it that slow you might want to
come<00:04:38.210> a<00:04:38.240> bit<00:04:38.390> faster<00:04:38.980> try<00:04:39.980> that<00:04:40.160> and<00:04:40.310> you<00:04:40.370> might

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
come a bit faster try that and you might

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.030 
come a bit faster try that and you might
find<00:04:40.760> get<00:04:41.000> a<00:04:41.030> smoother<00:04:41.620> it's<00:04:42.620> slower

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
find get a smoother it's slower

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.790 
find get a smoother it's slower
obviously<00:04:43.790> but<00:04:44.000> it's<00:04:44.120> a<00:04:44.180> lot<00:04:44.300> smoother<00:04:44.930> now

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
obviously but it's a lot smoother now

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.430 
obviously but it's a lot smoother now
the<00:04:46.460> other<00:04:46.640> option<00:04:47.210> that<00:04:47.360> I've<00:04:47.750> seen<00:04:48.110> and<00:04:48.380> I

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
the other option that I've seen and I

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.410 
the other option that I've seen and I
haven't<00:04:48.710> done<00:04:48.800> it<00:04:48.920> myself<00:04:49.070> but<00:04:50.060> I've<00:04:50.210> seen

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
haven't done it myself but I've seen

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.760 
haven't done it myself but I've seen
that<00:04:50.480> you<00:04:50.600> can<00:04:50.810> buy<00:04:51.080> on<00:04:51.830> eBay<00:04:52.190> and<00:04:52.420> other

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
that you can buy on eBay and other

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.730 
that you can buy on eBay and other
auction<00:04:54.770> sites<00:04:55.070> mainly<00:04:55.550> a<00:04:56.210> kit<00:04:56.750> where<00:04:57.560> what

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
auction sites mainly a kit where what

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.890 
auction sites mainly a kit where what
you<00:04:57.830> do<00:04:57.980> is<00:04:58.130> you<00:04:58.220> take<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.490> back<00:04:58.640> off<00:04:58.850> the

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
you do is you take the back off the

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.280 
you do is you take the back off the
transmitter<00:04:59.900> and<00:05:00.230> where<00:05:01.010> the<00:05:01.220> slider

transmitter and where the slider
potentiometer<00:05:03.290> is<00:05:03.410> in<00:05:03.560> there<00:05:03.770> you<00:05:04.100> actually

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
potentiometer is in there you actually

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.050 
potentiometer is in there you actually
reroute<00:05:04.910> the<00:05:05.090> wiring<00:05:05.510> from<00:05:05.750> that<00:05:06.040> to<00:05:07.040> a<00:05:07.070> a

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
reroute the wiring from that to a a

potentiometer<00:05:11.600> that<00:05:11.780> you<00:05:11.960> mount<00:05:12.290> on<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:13.040> top

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
potentiometer that you mount on the top

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.090 
potentiometer that you mount on the top
here<00:05:16.300> tends<00:05:17.300> to<00:05:17.510> be<00:05:17.660> mounted<00:05:18.290> on<00:05:18.440> the<00:05:18.590> left<00:05:18.860> I

here tends to be mounted on the left I

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.290 
here tends to be mounted on the left I
would<00:05:19.250> imagine<00:05:19.460> so<00:05:19.760> you've<00:05:19.880> still<00:05:20.120> got<00:05:20.270> your

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
would imagine so you've still got your

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.300 
would imagine so you've still got your
right<00:05:20.870> stick<00:05:21.140> control<00:05:21.500> and<00:05:21.920> it's<00:05:22.040> a<00:05:22.130> rotary

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
right stick control and it's a rotary

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.700 
right stick control and it's a rotary
knob<00:05:22.520> and<00:05:23.150> with<00:05:23.450> that<00:05:23.600> rotary<00:05:24.200> knob<00:05:24.500> and

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
knob and with that rotary knob and

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.500 
knob and with that rotary knob and
you're<00:05:25.220> sort<00:05:25.400> of<00:05:25.490> thumb<00:05:25.670> and<00:05:25.790> forefinger<00:05:26.360> you

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
you're sort of thumb and forefinger you

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.410 
you're sort of thumb and forefinger you
can<00:05:26.750> get<00:05:26.930> a<00:05:26.960> much<00:05:27.290> if<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:28.550> potentiometer<00:05:29.360> is

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
can get a much if the potentiometer is

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.730 
can get a much if the potentiometer is
nice<00:05:29.600> and<00:05:29.780> smooth<00:05:30.110> you<00:05:30.230> can<00:05:30.260> get<00:05:30.470> a<00:05:30.500> nice

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
nice and smooth you can get a nice

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.800 
nice and smooth you can get a nice
smooth<00:05:31.280> transition<00:05:31.520> probably<00:05:32.300> even<00:05:32.510> with<00:05:32.780> a

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
smooth transition probably even with a

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.750 
smooth transition probably even with a
higher<00:05:33.050> gimbal<00:05:33.530> setting<00:05:34.040> so<00:05:34.280> if<00:05:34.400> you<00:05:34.490> want<00:05:34.669> to

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
higher gimbal setting so if you want to

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.090 
higher gimbal setting so if you want to
do<00:05:34.880> a<00:05:34.910> quick<00:05:35.150> flick<00:05:35.510> you<00:05:36.410> can<00:05:36.590> do<00:05:36.710> that<00:05:36.890> so

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
do a quick flick you can do that so

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.230 
do a quick flick you can do that so
that's<00:05:37.190> another<00:05:37.460> option<00:05:37.880> but<00:05:37.970> that<00:05:38.090> does

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
that's another option but that does

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.020 
that's another option but that does
involve<00:05:38.480> opening<00:05:39.169> this<00:05:39.500> boy<00:05:39.710> up<00:05:39.860> and<00:05:40.030> re

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
involve opening this boy up and re

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.570 
involve opening this boy up and re
soldiering<00:05:41.570> some<00:05:42.130> soldering<00:05:43.130> in<00:05:43.280> some<00:05:43.460> new

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
soldiering some soldering in some new

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.670 
soldiering some soldering in some new
connections<00:05:44.090> and<00:05:44.300> drilling<00:05:45.050> a<00:05:45.140> hole<00:05:45.169> in<00:05:45.410> it

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
connections and drilling a hole in it

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.190 
connections and drilling a hole in it
you<00:05:46.220> may<00:05:46.460> or<00:05:46.610> may<00:05:46.640> not<00:05:46.970> want<00:05:47.150> to<00:05:47.270> do<00:05:47.450> that<00:05:47.480> but

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
you may or may not want to do that but

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.830 
you may or may not want to do that but
that's<00:05:48.320> another<00:05:48.560> option<00:05:48.800> for<00:05:49.190> a<00:05:49.220> finer<00:05:49.840> finer

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
that's another option for a finer finer

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.050 
that's another option for a finer finer
control<00:05:52.120> so<00:05:53.120> anyway<00:05:53.390> I<00:05:54.490> hope<00:05:55.490> that<00:05:55.550> was<00:05:55.850> useful

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
control so anyway I hope that was useful

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.870 
control so anyway I hope that was useful
