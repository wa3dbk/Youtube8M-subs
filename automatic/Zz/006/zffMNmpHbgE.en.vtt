the 2004 latent so the main difference

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.200 
the 2004 latent so the main difference
is<00:00:43.150> we<00:00:43.329> have<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:43.780> new<00:00:44.379> SRAM<00:00:44.800> red<00:00:45.100> is<00:00:45.339> that<00:00:45.699> we

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
is we have the new SRAM red is that we

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.569 
is we have the new SRAM red is that we
have<00:00:46.390> a<00:00:46.420> true<00:00:47.110> hollow<00:00:47.500> carbon<00:00:48.100> crank<00:00:48.370> arm

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
have a true hollow carbon crank arm

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.189 
have a true hollow carbon crank arm
they've<00:00:48.760> also<00:00:48.970> stiffened<00:00:49.690> up<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:49.930> chain

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
they've also stiffened up the chain

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:51.930 
they've also stiffened up the chain
rings<00:00:50.409> so<00:00:50.649> the<00:00:50.769> chainring<00:00:51.159> profile<00:00:51.579> is<00:00:51.699> a<00:00:51.730> lot

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
rings so the chainring profile is a lot

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.020 
rings so the chainring profile is a lot
thicker<00:00:52.300> now<00:00:52.920> with<00:00:53.920> additional<00:00:54.070> shifting

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
thicker now with additional shifting

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.070 
thicker now with additional shifting
ramps<00:00:55.420> and<00:00:55.680> also<00:00:56.680> shifting<00:00:57.190> pins<00:00:58.080> difference

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
ramps and also shifting pins difference

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.649 
ramps and also shifting pins difference
is<00:00:59.199> about<00:00:59.290> set<00:00:59.920> borrow<00:01:00.400> the<00:01:00.610> technology<00:01:01.239> from

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
is about set borrow the technology from

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.280 
is about set borrow the technology from
the<00:01:02.040> mountain<00:01:03.040> bike<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:04.420> set<00:01:04.629> in<00:01:04.809> that<00:01:04.869> they

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
the mountain bike just set in that they

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.530 
the mountain bike just set in that they
the<00:01:06.159> cone<00:01:06.340> of<00:01:06.400> over<00:01:06.790> onto<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.119> back<00:01:07.299> here

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
the cone of over onto the back here

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.460 
the cone of over onto the back here
you'll<00:01:07.900> see<00:01:07.930> that<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.590> backing<00:01:08.950> plate<00:01:09.070> is<00:01:09.430> now

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
you'll see that the backing plate is now

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.010 
you'll see that the backing plate is now
machined<00:01:11.470> out<00:01:11.619> a<00:01:11.799> lot<00:01:12.070> more<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:12.720> I'm<00:01:13.720> not<00:01:13.990> sure

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
machined out a lot more and I'm not sure

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.749 
machined out a lot more and I'm not sure
whether<00:01:14.439> you<00:01:14.560> can<00:01:14.710> make<00:01:14.770> it<00:01:15.189> out<00:01:15.369> but<00:01:15.400> will

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
whether you can make it out but will

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.420 
whether you can make it out but will
also<00:01:15.790> see<00:01:16.450> there's<00:01:16.689> a<00:01:16.780> lot<00:01:16.960> more<00:01:17.250> machining<00:01:18.250> in

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
also see there's a lot more machining in

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.719 
also see there's a lot more machining in
between<00:01:18.909> the<00:01:19.090> cogs<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:20.409> that<00:01:20.590> alleviates<00:01:21.310> the

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
between the cogs so that alleviates the

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.109 
between the cogs so that alleviates the
the<00:01:22.659> noise<00:01:22.900> that<00:01:23.259> we<00:01:23.380> previously<00:01:23.950> saw<00:01:24.220> we<00:01:24.970> also

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
the noise that we previously saw we also

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.499 
the noise that we previously saw we also
do<00:01:25.540> have<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.170> addition<00:01:26.619> of<00:01:26.799> stealth<00:01:27.369> rings<00:01:27.700> in

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
do have the addition of stealth rings in

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.410 
do have the addition of stealth rings in
between<00:01:29.020> each<00:01:29.049> gear<00:01:29.560> that<00:01:30.369> are<00:01:30.549> cushioning

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
between each gear that are cushioning

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.080
