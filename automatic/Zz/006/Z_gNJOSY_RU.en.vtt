behind the r one was portability and
mobility<00:01:34.680> sure<00:01:35.220> don't<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.640> tell<00:01:35.790> our<00:01:35.880> viewers

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
mobility sure don't you tell our viewers

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.219 
mobility sure don't you tell our viewers
a<00:01:36.180> little<00:01:36.210> bit<00:01:36.420> more<00:01:36.570> about<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.869> sure<00:01:37.020> it's

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
a little bit more about that sure it's

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.719 
a little bit more about that sure it's
really<00:01:37.439> something<00:01:37.680> mean<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:37.979> got<00:01:38.130> an<00:01:38.369> a4

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
really something mean it's got an a4

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.679 
really something mean it's got an a4
size<00:01:38.909> screen<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.390> mentioned<00:01:39.630> before

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
size screen like you mentioned before

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.620 
size screen like you mentioned before
but<00:01:39.960> that's<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.170> 13<00:01:40.530> x<00:01:40.560> 13<00:01:40.799> size<00:01:41.610> screen<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.509> it's

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
but that's a 13 x 13 size screen so it's

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.969 
but that's a 13 x 13 size screen so it's
got<00:01:42.780> plenty<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.259> room<00:01:43.470> for<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.710> be<00:01:43.799> able<00:01:43.860> to

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
completely lightweight so they don't

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.100 
completely lightweight so they don't
have<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.700> worry<00:01:50.880> about<00:01:50.970> too<00:01:51.540> much<00:01:51.689> weight<00:01:51.930> in

have to worry about too much weight in
the<00:01:52.200> bag<00:01:52.350> well<00:01:52.860> now<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.070> your<00:01:53.310> point<00:01:53.520> about

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
the bag well now to your point about

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.179 
the bag well now to your point about
doctors<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.869> let's<00:01:55.049> say<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> doctor<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.829> using

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
doctors so let's say a doctor is using

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.370 
doctors so let's say a doctor is using
the<00:01:56.250> r1<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.880> they<00:01:57.509> want<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.840> make<00:01:57.990> sure<00:01:58.020> that

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the r1 and they want to make sure that

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.620 
the r1 and they want to make sure that
their<00:01:58.500> patient<00:01:58.920> files<00:01:59.189> are<00:01:59.520> protected<00:01:59.630> what

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
their patient files are protected what

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.459 
their patient files are protected what
is<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.899> what<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.409> face<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.860> done<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.909> r1

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
is a what a face is done in the r1

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.350 
is a what a face is done in the r1
security<00:02:04.469> wise<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:05.159> protect<00:02:05.640> other<00:02:06.270> people

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
security wise to protect other people

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.150 
security wise to protect other people
from<00:02:06.719> accessing<00:02:06.990> those<00:02:07.290> files<00:02:07.530> sure<00:02:07.890> there's

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
from accessing those files sure there's

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.499 
from accessing those files sure there's
two<00:02:08.399> things<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.849> really<00:02:09.179> liked<00:02:09.420> about

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
two things that I really liked about

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.400 
two things that I really liked about
their<00:02:09.750> notebook<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.050> there's<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.259> couple

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
their notebook and there's a couple

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.960 
their notebook and there's a couple
other<00:02:10.560> security<00:02:11.129> features<00:02:11.430> but<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.790> two<00:02:11.940> I

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
other security features but the two I

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.040 
other security features but the two I
want<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.270> talk<00:02:12.390> about<00:02:12.420> is

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
want to talk about is

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.990 
want to talk about is
the<00:02:13.170> fingerprint<00:02:13.650> scanner<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.430> really<00:02:14.820> cool

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
the fingerprint scanner is really cool

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.330 
the fingerprint scanner is really cool
actually<00:02:15.210> their<00:02:15.510> fingerprint<00:02:16.020> scanner<00:02:16.340> gets

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
actually their fingerprint scanner gets

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.130 
actually their fingerprint scanner gets
the<00:02:17.490> live<00:02:17.700> layer<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.150> scan<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.540> live<00:02:18.720> layer<00:02:18.930> of

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
the live layer and scan to live layer of

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.900 
the live layer and scan to live layer of
your<00:02:19.230> fingerprint<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:20.490> in<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.700> event<00:02:20.760> that

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
your fingerprint so in the event that

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.130 
your fingerprint so in the event that
you<00:02:21.030> get<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.150> cut<00:02:21.360> or<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.840> might<00:02:21.960> have<00:02:22.110> a

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
you get a cut or you might have a

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.990 
you get a cut or you might have a
callous<00:02:22.500> or<00:02:22.650> something<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.010> effect<00:02:23.370> it

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
callous or something to that effect it

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.580 
callous or something to that effect it
will<00:02:24.210> still<00:02:24.420> read<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.840> let<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.050> into<00:02:25.440> your

will still read and let you into your

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.440 
will still read and let you into your
notebook<00:02:25.980> Wow<00:02:26.250> now<00:02:26.550> I've<00:02:26.730> interviewed<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.420> lot

it's really cool it's something that
Sue's<00:02:33.150> has<00:02:33.270> done<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.510> really<00:02:33.690> kind<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:33.900> step<00:02:34.410> it

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
Sue's has done to really kind of step it

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.770 
Sue's has done to really kind of step it
up<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.650> notch<00:02:34.800> so<00:02:35.160> other<00:02:35.490> than<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.030> design<00:02:36.390> and

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
up a notch so other than the design and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.390 
up a notch so other than the design and
the<00:02:36.840> power<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.350> obviously<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.950> security

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
the power and obviously the security

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.640 
the power and obviously the security
that<00:02:38.520> HTS<00:02:38.940> is<00:02:39.030> put<00:02:39.210> into<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.480> r-1<00:02:39.810> what<00:02:40.380> else

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
that HTS is put into the r-1 what else

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.290 
that HTS is put into the r-1 what else
have<00:02:40.920> they<00:02:40.950> incorporated<00:02:41.520> into<00:02:41.730> their<00:02:41.910> pcs

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
have they incorporated into their pcs

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.910 
have they incorporated into their pcs
that<00:02:42.570> kind<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.110> separates<00:02:43.500> them<00:02:43.650> from<00:02:43.680> the
