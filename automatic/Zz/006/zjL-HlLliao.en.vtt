00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
guess come to kind of the decorative

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.670 
guess come to kind of the decorative
portion<00:02:00.590> of<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:01.009> one<00:02:01.220> rack<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:01.910> then<00:02:02.750> for<00:02:03.350> the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
portion of the one rack and then for the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.960 
portion of the one rack and then for the
top<00:02:03.979> piece<00:02:04.759> I'm<00:02:05.479> actually<00:02:05.780> gonna<00:02:06.110> trim<00:02:06.970> right

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
top piece I'm actually gonna trim right

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.669 
top piece I'm actually gonna trim right
I'm<00:02:08.300> gonna<00:02:08.600> cut<00:02:08.840> all<00:02:08.959> these<00:02:09.110> like<00:02:09.380> it<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.560> little

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
I'm gonna cut all these like it a little

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.960 
I'm gonna cut all these like it a little
extra<00:02:09.860> forklift<00:02:10.610> pieces<00:02:11.270> right<00:02:11.540> off<00:02:11.750> and

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
extra forklift pieces right off and

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.540 
extra forklift pieces right off and
eventually<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.320> think<00:02:15.320> what<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.709> plan<00:02:15.950> is<00:02:16.250> is

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
eventually I think what the plan is is

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.500 
eventually I think what the plan is is
to<00:02:16.910> put<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.630> little<00:02:18.020> top<00:02:18.380> on<00:02:18.709> it<00:02:19.160> so<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:20.420> you

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
to put a little top on it so that you

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.990 
to put a little top on it so that you
can<00:02:20.660> sit<00:02:20.989> like<00:02:21.260> glasses<00:02:21.620> or<00:02:22.010> something<00:02:22.430> on<00:02:22.700> top

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
can sit like glasses or something on top

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.900 
can sit like glasses or something on top
of<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.360> or<00:02:24.220> whatever<00:02:25.220> your<00:02:25.520> else<00:02:25.670> you're<00:02:25.790> going

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
of it or whatever your else you're going

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.640 
of it or whatever your else you're going
to<00:02:25.970> put<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.270> so<00:02:26.750> let's<00:02:26.930> go<00:02:27.080> ahead<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.290> get

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
to put it so let's go ahead and get

00:02:27.650 --> 00:03:08.050 
to put it so let's go ahead and get
those<00:02:27.890> cups

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:22.390 

I<00:03:19.989> decided<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.140> keep<00:03:21.290> it<00:03:21.440> simple<00:03:21.680> just<00:03:21.950> use<00:03:22.370> a

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
I decided to keep it simple just use a

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.270 
I decided to keep it simple just use a
hand<00:03:22.640> saw<00:03:22.849> to<00:03:22.910> cut<00:03:23.120> these<00:03:23.300> out<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:24.830> base<00:03:25.040> is

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
hand saw to cut these out the base is

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.250 
hand saw to cut these out the base is
gonna<00:03:25.370> be<00:03:25.489> 20<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.390> quarter<00:03:26.750> inches<00:03:26.989> wide

gonna be 20 and a quarter inches wide

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.610 
gonna be 20 and a quarter inches wide
and<00:03:28.120> it<00:03:29.120> should<00:03:30.040> look<00:03:31.040> all<00:03:31.489> centered<00:03:32.150> up<00:03:32.620> with

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
and it should look all centered up with

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.690 
and it should look all centered up with
the<00:03:36.220> little<00:03:37.220> piece<00:03:37.580> on<00:03:37.819> the<00:03:37.970> very<00:03:38.150> bottom<00:03:38.390> and

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
the this connecting piece to the front

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.440 
the this connecting piece to the front
and<00:05:08.920> the<00:05:09.040> back<00:05:09.220> and<00:05:09.520> it<00:05:09.640> kind<00:05:09.760> of<00:05:09.880> covers<00:05:10.090> up

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
and the back and it kind of covers up

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.740 
and the back and it kind of covers up
that<00:05:10.480> gap<00:05:10.990> that<00:05:11.020> was<00:05:11.380> down<00:05:11.560> in<00:05:11.740> here<00:05:12.070> and<00:05:12.750> as

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
that gap that was down in here and as

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.300 
that gap that was down in here and as
you<00:05:13.870> can<00:05:14.020> see<00:05:14.170> I<00:05:14.200> got<00:05:14.440> a<00:05:14.500> wine<00:05:14.740> bottle<00:05:15.100> in<00:05:15.160> there

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
you can see I got a wine bottle in there

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.960 
you can see I got a wine bottle in there
right<00:05:15.460> now

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
right now

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.660 
right now
and<00:05:16.570> I'm<00:05:17.320> trying<00:05:17.590> to<00:05:17.620> figure<00:05:17.830> out<00:05:18.070> what<00:05:18.400> to<00:05:18.520> do

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
and I'm trying to figure out what to do

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.950 
and I'm trying to figure out what to do
with<00:05:18.880> this<00:05:19.000> I'll<00:05:19.240> probably<00:05:19.330> just<00:05:19.600> cut<00:05:19.870> another

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
with this I'll probably just cut another

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.440 
with this I'll probably just cut another
piece<00:05:20.320> of<00:05:20.350> wood<00:05:20.650> and<00:05:21.100> put<00:05:21.910> it<00:05:22.030> in<00:05:22.150> there<00:05:22.360> to

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
piece of wood and put it in there to

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.060 
piece of wood and put it in there to
close<00:05:22.660> that<00:05:22.930> end<00:05:23.200> up<00:05:23.470> and<00:05:24.600> if<00:05:25.600> you<00:05:26.350> can<00:05:26.650> tale

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
close that end up and if you can tale

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.410 
close that end up and if you can tale
this<00:05:27.790> is<00:05:28.240> a<00:05:28.300> half-inch<00:05:29.200> taller<00:05:29.650> in<00:05:30.010> the<00:05:30.070> back

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
this is a half-inch taller in the back

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.930 
this is a half-inch taller in the back
to<00:05:31.420> allow<00:05:32.140> the<00:05:32.770> wine<00:05:33.010> bottle<00:05:33.460> it's<00:05:33.640> actually

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
to allow the wine bottle it's actually

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.810 
to allow the wine bottle it's actually
leaning<00:05:34.180> forward<00:05:34.690> a<00:05:34.840> little<00:05:35.080> bit<00:05:35.730> for<00:05:37.290> the<00:05:38.820> the

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
leaning forward a little bit for the the

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.450 
leaning forward a little bit for the the
cork<00:05:40.120> always<00:05:40.420> to<00:05:40.570> stay<00:05:40.810> wet<00:05:41.320> with<00:05:41.800> the<00:05:41.830> fluid

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
cork always to stay wet with the fluid

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.670 
cork always to stay wet with the fluid
and<00:05:43.290> now<00:05:44.290> is<00:05:44.620> time<00:05:45.070> to<00:05:45.270> cut<00:05:46.270> the<00:05:46.630> top<00:05:46.870> I'm<00:05:47.500> using
