is this is a chip I ordered like a while
back<00:00:33.890> what<00:00:34.520> it<00:00:34.610> does<00:00:34.760> is<00:00:34.790> it<00:00:35.000> converts<00:00:35.420> your

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
back what it does is it converts your

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.520 
back what it does is it converts your
Nintendo<00:00:37.280> controller<00:00:37.750> nes<00:00:38.750> or<00:00:39.050> Super

Nintendo controller nes or Super
Nintendo<00:00:39.620> or<00:00:40.280> Sega<00:00:40.790> I<00:00:41.690> don't<00:00:42.110> even<00:00:42.199> know<00:00:42.500> what

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
Nintendo or Sega I don't even know what

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.170 
Nintendo or Sega I don't even know what
else<00:00:42.769> it<00:00:42.949> can<00:00:43.040> do<00:00:43.190> like<00:00:43.460> it<00:00:43.670> does<00:00:43.820> a<00:00:43.850> bunch<00:00:44.090> of

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
else it can do like it does a bunch of

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.830 
else it can do like it does a bunch of
shit<00:00:44.420> this<00:00:45.320> chip<00:00:45.910> converts<00:00:46.910> it<00:00:47.059> to<00:00:47.090> USB<00:00:47.420> and

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
shit this chip converts it to USB and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.819 
shit this chip converts it to USB and
the<00:00:48.470> intention<00:00:48.920> is<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:49.280> put<00:00:49.879> this<00:00:50.000> chip<00:00:50.829> inside

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
the intention is to put this chip inside

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.569 
the intention is to put this chip inside
of<00:00:52.100> your<00:00:52.250> controller<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:54.219> output<00:00:55.219> through<00:00:55.520> a

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
of your controller and output through a

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.299 
of your controller and output through a
regular<00:00:55.910> USB<00:00:56.149> port<00:00:56.680> what<00:00:57.680> I<00:00:57.710> have<00:00:58.100> done

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
regular USB port what I have done

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.040 
regular USB port what I have done
instead<00:00:59.739> was<00:01:01.300> instead<00:01:02.300> of<00:01:02.450> going<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:02.690> that<00:01:02.719> how

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
instead was instead of going to that how

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.350 
instead was instead of going to that how
I'm<00:01:03.440> going<00:01:03.620> in<00:01:03.800> tunnel<00:01:04.039> and<00:01:04.280> instead<00:01:05.149> of<00:01:05.210> going

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
I'm going in tunnel and instead of going

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.050 
I'm going in tunnel and instead of going
to<00:01:05.479> a<00:01:05.509> controller<00:01:05.930> I'm<00:01:06.649> going<00:01:07.160> to<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:07.610> actual

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
to a controller I'm going to the actual

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.740 
to a controller I'm going to the actual
NES<00:01:08.720> pork<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:09.950> i<00:01:09.979> can<00:01:10.310> plug<00:01:10.550> in<00:01:10.759> any<00:01:11.090> regular

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
NES pork so i can plug in any regular

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.249 
NES pork so i can plug in any regular
controller<00:01:13.030> and<00:01:14.030> it<00:01:14.420> will<00:01:14.509> convert<00:01:14.750> at<00:01:14.869> us<00:01:15.110> be

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
controller and it will convert at us be

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.620 
controller and it will convert at us be
internally<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.070> this<00:01:17.060> is<00:01:17.180> going<00:01:17.300> to<00:01:17.360> be<00:01:17.420> on

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
internally and this is going to be on

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.350 
internally and this is going to be on
the<00:01:17.750> front<00:01:17.899> of<00:01:18.020> my<00:01:18.110> computer<00:01:19.149> i'm<00:01:20.149> going<00:01:20.300> to

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
the front of my computer i'm going to

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.550 
the front of my computer i'm going to
have<00:01:20.479> two<00:01:20.630> of<00:01:20.660> these<00:01:20.810> I've<00:01:20.990> had<00:01:21.110> two<00:01:21.259> chips

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
have two of these I've had two chips

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.340 
have two of these I've had two chips
obviously<00:01:22.160> and<00:01:22.390> I've<00:01:23.390> made<00:01:23.659> this<00:01:23.840> front<00:01:24.200> bay

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
obviously and I've made this front bay

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.830 
obviously and I've made this front bay
that<00:01:27.520> will<00:01:28.520> do<00:01:28.670> that<00:01:28.700> we<00:01:29.390> just<00:01:29.540> need<00:01:29.659> some

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
that will do that we just need some

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.080 
that will do that we just need some
paint<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:30.439> sand<00:01:31.369> a<00:01:31.460> little<00:01:31.490> bit<00:01:31.700> more<00:01:31.850> and

paint and sand a little bit more and
then<00:01:32.920> get<00:01:33.920> some<00:01:34.070> hot<00:01:34.220> glue<00:01:34.369> action<00:01:34.759> going<00:01:34.970> on

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
then get some hot glue action going on

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.630 
then get some hot glue action going on
and<00:01:35.360> it<00:01:36.259> will<00:01:36.380> be<00:01:36.470> on<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.590> front<00:01:36.890> now<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:37.549> just

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
and it will be on the front now you just

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.330 
and it will be on the front now you just
plug<00:01:37.909> in<00:01:38.030> my<00:01:38.150> controller<00:01:38.920> right<00:01:39.920> to<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:40.130> front

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340
