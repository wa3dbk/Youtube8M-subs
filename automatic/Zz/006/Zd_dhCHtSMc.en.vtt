00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.220 
most inspirational to me and you can see
that<00:00:56.270> some<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> works<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.930> I'll<00:00:58.109> be

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
that some of the works that I'll be

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.279 
that some of the works that I'll be
doing<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.399> similar<00:01:00.289> female

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
doing have this similar female

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.590 
doing have this similar female
figurative<00:01:02.100> form

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
figurative form

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.479 
figurative form
I<00:01:03.630> found<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.290> water<00:01:04.590> bottle<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.070> was<00:01:05.160> crushed

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
I found this water bottle it was crushed

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.030 
I found this water bottle it was crushed
and<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.300> make<00:01:06.660> a<00:01:06.690> mold<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:07.950> I

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
and so I make a mold of it and then I

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:26.000 
and so I make a mold of it and then I
cast<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.360> glass<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:24.440> think<00:01:25.440> about<00:01:25.860> my

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
cast it in glass I think about my

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.469 
cast it in glass I think about my
artists<00:01:26.370> making<00:01:26.580> something<00:01:27.030> from<00:01:27.390> nothing

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
artists making something from nothing

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.430 
artists making something from nothing
and<00:01:28.110> then<00:01:28.920> having<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.750> something<00:01:30.750> carry<00:01:31.290> a

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
and then having that something carry a

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.760 
and then having that something carry a
very<00:01:31.770> magical<00:01:32.300> power<00:01:33.300> or<00:01:33.630> presence<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.380> in

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
very magical power or presence so in

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.440 
very magical power or presence so in
some<00:01:35.070> ways<00:01:35.220> it's<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.640> integration<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
some ways it's that integration of the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.719 
some ways it's that integration of the
ancient<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.050> the<00:01:37.080> contemporary<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:38.280> helps

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
ancient and the contemporary that helps

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.680 
ancient and the contemporary that helps
transform<00:01:39.330> experience<00:01:40.229> or<00:01:41.240> creates<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.450> new

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
transform experience or creates a new

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.930 
transform experience or creates a new
kind<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.880> now<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.259> speak<00:01:46.650> and<00:01:47.520> it's<00:01:47.729> like

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
kind of now so to speak and it's like

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.420 
kind of now so to speak and it's like
that<00:01:48.150> shamanic<00:01:48.630> or<00:01:48.900> alchemical<00:01:49.650> process<00:01:50.220> of

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
that shamanic or alchemical process of

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.249 
that shamanic or alchemical process of
taking<00:01:51.060> something<00:01:51.330> that<00:01:51.509> has<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.110> is

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
taking something that has that is

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.080 
taking something that has that is
valueless<00:01:52.830> that<00:01:53.280> someone<00:01:53.580> else<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.820> thrown

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
valueless that someone else is thrown

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.510 
valueless that someone else is thrown
away<00:01:54.560> gold<00:01:55.560> leafing<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.570> giving<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.690> this

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
away gold leafing it and giving it this

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.670 
away gold leafing it and giving it this
this<00:01:59.520> sort<00:01:59.759> of<00:02:00.290> background<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.850> history<00:02:03.680> and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
this sort of background of history and

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.730 
this sort of background of history and
combining<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.940> two<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.170> develops

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
combining the two so it develops

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.979 
combining the two so it develops
somewhat<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.550> new<00:02:08.729> mythology<00:02:09.330> or<00:02:09.510> a<00:02:09.750> new

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
somewhat of a new mythology or a new

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.010 
somewhat of a new mythology or a new
presence

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.560 

what<00:02:14.020> I'll<00:02:14.110> be<00:02:14.140> doing<00:02:14.410> at<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.010> Museum<00:02:15.570> during

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
what I'll be doing at the Museum during

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.810 
what I'll be doing at the Museum during
the<00:02:16.750> residency<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.590> creating<00:02:18.250> some<00:02:18.490> of<00:02:18.640> those

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
the residency is creating some of those

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.540 
the residency is creating some of those
forms<00:02:19.540> inspired<00:02:20.110> by<00:02:20.410> ancient<00:02:20.650> cultures<00:02:21.280> and

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
forms inspired by ancient cultures and

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.860 
forms inspired by ancient cultures and
then<00:02:22.890> later<00:02:23.890> integrate<00:02:24.790> some<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.630> found

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
then later integrate some of the found

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.290 
then later integrate some of the found
objects<00:02:26.350> that<00:02:26.530> are<00:02:26.710> part<00:02:27.100> of<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.370> archaeology

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
objects that are part of the archaeology

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.530 
objects that are part of the archaeology
of<00:02:28.330> my<00:02:28.630> everyday<00:02:29.020> experience<00:02:30.180> onto<00:02:31.180> the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
of my everyday experience onto the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.540 
of my everyday experience onto the
surface<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.290> these<00:02:32.950> are<00:02:33.040> going<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.190> all<00:02:33.340> look

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
surface and these are going to all look

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.040 
surface and these are going to all look
like<00:02:33.670> they<00:02:33.820> were<00:02:33.880> just<00:02:34.120> dug<00:02:34.390> up<00:02:34.600> so<00:02:34.870> we're

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
like they were just dug up so we're

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.350 
like they were just dug up so we're
using<00:02:35.260> some<00:02:35.410> materials<00:02:36.130> during<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.850> process

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
using some materials during the process

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.420 
using some materials during the process
to<00:02:37.980> create<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.580> somewhat<00:02:40.320> ancient

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
to create a somewhat ancient

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.760 
to create a somewhat ancient
archaeological<00:02:42.480> effect<00:02:43.480> I've<00:02:44.260> never<00:02:44.560> done<00:02:44.740> a

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
archaeological effect I've never done a

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.330 
archaeological effect I've never done a
residency<00:02:45.400> at<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.610> Museum<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.120> Glass<00:02:46.300> but<00:02:46.750> I

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
residency at the Museum of Glass but I

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.710 
residency at the Museum of Glass but I
visited<00:02:48.340> here<00:02:48.550> many<00:02:48.760> times<00:02:48.850> I've<00:02:49.390> taught<00:02:49.600> at

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
visited here many times I've taught at
