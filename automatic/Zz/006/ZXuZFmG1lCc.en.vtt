technology<00:00:19.880> with<00:00:23.090> 2008<00:00:24.230> technology<00:00:25.230> let's

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
technology with 2008 technology let's

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.000 
technology with 2008 technology let's
see<00:00:26.369> if<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.609> works

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
see if it works

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
software for messing about with audio

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.620 
software for messing about with audio
files<00:01:52.810> so<00:01:53.730> I'm<00:01:54.730> gonna<00:01:54.850> see<00:01:55.090> what<00:01:55.240> happens<00:01:55.510> here

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
files so I'm gonna see what happens here

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.930 
files so I'm gonna see what happens here
now<00:01:55.840> we<00:01:55.900> plugged<00:01:56.770> into<00:01:57.010> the<00:01:57.220> air<00:01:57.430> regard<00:01:57.790> it

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
now we plugged into the air regard it

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.050 
now we plugged into the air regard it
will<00:01:58.060> plug<00:01:58.270> in<00:01:58.420> at<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.630> PC<00:01:59.700> gonna<00:02:00.700> press<00:02:00.940> the

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
will plug in at the PC gonna press the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.560 
will plug in at the PC gonna press the
record<00:02:01.210> button<00:02:01.510> to<00:02:01.840> see<00:02:02.050> what<00:02:02.080> happens<00:02:03.570> we've

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
record button to see what happens we've

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.820 
record button to see what happens we've
got<00:02:04.690> progress<00:02:04.960> bar<00:02:05.380> coming<00:02:05.710> up<00:02:05.830> there<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.780> that

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
got progress bar coming up there so that

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.460 
got progress bar coming up there so that
is<00:02:08.830> looking<00:02:09.190> good<00:02:09.780> looking<00:02:10.780> at<00:02:11.080> that<00:02:11.200> top

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
is looking good looking at that top

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.230 
is looking good looking at that top
right<00:02:11.650> hand<00:02:11.770> side<00:02:11.920> it's<00:02:12.400> showing<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.760> record

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
right hand side it's showing the record

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.800 
right hand side it's showing the record
bar<00:02:13.600> in<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:15.220> owl<00:02:15.370> so<00:02:15.910> I'm<00:02:16.030> assuming<00:02:16.300> it's<00:02:16.630> just

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
bar in the owl so I'm assuming it's just

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.760 
bar in the owl so I'm assuming it's just
within<00:02:17.260> one<00:02:17.470> channel<00:02:17.980> which<00:02:18.100> means<00:02:18.340> it's<00:02:18.520> mono

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
within one channel which means it's mono

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.470 
within one channel which means it's mono
so<00:02:20.770> let's<00:02:21.190> give<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.520> try<00:02:21.760> see<00:02:22.180> if<00:02:22.209> that's

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
so let's give that a try see if that's

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.710 
so let's give that a try see if that's
worth<00:02:22.660> we're<00:02:22.930> gonna<00:02:24.180> stop<00:02:25.180> that

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.120 

I'm<00:02:28.720> going<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.930> stop<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.230> tape<00:02:29.470> machine<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:30.010> we

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
I'm going to stop the tape machine so we

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.650 
I'm going to stop the tape machine so we
can<00:02:30.160> hear<00:02:30.400> what's<00:02:30.550> going<00:02:30.640> on<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.150> I'm<00:02:31.569> going

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
can hear what's going on and I'm going

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.620 
can hear what's going on and I'm going
to<00:02:31.720> play<00:02:31.959> that<00:02:32.140> file<00:02:32.440> back<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:35.230> that's<00:02:35.440> what

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
to play that file back and that's what

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:44.040 
to play that file back and that's what
that's<00:02:37.630> recorded<00:02:40.230> from<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.260> machine<00:02:42.810> which<00:02:43.810> is

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
that's recorded from a machine which is

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.140 
that's recorded from a machine which is
probably<00:02:45.060> almost<00:02:46.060> 50<00:02:46.690> years<00:02:46.720> old<00:02:46.989> 41<00:02:47.830> year<00:02:48.100> old

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
probably almost 50 years old 41 year old

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.140 
probably almost 50 years old 41 year old
onto<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.180> modern<00:02:49.780> computer<00:02:50.380> so<00:02:50.880> that's<00:02:51.880> good

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
onto a modern computer so that's good

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:14.460 
onto a modern computer so that's good
that's<00:02:53.050> great<00:03:01.950> hey

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.600 

you'll<00:03:15.470> be<00:03:15.770> glad<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.600> decided
