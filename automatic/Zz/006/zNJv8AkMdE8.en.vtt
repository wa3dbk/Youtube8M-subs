a<00:02:05.009> sling<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.869> sling<00:02:07.079> was<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.350> too

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
a sling like this the sling was just too

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.820 
a sling like this the sling was just too
wide<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:09.840> made<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.080> knife<00:02:10.259> really<00:02:10.440> stand

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
wide and it made the knife really stand

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.870 
wide and it made the knife really stand
off<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.250> pack<00:02:11.489> and

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
off the pack and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.460 
off the pack and
give<00:02:12.030> me<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.180> few<00:02:12.480> different<00:02:12.870> mounting<00:02:13.140> options

give me a few different mounting options

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.460 
give me a few different mounting options

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
handle and what's nice about the sheath

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.720 
handle and what's nice about the sheath
is<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.960> knife<00:02:46.140> fits<00:02:46.440> in<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.770> either<00:02:47.460> way

slimmer fit on the sling without the
nylon<00:04:06.140> also<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.800> male<00:04:08.040> attachments<00:04:08.790> the

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
nylon also the male attachments the

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.710 
nylon also the male attachments the
MOLLE<00:04:09.390> compatible<00:04:10.220> straps<00:04:11.220> on<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.459> back

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
MOLLE compatible straps on the back

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.240 
MOLLE compatible straps on the back
didn't<00:04:12.720> fit<00:04:12.930> on<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.170> sling<00:04:13.410> very<00:04:13.620> well<00:04:13.830> so<00:04:14.160> it

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
didn't fit on the sling very well so it

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.740 
didn't fit on the sling very well so it
just<00:04:14.280> wasn't<00:04:14.700> conducive<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:15.240> put<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.540> whole

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
just wasn't conducive to put the whole

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.699 
just wasn't conducive to put the whole
sheath<00:04:16.170> on<00:04:16.440> there<00:04:18.049> what's<00:04:19.049> cool<00:04:19.320> though<00:04:19.530> is

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
sheath on there what's cool though is

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.370 
sheath on there what's cool though is
that<00:04:19.739> it<00:04:19.890> did<00:04:20.100> come<00:04:20.340> with<00:04:20.370> a<00:04:20.549> leg<00:04:20.820> strap

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
that it did come with a leg strap

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.120 
that it did come with a leg strap
you<00:04:23.380> know<00:04:23.470> if<00:04:23.530> you<00:04:23.590> wanted<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:23.890> wear<00:04:24.010> it<00:04:24.100> on

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
you know if you wanted to wear it on

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.000 
you know if you wanted to wear it on
your<00:04:24.280> belt<00:04:24.460> you<00:04:25.300> could<00:04:25.620> fasten<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.740> your<00:04:26.860> leg

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
your belt you could fasten to your leg

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.800 
your belt you could fasten to your leg
as<00:04:27.220> well<00:04:27.340> so<00:04:27.550> it<00:04:27.610> wasn't<00:04:27.850> so<00:04:28.510> it<00:04:28.570> wouldn't<00:04:28.750> be

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
as well so it wasn't so it wouldn't be

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.470 
as well so it wasn't so it wouldn't be
flopping<00:04:29.200> around<00:04:29.640> which<00:04:30.640> is<00:04:30.760> cool<00:04:31.000> that's<00:04:31.270> a

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
flopping around which is cool that's a

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.430 
flopping around which is cool that's a
that's<00:04:31.690> a<00:04:31.840> good<00:04:31.990> design<00:04:32.320> feature<00:04:33.660> but<00:04:34.660> like<00:04:35.350> I

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
that's a good design feature but like I

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.810 
that's a good design feature but like I
said<00:04:35.650> a<00:04:35.680> nylon<00:04:36.100> isn't<00:04:36.370> something<00:04:36.520> that<00:04:36.670> I

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
said a nylon isn't something that I

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.900 
said a nylon isn't something that I
needed<00:04:37.980> so<00:04:41.040> that's<00:04:42.040> just<00:04:42.370> that's<00:04:42.640> how<00:04:42.880> I

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
needed so that's just that's how I

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.910 
needed so that's just that's how I
mounted<00:04:43.420> it<00:04:43.510> to<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.810> pack<00:04:44.080> I<00:04:44.410> thought<00:04:44.680> someone

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
mounted it to the pack I thought someone

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.650 
mounted it to the pack I thought someone
else<00:04:45.160> might<00:04:45.490> want<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.730> see<00:04:45.940> this<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:46.420> see<00:04:46.540> how

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
else might want to see this and see how

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.960 
else might want to see this and see how
it's<00:04:46.840> done<00:04:46.990> on<00:04:47.050> this<00:04:47.320> was<00:04:47.560> a<00:04:47.590> lot<00:04:47.830> I<00:04:48.130> did<00:04:48.760> a<00:04:48.790> lot

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
it's done on this was a lot I did a lot

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.210 
it's done on this was a lot I did a lot
of<00:04:49.000> research<00:04:49.180> trying<00:04:49.540> to<00:04:49.660> find<00:04:49.870> videos<00:04:50.440> about

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
of research trying to find videos about

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.680 
of research trying to find videos about
how<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.430> mount<00:04:51.640> a<00:04:51.790> knife<00:04:51.970> and<00:04:52.180> anything<00:04:52.660> that

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
how to mount a knife and anything that

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.050 
how to mount a knife and anything that
came<00:04:52.990> up<00:04:53.200> was<00:04:53.380> about<00:04:53.560> you<00:04:54.340> know<00:04:54.460> the<00:04:54.610> tech<00:04:54.790> lock

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
came up was about you know the tech lock

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.430 
came up was about you know the tech lock
and<00:04:55.680> in<00:04:56.680> this<00:04:56.919> case<00:04:57.130> it<00:04:57.280> was<00:04:57.400> really<00:04:57.430> useless

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
and in this case it was really useless

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.900 
and in this case it was really useless
if<00:04:59.440> you<00:04:59.590> have<00:04:59.770> a<00:04:59.800> Maxpedition<00:05:00.160> pack<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:00.850> you

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
if you have a Maxpedition pack and you

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.490 
if you have a Maxpedition pack and you
have<00:05:01.060> this<00:05:01.180> elastic<00:05:01.630> cord<00:05:01.870> this<00:05:01.930> is<00:05:02.140> a<00:05:02.169> great

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
have this elastic cord this is a great

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.000 
have this elastic cord this is a great
option<00:05:03.690> this<00:05:04.690> isn't<00:05:05.050> going<00:05:05.200> anywhere

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
option this isn't going anywhere

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.970 
option this isn't going anywhere
I<00:05:06.040> mean<00:05:06.280> it's<00:05:06.400> not<00:05:07.410> necessary<00:05:08.410> easily<00:05:08.800> from

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
I mean it's not necessary easily from

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.730 
I mean it's not necessary easily from
the<00:05:09.070> pack<00:05:09.250> I<00:05:09.580> mean<00:05:10.330> it's<00:05:10.570> certainly<00:05:10.690> faster<00:05:11.650> to

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
the pack I mean it's certainly faster to

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.320 
the pack I mean it's certainly faster to
remove<00:05:12.070> than<00:05:12.280> it<00:05:12.370> was<00:05:12.520> to<00:05:12.640> put<00:05:12.850> on<00:05:12.970> there<00:05:13.240> and

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
remove than it was to put on there and

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.550 
remove than it was to put on there and
to<00:05:13.450> weave<00:05:13.600> it<00:05:13.750> in<00:05:13.870> and<00:05:13.900> out<00:05:14.110> of<00:05:14.290> the<00:05:14.350> molle

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
to weave it in and out of the molle

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.580 
to weave it in and out of the molle
webbing<00:05:15.690> but<00:05:16.690> it's<00:05:16.810> not<00:05:16.990> going<00:05:17.169> to<00:05:17.260> be<00:05:17.410> as

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
webbing but it's not going to be as

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.159 
webbing but it's not going to be as
quick<00:05:17.830> releasing<00:05:18.340> as<00:05:18.490> you<00:05:18.970> know<00:05:19.090> the<00:05:19.690> detect

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
quick releasing as you know the detect

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.300 
quick releasing as you know the detect
lock<00:05:21.419> so<00:05:22.419> that's<00:05:22.600> one<00:05:22.780> downfall<00:05:23.020> I<00:05:23.260> guess<00:05:23.560> but

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
lock so that's one downfall I guess but

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.810 
lock so that's one downfall I guess but
I<00:05:24.580> mean<00:05:25.390> for<00:05:25.570> me<00:05:25.860> it's<00:05:26.860> not<00:05:27.040> that<00:05:27.100> big<00:05:27.370> a<00:05:27.460> deal<00:05:27.490> I

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
I mean for me it's not that big a deal I

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.180 
I mean for me it's not that big a deal I
really<00:05:28.120> I<00:05:28.150> really<00:05:28.419> like<00:05:28.660> this<00:05:28.810> set<00:05:29.050> up<00:05:32.190> so

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
really I really like this set up so

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.880 
really I really like this set up so
that's<00:05:33.520> really<00:05:33.910> about<00:05:34.240> it<00:05:34.500> if<00:05:35.500> you<00:05:35.650> have<00:05:35.770> any

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
that's really about it if you have any

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.320 
that's really about it if you have any
questions<00:05:36.220> about<00:05:36.310> how<00:05:36.430> I<00:05:36.550> wove<00:05:36.850> this<00:05:37.030> in<00:05:37.180> and

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
questions about how I wove this in and

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.700 
questions about how I wove this in and
out<00:05:37.419> of<00:05:37.570> the<00:05:37.630> molle<00:05:37.840> webbing<00:05:37.960> feel<00:05:38.530> free<00:05:38.680> to

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
out of the molle webbing feel free to

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.820 
out of the molle webbing feel free to
ask<00:05:39.360> but<00:05:40.360> it's<00:05:40.479> really<00:05:40.720> pretty<00:05:41.260> simple<00:05:41.560> you

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
ask but it's really pretty simple you

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.330 
ask but it's really pretty simple you
can<00:05:42.010> make<00:05:42.160> up<00:05:42.370> any<00:05:43.050> combination<00:05:44.050> of<00:05:44.350> weaving

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
can make up any combination of weaving

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.930 
can make up any combination of weaving
you<00:05:45.460> want<00:05:45.700> and<00:05:45.970> you<00:05:46.360> know<00:05:46.479> it'll<00:05:46.660> stay<00:05:46.960> I<00:05:47.940> don't

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
you want and you know it'll stay I don't

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.300 
you want and you know it'll stay I don't
know<00:05:49.270> what<00:05:49.840> where<00:05:50.650> you'd<00:05:50.800> be<00:05:50.919> able<00:05:51.010> to<00:05:51.100> buy

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
know what where you'd be able to buy

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.480 
know what where you'd be able to buy
elastic<00:05:52.180> cord<00:05:52.450> like<00:05:52.630> this<00:05:53.070> aside<00:05:54.070> for<00:05:54.250> maybe

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
elastic cord like this aside for maybe

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.909 
elastic cord like this aside for maybe
cutting<00:05:54.700> up<00:05:54.880> a<00:05:54.970> bungee<00:05:55.300> cable<00:05:55.770> but<00:05:56.770> if<00:05:56.830> you

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
cutting up a bungee cable but if you

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:58.920 
cutting up a bungee cable but if you
have<00:05:57.070> a<00:05:57.100> Maxpedition<00:05:57.490> pack<00:05:58.000> it<00:05:58.270> always<00:05:58.419> you

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
have a Maxpedition pack it always you

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.219 
have a Maxpedition pack it always you
know<00:05:59.020> they<00:05:59.169> always<00:05:59.320> come<00:05:59.650> on<00:05:59.830> there<00:06:01.110> so<00:06:02.110> you

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229
