have<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> little<00:01:27.360> walk<00:01:27.509> around<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.140> can<00:01:28.290> see

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
have a little walk around so you can see

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.690 
have a little walk around so you can see
what<00:01:29.310> we've<00:01:29.460> got

what we've got

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.819 
what we've got
I<00:01:31.700> think<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> case<00:01:33.210> where<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> video

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
I think this is a case where a video

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.020 
I think this is a case where a video
certainly<00:01:34.829> works<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.610> explain<00:01:36.409> what<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.560> is

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
certainly works to explain what it is

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.249 
certainly works to explain what it is
not<00:01:39.030> unlike<00:01:39.390> what<00:01:39.630> used<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.900> be<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.140> little

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
not unlike what used to be the little
