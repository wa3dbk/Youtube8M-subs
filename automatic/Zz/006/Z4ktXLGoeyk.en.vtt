00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.020 
record all so uh that's that video I did
of<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:46.659> stop<00:03:47.409> water<00:03:47.620> flow<00:03:47.799> but<00:03:48.129> I'm<00:03:48.370> magnified

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
of the stop water flow but I'm magnified

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.619 
of the stop water flow but I'm magnified
into<00:03:49.209> a<00:03:49.360> 10<00:03:49.599> by<00:03:49.720> 10<00:03:49.750> Q<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:52.180> is<00:03:52.329> something<00:03:52.569> I

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
into a 10 by 10 Q this is something I

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:58.140 
into a 10 by 10 Q this is something I
forgot<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:52.900> include<00:03:53.470> in<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:54.159> video<00:03:54.629> is<00:03:56.400> now<00:03:57.400> if

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
forgot to include in the video is now if

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.869 
forgot to include in the video is now if
you<00:03:58.780> have<00:03:58.930> redstone<00:03:59.560> like<00:04:00.400> a<00:04:00.430> redstone<00:04:00.760> torch

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
you have redstone like a redstone torch

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.920 
you have redstone like a redstone torch
within<00:04:01.420> there<00:04:01.930> it<00:04:02.500> will<00:04:02.650> cause<00:04:02.829> loping<00:04:03.190> a<00:04:03.250> flow

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
within there it will cause loping a flow

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.119 
within there it will cause loping a flow
which<00:04:04.930> I'm<00:04:05.109> guessing<00:04:05.440> it's<00:04:05.560> because<00:04:05.620> of<00:04:06.040> the

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
which I'm guessing it's because of the

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.039 
which I'm guessing it's because of the
redstone<00:04:06.549> output<00:04:07.030> getting<00:04:07.480> put<00:04:07.659> into<00:04:07.810> that

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
redstone output getting put into that

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.599 
redstone output getting put into that
air<00:04:08.200> block<00:04:08.409> I<00:04:08.680> don't<00:04:08.920> know<00:04:08.980> what<00:04:09.099> causes<00:04:09.310> that

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
air block I don't know what causes that

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.589 
air block I don't know what causes that
but<00:04:10.319> so<00:04:11.319> keep<00:04:11.530> redstone<00:04:11.889> away<00:04:12.040> from<00:04:12.220> those

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
but so keep redstone away from those

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.390 
but so keep redstone away from those
just<00:04:13.599> let<00:04:13.780> y'all<00:04:13.959> know<00:04:14.040> all<00:04:15.040> right<00:04:15.099> this<00:04:15.370> next

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400

still<00:05:36.860> touch<00:05:37.040> these<00:05:37.760> mushroom<00:05:38.180> trees<00:05:38.420> can<00:05:38.900> you

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
still touch these mushroom trees can you

still touch these mushroom trees can you
get<00:05:39.110> a<00:05:39.230> mushroom<00:05:39.650> block<00:05:39.830> there's<00:05:40.820> a<00:05:40.910> problem

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
get a mushroom block there's a problem

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.340 
get a mushroom block there's a problem
well<00:05:41.480> you<00:05:41.510> probably<00:05:41.720> can't<00:05:41.960> see<00:05:41.990> it<00:05:42.110> too<00:05:42.320> well

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350

in<00:05:42.590> these<00:05:42.710> videos<00:05:43.040> but<00:05:43.420> the<00:05:44.420> texture<00:05:44.780> is<00:05:44.840> the

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
in these videos but the texture is the

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.920 
in these videos but the texture is the
same<00:05:45.170> on<00:05:45.470> both<00:05:45.890> blocks<00:05:46.510> but<00:05:47.510> they<00:05:47.600> stacked

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
same on both blocks but they stacked

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.200 
same on both blocks but they stacked
separately<00:05:48.640> but<00:05:49.640> now<00:05:49.850> they<00:05:50.030> have<00:05:50.180> a

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
separately but now they have a

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.570 
separately but now they have a
definition<00:05:50.830> can<00:05:51.830> we<00:05:51.920> craft<00:05:52.160> it<00:05:52.280> with<00:05:52.370> the<00:05:52.430> bowl

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
definition can we craft it with the bowl

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.530 
definition can we craft it with the bowl
to<00:05:52.700> make<00:05:52.870> stew<00:05:53.870> but<00:05:54.740> this<00:05:55.010> crafting<00:05:55.430> table<00:05:55.760> if

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
to make stew but this crafting table if

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.770 
to make stew but this crafting table if
you<00:05:56.780> go<00:05:56.930> over<00:05:57.260> to<00:05:57.290> a<00:05:57.440> mushroom<00:05:57.920> stew<00:05:58.570> it's<00:05:59.570> not

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
you go over to a mushroom stew it's not

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.730 
you go over to a mushroom stew it's not
even<00:05:59.990> acknowledging<00:06:00.440> the<00:06:00.530> mushrooms<00:06:00.920> so

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
even acknowledging the mushrooms so

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.660 
even acknowledging the mushrooms so
that's<00:06:03.740> a<00:06:04.040> little<00:06:04.250> weird

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:04.670

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
all right got them but I have used this

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.010 
all right got them but I have used this
in<00:06:15.520> a<00:06:15.610> Hunger<00:06:15.880> Games<00:06:16.030> map<00:06:16.270> where<00:06:16.510> if<00:06:16.630> you<00:06:16.780> have

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
in a Hunger Games map where if you have

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.510 
in a Hunger Games map where if you have
a<00:06:17.130> sticky<00:06:18.130> piston<00:06:18.580> or<00:06:19.300> pastand<00:06:19.750> and<00:06:20.340> then<00:06:21.340> you

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
a sticky piston or pastand and then you

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.360 
a sticky piston or pastand and then you
power<00:06:21.700> that<00:06:21.970> piston<00:06:22.330> you<00:06:22.630> can<00:06:22.870> move<00:06:23.370> that

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
power that piston you can move that

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.050 
power that piston you can move that
exact<00:06:24.730> texture<00:06:25.030> block<00:06:26.669> which<00:06:27.669> i<00:06:27.790> think<00:06:27.910> is

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
exact texture block which i think is

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.870 
exact texture block which i think is
pretty<00:06:28.240> neat<00:06:28.450> and<00:06:29.370> this<00:06:30.370> one<00:06:30.550> is<00:06:30.639> the<00:06:30.730> one<00:06:30.850> I

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 
pretty neat and this one is the one I

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.720 
pretty neat and this one is the one I
found<00:06:31.240> it's<00:06:32.139> not<00:06:32.260> helpful<00:06:32.680> in<00:06:32.860> any<00:06:33.040> way<00:06:33.130> but<00:06:33.520> as

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:33.730

you<00:06:34.120> can<00:06:34.210> see<00:06:34.270> I<00:06:34.389> have<00:06:34.690> over<00:06:35.110> 16<00:06:35.710> buttons<00:06:35.950> which

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 
you can see I have over 16 buttons which

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:42.650 
you can see I have over 16 buttons which
is<00:06:36.370> the<00:06:36.490> redstone<00:06:36.850> limit<00:06:37.200> but<00:06:38.200> if<00:06:38.320> I<00:06:38.850> don't

lagging behind like three four or five
minutes<00:08:03.490> is<00:08:04.270> if<00:08:04.570> say<00:08:04.810> you<00:08:04.870> getting<00:08:05.140> them<00:08:05.230> into

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:05.470
