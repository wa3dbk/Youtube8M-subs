think<00:03:15.440> from<00:03:16.440> day<00:03:16.500> one<00:03:16.830> we've<00:03:17.040> been<00:03:17.070> saying

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
think from day one we've been saying

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.740 
think from day one we've been saying
that<00:03:17.790> this<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.120> team<00:03:18.300> that<00:03:18.420> could<00:03:18.540> win<00:03:18.570> the

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
that this is a team that could win the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.180 
that this is a team that could win the
one<00:03:18.900> nothing<00:03:19.080> game<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:19.680> could<00:03:19.830> win<00:03:19.980> the

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
one nothing game and that could win the

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.550 
one nothing game and that could win the
game<00:03:20.970> because<00:03:21.270> of<00:03:21.300> our<00:03:21.480> team<00:03:21.750> defense<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.440> I

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
game because of our team defense and I

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.510 
game because of our team defense and I
think<00:03:22.740> we've<00:03:22.830> been<00:03:22.920> showing<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.340> little

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
think we've been showing that a little

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.280 
think we've been showing that a little
bit<00:03:23.610> now<00:03:23.790> we<00:03:24.420> had<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.540> lot<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.720> chances<00:03:25.140> tonight

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
bit now we had a lot of chances tonight

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.750 
bit now we had a lot of chances tonight
and<00:03:25.590> we<00:03:25.680> did<00:03:25.950> score<00:03:26.220> there<00:03:26.370> are<00:03:26.430> really<00:03:26.610> nice

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
and we did score there are really nice

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.390 
and we did score there are really nice
schools<00:03:27.170> it's<00:03:28.170> always<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.739> little<00:03:29.100> bit<00:03:29.280> of<00:03:29.310> a

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
schools it's always a little bit of a

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.729 
schools it's always a little bit of a
dampener<00:03:29.850> when<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.060> have<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.690> guy<00:03:31.050> stretchered

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
dampener when you have a guy stretchered

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.890 
dampener when you have a guy stretchered
off<00:03:31.800> the<00:03:31.980> ice<00:03:32.100> but<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:33.090> top<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.600> league<00:03:33.750> is

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900

now<00:03:35.959> was<00:03:36.959> it<00:03:37.140> was<00:03:37.290> one<00:03:37.500> of<00:03:37.530> those<00:03:37.650> plays<00:03:37.950> where

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310

their player try it was trying to cut

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.600 
their player try it was trying to cut
across<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.050> blue<00:03:40.200> line<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.590> for<00:03:40.890> folks<00:03:41.370> had

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
across the blue line and for folks had

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.910 
across the blue line and for folks had
him<00:03:41.700> lined<00:03:41.910> up<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.300> whether<00:03:43.140> whether<00:03:43.590> I

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
him lined up and whether whether I

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.290 
him lined up and whether whether I
didn't<00:03:44.100> know<00:03:44.250> was<00:03:44.550> whether<00:03:44.880> they're<00:03:45.120> guys

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
didn't know was whether they're guys

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.090 
didn't know was whether they're guys
slipped<00:03:45.959> or<00:03:46.170> whether<00:03:46.350> he<00:03:46.500> just<00:03:46.680> kind<00:03:47.010> of

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
slipped or whether he just kind of

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.140 
slipped or whether he just kind of
wanted<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.519> go<00:03:47.550> underneath<00:03:47.790> him<00:03:47.970> because<00:03:48.120> I

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
wanted to go underneath him because I

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.820 
wanted to go underneath him because I
didn't<00:03:48.300> want<00:03:48.330> to<00:03:48.480> take<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.630> hit<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.080> you<00:03:49.739> know

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
didn't want to take the hit and you know

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.110 
didn't want to take the hit and you know
your<00:03:50.010> skates<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.430> get<00:03:50.550> caught<00:03:50.730> in<00:03:50.850> a<00:03:50.910> rut<00:03:51.090> and

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
your skates and get caught in a rut and

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.820 
your skates and get caught in a rut and
I<00:03:51.330> think<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:52.110> kind<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.350> happened<00:03:52.680> when<00:03:52.769> you

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
I think it kind of happened when you

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.530 
I think it kind of happened when you
tried<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:53.070> twist<00:03:53.250> out<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.580> way<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:53.940> your

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
tried to twist out of the way and your

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.360 
tried to twist out of the way and your
body<00:03:54.660> goes<00:03:54.900> one<00:03:55.080> way<00:03:55.230> or<00:03:55.500> your<00:03:55.769> ankle<00:03:56.040> stays<00:03:56.220> in

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
body goes one way or your ankle stays in

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.740 
body goes one way or your ankle stays in
the<00:03:56.430> ice<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:56.910> I<00:03:57.000> think<00:03:57.209> that's<00:03:57.540> kind<00:03:57.720> of

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
the ice and I think that's kind of

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.440 
the ice and I think that's kind of
similar<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:58.860> what<00:03:59.160> happened<00:03:59.459> tonight<00:03:59.550> it

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
similar to what happened tonight it

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.330 
similar to what happened tonight it
feels<00:04:00.660> great<00:04:00.870> my<00:04:01.080> first<00:04:01.230> time<00:04:01.500> since<00:04:02.220> I've

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
feels great my first time since I've

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.670 
feels great my first time since I've
been<00:04:02.430> over<00:04:02.579> here<00:04:03.019> got<00:04:04.019> my<00:04:04.110> first<00:04:04.290> couple<00:04:04.500> goals

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
been over here got my first couple goals

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.990 
been over here got my first couple goals
tonight<00:04:04.890> so<00:04:05.280> it's<00:04:05.430> definitely<00:04:05.670> good<00:04:05.790> games

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
tonight so it's definitely good games

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.670 
tonight so it's definitely good games
good<00:04:06.269> feel<00:04:06.420> I<00:04:06.690> mean<00:04:06.959> it's<00:04:07.170> been<00:04:07.320> a<00:04:07.350> long<00:04:07.650> time

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
good feel I mean it's been a long time

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.289 
good feel I mean it's been a long time
coming<00:04:07.920> like<00:04:08.400> you<00:04:08.489> could<00:04:08.640> see<00:04:08.850> he's<00:04:09.000> going<00:04:09.239> to
