00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.350 

everybody<00:00:01.050> says<00:00:01.260> dr.<00:00:01.530> J<00:00:01.770> Tita<00:00:02.280> with<00:00:02.610> metabolic

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
everybody says dr. J Tita with metabolic

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.390 
everybody says dr. J Tita with metabolic
effect<00:00:04.020> and<00:00:04.440> I<00:00:04.710> just<00:00:04.890> want<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.100> cover<00:00:05.279> a

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
effect and I just want to cover a

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.179 
effect and I just want to cover a
concept<00:00:05.879> today<00:00:06.210> about<00:00:06.509> how<00:00:07.319> frequent<00:00:07.980> which

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
concept today about how frequent which

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.730 
concept today about how frequent which
should<00:00:08.429> we<00:00:08.610> be<00:00:08.790> eating<00:00:09.269> for<00:00:09.510> fat<00:00:09.780> loss<00:00:09.809> so

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
should we be eating for fat loss so

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.039 
should we be eating for fat loss so
there's<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.309> lot<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.519> confusion<00:00:12.059> over<00:00:12.870> this

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
there's a lot of confusion over this

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.890 
there's a lot of confusion over this
concept<00:00:13.820> some<00:00:14.820> people<00:00:15.120> say<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.360> should<00:00:15.540> eat

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
concept some people say you should eat

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.960 
concept some people say you should eat
more<00:00:15.929> frequently<00:00:16.770> some<00:00:17.460> people<00:00:17.730> say<00:00:17.910> you

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
more frequently some people say you

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.439 
more frequently some people say you
shouldn't<00:00:18.480> eat<00:00:18.770> frequently<00:00:19.770> at<00:00:19.859> all<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.449> you

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
shouldn't eat frequently at all and you

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.670 
shouldn't eat frequently at all and you
know<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.539> lot<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.720> people<00:00:21.960> are<00:00:22.050> asking<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.590> know

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
know a lot of people are asking you know

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.830 
know a lot of people are asking you know
where<00:00:22.890> does<00:00:23.070> metabolic<00:00:23.609> effect<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.269> come<00:00:24.600> down

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
where does metabolic effect of come down

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.929 
where does metabolic effect of come down
on<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.170> one<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:25.980> things<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.789> need

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
on this one of the things that you need

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.730 
on this one of the things that you need
to<00:00:27.029> understand<00:00:27.480> about<00:00:27.599> metabolic<00:00:28.050> effect<00:00:28.619> is

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
to understand about metabolic effect is

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.769 
to understand about metabolic effect is
really<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.130> answer<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.699> both<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.510> sense

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
really the answer is both in a sense

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.389 
really the answer is both in a sense
there's<00:00:31.080> certainly<00:00:31.529> gonna<00:00:31.769> be<00:00:31.949> people<00:00:32.160> who

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
there's certainly gonna be people who

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.700 
there's certainly gonna be people who
thrive<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:32.960> eating<00:00:33.960> less<00:00:34.170> frequently

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
thrive on eating less frequently

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.709 
thrive on eating less frequently
throughout<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.280> day<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.880> there's<00:00:36.360> gonna<00:00:36.480> be

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
throughout the day and there's gonna be

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.139 
throughout the day and there's gonna be
people<00:00:36.960> who<00:00:37.200> do<00:00:37.500> much<00:00:37.800> better<00:00:38.160> eating<00:00:38.670> small

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
people who do much better eating small

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.420 
people who do much better eating small
frequent<00:00:39.180> meals<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.230> before<00:00:40.950> we<00:00:41.070> even<00:00:41.219> get

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
frequent meals so before we even get

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.950 
frequent meals so before we even get
into<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.730> biochemistry<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.570> things<00:00:42.780> you

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
into the biochemistry of things you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.660 
into the biochemistry of things you
always<00:00:43.110> want<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.530> kind<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.010> look<00:00:44.250> at<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
always want to kind of look at the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.660 
always want to kind of look at the
concept<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:46.280> individuals<00:00:47.280> will<00:00:47.460> have

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
concept that individuals will have

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.290 
concept that individuals will have
different<00:00:48.000> responses<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.550> feeding<00:00:50.550> frequency

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
different responses to feeding frequency

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.900 
different responses to feeding frequency
but<00:00:52.260> when<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.739> look<00:00:52.949> at<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.219> science<00:00:53.730> behind

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
but when we look at the science behind

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.420 
but when we look at the science behind
this<00:00:54.360> we<00:00:54.660> can<00:00:54.870> look<00:00:55.079> very<00:00:55.350> clearly<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.070> see

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
this we can look very clearly and see

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.180 
this we can look very clearly and see
when<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.480> talk<00:00:57.750> about<00:00:57.780> feeding<00:00:58.410> frequencies

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
when you talk about feeding frequencies

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.849 
when you talk about feeding frequencies
sometimes<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.359> science<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.289> what<00:01:01.590> makes

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
sometimes the science and what makes

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.009 
sometimes the science and what makes
sense<00:01:02.129> biochemically<00:01:03.000> does<00:01:03.539> not<00:01:03.750> actually

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
sense biochemically does not actually

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.350 
sense biochemically does not actually
make<00:01:04.470> sense<00:01:04.850> clinically<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.000> here's<00:01:06.180> what

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
make sense clinically and here's what

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.750 
make sense clinically and here's what
I'm<00:01:06.450> talking<00:01:06.840> about<00:01:06.900> there<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:08.070> very

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
I'm talking about there is a very

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.270 
I'm talking about there is a very
specific<00:01:09.150> way<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> body<00:01:10.470> works<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.159> so

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
specific way that the body works and so

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.730 
specific way that the body works and so
every<00:01:11.700> single<00:01:11.939> time<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.540> eat<00:01:12.869> for<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> period

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
every single time you eat for a period

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.100 
every single time you eat for a period
of<00:01:13.830> time<00:01:13.979> after<00:01:14.610> eating<00:01:14.909> you're<00:01:15.659> going<00:01:15.960> to

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
of time after eating you're going to

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.050 
of time after eating you're going to
raise<00:01:16.290> insulin<00:01:16.920> levels<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.460> those<00:01:17.610> insulin

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
raise insulin levels and those insulin

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.550 
raise insulin levels and those insulin
levels<00:01:18.360> are<00:01:18.450> going<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.840> lock<00:01:19.290> down

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
levels are going to lock down

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.149 
levels are going to lock down
fat-burning<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.909> some<00:01:21.119> degree<00:01:21.470> so<00:01:22.470> it's

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
fat-burning to some degree so it's

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.530 
fat-burning to some degree so it's
really<00:01:23.430> relative<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.090> not<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.390> you're<00:01:24.509> not

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
really relative it's not that you're not

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.600 
really relative it's not that you're not
burning<00:01:24.960> any<00:01:25.229> fat<00:01:25.530> but<00:01:26.009> you're<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.430> be

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
burning any fat but you're going to be

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.649 
burning any fat but you're going to be
burning<00:01:26.880> less<00:01:27.330> fat<00:01:28.369> post-meal<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> lot<00:01:30.630> of

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
burning less fat post-meal so a lot of

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.179 
burning less fat post-meal so a lot of
people<00:01:30.990> would<00:01:31.140> say<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.710> order<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.040> take

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
people would say in order to take

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.160 
people would say in order to take
advantage<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.119> effect<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.689> should<00:01:33.780> go

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
advantage of this effect you should go

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.010 
advantage of this effect you should go
long<00:01:34.560> periods<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.189> time<00:01:35.400> without<00:01:35.670> meals<00:01:36.210> from

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
long periods of time without meals from

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.950 
long periods of time without meals from
you<00:01:37.500> know<00:01:37.619> four<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.549> six<00:01:38.579> hours<00:01:39.329> some<00:01:39.600> people

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
you know four to six hours some people

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.080 
you know four to six hours some people
say<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:41.220> know<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.759> an<00:01:41.880> interesting

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
say and you know this is an interesting

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.690 
say and you know this is an interesting
concept<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.140> certainly<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.799> true<00:01:44.460> that

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
concept and it certainly is true that

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.609 
concept and it certainly is true that
insulin<00:01:45.149> levels<00:01:45.420> will<00:01:45.570> be<00:01:45.689> lower<00:01:46.049> when<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.439> do

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
insulin levels will be lower when you do

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.499 
insulin levels will be lower when you do
that<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.280> increase<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.909> relative

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
that and you can increase the relative

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.899 
that and you can increase the relative
proportion<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.229> fat<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.490> are<00:01:50.640> burning

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
proportion of fat that you are burning

when you go long periods of time without
eating<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.670> huge<00:01:54.299> problem<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
eating the huge problem is is that the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.440 
eating the huge problem is is that the
body<00:01:56.250> has<00:01:57.180> huge<00:01:57.840> compensatory<00:01:58.439> reactions<00:01:59.189> and

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
body has huge compensatory reactions and

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.330 
body has huge compensatory reactions and
different<00:02:00.450> people<00:02:00.930> will<00:02:01.350> react<00:02:01.799> differently

hours<00:02:05.549> without<00:02:05.670> food<00:02:06.149> will<00:02:06.450> see<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.899> drop<00:02:07.380> in

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
hours without food will see a drop in

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.080 
hours without food will see a drop in
their<00:02:07.860> blood<00:02:08.129> sugar<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.910> not

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
their blood sugar and this is not

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.500 
their blood sugar and this is not

necessarily a drop into a low range the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.869 
necessarily a drop into a low range the

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
you pick up on a blood test so it's not

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.410 
you pick up on a blood test so it's not

you know um diagnosed diagnosed as low
blood<00:02:17.659> sugar<00:02:17.959> it<00:02:18.140> is<00:02:18.470> essentially<00:02:19.220> low<00:02:19.430> blood

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
blood sugar it is essentially low blood

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.670 
blood sugar it is essentially low blood
sugar<00:02:19.970> for<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.269> person<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:20.900> some<00:02:21.230> people

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
sugar for that person and some people

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.089 
sugar for that person and some people
will<00:02:22.189> react<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:23.239> with<00:02:23.930> increased<00:02:24.590> stress

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
will react to that with increased stress

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.789 
will react to that with increased stress
hormone<00:02:25.519> response<00:02:26.030> which<00:02:26.840> will<00:02:27.049> then<00:02:27.260> raise

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
hormone response which will then raise

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.850 
hormone response which will then raise
blood<00:02:28.220> sugar<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:29.140> because<00:02:30.140> we<00:02:30.530> are<00:02:30.709> all

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
blood sugar and because we are all

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.220 
blood sugar and because we are all
sitting<00:02:31.310> at<00:02:31.430> our<00:02:31.459> desks<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.120> working<00:02:32.569> then

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
sitting at our desks and working then

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.050 
sitting at our desks and working then
that's<00:02:33.440> gonna<00:02:33.650> cause<00:02:33.920> insulin<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.670> be<00:02:34.819> raised

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
that's gonna cause insulin to be raised

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.509 
that's gonna cause insulin to be raised
to<00:02:35.299> lower<00:02:35.510> blood<00:02:35.750> sugar<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.349> that<00:02:37.069> puts<00:02:37.370> you

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
to lower blood sugar and that puts you

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.890 
to lower blood sugar and that puts you
on<00:02:37.549> an<00:02:38.090> insulin<00:02:38.599> stress<00:02:39.470> hormone<00:02:39.950> cortisol

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
on an insulin stress hormone cortisol

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.149 
on an insulin stress hormone cortisol
rollercoaster<00:02:41.900> all<00:02:42.140> day<00:02:42.349> long<00:02:42.590> which<00:02:42.920> leads

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
rollercoaster all day long which leads

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.460 
rollercoaster all day long which leads
to<00:02:43.450> compensatory<00:02:44.450> reactions<00:02:45.200> such<00:02:45.440> as

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
to compensatory reactions such as

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.360 
to compensatory reactions such as
increased<00:02:46.099> hunger<00:02:46.390> increased<00:02:47.390> cravings<00:02:48.019> and

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
increased hunger increased cravings and

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.309 
increased hunger increased cravings and
fluctuations<00:02:49.370> in<00:02:49.579> energy<00:02:49.819> and<00:02:50.209> this<00:02:50.750> is<00:02:50.959> the

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
fluctuations in energy and this is the

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.460 
fluctuations in energy and this is the
problem<00:02:51.680> with<00:02:52.190> looking<00:02:52.970> only<00:02:53.359> at<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.900> science

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
problem with looking only at the science

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.349 
problem with looking only at the science
because<00:02:54.859> if<00:02:55.099> we<00:02:55.340> look<00:02:55.549> it<00:02:55.670> through<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.060> lens

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
because if we look it through the lens

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.589 
because if we look it through the lens
of<00:02:56.659> just<00:02:57.200> insulin<00:02:57.739> or<00:02:57.950> we<00:02:58.519> just<00:02:58.760> look<00:02:59.000> at<00:02:59.150> just

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
of just insulin or we just look at just

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.619 
of just insulin or we just look at just
the<00:02:59.780> stress<00:03:00.049> hormones<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.739> we<00:03:01.459> look<00:03:02.060> at<00:03:02.239> just

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
the stress hormones and we look at just

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.710 
the stress hormones and we look at just
one<00:03:03.049> aspect<00:03:03.319> of<00:03:03.980> physiology<00:03:04.639> we<00:03:04.879> miss<00:03:05.239> what

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
one aspect of physiology we miss what

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.170 
one aspect of physiology we miss what
happens<00:03:05.829> clinically<00:03:06.829> to<00:03:07.069> many<00:03:07.459> people<00:03:08.000> and

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
happens clinically to many people and

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.210 
happens clinically to many people and
the<00:03:08.299> people<00:03:08.750> that<00:03:08.900> this<00:03:09.049> happens<00:03:09.530> most<00:03:09.859> often

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
the people that this happens most often

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.849 
the people that this happens most often
too<00:03:10.639> are<00:03:10.879> the<00:03:11.420> people<00:03:11.780> who<00:03:11.959> are<00:03:11.989> obese<00:03:12.620> or

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
too are the people who are obese or

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.399 
too are the people who are obese or
overweight<00:03:12.950> or<00:03:13.940> have<00:03:14.239> metabolic<00:03:15.200> dysfunction

overweight or have metabolic dysfunction

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.580 
overweight or have metabolic dysfunction
to<00:03:16.340> begin<00:03:16.760> with<00:03:17.030> so<00:03:17.510> our<00:03:17.900> approach<00:03:18.379> at

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
to begin with so our approach at

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.559 
to begin with so our approach at
metabolic<00:03:19.069> effect<00:03:19.370> is<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:19.639> say<00:03:19.819> sure<00:03:20.180> some

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
metabolic effect is to say sure some

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.599 
metabolic effect is to say sure some
people<00:03:20.750> would<00:03:20.989> do<00:03:21.109> well<00:03:21.440> on<00:03:21.739> going<00:03:22.430> long

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
people would do well on going long

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:23.890 
people would do well on going long
periods<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.000> time<00:03:23.180> without<00:03:23.269> eating<00:03:23.629> but<00:03:23.810> if

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
periods of time without eating but if

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.110 
periods of time without eating but if
