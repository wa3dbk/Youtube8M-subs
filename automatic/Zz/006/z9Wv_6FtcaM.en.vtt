00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.929 

okay<00:00:01.650> I'd<00:00:01.770> like<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.949> talk<00:00:02.190> about<00:00:02.340> prime

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
okay I'd like to talk about prime

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.130 
okay I'd like to talk about prime
numbers<00:00:03.440> prime<00:00:04.440> numbers<00:00:04.470> are<00:00:04.950> numbers<00:00:05.130> that

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.140 
numbers prime numbers are numbers that

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.320 
numbers prime numbers are numbers that
only<00:00:07.140> have<00:00:07.440> factors<00:00:08.040> one<00:00:08.340> in<00:00:08.490> themselves<00:00:08.940> so

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
only have factors one in themselves so

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.709 
only have factors one in themselves so
let's<00:00:09.510> talk<00:00:09.690> about<00:00:09.840> some<00:00:10.110> prime<00:00:10.320> numbers<00:00:11.719> 11

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
let's talk about some prime numbers 11

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.709 
let's talk about some prime numbers 11
is<00:00:12.870> not<00:00:13.080> prime<00:00:13.440> 1<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.670> identity<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.509> it's

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
is not prime 1 is the identity and it's

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.460 
is not prime 1 is the identity and it's
not<00:00:15.960> prime<00:00:16.279> 2<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.789> prime<00:00:18.210> because<00:00:18.960> it's<00:00:19.170> only

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
not prime 2 is prime because it's only

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.630 
not prime 2 is prime because it's only
factors<00:00:19.980> or<00:00:20.310> one<00:00:20.720> until<00:00:22.310> three<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.699> prime

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
factors or one until three is prime

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.359 
factors or one until three is prime
because<00:00:26.640> one<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.630> three<00:00:28.590> or<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.130> only

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
because one and three or it's only

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.900 
because one and three or it's only
factors<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.320> not<00:00:31.650> prime<00:00:32.099> because<00:00:32.730> it's

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
factors for is not prime because it's

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.760 
factors for is not prime because it's
factors<00:00:33.420> are<00:00:33.570> 1<00:00:33.809> 2<00:00:34.140> &amp;<00:00:34.680> 4<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:35.730> not<00:00:36.030> prime

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
factors are 1 2 &amp; 4 so it's not prime

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.340 
factors are 1 2 &amp; 4 so it's not prime
five<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:38.160> prime<00:00:38.520> because<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.570> only<00:00:39.750> factors

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
five is prime because it's only factors

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.139 
five is prime because it's only factors
are<00:00:40.500> 1<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.980> 5<00:00:42.230> 6<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.500> not<00:00:43.770> prime<00:00:44.309> because<00:00:44.940> it's

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
are 1 and 5 6 is not prime because it's

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.060 
are 1 and 5 6 is not prime because it's
factors<00:00:45.660> are<00:00:45.840> 1<00:00:46.079> 2<00:00:46.379> 3<00:00:47.450> and<00:00:48.450> six<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:49.770> not

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
factors are 1 2 3 and six so it's not

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.740 
factors are 1 2 3 and six so it's not
prime<00:00:50.750> 7<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.930> prime<00:00:52.579> so<00:00:53.579> because<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.270> factors

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
prime 7 is prime so because it's factors

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.250 
prime 7 is prime so because it's factors
are<00:00:54.930> 1<00:00:55.170> &amp;<00:00:55.590> 7<00:00:56.210> so<00:00:57.210> if<00:00:57.300> I'm<00:00:57.449> looking<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
are 1 &amp; 7 so if I'm looking for the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.160 
are 1 &amp; 7 so if I'm looking for the
prime<00:00:58.680> factors<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.520> a<00:01:00.059> particular<00:01:00.449> kind<00:01:00.960> of

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
prime factors of a particular kind of

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.730 
prime factors of a particular kind of
number<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.770> particular<00:01:02.370> number<00:01:03.110> say<00:01:04.220> 35<00:01:06.740> I'm

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
number of particular number say 35 I'm

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.210 
number of particular number say 35 I'm
looking<00:01:08.220> for<00:01:08.549> only<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.630> factors<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.110> 35<00:01:10.770> that

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
looking for only the factors of 35 that

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.980 
looking for only the factors of 35 that
are<00:01:11.369> prime<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.880> need<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.270> list<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.750> factors

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
are prime so I need to list the factors

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.130 
are prime so I need to list the factors
of<00:01:16.320> 35<00:01:17.810> 1<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.259> 35<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:21.240> doesn't<00:01:21.630> go<00:01:21.720> into<00:01:21.900> it

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
of 35 1 and 35 to doesn't go into it

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.340 
of 35 1 and 35 to doesn't go into it
because<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.619> not<00:01:22.799> even<00:01:23.130> three<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.840> add<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
because it's not even three if I add the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.590 
because it's not even three if I add the
digits<00:01:25.530> three<00:01:26.070> plus<00:01:26.369> five<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.610> get<00:01:26.970> eight<00:01:27.210> and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
digits three plus five I get eight and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.510 
digits three plus five I get eight and
three<00:01:28.259> doesn't<00:01:28.590> go<00:01:28.619> into<00:01:28.829> eight<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.400> it

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
three doesn't go into eight so it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.560 
three doesn't go into eight so it
doesn't<00:01:29.880> go<00:01:29.970> into<00:01:30.090> 35<00:01:31.430> for<00:01:32.430> does<00:01:32.939> not<00:01:33.180> go<00:01:33.360> into

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
doesn't go into 35 for does not go into

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.530 
doesn't go into 35 for does not go into
it<00:01:33.720> because<00:01:33.990> 4<00:01:34.350> times<00:01:34.590> 9<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.860> 36<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.180> doesn't

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
it because 4 times 9 is 36 so it doesn't

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.819 
it because 4 times 9 is 36 so it doesn't
go<00:01:36.630> into<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.159> five<00:01:38.159> definitely<00:01:38.880> goes<00:01:39.060> into<00:01:39.570> it

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
go into it five definitely goes into it

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.690 
go into it five definitely goes into it
5<00:01:40.829> times<00:01:41.220> 7<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:42.090> 35<00:01:42.770> 6<00:01:43.770> doesn't<00:01:44.250> go<00:01:44.340> into<00:01:44.490> it

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
5 times 7 is 35 6 doesn't go into it

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.780 
5 times 7 is 35 6 doesn't go into it
because<00:01:44.880> 6<00:01:45.659> times<00:01:45.899> 6<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.259> 36<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.369> doesn't<00:01:47.670> go

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
because 6 times 6 is 36 so it doesn't go

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.469 
because 6 times 6 is 36 so it doesn't go
into<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.720> those<00:01:48.899> are<00:01:49.020> all<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.500> factors<00:01:50.100> of

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
into it so those are all the factors of

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.010 
into it so those are all the factors of
35<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:52.710> those<00:01:53.009> numbers<00:01:53.549> one<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.390> not<00:01:54.689> prime

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
35 and of those numbers one is not prime

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.800 
35 and of those numbers one is not prime
remember<00:01:55.530> one<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.070> identity<00:01:56.549> five<00:01:57.479> is

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
remember one is the identity five is

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.510 
remember one is the identity five is
prime<00:01:58.399> 7<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.549> prime<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.840> five<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.680> seven<00:02:02.310> are

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
prime 7 is prime so five and seven are

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.920 
prime 7 is prime so five and seven are
the<00:02:02.820> prime<00:02:03.119> factors<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.920> 35
