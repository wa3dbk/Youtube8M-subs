00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.250
 expectations of my fans I would like 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.950
 ask them to look closely at my new 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.750
 starting from her departure from the group she 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.450
 he has dedicated his time to his white brand 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.190
 in English, mainly promoting 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.140
 in china after it was announced 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.239
 exit of that metro have also emerged 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.430
 several rumors about its release 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.200
 as a soloist and even the rumors where 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.910
 it is said that he has finished recording his 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.920
 album as a soloist have grown 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.510
 quickly to what your representative 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.220
 legal has spoken and denied these 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.290
 rumors saying that jessica is still 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.940
 working as a designer and visiting 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.099
 to the study of recordings was only for 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.140
 fun and to have a nice time 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.390
 with his friends this is like my 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.030
 opinion and I want to mention this that 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.609
 jessica spent 15 years of her life asm 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.340
 timing since it entered the year 2000 to 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.440
 the agency and he spent seven years 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.840
 in Eurovision thank you for that jessica 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.129
 because as a fan you are grateful I think 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.739
 that what comes next and is 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.269
 problem of it already if it is released as 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.120
 soloist because many say that only 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.590
 is going to launch in china and things like that 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.120
 let's remember that the Korean fans the 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.069
 Korean netizens so flat no 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.930
 they want or jessica and if it is released as 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.489
 soloist so father must support his 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.019
 solo career continue to support 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.209
 as a designer, it's not like I 'm going to 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.819
 disappear from the face of the earth still 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.709
 working as a model as a designer 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.799
 so we have to continue supporting it and that 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.540
 parent who has already been resolved so 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.790
 good in a kind way many are 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.959

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.019
 as a soloist, what happened

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.620
 with jessica this can not happen anymore 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.239
