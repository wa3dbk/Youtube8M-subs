00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
one's gonna have a cutout that you that

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.529 
one's gonna have a cutout that you that
the<00:05:00.870> rats<00:05:01.229> can<00:05:02.180> burrow<00:05:03.180> into<00:05:04.340> so<00:05:05.340> yeah<00:05:05.789> so<00:05:06.330> when

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
the rats can burrow into so yeah so when

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.300 
the rats can burrow into so yeah so when
you're<00:05:06.690> cutting<00:05:07.139> out<00:05:07.259> your<00:05:07.320> fabric<00:05:07.650> make<00:05:08.070> sure

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
you're cutting out your fabric make sure

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.550 
you're cutting out your fabric make sure
that<00:05:08.550> you<00:05:08.729> do<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.120> right<00:05:09.330> sides<00:05:09.660> together<00:05:10.020> and

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
that you do the right sides together and

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.219 
that you do the right sides together and
then<00:05:11.400> I<00:05:12.380> will<00:05:13.380> sew<00:05:13.590> around<00:05:13.710> the<00:05:14.009> outside

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
then I will sew around the outside

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.529 
then I will sew around the outside
you'll<00:05:16.229> have<00:05:16.410> to<00:05:16.530> leave<00:05:16.740> a<00:05:17.190> little<00:05:18.000> bit<00:05:18.120> of<00:05:18.300> a

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
you'll have to leave a little bit of a

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:20.689 
you'll have to leave a little bit of a
space<00:05:18.900> so<00:05:19.440> that<00:05:19.590> you<00:05:19.710> can<00:05:19.919> inside-out<00:05:20.520> the

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
space so that you can inside-out the

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.920 
space so that you can inside-out the
fabric<00:05:21.120> and<00:05:21.300> then<00:05:22.199> you'll<00:05:22.380> have<00:05:22.500> to<00:05:23.930> close

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
fabric and then you'll have to close

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.010 
fabric and then you'll have to close
that<00:05:25.199> hole<00:05:25.349> and<00:05:26.130> that's<00:05:26.550> I<00:05:27.389> won't<00:05:27.810> have<00:05:27.930> to

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
that hole and that's I won't have to

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.450 
that hole and that's I won't have to
make<00:05:28.110> a<00:05:28.169> hole<00:05:28.409> on<00:05:28.440> that<00:05:28.770> one<00:05:28.919> because<00:05:29.099> they'll

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
make a hole on that one because they'll

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.619 
make a hole on that one because they'll
already<00:05:29.669> be<00:05:30.090> one<00:05:30.409> other<00:05:31.409> than<00:05:31.710> that
