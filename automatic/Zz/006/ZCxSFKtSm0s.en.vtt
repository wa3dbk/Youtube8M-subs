00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Big hello to all today to tell you 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.620
 about your purchases it was a firm order 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.280
 jeans brush JUST I wanted for a long time 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.320
 but still could not decide to purchase and 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.570
 In general, I came across their website 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.630
 a reference at the bottom of our questionnaire can be ordered 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.850
 and big shell something so let's say 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.350
 test and order something and for 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.840
 I started this here 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.480
 brush case for a long time 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.609
 Many companies wanted a case like a case 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.189
 but since I decided to buy a brush I 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.070
 I think that cheholchik will be useful 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.160
 he is tall enough that is here 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.850
 any long brushes probably fit 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.430
 at the extreme my can be placed 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.940
 divided into two halves and inside yet 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.520
 there is a strap do not know either by the strap 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.739
 most likely not needed but very 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.500
 convenient when you go somewhere and ride 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.140
 principle to remove it or so here 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.739
 divide and put yourself on the table here 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.530
 now i'm glad i have it too 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.840
 I ordered brushes, I came across bags and 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.000
 today I 'll show you these rudoms 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:15.659
 it's number 105 they're on my face now 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.960
 the color is so peachy light and a little 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.790
 so dark cooler nazim hoteli 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.939
 until the color is generally excellent leads in principle 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.290
 I mix them either on our 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.590
 singly one of them now they 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.290
 i'm mixed on my cheeks and i like 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.170
 which is very good pigmentation and they can 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.030
 build up they absolutely do not dust when 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.979
 You put the brush in general, I basically 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.490
 pretty quality not bad enough 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.700
 but such velvety and pigmentation here 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.399
 if you can see the poison 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.799
 as can be seen very good 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.530
 Then I bought here are three 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.590
 brushes for now it's three decided 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.020
 dwell on those that I more 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.200
 less husband not and so say that I would 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.860
 I wanted to replace them with some others and 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.360
 let's start in order 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.229
 I'll start with this little one 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.990
 canted brush this is brush number 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.989
 65 I bought it in principle for eyebrows 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.819
 so you better fill your eyebrows now 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.410
 me by the way eyebrows decorated this 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.019
 brush i really like how this brush 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.940
 gaining shade as the brow fills 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.739
 much better than this brush which up 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.170
 I used it like she did 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.970
 fills precisely here the gap where there is no 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.340
 the hair is very delicate and 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.280
 well fills them too 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.530
 well shading the ciliary row if 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.049
 you carry for example a black pencil there 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.000
 this brush can blend very well 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.590
 work out and outer corner 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.030
 general, this is universally sufficient 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.519
 brush i can't say she only 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.170
 eyebrow make-up class she too 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.959
 perfect for your own 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.880
 Used as well as in the make-up such 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.650
 here's a little one from synthetic 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.440
 lint 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.180
 quite pleasant not prickly 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.430
 average elasticity as if she says 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.440
 By the way, not a hair comes out of me 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.810
 she did not get out she's such a form 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.190
 It was so for the time being I did not soap it 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.450
 I can tell how she will behave 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.819
 after washing 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.470
 but for the time being I like her I would say 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.810
 so more or less universal 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.850
 the next brush is such a big one 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.400
 brush number 71 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.370
 She, too, synthetic she have them all 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.380
 by the way wooden synthetic handles 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:25.050
 brush like kisim we all understood on 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.570
 he speaks but it is not so dense 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.000
 my lizuna still told that this is the same 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.430
 I do not like that sigma so 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.100
 thick brushes I totally agree with him 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.700
 I also do not like tight so here 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.470
 Jeans is not less so tight and I like 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.340
 I don’t know if it’s more pleasant to work with 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.330
 on his face 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.900
 This is a brush for applying liquid textures. 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.810
 tonal bases or some kind of bass under 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.730
 makeup liquid and such here any 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.820
 I have already tried to put fat 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.550
 liquid its basis from clinics and by the way 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.500
 we are very smooth and evenly 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.910
 are working out the plot well she puts 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.150
 climb into such here even 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.280
 hard to reach some places there near 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.900
 nose under the eyes and very comfortable 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.600
 spread the foundation she leaves 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.820
 no traces there 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.180
 beautifully does i like this brush 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.910
 very very nice to wash it easy neither 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.680
 one hair become not got me here 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.510
 which i'm glad and despite the fact that 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.340
 synthetic they are absolutely not prickly 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.700
 and very very nice and 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.740
 on the face who does not like this type 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.500
 brushes from strongly because not so 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.110
 very tight and here this brush is 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.060
 substitute and here's the perfect brush for me and 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.760
 the next last brush is a brush for 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.790
 me contouring with her are small here 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.300
 Such are the problems and I got it in 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.070
 this way I sin on transportation 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.750
 here these here 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.640
 protruding hairs on the sides of me completely 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.700
 I was not at all happy 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:00.000
 upset but I hope that after washing 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.310
 she will bring herself to the original appearance and 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.040
 will so that's all the same if rovnenko 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.010
 No, I do not know, maybe I even then 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.710
 cut your hair don't know what to do with it 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:14.090
 come up with this brush made of nap 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.650
 black goats so the pile is enough 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:20.130
 tough and for people with sensitive 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:23.550
 skin it does not fit it is a little prickly 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:26.190
 but she is well for being so 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:30.060
 boring shape and doing very well 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.160
 contouring the face of the cheek forehead and also 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.590
 it is good to apply blush on the bill not 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.720
 very convenient to use it but these 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.040
 hair of course sticking out on the sides and 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.900
 a little frustrating 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.200
 but she's good at picking up pigment 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.030
 well spreads well shading in 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.190
 In general, it is quite good but 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.650
 again I will say that it is a little bit spiky 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.240
 and hair is probably these two here 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.080
 minus who can say about these 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.700
 brushes the rest of the days of course are good 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.130
 by the way his handle is not wooden like that of 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.750
 previous brush she is so plastic 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.600
 plastic if someone has 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.660
 any ideas thoughts about how 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.790
 collect this hair back then please 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.830
