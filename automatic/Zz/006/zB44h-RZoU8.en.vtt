hello guys it's casual UK and welcome to

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.669 
hello guys it's casual UK and welcome to
an<00:00:08.910> overview<00:00:09.330> today<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.019> portable<00:00:10.559> SSD

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
an overview today of the portable SSD

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.520 
an overview today of the portable SSD
from<00:00:11.250> integral<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.240> 128<00:00:13.080> gigabyte

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
from integral this is the 128 gigabyte

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.140 
from integral this is the 128 gigabyte
version<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.370> does<00:00:14.670> come<00:00:14.880> in<00:00:15.000> all

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
version and this does come in all

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.700 
version and this does come in all
different<00:00:15.179> sizes<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:15.990> think<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.260> goes<00:00:16.410> from

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
different sizes and I think it goes from

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.220 
different sizes and I think it goes from
I<00:00:17.190> think<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.760> might<00:00:17.910> go<00:00:17.940> from<00:00:18.180> 128<00:00:18.840> all<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.140> way

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
I think it might go from 128 all the way

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.660 
I think it might go from 128 all the way
up<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.470> one<00:00:19.650> terabyte<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.369> can<00:00:20.490> get<00:00:20.640> a

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
up to one terabyte so you can get a

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.189 
up to one terabyte so you can get a
considerable<00:00:21.270> out<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.480> storage<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:22.080> this

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
considerable out of storage in this

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.230 
considerable out of storage in this
device<00:00:22.529> before<00:00:23.460> we<00:00:23.519> go<00:00:23.609> any<00:00:23.730> further<00:00:23.850> guides

a closer look ok so here it is here is

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.960 
a closer look ok so here it is here is
the<00:01:30.810> portable<00:01:31.380> SSD<00:01:31.560> from<00:01:31.979> integral<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.909> is

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the portable SSD from integral it is

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.859 
the portable SSD from integral it is
very<00:01:33.479> very<00:01:33.990> light<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:35.340> probably<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.390> don't

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
very very light it's probably I don't

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:37.969 
very very light it's probably I don't
know<00:01:37.049> it's<00:01:37.229> probably<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.619> weight<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.920> a

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
know it's probably the weight of a

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.289 
know it's probably the weight of a
couple<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.310> credit<00:01:38.579> cards<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.939> be<00:01:39.030> honest<00:01:39.210> we

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
couple of credit cards to be honest we

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.420 
couple of credit cards to be honest we
are<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:39.869> light<00:01:40.079> basically<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> few

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
are so so light basically is a few

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.710 
are so so light basically is a few
rubber<00:01:41.579> feet<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:41.970> back<00:01:42.150> just<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.509> lay<00:01:42.659> it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
rubber feet on the back just to lay it

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.270 
rubber feet on the back just to lay it
down<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.200> desk<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.740> won't<00:01:43.920> move<00:01:44.070> around

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
down on the desk so won't move around

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.069 
down on the desk so won't move around
then<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.509> connection<00:01:45.720> at<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
then you have the connection at the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.319 
then you have the connection at the
bottom<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.380> goes<00:01:46.560> into<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.130> USB<00:01:47.790> cable<00:01:48.210> so

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
bottom that goes into the USB cable so

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.260 
bottom that goes into the USB cable so
we'll<00:01:48.450> just<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.899> for<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.170> guys<00:01:49.200> now<00:01:49.619> I

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
we'll just do that for you guys now I

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.730 
we'll just do that for you guys now I
think<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.600> goes<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.960> nice<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.320> easy

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
think so it goes in nice and easy

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.109 
think so it goes in nice and easy
and<00:01:53.040> then<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.520> front<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.939> do<00:01:54.090> have

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
and then on the front you do have

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.319 
and then on the front you do have
integral<00:01:54.840> SSD<00:01:55.380> solid<00:01:55.649> state<00:01:56.009> drive<00:01:56.310> 128<00:01:57.060> GB

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
integral SSD solid state drive 128 GB

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.060 
integral SSD solid state drive 128 GB
and<00:01:57.630> there<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.079> an<00:01:58.229> LED<00:01:58.350> light<00:01:58.530> here<00:01:58.920> that

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
and there is an LED light here that

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.469 
and there is an LED light here that
you'll<00:01:59.189> see<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.640> lit<00:01:59.850> up<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.149> minute<00:02:00.329> when<00:02:00.450> we

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
you'll see a lit up in a minute when we

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.840 
you'll see a lit up in a minute when we
do<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.780> speed<00:02:01.049> test<00:02:01.320> but<00:02:01.560> my<00:02:02.549> first

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
do the speed test but my first

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.819 
do the speed test but my first
impression<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.360> far<00:02:03.780> if<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.290> very<00:02:04.740> very

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
impression so far if it is very very

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.410 
impression so far if it is very very
late<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.369> it's<00:02:05.490> very<00:02:05.729> very<00:02:05.850> small<00:02:06.119> it's<00:02:06.329> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
late and it's very very small it's the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.330 
late and it's very very small it's the
size<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.840> credit<00:02:06.960> card<00:02:07.140> okay<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.069> what<00:02:08.250> we're

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
size of a credit card okay so what we're

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.710 
size of a credit card okay so what we're
gonna<00:02:08.429> do<00:02:08.610> now<00:02:08.789> guys<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.270> we're<00:02:09.420> just<00:02:09.450> going<00:02:09.629> to

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.420 
portable SSD and we're going to choose
it<00:03:02.570> and<00:03:02.690> start<00:03:03.020> the<00:03:03.140> test<00:03:03.320> so<00:03:03.860> we<00:03:03.920> can<00:03:04.070> see<00:03:04.220> what

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
it and start the test so we can see what

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.950 
it and start the test so we can see what
things<00:03:04.820> we<00:03:05.060> could<00:03:05.210> result<00:03:05.630> so<00:03:05.780> we<00:03:05.840> can

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
things we could result so we can

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.900 
things we could result so we can
actually<00:03:06.050> get<00:03:06.380> back<00:03:06.620> now<00:03:06.920> as<00:03:07.400> you<00:03:07.610> can<00:03:07.730> see

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
actually get back now as you can see

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.670 
actually get back now as you can see
already<00:03:08.120> it's<00:03:08.450> exceeded<00:03:08.960> the<00:03:09.110> write<00:03:09.350> speed

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
already it's exceeded the write speed

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.320 
already it's exceeded the write speed
that<00:03:09.860> is<00:03:09.920> actually<00:03:10.220> advertised<00:03:10.670> this<00:03:10.880> is<00:03:11.060> 30

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
that is actually advertised this is 30

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.800 
that is actually advertised this is 30
Bing<00:03:11.660> AB<00:03:11.780> it's<00:03:11.950> 30<00:03:12.950> megabits<00:03:13.400> on<00:03:14.090> top<00:03:14.600> of

this this at Port of Westie can

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.090 
this this at Port of Westie can
definitely<00:03:26.959> definitely<00:03:27.590> push<00:03:27.950> the

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
definitely definitely push the

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.620 
definitely definitely push the
boundaries<00:03:28.490> and<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:28.850> can<00:03:29.000> definitely<00:03:29.240> give

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
boundaries and it can definitely give

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.900

you<00:03:29.750> faster<00:03:30.230> speeds<00:03:30.470> than<00:03:30.650> advertised<00:03:31.130> so<00:03:31.430> as

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
you faster speeds than advertised so as

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.790 
you faster speeds than advertised so as
you<00:03:32.209> can<00:03:32.330> see<00:03:32.390> here<00:03:32.750> we're<00:03:32.900> still<00:03:33.140> testing<00:03:33.650> and

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
you can see here we're still testing and

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.940 
you can see here we're still testing and
now<00:03:33.890> it's<00:03:34.070> come<00:03:34.250> up<00:03:34.370> 138<00:03:35.440> 140<00:03:36.440> so<00:03:36.560> it's<00:03:36.740> still

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
now it's come up 138 140 so it's still

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.280 
now it's come up 138 140 so it's still
exceeding<00:03:37.490> a<00:03:37.880> little<00:03:38.570> bit<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.870> actual<00:03:39.140> work

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
exceeding a little bit the actual work

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.380 
exceeding a little bit the actual work
speed<00:03:39.590> that's<00:03:39.740> advertised<00:03:40.220> on<00:03:40.490> the<00:03:40.550> second

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
speed that's advertised on the second

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.820 
speed that's advertised on the second
test<00:03:41.600> we've<00:03:41.840> gone<00:03:42.020> a<00:03:42.080> little<00:03:42.230> bit<00:03:42.440> lower<00:03:42.620> on

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
test we've gone a little bit lower on

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.710 
test we've gone a little bit lower on
the<00:03:42.980> read<00:03:43.190> speed<00:03:43.459> but<00:03:43.610> as<00:03:43.730> you<00:03:43.880> can<00:03:44.030> see<00:03:44.239> with

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
the read speed but as you can see with

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.330 
the read speed but as you can see with
the<00:03:44.810> first<00:03:45.110> two<00:03:45.380> initial<00:03:45.830> tests<00:03:46.100> this

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
the first two initial tests this

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.520 
the first two initial tests this
portable<00:03:47.030> SSD<00:03:47.209> is<00:03:47.570> definitely<00:03:48.050> giving<00:03:48.320> you

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
portable SSD is definitely giving you

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.190 
portable SSD is definitely giving you
faster<00:03:49.459> speeds<00:03:49.760> than<00:03:49.970> advertised<00:03:50.390> so<00:03:50.959> I<00:03:50.989> just

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
faster speeds than advertised so I just

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.900 
faster speeds than advertised so I just
want<00:03:51.350> to<00:03:51.440> say<00:03:51.530> a<00:03:51.560> big<00:03:51.830> thanks<00:03:52.100> to<00:03:52.160> integral<00:03:52.730> for
