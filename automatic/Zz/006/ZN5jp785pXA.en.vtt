00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
windows and what we're finding while it

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.529 
windows and what we're finding while it
but<00:00:22.189> if<00:00:22.460> I'm<00:00:22.609> correct<00:00:22.789> is<00:00:23.119> there<00:00:23.240> a<00:00:23.269> lot<00:00:23.480> of

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
but if I'm correct is there a lot of

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.240 
but if I'm correct is there a lot of
covenants<00:00:24.109> where<00:00:24.260> you<00:00:24.350> cannot<00:00:24.680> stick<00:00:25.010> the<00:00:25.189> air

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
covenants where you cannot stick the air

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.009 
covenants where you cannot stick the air
conditioner<00:00:25.699> out<00:00:25.789> the<00:00:25.939> window<00:00:26.210> /<00:00:26.570> this<00:00:26.840> is<00:00:26.990> a

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
conditioner out the window / this is a

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.320 
conditioner out the window / this is a
solution<00:00:27.380> for<00:00:27.769> that<00:00:27.800> so<00:00:28.460> what<00:00:28.699> you<00:00:28.789> can<00:00:28.939> do<00:00:29.119> is

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
solution for that so what you can do is

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.359 
solution for that so what you can do is
just<00:00:29.359> roll<00:00:29.720> this<00:00:29.869> into<00:00:30.050> a<00:00:30.199> room<00:00:30.500> right<00:00:30.949> and

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
just roll this into a room right and

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.490 
just roll this into a room right and
then<00:00:31.910> look<00:00:32.090> how<00:00:32.210> easy<00:00:32.449> this<00:00:32.689> is<00:00:32.750> this<00:00:33.110> window

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
then look how easy this is this window

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.200 
then look how easy this is this window
opens<00:00:33.890> up<00:00:34.070> they<00:00:34.520> come<00:00:34.700> with<00:00:34.730> this<00:00:34.969> little

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
opens up they come with this little

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.319 
opens up they come with this little
slidy<00:00:35.660> kit<00:00:36.050> and<00:00:36.370> that<00:00:37.370> looked<00:00:37.640> that<00:00:37.850> locks<00:00:38.120> all

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
slidy kit and that looked that locks all

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:39.910 
slidy kit and that looked that locks all
together<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:38.750> just<00:00:38.840> pumps<00:00:39.200> the<00:00:39.320> air<00:00:39.410> up<00:00:39.559> so

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
together and just pumps the air up so

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.350 
together and just pumps the air up so
the<00:00:40.010> hot<00:00:40.160> air<00:00:40.340> goes<00:00:40.550> straight<00:00:40.820> outside<00:00:41.149> which

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
the hot air goes straight outside which

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.030 
the hot air goes straight outside which
is<00:00:41.510> pretty<00:00:41.690> nice<00:00:41.930> because<00:00:42.350> then<00:00:42.860> you<00:00:43.010> don't

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
is pretty nice because then you don't

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.709 
is pretty nice because then you don't
avoid<00:00:43.370> you<00:00:43.579> don't<00:00:43.730> have<00:00:43.850> any<00:00:44.030> coveted<00:00:44.420> issues

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719

the next thing that's kind of cool and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.359 
the next thing that's kind of cool and
this<00:01:26.960> is<00:01:27.110> pretty<00:01:27.290> neat<00:01:27.560> maybe<00:01:27.740> you<00:01:28.040> can<00:01:28.220> hold

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
this is pretty neat maybe you can hold

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:29.679 
this is pretty neat maybe you can hold
this<00:01:28.490> up<00:01:28.670> line<00:01:28.880> i'll<00:01:29.060> demonstrate<00:01:29.240> we're

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
this up line i'll demonstrate we're

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.660 
this up line i'll demonstrate we're
going<00:01:29.990> on<00:01:30.079> because<00:01:30.740> what<00:01:31.040> you<00:01:31.159> do<00:01:31.340> is<00:01:31.520> you

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
going on because what you do is you

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.580 
going on because what you do is you
install<00:01:32.090> this<00:01:32.299> pump<00:01:32.630> and<00:01:32.900> it's<00:01:33.049> not<00:01:33.320> you<00:01:33.530> don't

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
install this pump and it's not you don't

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.230 
install this pump and it's not you don't
have<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:33.829> do<00:01:33.950> any<00:01:34.100> wiring<00:01:34.400> you<00:01:34.640> just<00:01:34.909> plug<00:01:35.090> it

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
have to do any wiring you just plug it

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.929 
have to do any wiring you just plug it
in<00:01:35.360> at<00:01:36.079> the<00:01:36.409> at<00:01:36.650> the<00:01:36.710> think<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:37.759> is<00:01:37.909> the

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
in at the at the think that is the

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.210 
in at the at the think that is the
farthest<00:01:38.630> away<00:01:38.810> from<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.710> hot<00:01:39.860> water<00:01:40.100> heater

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
farthest away from the hot water heater

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.179 
farthest away from the hot water heater
exactly<00:01:40.909> and<00:01:41.090> then<00:01:41.570> what<00:01:41.869> you<00:01:42.020> do<00:01:42.290> is<00:01:42.619> this

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
exactly and then what you do is this

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.770 
exactly and then what you do is this
ties<00:01:43.460> into<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:43.880> hot<00:01:44.090> water<00:01:44.329> heater<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:44.720> it

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
ties into the hot water heater and it

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.440 
ties into the hot water heater and it
pumps<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.200> hot<00:01:45.350> water<00:01:45.590> heater<00:01:45.680> from<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.130> hot

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
pumps the hot water heater from the hot

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.910 
pumps the hot water heater from the hot
water<00:01:47.450> heater<00:01:47.570> side<00:01:48.020> all<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.290> way<00:01:48.380> back<00:01:48.590> up<00:01:48.649> to

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
water heater side all the way back up to

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.109 
water heater side all the way back up to
the<00:01:48.950> end<00:01:49.159> of<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.340> house<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.759> what's<00:01:49.909> pretty

about<00:02:00.079> is<00:02:00.320> if<00:02:00.619> your<00:02:00.770> hot<00:02:00.950> water<00:02:01.130> is<00:02:01.340> heating<00:02:01.689> on

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
about is if your hot water is heating on

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.389 
about is if your hot water is heating on
a<00:02:02.719> regular<00:02:02.990> basis<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:03.770> it's<00:02:03.890> in<00:02:04.009> a<00:02:04.040> small

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
a regular basis and it's in a small

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.819 
a regular basis and it's in a small
space<00:02:04.670> like<00:02:05.000> an<00:02:05.149> apartment<00:02:05.719> or<00:02:05.899> a<00:02:05.960> small

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
lesson thousand square foot house that

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.630 
lesson thousand square foot house that
can<00:02:08.750> really<00:02:08.899> increase<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.410> internal<00:02:10.009> ambient

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
can really increase the internal ambient

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.820 
can really increase the internal ambient
temperature<00:02:11.090> so<00:02:11.510> by<00:02:11.720> having<00:02:11.840> this<00:02:12.170> work<00:02:12.680> in

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
temperature so by having this work in

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.420 
temperature so by having this work in
your<00:02:12.920> water<00:02:13.099> here

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
your water here

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.800 
your water here
less<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.790> can<00:02:13.879> really<00:02:14.120> save<00:02:14.299> a<00:02:14.329> lot<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.540> time

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
less you can really save a lot of time

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.750 
less you can really save a lot of time
and<00:02:15.290> or<00:02:15.620> excuse<00:02:16.010> me<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.129> lot<00:02:16.280> of<00:02:16.310> time<00:02:16.430> when<00:02:16.730> you

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
and or excuse me a lot of time when you

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.880 
and or excuse me a lot of time when you
pull<00:02:16.969> the<00:02:17.000> point<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.780> get<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.019> hot<00:02:18.170> water<00:02:18.409> and

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
pull the point to get the hot water and

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.559 
pull the point to get the hot water and
then<00:02:19.040> lastly<00:02:19.459> this<00:02:19.640> is<00:02:19.819> pretty<00:02:20.000> cool<00:02:20.090> they<00:02:20.420> got

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
then lastly this is pretty cool they got

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.559 
then lastly this is pretty cool they got
the<00:02:20.689> 1.6<00:02:21.469> gala<00:02:22.189> for<00:02:22.370> six<00:02:22.670> gallon<00:02:23.030> flush<00:02:23.239> and

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
the 1.6 gala for six gallon flush and

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.899 
the 1.6 gala for six gallon flush and
cola<00:02:23.810> came<00:02:24.079> out<00:02:24.230> with<00:02:24.439> a<00:02:24.469> new<00:02:24.590> toilet<00:02:25.489> that<00:02:25.819> you

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:25.909 
cola came out with a new toilet that you

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.149 
cola came out with a new toilet that you
can<00:02:26.060> set<00:02:26.269> for<00:02:26.450> 1.4<00:02:27.049> gallon<00:02:27.409> clash<00:02:27.620> right<00:02:27.950> and

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
can set for 1.4 gallon clash right and

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.860 
can set for 1.4 gallon clash right and
what's<00:02:28.370> important<00:02:28.849> about<00:02:28.879> this<00:02:29.150> is<00:02:29.209> they<00:02:29.480> that

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
what's important about this is they that

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.720 
what's important about this is they that
1.6<00:02:30.500> didn't<00:02:30.709> flush<00:02:30.980> as<00:02:31.159> well<00:02:31.310> as<00:02:31.400> they<00:02:31.489> used<00:02:31.519> to

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
1.6 didn't flush as well as they used to

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.550 
1.6 didn't flush as well as they used to
so<00:02:32.209> what<00:02:32.389> they've<00:02:32.569> done<00:02:32.599> is<00:02:32.810> they've<00:02:33.170> just

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
so what they've done is they've just

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.289 
so what they've done is they've just
designed<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.159> bigger<00:02:34.370> flapper<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.000> when<00:02:35.180> that

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
designed a bigger flapper so when that

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.920 
designed a bigger flapper so when that
opens<00:02:35.750> up<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.409> lets<00:02:36.769> one<00:02:37.180> welching<00:02:38.180> tsunami<00:02:38.689> of

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
opens up it lets one welching tsunami of

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.740 
opens up it lets one welching tsunami of
water<00:02:39.139> out<00:02:39.409> for<00:02:40.219> the<00:02:40.280> 1.6<00:02:40.969> in<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:41.239> faster<00:02:41.599> rate

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
water out for the 1.6 in a faster rate

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.720 
water out for the 1.6 in a faster rate
so<00:02:41.989> it<00:02:42.109> really<00:02:42.319> it<00:02:42.560> really<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:43.250> really<00:02:43.280> puts<00:02:43.639> a

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
so it really it really it really puts a

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.490 
so it really it really it really puts a
lot<00:02:43.879> of<00:02:43.909> it<00:02:44.180> saves<00:02:44.450> water<00:02:44.659> but<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:45.019> also<00:02:45.170> does<00:02:45.470> a

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
lot of it saves water but it also does a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.500 
lot of it saves water but it also does a
good<00:02:45.709> job<00:02:45.769> flushing<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.549> then<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.120> can<00:02:47.299> even

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
good job flushing and then you can even

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.210 
good job flushing and then you can even
reduce<00:02:47.689> this<00:02:48.019> down<00:02:48.230> this<00:02:48.620> one<00:02:48.769> here<00:02:49.010> if<00:02:49.099> you

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
reduce this down this one here if you

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.220
