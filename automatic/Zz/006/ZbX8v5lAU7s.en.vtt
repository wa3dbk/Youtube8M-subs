00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.160
 greet you friends my name is denis 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.500
 Boris you are on the FIFA channel 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.380
 life.ru and now we will consider such 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.869
 exercise like swinging dumbbells in front of you 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.869
 this exercise aims to develop 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:26.769
 deltas more precisely the front of our 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:29.259
 Delta here and refers to isolated 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.179
 exercise that is such an exercise 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.430
 where more focus on being worked 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.280
 target muscle due to the fact that 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.570
 we have an elbow joint fixed 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.140
 movement occurs only in the shoulder 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.760
 joint 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.590
 due to this we have 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.720
 isolated study directly 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.970
 deltas and triceps off and biceps 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.000
 turned off focus on what we do 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.150
 need all the exercise on the delta can 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.500
 conventionally divided into two parts 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.510
 exercise on the front hemisphere 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.079
 exercise on the rear hemisphere 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.410
 exercises on the front hemisphere is 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.859
 various press options in front of you for 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.619
 dumbbell head including swinging in 

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:10.780
 these exercises in all weight 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.149
 away from our body they relate 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.579
 categories of presses second group 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:19.060
 exercise is traction you exercise barbell 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:23.920
 and dumbbells thrust mahi through sides mahi in 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.719
 tilting in these exercises in these 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.490
 Exercises we know ourselves 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.810
 that is, the front hemisphere we 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.179
 work when we hang ourselves 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.000
 pushing off the rear boosted work 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:38.300
 when we draw weight to ourselves 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.310
 swinging dumbbells in front of yourself is such 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:46.700
 exercise sponsored 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:50.890
 this exercise works most often it 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:54.619
 perform two dumbbells about 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:59.000
 lift one dumbbell as follows 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:04.520
 then at the second dumbbell in general that such 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.490
 way to do personal exercises if 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.440
 and doing a modification with two dumbbells 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.450
 then in this exercise I use 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.709
 parallel grip and doing it 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.110
 at the same time that is, I firstly 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.209
 I lift not so that I have a dumbbell 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.190
 parallel to the floor, I understand it so 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.690
 the way she was perpendicular to the floor 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.060
 see not that way but 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.040
 perpendicular and secondly i do it 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.800
 I do not take turns using two at once 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:39.580
 dumbbells and raise here from this position 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.580
 top 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.340
 but there is even more professional 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.079
 option when you generally work in 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.349
 this exercise in general with one dumbbell 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.439
 that is, you take one dumbbell 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:57.049
 lean forward your back is straight and 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:03:00.470
 performs simah before him immediately two 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.420
 hands are absolutely symmetrical why 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.129
 in this form, I advise you to perform 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.659
 exercise because it is an exercise 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.689
 urged to work out 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:13.819
 the front bunch of our delta they are middle 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:16.730
 or back to middle back we have 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:21.109
 other specialized exercises here 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.150
 when we use grip parallel 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.190
 the floor 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.230
 then in this situation we have an elbow 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:32.299
 rises up and accordingly 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:34.220
 load flows partially have their 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.170
 exercise so we use 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.480
 parallel grip this allows us 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.549
 take more weight this grip more 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.870
 safe for our joints but also 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.689
 accordingly we can do more in it 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.540
 work the front delta more 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:50.510
 effectively why with one dumbbell 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.970
 but because it is more convenient in terms of 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.449
 weight savings and in terms of 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.519
 equilibrium see and we don't need to throw one 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:02.800
 hand then second spend a ton of time 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:05.730
 a lot of strength we take a lot of weight and 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.890
 and load each side evenly 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.250
 notice i lean a little bit 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.920
 forward and top and bottom positions I have 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.230
 no rest i mean i'm not throwing to the end 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.390
 dumbbell and the top point and not lift 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.170
 above my head i mean i work inside 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:25.360
 amplitudes i work inside amplitudes for 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:29.080
 to keep load on delta 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:34.660
 throughout the entire exercise on 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:37.330
 throughout the amplitude of motion this 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:42.370
 way to take less weight 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:45.060
 but more load the front delta so 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.850
 like me and the top and bottom point 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.800
 load persists i have to work 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.750
 safer weights but these 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.360
 safe weights are more than enough 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.890
 in order to load our deltas i 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.630
 often like repeating so that you don't 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.000
 tried to facilitate their exercise 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.400
 if you are a bodybuilder always try 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.710
 make the exercise more in more difficult 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.660
 form they are easier in this regard 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:12.160
 partial amplitude is what you need 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:14.650
 you work in a heavy range for 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.480
 their muscles respectively when muscular 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.720
 hard they have to do with it 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.440
 adapt and increase your 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.840
 size remaining rules are basic such 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.220
 same as in other maxims for you 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.260
 it was easier to make a slight slope 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.660
 forward you can just sit down at the knees 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.640
 slightly bend them exhale we do on 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.040
 effort that is when dumbbells go with us 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.830
 up we breathe out 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:42.310
 when dumbbells go down we take a breath 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:44.910
 in general, it is a swing with dumbbells in front of you 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.910
 baby
