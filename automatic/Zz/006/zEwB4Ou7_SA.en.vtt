00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.200 
beating he's playing with them he hasn't
even<00:00:30.689> probably<00:00:31.230> tapped<00:00:31.619> into<00:00:31.830> half<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:33.059> his

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210

is<00:00:38.670> as<00:00:38.910> strong<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.540> he<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.690> right<00:00:40.020> now<00:00:40.050> I'd

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
is as strong as he is right now I'd

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.330 
is as strong as he is right now I'd
still<00:00:41.129> say<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.820> he'd<00:00:42.149> either<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.710> have<00:00:43.710> one

crazy time trying to beat him and maybe

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.970 
crazy time trying to beat him and maybe
could<00:00:48.480> possibly<00:00:48.840> pull<00:00:49.140> out<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> win<00:00:49.500> because<00:00:49.680> of

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
could possibly pull out a win because of

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.729 
could possibly pull out a win because of
the<00:00:50.070> nine<00:00:50.280> tails<00:00:50.579> or<00:00:50.789> B<00:00:51.420> he<00:00:52.050> will<00:00:52.230> not<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.620> able

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
to beat him B and we'll have to have

somebody like Sasuke come and help him

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.430 
somebody like Sasuke come and help him
because<00:00:56.460> edo<00:00:57.180> tensei<00:00:57.750> Madara<00:00:58.170> he<00:00:58.379> is

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
because edo tensei Madara he is

see that

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.090 
see that
Naruto<00:01:06.510> by<00:01:06.689> himself<00:01:07.080> could<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.830> know<00:01:07.920> at

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
Naruto by himself could be you know at

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.530 
Naruto by himself could be you know at
all<00:01:08.130> tense<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.490> moderate<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.000> would<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.390> be

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
all tense a moderate it would have to be

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.690 
all tense a moderate it would have to be
some<00:01:10.049> crazy<00:01:10.409> ridiculous<00:01:11.070> situation<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.670> I

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
some crazy ridiculous situation that I

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.399 
some crazy ridiculous situation that I
don't<00:01:11.909> even<00:01:11.970> think<00:01:12.119> would<00:01:12.659> make<00:01:12.840> sense<00:01:13.080> for<00:01:13.229> an

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
don't even think would make sense for an

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.350 
don't even think would make sense for an
order<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:13.799> Naruto<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.490> uh<00:01:14.520> beat<00:01:14.909> him<00:01:15.060> because

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
order for Naruto to uh beat him because

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.899 
order for Naruto to uh beat him because
if<00:01:15.570> he's<00:01:16.020> making<00:01:16.409> light<00:01:16.590> work<00:01:16.619> five<00:01:17.220> cog<00:01:17.610> aids

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
if he's making light work five cog aids

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.730 
if he's making light work five cog aids
don't<00:01:18.119> get<00:01:18.270> me<00:01:18.360> wrong<00:01:18.390> also<00:01:18.900> it's<00:01:19.170> very<00:01:19.380> strong

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
don't get me wrong also it's very strong

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.130 
don't get me wrong also it's very strong
in<00:01:19.799> his<00:01:20.009> video<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.880> don't<00:01:21.150> think<00:01:21.270> Naruto<00:01:21.930> by

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
in his video but I don't think Naruto by

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.560 
in his video but I don't think Naruto by
himself<00:01:22.500> could<00:01:22.770> make<00:01:23.400> light<00:01:23.640> work<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:24.000> Gaara

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
himself could make light work of Gaara

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.230 
himself could make light work of Gaara
tusu<00:01:24.869> chikage<00:01:25.259> mizukage<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.670> know<00:01:26.790> all<00:01:27.060> these

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
tusu chikage mizukage you know all these

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.240 
tusu chikage mizukage you know all these
people<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.930> Reich<00:01:28.110> ah<00:01:28.320> Gaede<00:01:28.619> Tsunade

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
people the Reich ah Gaede Tsunade

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.920 
people the Reich ah Gaede Tsunade
I<00:01:29.430> don't<00:01:29.790> think<00:01:29.820> Naruto<00:01:30.329> could<00:01:30.509> do<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.750> by

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
I don't think Naruto could do that by

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.280 
I don't think Naruto could do that by
himself<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.920> safe<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.670> say<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.290> Naruto

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
himself so it's safe to say that Naruto

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.200 
himself so it's safe to say that Naruto
probably<00:01:35.130> couldn't<00:01:35.430> take<00:01:35.579> on<00:01:35.729> model<00:01:36.090> uh

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
probably couldn't take on model uh

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.300 
probably couldn't take on model uh
unless<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.930> know<00:01:37.020> again<00:01:37.290> some<00:01:37.470> crazy<00:01:37.979> thing

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
unless you know again some crazy thing

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.710 
unless you know again some crazy thing
happened<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:39.119> wouldn't<00:01:39.390> make<00:01:39.479> sense

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
happened that just wouldn't make sense

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.090 
happened that just wouldn't make sense
so<00:01:40.110> here's<00:01:40.320> what<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.530> think<00:01:40.590> what<00:01:40.860> would<00:01:40.950> happen

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
so here's what I think what would happen

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.249 
so here's what I think what would happen
if<00:01:41.369> they<00:01:41.520> did<00:01:41.820> fight<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.689> know<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.049> kind

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
if they did fight and you know it kind

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.139 
if they did fight and you know it kind
of<00:01:43.290> went<00:01:43.439> down<00:01:43.649> assuming<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.700> know<00:01:44.729> he

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
of went down assuming that you know he

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.780 
of went down assuming that you know he
gets<00:01:45.390> past<00:01:45.659> akagi's<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.500> Itachi<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.430> Sasuke

crazy battle

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.130 
crazy battle
probably<00:01:54.030> not<00:01:54.240> also<00:01:54.509> won't<00:01:54.720> be<00:01:54.810> able<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.049> do

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
probably not also won't be able to do

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.080 
probably not also won't be able to do
too<00:01:55.350> much<00:01:55.470> because<00:01:55.649> we<00:01:55.979> know<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.460> an<00:01:56.790> old

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
too much because we know that an old

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.060 
too much because we know that an old
model<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.630> like<00:01:57.840> he's<00:01:58.200> barely<00:01:58.469> using<00:01:58.890> any<00:01:59.040> of

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070

model is like he's barely using any of
his<00:01:59.189> power<00:01:59.399> des<00:01:59.700> akagi's<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.329> if<00:02:00.450> he<00:02:00.540> went<00:02:00.689> up

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
his power des akagi's so if he went up

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.109 
his power des akagi's so if he went up
against<00:02:01.560> Naruto<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.250> Naruto<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:02.820> actually

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
against Naruto and Naruto is actually

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.209 
against Naruto and Naruto is actually
giving<00:02:03.360> him<00:02:03.450> some<00:02:03.659> sort<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.020> challenge<00:02:04.320> he

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
giving him some sort of a challenge he

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.039 
giving him some sort of a challenge he
could<00:02:05.460> use<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.850> lot<00:02:06.180> more<00:02:06.450> strength<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.930> know

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
could use a lot more strength you know

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.990 
could use a lot more strength you know
he<00:02:07.439> got<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.680> powers<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.610> First<00:02:08.819> Hokage

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.180 
he got the powers of the First Hokage
you<00:02:09.569> know<00:02:09.660> trees<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.679> everything<00:02:10.979> he<00:02:11.069> could

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
you know trees and everything he could

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.860 
you know trees and everything he could
just<00:02:11.340> wrap<00:02:11.580> up<00:02:11.790> no<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.239> he<00:02:12.270> has<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> lot<00:02:12.720> of

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
just wrap up no so he has a lot of

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.979 
just wrap up no so he has a lot of
different<00:02:13.110> things<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.319> he

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
different things that he

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.809 
different things that he
now<00:02:14.230> we<00:02:14.290> do<00:02:14.560> know<00:02:14.709> that<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:15.040> b2<00:02:15.370> mode<00:02:15.579> makes

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
now we do know that the b2 mode makes

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.509 
now we do know that the b2 mode makes
them<00:02:16.000> very<00:02:16.269> fast<00:02:16.569> so<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.829> know<00:02:17.950> in<00:02:18.129> that<00:02:18.189> sense

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
them very fast so you know in that sense

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.640 
them very fast so you know in that sense
moderate<00:02:19.180> probably<00:02:19.599> trying<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.230> keep<00:02:20.379> up<00:02:20.530> with

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
moderate probably trying to keep up with

moderate probably trying to keep up with
him<00:02:20.829> which<00:02:20.950> would<00:02:21.099> be<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.280> little<00:02:21.430> bit

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:21.609 
him which would be a little bit

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:23.819 
him which would be a little bit
difficult<00:02:22.060> but<00:02:22.180> if<00:02:22.480> he<00:02:23.170> hasn't<00:02:23.379> really<00:02:23.709> used

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
difficult but if he hasn't really used

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.140 
difficult but if he hasn't really used
my<00:02:23.950> super<00:02:24.219> strength<00:02:24.400> who<00:02:24.640> knows<00:02:24.819> how<00:02:24.969> much<00:02:25.090> of

more<00:03:05.349> training<00:03:05.560> than<00:03:05.739> possibly<00:03:06.459> you<00:03:06.609> know<00:03:06.730> if

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
more training than possibly you know if

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.849 
more training than possibly you know if
he<00:03:06.909> had<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.060> longer<00:03:07.389> time<00:03:07.989> to<00:03:08.019> be<00:03:08.349> in<00:03:08.439> every<00:03:08.680> jew

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
he had a longer time to be in every jew

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.080 
he had a longer time to be in every jew
mode<00:03:09.069> it<00:03:09.340> would<00:03:09.459> give<00:03:09.609> him<00:03:09.730> more<00:03:09.939> of<00:03:09.970> an

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
mode it would give him more of an

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.179 
mode it would give him more of an
advantage<00:03:10.419> but<00:03:10.900> with<00:03:11.079> just<00:03:11.319> five<00:03:11.680> minutes

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:12.189 
advantage but with just five minutes

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:14.159 
advantage but with just five minutes
it's<00:03:12.430> not<00:03:12.549> gonna<00:03:12.909> happen<00:03:13.180> he<00:03:13.540> would<00:03:13.720> not<00:03:13.989> be

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:14.169 
it's not gonna happen he would not be

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:16.349 
it's not gonna happen he would not be
able<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.439> take<00:03:14.620> down<00:03:14.799> idle<00:03:15.579> model<00:03:15.909> at<00:03:16.180> that

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
able to take down idle model at that

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.000 
able to take down idle model at that
time<00:03:16.599> now<00:03:16.930> here's<00:03:17.169> the<00:03:17.319> thing<00:03:17.500> if<00:03:17.709> Naruto

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
time now here's the thing if Naruto

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.009 
time now here's the thing if Naruto
Sasuke<00:03:18.489> Itachi<00:03:19.090> teamed<00:03:19.479> up<00:03:19.659> would<00:03:19.840> they<00:03:19.959> be

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
Sasuke Itachi teamed up would they be

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.539 
Sasuke Itachi teamed up would they be
able<00:03:20.199> to<00:03:20.349> take<00:03:20.500> our<00:03:20.650> model<00:03:20.859> or<00:03:21.129> the<00:03:21.220> three<00:03:21.459> of

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
able to take our model or the three of

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.069 
able to take our model or the three of
them<00:03:21.639> yeah<00:03:21.970> I<00:03:22.000> think<00:03:22.150> they<00:03:22.389> could<00:03:22.659> they<00:03:22.930> would

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
them yeah I think they could they would

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.449 
them yeah I think they could they would
struggle<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.769> be<00:03:23.919> honest<00:03:24.129> with<00:03:24.250> you<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:24.400> think

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
struggle to be honest with you I think

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.099 
struggle to be honest with you I think
that<00:03:24.639> there<00:03:24.849> was<00:03:24.940> stroke<00:03:25.150> because<00:03:25.479> this<00:03:25.870> arrow

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
that there was stroke because this arrow

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.379 
that there was stroke because this arrow
model<00:03:26.530> is<00:03:26.650> just<00:03:26.889> beyond<00:03:27.190> belief<00:03:27.280> strong<00:03:27.909> but<00:03:28.359> I

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
model is just beyond belief strong but I

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.119 
model is just beyond belief strong but I
think<00:03:28.599> that<00:03:28.720> they<00:03:28.810> can<00:03:28.870> do<00:03:29.109> Itachi<00:03:29.680> is<00:03:29.889> very

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
think that they can do Itachi is very

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.469 
think that they can do Itachi is very
formidable<00:03:30.549> and<00:03:30.909> I<00:03:30.940> believe<00:03:31.209> he<00:03:31.329> would

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:31.479 
formidable and I believe he would

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.539 
formidable and I believe he would
definitely<00:03:31.629> be<00:03:31.900> almost<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.769> sacrifice<00:03:33.280> in<00:03:33.459> this

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
definitely be almost a sacrifice in this

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.189 
definitely be almost a sacrifice in this
one<00:03:33.729> because<00:03:33.970> he's<00:03:34.090> not<00:03:34.239> gonna<00:03:34.419> want<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.959> two

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:35.199 
one because he's not gonna want the two

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:36.899 
one because he's not gonna want the two
young<00:03:35.440> ones<00:03:35.680> to<00:03:35.919> you<00:03:36.159> know<00:03:36.280> die<00:03:36.609> especially

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
young ones to you know die especially

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.879 
young ones to you know die especially
you<00:03:37.540> know<00:03:37.659> his<00:03:37.810> brother<00:03:38.109> you<00:03:38.500> know<00:03:38.590> he's<00:03:38.769> not

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
you know his brother you know he's not

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.740 
you know his brother you know he's not
just<00:03:38.949> gonna<00:03:39.220> want<00:03:39.489> that<00:03:39.549> happen<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.180> Itachi

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
just gonna want that happen so Itachi

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.750 
just gonna want that happen so Itachi
would<00:03:40.989> probably<00:03:41.319> do<00:03:41.440> some<00:03:41.650> craziness<00:03:42.250> that

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
would probably do some craziness that

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.879 
would probably do some craziness that
would<00:03:42.879> definitely<00:03:43.060> get<00:03:43.510> him<00:03:43.659> killed<00:03:44.079> but<00:03:44.709> at

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
would definitely get him killed but at

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.860 
would definitely get him killed but at
least<00:03:45.040> would<00:03:45.370> probably<00:03:45.819> we<00:03:46.030> can<00:03:46.209> moderate<00:03:46.599> and

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
least would probably we can moderate and

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.360 
least would probably we can moderate and
I<00:03:46.930> think<00:03:47.229> Naruto<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:47.709> Sasuke<00:03:47.829> were<00:03:48.159> probably

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
I think Naruto and Sasuke were probably

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.550 
I think Naruto and Sasuke were probably
going<00:03:48.609> for<00:03:48.729> the<00:03:48.970> win<00:03:49.150> if<00:03:49.359> this<00:03:49.840> did<00:03:50.139> in<00:03:50.319> fact

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
going for the win if this did in fact

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.259 
going for the win if this did in fact
happen<00:03:50.889> either<00:03:51.340> way<00:03:51.459> I<00:03:51.549> think<00:03:51.819> it<00:03:51.909> would<00:03:52.030> be<00:03:52.150> an

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
happen either way I think it would be an

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.539 
happen either way I think it would be an
amazing<00:03:52.690> battle<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:53.590> I<00:03:53.650> would<00:03:53.859> love<00:03:54.129> to<00:03:54.340> see
