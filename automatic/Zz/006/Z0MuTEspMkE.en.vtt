it<00:01:17.900> hesitates<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.229> second<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.590> then<00:01:19.650> it

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
it hesitates just a second and then it

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.520 
it hesitates just a second and then it
slides<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.460> off<00:01:20.700> if<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.630> need<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.840> faster<00:01:22.320> fall<00:01:22.500> I

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
slides on off if I need a faster fall I

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.140 
slides on off if I need a faster fall I
put<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> caffeine<00:01:23.280> shad<00:01:23.549> on<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.909> where<00:01:24.060> it

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
put a caffeine shad on it where it

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.149 
put a caffeine shad on it where it
doesn't<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.600> as<00:01:24.689> much<00:01:24.810> buoyancy<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.740> if<00:01:26.040> I

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
doesn't have as much buoyancy to it if I

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.740 
doesn't have as much buoyancy to it if I
want<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.340> keep<00:01:26.460> them<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.729> top<00:01:26.939> I'll<00:01:27.119> put<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> Zulu
