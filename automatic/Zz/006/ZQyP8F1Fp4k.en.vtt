00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
with it I had a massive 800d and I

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.830 
with it I had a massive 800d and I
decided<00:00:41.980> that<00:00:42.310> uh<00:00:42.340> I<00:00:42.850> don't<00:00:43.150> really<00:00:43.450> want<00:00:43.720> that

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
decided that uh I don't really want that

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.690 
decided that uh I don't really want that
anymore<00:00:44.080> and<00:00:44.530> I<00:00:44.650> want<00:00:44.920> something<00:00:45.160> smaller<00:00:45.460> so

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
I hopefully only PCB 354 be so that's a

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.670 
I hopefully only PCB 354 be so that's a
