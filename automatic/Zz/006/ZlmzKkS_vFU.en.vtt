frying them we're going to be baking
them<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.790> important<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.329> we<00:02:00.420> take<00:02:00.600> out<00:02:00.780> all

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960

between the onion and the potatoes

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.050 
between the onion and the potatoes
