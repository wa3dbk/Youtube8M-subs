00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Any salvation we have 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Who takes us away from our religion 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Which you put on your son 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Until he dies once and for ever, for the sake of his people's speech 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 And in order to forgive our sins, and carry them out of the gates of the city 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 So that we will not have more of them in the post 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 And we have taken our sins 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 And away from us as far as the east from Morocco 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Father, we stand before you, putting on the righteousness of Jesus Christ 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 We do not boast in our righteousness 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 But we boast what she did for us 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 We accept it, and we are happy with it. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 And steadfast in it 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 O Lord, thank you for the work of renewal so that it brought about a change in us 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Our hearts are torn down, which you hate; 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Our hearts that love sin and hate righteousness are removed 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 And replace it with a new heart created according to your image 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 In righteousness and sanctity of truth 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 We thank you, Lord, for we no longer belong to the kingdom of darkness 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 But we have turned into the kingdom of your beloved Son 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 We appreciate it, our God 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 And that we are no longer servants of sin 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 But we can offer our members slaves to righteousness 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 We have our victory, even on sin, even on the wicked, even on this falling world 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Not with our ability, but with strength, glory and dignity 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 And the greatness of Jesus Christ 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 We rely on the legacy that we have been given 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 And, Lord, we will not allow anyone to deprive us of this great blessing, or to take away our joy 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 Glorify Yahweh in your people, and make them know that they are loved 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 He forgave them, they changed, and they would change from glory to glory 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 And that in a day they will stand before you 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Without spot, and without blemish 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Oh God, in the world that has the least repentance 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Who has the least faith, make them Yatun 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 ! They drink from the fountain for free 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 : My God, maybe there are people here this morning saying 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Is this for me? 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Dear, do you want it? Do you ask for it? 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 ! Then come 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 ! Are you thirsty? Come on 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 ! Are you hungry? Come on! And drink for free, and eat without price 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 My God, let the Redemption visit many homes 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 In the name of Jesus Amen 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 I do not care who you are, and I do not care what you've done 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Jesus Christ is a great Savior 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 : In an ancient Calvinist hymn says the following 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 You sinners, do not wait until you think you are ready " 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Or even think that you are repentant enough 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Or even think that you are sufficiently faithful 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 For if you wait until you are ready, you will never come 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 "Sit here now, and think," I'm lost, I'm lost 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 how do you know that ? 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Sinners do not know that 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 The hearts of wicked sluts do not know that they are destitute 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 ! But if you already know that you are a god, this indicates the work of God 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 "Oh, I want to be faithful 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Want? 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 Where do you think this desire comes from? 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 ! Come from him 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 ! So come to him 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 ! Believe it 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 ! Give it to yourself 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 "Cry to him!" My God saved me 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 He will be great in salvation, he is a great Savior
