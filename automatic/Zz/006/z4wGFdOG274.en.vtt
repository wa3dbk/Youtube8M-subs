00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
I think Dawn's up there metal detecting

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.680 
I think Dawn's up there metal detecting
somewhere<00:04:37.880> Travis<00:04:38.880> is<00:04:39.000> over<00:04:39.240> here<00:04:39.420> somewhere

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
somewhere Travis is over here somewhere

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.350 
and I am right now say right on it like
what<00:04:46.440> they<00:04:46.560> call<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.860> hemp<00:04:47.070> road<00:04:47.310> just<00:04:48.180> be<00:04:48.330> a

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
what they call the hemp road just be a

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.410 
what they call the hemp road just be a
big<00:04:48.570> hemp<00:04:48.810> production<00:04:48.960> area<00:04:49.560> and<00:04:50.190> a<00:04:50.730> lot<00:04:51.330> of

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
big hemp production area and a lot of

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.870 
big hemp production area and a lot of
vehicles<00:04:51.600> come<00:04:51.960> through<00:04:52.140> here<00:04:52.380> and

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
vehicles come through here and

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.310

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.659 

which<00:06:06.509> is<00:06:06.659> neat<00:06:06.840> this<00:06:07.080> is<00:06:07.259> actually<00:06:07.710> you<00:06:08.520> can

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
which is neat this is actually you can

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.429 
which is neat this is actually you can
tell<00:06:08.849> by<00:06:08.969> the<00:06:09.030> gray<00:06:09.330> on<00:06:09.569> it<00:06:09.689> this<00:06:09.870> thing<00:06:09.930> dated

00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:10.439 
tell by the gray on it this thing dated

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:14.119

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:14.129 
way back lead starts oxidizing like that

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:16.279 
way back lead starts oxidizing like that
and<00:06:14.400> then<00:06:15.300> this<00:06:15.449> is<00:06:15.689> kind<00:06:15.870> of<00:06:16.020> the<00:06:16.110> neatest

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:16.289 
and then this is kind of the neatest

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:17.420 
and then this is kind of the neatest
piece<00:06:16.620> thus<00:06:16.889> far

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
piece thus far

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.279 
piece thus far
pretty<00:06:18.300> sure<00:06:18.599> it's<00:06:18.779> silver<00:06:21.020> just<00:06:22.020> because<00:06:22.169> it

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
pretty sure it's silver just because it

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:23.869 
pretty sure it's silver just because it
hadn't<00:06:22.499> tarnish<00:06:22.830> I<00:06:22.949> think<00:06:23.099> it<00:06:23.189> was<00:06:23.430> iron<00:06:23.639> it

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:23.879 
hadn't tarnish I think it was iron it

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:27.080 
hadn't tarnish I think it was iron it
would<00:06:23.969> definitely<00:06:24.150> be<00:06:25.639> corroded<00:06:26.639> but<00:06:26.789> you<00:06:26.969> can

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
would definitely be corroded but you can

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.209 
would definitely be corroded but you can
see<00:06:27.240> a<00:06:27.270> little<00:06:27.449> bit<00:06:27.659> of<00:06:27.779> that<00:06:27.870> black<00:06:28.219> tarnish

00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:29.219

on<00:06:29.370> the<00:06:29.460> back<00:06:29.669> of<00:06:29.879> it<00:06:30.259> so<00:06:31.259> we're<00:06:31.379> gonna<00:06:31.469> test

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
on the back of it so we're gonna test

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.309 
on the back of it so we're gonna test
that<00:06:31.860> a<00:06:31.979> little<00:06:32.219> bit<00:06:32.310> later

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 
that a little bit later

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:36.769 
that a little bit later
make<00:06:34.319> sure<00:06:34.469> it's<00:06:34.620> silver<00:06:35.360> but<00:06:36.360> we're<00:06:36.689> gonna

00:06:36.769 --> 00:06:36.779 
make sure it's silver but we're gonna

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:39.110 
make sure it's silver but we're gonna
hit<00:06:36.960> that<00:06:36.990> filled<00:06:37.349> again<00:06:37.650> and<00:06:37.919> hopefully<00:06:38.759> next

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
hit that filled again and hopefully next

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.719
