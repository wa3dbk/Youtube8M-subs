00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.230
 hi how about guys and girls followers 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:10.580
 of kachin veros dot net today I 'm going to 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:14.570
 make a video review of a hose in 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:18.110
 concrete the hose is the basic box 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.320
 internews video review of the hose 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.570
 calla baksi interview in set mode 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.590
 let's see a little of its outside 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.930
 it's very good because it comes with a can 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.870
 where all the hose kit comes with 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.730
 nozzle and others 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.610
 We can find this hose in 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.570
 any store on offer over 15 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.090
 euros and its price around 19 is very 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.610
 easy to open the only thing that there is 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.120
 to do is remove the plug 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.120
 Y 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.239
 and once removed we are inside 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:58.179
 the hose we're going to take it out and see the 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.879
 accessories the first thing we have is the 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:05.229
 nozzle the nozzle as you can 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:07.630
 observe is methacrylate and is a 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.340
 nozzle that has screenprinted as 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.740
 you see the symbol the symbol 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.950
 characteristic of the street brand and 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.280
 has in its in its upper part has 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.420
 the nozzle good for smoking 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.189
 is where we will see that as 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.530
 You see, it has a pretty generous hole 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:27.840
 and at the bottom it has the 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.840
 connection to the hose to use 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.800
 and point 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.010
 what else has we turn around on 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.440
 hose connector that is the 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.510
 hose connector as this is what 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.820
 that will be plugged into the rubber band 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.770
 hose and this part is the one that goes to the 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.630
 hookah this what will be connected to 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.070
 our hookah this part is going to 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.070
 put as I say in the hose 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:01.810
 and finally 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.610
 the accessory that connects the mouthpiece with 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.190
 the hose does not connect to the hose 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.729
 directly the mouthpiece this accessory 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.900
 as well hole is constructed 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.400
 color as you see electric blue is this 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.390
 hose is in different colors that 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.650
 I have seen in red green black and this 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.600
 blue and I think they are all colors 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.720
 electrical also has the distinctive 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.390
 of street like you see this I do not know if 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.950
 is a queen I also tell you and for her 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.580
 part where we connect the mouthpiece has 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.410
 you see three silicone grips that 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.620
 is what they will do is hold the hose 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.410
 so that we press down and 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.030
 we connect the hose so that I 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.610
 I have a handle and for example floor 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.440
 put the street symbol of del 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.120
 connector with the street symbol of the 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.580
 nozzle 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.909
 and finally, what we need then 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.069
 obviously the hose this hose to the 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.440
 principle may seem that it is not 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:03.340
 Washable because as you can see 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.620
 It has a pretty nice coating 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.440
 nylon that 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:13.030
 how good that is left game with color 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.680
 from the connector and it has its holes 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.680
 and what you are not going to appreciate 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.470
 inside is that this hose has the 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.409
 basic silicone only that is coated 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.090
 is the detail of the nylon coating 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.860
 The good thing about this hose is that 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.299
 all accessories can be purchased 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.760
 apart from saying this comes in a tip 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.560
 but we can mount them 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.599
 go up the hose with this 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.120
 nozzle or another that that is I think that 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.799
 a size smy other than a here in the 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.810
 which it is quite fatter but this anymore 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.819
 me to put in my mouth flame 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.069
 too 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.170
 as I say all the accessories can be 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.810
 buy independently at least 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.999
 the nozzle and the hose this part is not 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.680
 I know but for the price that the 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:55.120
 offer of the kit the truth is that a 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.129
 hose for seven euros or a mouthpiece 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.170
 for five or six the truth is that 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.819
 Neither is the case but good 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.370
 nozzle following this larger type 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.010
 and with one thing that focuses on more fish or 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.569
 unless it has two openings and it's not 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.629
 a mouth as big as this one and it's more 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.760
 easy to have it in your mouth and now what 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:15.639
 The only thing we have to do is make the 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.099
 two the two connections that are missing already 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:21.530
 we have a part of the hose and 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:23.240
 on the other hand the connector to the hookah 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.570
 and the pros and cons of this hose 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.330
 well look 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.950
 the pros is the great shot that has 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.950
 thanks to your to your mouthpiece 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.470
 it's durable it's washable and it has pieces 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.849
 interchangeable and against at least 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.470
 that I have seen against is that with the 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:45.520
 nylon that this nylon hose like 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:49.449
 you can appreciate it is not too flexible 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.639
 so if we have a hookah you see 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.590
 if we have a hookah like mine 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.330
 bambino that is the one that I have we are going to 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.069
 have a serious problem if we do not have it 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.389
 to the height and it may be that this 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:59.919
 hose or hookah strip or it 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.930
 disconnect constantly what is it 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:06.729
 same has happened so this is the part 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.580
 of the product and I'll show you now 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.610
 how it works or how it works 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.300
 try a little the lamas and the street 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.879
 basic interior as you see and they teach you 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.139
 that has a pretty hole 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:23.229
 interesting the opening what he wants 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:25.270
 say that we are going to have a smoke with 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.919
 a pretty big shot also depends 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.889
 of the hookah and the bowl that 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:33.639
 let's use as you know georgi mine 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:37.560
 bambino with the heat and with the 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.560
 Sanzar and let's try the shot 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.790
 smoke 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.260
 It is quite dense but also clear 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.820
 depends a bit on the castilla and on 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.670
 all of the type of tobacco that we have 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.390
 this one is a hacker from 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.390
 mental chocolate 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.550
 the shot has decayed a bit too 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.270
 because it is already a ratillo that I have 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.700
 lit but good 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.410
 I was already shut up so interlude 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.930
 It is also not recommended with the 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.450
 patina because the weight is very large and 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.810
 it may be that smn is a lot toppled over but 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:29.590
 as I say the shot is fantastic with two 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.590
 coals in the heat 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:39.210
 we penalized a little the shot as I say 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.740
 the diffuser maybe but good and everyone 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.130
 let him make his own wings to mold well 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.440
 How good I hope you liked a 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.090
 I greet you all good afternoon 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.220
 let's say at night and I hope it leaves you a 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:53.330
 like so that I can keep working 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.330
 and making videos
