motor rail to the garage door springs
that<00:00:13.799> are<00:00:13.860> about<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.309> door<00:00:14.750> three<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.320> hinges

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
that are about the door three the hinges

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.689 
that are about the door three the hinges
on<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.279> garage<00:00:17.670> door<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:19.410> bearings<00:00:19.859> that

on the garage door and the bearings that
are<00:00:21.000> above<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:21.960> torsion<00:00:22.439> system<00:00:22.800> what

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
are above on the torsion system what

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:23.990 
are above on the torsion system what
you'll<00:00:23.220> see<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.519> moment

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
you'll see in a moment

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.089 
you'll see in a moment
so<00:00:24.480> first<00:00:24.750> let's<00:00:24.990> get<00:00:25.140> started<00:00:25.500> with<00:00:25.619> greasing

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
so first let's get started with greasing

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.519 
so first let's get started with greasing
the<00:00:26.220> motor<00:00:26.430> rail<00:00:26.699> here<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.180> like<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.720> use<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.439> a

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
the motor rail here I like to use on a

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.580 
the motor rail here I like to use on a
screw<00:00:28.980> driven<00:00:29.340> model<00:00:30.140> whether<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.320> be<00:00:31.410> from

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
screw driven model whether it be from

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.400 
screw driven model whether it be from
Jeannie<00:00:31.949> or<00:00:32.189> liftmaster<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.780> screwdrivers

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
Jeannie or liftmaster the screwdrivers

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.229 
Jeannie or liftmaster the screwdrivers
really<00:00:34.680> like<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.160> white<00:00:35.340> thicker<00:00:35.700> grease<00:00:36.030> if

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
really like the white thicker grease if

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.040 
really like the white thicker grease if
you<00:00:36.420> would<00:00:36.600> use<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> thin<00:00:37.730> oil<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:39.059> wd-40<00:00:39.899> or

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
you would use a thin oil like wd-40 or

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.530 
you would use a thin oil like wd-40 or
silicon<00:00:40.710> it's<00:00:41.489> going<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.790> thin<00:00:42.329> out

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
silicon it's going to thin out

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.090 
silicon it's going to thin out
everything<00:00:43.110> inside<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.829> it's<00:00:43.980> gonna

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
everything inside of it and it's gonna

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.209 
everything inside of it and it's gonna
make<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.250> even<00:00:44.730> louder<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.360> out<00:00:45.570> here<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.500> I'm

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
make it even louder and out here so I'm

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.520 
make it even louder and out here so I'm
going<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.520> actually<00:00:47.640> kind<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.239> feed<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.350> white

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
going to actually kind of feed the white

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.450 
going to actually kind of feed the white
lithium<00:00:49.739> grease<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.460> here<00:00:51.320> as<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.649> motor<00:00:52.890> is

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
lithium grease in here as the motor is

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.950 
lithium grease in here as the motor is
running

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.420 

and<00:01:01.320> that's<00:01:01.469> going<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.770> really<00:01:01.980> help<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
and that's going to really help the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.790 
and that's going to really help the
chatter

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
chatter

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:12.310 
chatter
come<00:01:04.400> down<00:01:04.670> on<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:05.059> door<00:01:07.720> in<00:01:08.720> second<00:01:11.290> wd-40<00:01:12.290> is

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
come down on the door in second wd-40 is

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.880 
come down on the door in second wd-40 is
fine

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
fine

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.270 
fine
so<00:01:13.100> comment<00:01:13.580> is<00:01:13.670> okay<00:01:14.000> as<00:01:14.180> well<00:01:14.479> I<00:01:14.690> like<00:01:15.530> wd-40

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
so comment is okay as well I like wd-40

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.120 
so comment is okay as well I like wd-40
for<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.360> springs<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.050> hinges<00:01:18.440> -

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
for the springs and the hinges -

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.880 
for the springs and the hinges -
sometimes<00:01:19.790> when<00:01:19.970> I<00:01:20.090> use<00:01:20.240> a<00:01:20.270> silicon<00:01:20.810> spray<00:01:21.080> it

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
sometimes when I use a silicon spray it

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.469 
sometimes when I use a silicon spray it
actually<00:01:22.250> leaves<00:01:22.490> a<00:01:22.610> film<00:01:22.790> on<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.150> hinges

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
actually leaves a film on the hinges

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.899 
actually leaves a film on the hinges
that<00:01:23.630> makes<00:01:23.810> even<00:01:23.990> more<00:01:24.170> noise<00:01:24.500> so<00:01:24.920> for<00:01:25.850> the

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
that makes even more noise so for the

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.219 
that makes even more noise so for the
most<00:01:26.060> part<00:01:26.150> if<00:01:26.450> you're<00:01:26.570> trying<00:01:26.750> to<00:01:26.840> quiet<00:01:27.110> down

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
most part if you're trying to quiet down

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.280 
most part if you're trying to quiet down
your<00:01:27.500> motor<00:01:27.680> just<00:01:28.640> regular<00:01:29.180> old<00:01:29.210> wd-40<00:01:30.110> works

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
your motor just regular old wd-40 works

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.999 
your motor just regular old wd-40 works
fine<00:01:30.530> so<00:01:31.690> lightly<00:01:32.690> spray<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.200> springs<00:01:33.560> once

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
fine so lightly spray the springs once

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:47.660 
fine so lightly spray the springs once
while<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.670> door<00:01:34.850> is<00:01:34.880> up<00:01:35.149> and<00:01:35.450> down

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.640 

the<00:01:48.030> door<00:01:48.300> completely<00:01:48.570> raises<00:01:49.290> all<00:01:49.410> the<00:01:49.530> way

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
the door completely raises all the way

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.990 
the door completely raises all the way
up<00:01:49.860> we're<00:01:50.070> going<00:01:50.190> to<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.370> little<00:01:50.610> bit<00:01:50.760> of<00:01:50.910> a

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
up we're going to have a little bit of a

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.800 
up we're going to have a little bit of a
gap<00:01:51.180> between<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:53.220> header<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.810> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
gap between the the header and the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.870 
gap between the the header and the
garage<00:01:55.110> door<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:56.660> we<00:01:57.660> can<00:01:57.840> get<00:01:57.990> up<00:01:58.140> there<00:01:58.350> and

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
garage door and we can get up there and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.560 
garage door and we can get up there and
spray<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.120> spring<00:02:00.390> lightly<00:02:00.810> one<00:02:00.960> more<00:02:01.170> time

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
spray the spring lightly one more time

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.840 
spray the spring lightly one more time
this<00:02:03.570> will<00:02:03.780> help<00:02:03.960> us<00:02:04.080> get<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:05.040> entire<00:02:05.340> spring

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
this will help us get the entire spring

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.570 
this will help us get the entire spring
since<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.330> coil<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.720> twisting<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.980> will<00:02:08.250> get

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
since the coil is twisting this will get

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.950 
since the coil is twisting this will get
the<00:02:08.910> wd-40<00:02:09.660> over<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.500> complete<00:02:10.970> spring<00:02:11.970> next

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
the wd-40 over the complete spring next

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.050 
the wd-40 over the complete spring next
we're<00:02:13.200> going<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.350> oil<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.800> hinges<00:02:13.980> here<00:02:14.520> I

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.420 

like<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.090> do<00:02:18.330> doors<00:02:18.990> moving<00:02:19.350> again

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.500 

right<00:02:23.060> here<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.810> get<00:02:24.019> in<00:02:24.230> close<00:02:24.739> right<00:02:25.189> here

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.589 

right<00:02:29.080> here<00:02:29.349> is<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.500> good<00:02:29.739> spot<00:02:30.069> is<00:02:30.420> where<00:02:31.420> the

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
right here is a good spot is where the

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.899 
right here is a good spot is where the

just stick the straw and there let's

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.500 
just stick the straw and there let's
give<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.459> a<00:03:24.549> little<00:03:25.620> bit<00:03:26.620> of<00:03:26.769> wd-40<00:03:27.489> so<00:03:28.239> one<00:03:28.390> on

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
give it a little bit of wd-40 so one on

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.750 
give it a little bit of wd-40 so one on
this<00:03:28.629> side<00:03:28.950> there's<00:03:29.950> one<00:03:30.190> on<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.459> opposing

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
this side there's one on the opposing

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
of the springs are actually going to

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.580 
of the springs are actually going to
have<00:03:36.400> another<00:03:36.700> bearing<00:03:37.180> or<00:03:37.380> sometimes<00:03:38.380> a

have another bearing or sometimes a

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.780 
have another bearing or sometimes a
plastic<00:03:39.040> bushing<00:03:39.430> I<00:03:40.109> recommend<00:03:41.109> the<00:03:41.290> bearings

rattles around in here so what we can do
to<00:04:28.030> resolve<00:04:28.210> that<00:04:28.690> is<00:04:28.900> actually<00:04:29.770> put<00:04:29.949> a

to resolve that is actually put a

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.790 
to resolve that is actually put a

heavy-duty grease in here that will keep

heavy-duty grease in here that will keep
this<00:04:33.039> rattle<00:04:33.520> down<00:04:33.789> to<00:04:34.210> a<00:04:34.240> minimum<00:04:34.570> and<00:04:35.070> a

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
couple of ways of doing that is you

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.990 
couple of ways of doing that is you
could<00:04:38.169> get<00:04:38.349> the<00:04:38.469> white<00:04:38.650> lithium<00:04:38.919> grease<00:04:39.190> with

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
could get the white lithium grease with

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.239 
could get the white lithium grease with
the

00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:40.249 
the

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:43.959 
the
draw<00:04:40.399> and<00:04:40.959> squirt<00:04:41.959> it<00:04:42.079> in<00:04:42.229> there<00:04:42.639> usually<00:04:43.639> the

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:43.969 
draw and squirt it in there usually the

draw and squirt it in there usually the
parasol<00:04:44.479> though<00:04:44.689> is<00:04:44.899> a<00:04:45.529> little<00:04:46.369> bit<00:04:46.549> thin<00:04:46.849> so<00:04:47.569> I

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
parasol though is a little bit thin so I

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.359 
parasol though is a little bit thin so I
like<00:04:47.959> to<00:04:48.109> use<00:04:48.199> a<00:04:48.229> little<00:04:48.469> bit<00:04:48.649> thinner<00:04:49.009> stuff

00:04:49.359 --> 00:04:49.369 
like to use a little bit thinner stuff

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:52.169 
like to use a little bit thinner stuff
if<00:04:49.999> you<00:04:50.089> can<00:04:50.239> find<00:04:50.509> a<00:04:50.859> mechanic's<00:04:51.859> crease

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
closer to a clear color that's good most

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:57.489 
closer to a clear color that's good most
of<00:04:55.969> the<00:04:56.059> time<00:04:56.149> you're<00:04:56.509> only<00:04:56.599> able<00:04:56.869> to<00:04:57.019> find<00:04:57.319> the

00:04:57.489 --> 00:04:57.499 
of the time you're only able to find the

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:00.009 
of the time you're only able to find the
mechanics<00:04:57.949> crease<00:04:58.219> that's<00:04:58.399> rather<00:04:58.699> blue<00:04:59.089> so
