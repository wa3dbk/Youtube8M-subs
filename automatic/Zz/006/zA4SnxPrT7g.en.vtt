00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
these are probably one of the most

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.609 
these are probably one of the most
easiest<00:00:24.420> machines<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.050> replace<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
separation rollers on the separation

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.810 
separation rollers on the separation
rollers<00:00:28.859> are<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:30.800> common<00:00:31.800> cause<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.399> paper

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
rollers are the common cause of paper

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.540 
rollers are the common cause of paper
jams<00:00:33.440> each<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.680> these<00:00:34.770> machines<00:00:35.070> are<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
jams each of these machines are the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.569 
jams each of these machines are the
series<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.270> machines<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:37.020> by<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.010> separation

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
series of machines you by the separation

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.729 
series of machines you by the separation
rollers<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.270> pairs<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.989> buy<00:00:40.140> two<00:00:40.200> at<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> time

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
rollers in pairs you buy two at a time

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.790 
rollers in pairs you buy two at a time
you<00:00:41.100> never<00:00:41.280> buy<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.760> one<00:00:42.000> by<00:00:42.300> 2<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:43.620> reason

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
you never buy just one by 2 the reason

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.910 
you never buy just one by 2 the reason
being<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.370> because<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:45.649> two<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.770> these

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
being is because you have two of these

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.979 
being is because you have two of these
rollers<00:00:47.309> one<00:00:47.789> located<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.510> paper<00:00:48.719> tray

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
rollers one located in the paper tray

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.750 
rollers one located in the paper tray
and<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.469> simply<00:00:49.710> they<00:00:50.129> always<00:00:50.309> have<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> door

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
and you simply they always have a door

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.100 
and you simply they always have a door
you<00:00:50.910> lift<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.210> open<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.600> get<00:00:51.690> pinch<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.079> you

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
you lift it open and get pinch it you

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.170 
you lift it open and get pinch it you
throw<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.530> off<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.949> when<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.520> look<00:00:53.699> at<00:00:53.850> yours

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
throw it off and when you look at yours

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.610 
throw it off and when you look at yours
you'll<00:00:54.570> examine<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.260> you'll<00:00:55.350> notice<00:00:55.500> that

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
you'll examine it and you'll notice that

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.130 
you'll examine it and you'll notice that
there's<00:00:55.890> no<00:00:56.039> tread<00:00:56.399> left<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.140> there's

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
there's no tread left on it there's

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.560 
there's no tread left on it there's
always<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.680> matching<00:00:59.550> roller<00:00:59.789> that's<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
always a matching roller that's on the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.170 
always a matching roller that's on the
inside<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.109> machine<00:01:01.730> so<00:01:02.730> when<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.969> buy

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
inside of the machine so when you buy

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.460 
inside of the machine so when you buy
these<00:01:03.390> rollers<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.930> always<00:01:04.080> buy<00:01:04.260> them<00:01:04.350> in

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
these rollers you always buy them in

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.219 
these rollers you always buy them in
pairs<00:01:05.180> each<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.390> these<00:01:06.479> machines<00:01:06.900> will<00:01:07.049> take

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
pairs each of these machines will take

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.070 
pairs each of these machines will take
different<00:01:07.380> rollers<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.159> again<00:01:08.780> you<00:01:09.780> want<00:01:09.990> to

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
different rollers but again you want to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.469 
different rollers but again you want to
either<00:01:10.260> buy<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> 2-pack<00:01:11.430> or<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.119> want<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.360> buy<00:01:12.450> a

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
either buy a 2-pack or you want to buy a

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.270 
either buy a 2-pack or you want to buy a
10<00:01:12.840> pack<00:01:13.080> or<00:01:13.409> even<00:01:13.619> beyond<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:15.920> keep<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.070> mind

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
10 pack or even beyond that keep in mind

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.520 
10 pack or even beyond that keep in mind
when<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.580> when<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.180> common<00:01:18.570> 13.1

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
when you when you have the common 13.1

would buy them as a 2-pack the
maintenance<00:01:45.090> kids<00:01:45.360> always<00:01:45.509> give<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.869> 6<00:01:46.259> so

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
maintenance kids always give you a 6 so

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.139 
maintenance kids always give you a 6 so
if<00:01:46.829> your<00:01:46.950> machine<00:01:47.070> only<00:01:47.369> has<00:01:47.520> one<00:01:47.790> trade<00:01:48.060> you

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
if your machine only has one trade you

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.399 
if your machine only has one trade you
buy<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> maintenance<00:01:48.780> kit<00:01:48.960> you're<00:01:49.110> wondering

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
buy a maintenance kit you're wondering

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.569 
buy a maintenance kit you're wondering
where<00:01:49.560> all<00:01:49.590> these<00:01:49.799> rollers<00:01:50.159> came<00:01:50.399> from

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
where all these rollers came from

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.289 
where all these rollers came from
remember<00:01:51.119> HP<00:01:51.750> created<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.290> maintenance<00:01:52.619> kit

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
remember HP created the maintenance kit

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.670 
remember HP created the maintenance kit
and<00:01:54.299> they<00:01:54.630> didn't<00:01:54.869> know<00:01:54.990> if<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.259> have<00:01:55.409> one
