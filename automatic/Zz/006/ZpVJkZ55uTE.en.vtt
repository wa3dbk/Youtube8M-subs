with<00:01:06.659> liquid<00:01:07.049> clay<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.500> didn't<00:01:07.979> because<00:01:08.189> this

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
with liquid clay I didn't because this

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.450 
with liquid clay I didn't because this
clay<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.119> super<00:01:09.630> sticky<00:01:10.080> i'm<00:01:10.400> using<00:01:11.400> primo

brown somewhere around there hazelnut
maybe<00:01:18.830> and<00:01:19.830> then<00:01:20.490> you're<00:01:20.640> going<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
maybe and then you're going to do the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.460 
maybe and then you're going to do the
same<00:01:21.330> thing<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> arms<00:01:24.200> what<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.229> would

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
same thing for the arms what I would

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.350 
same thing for the arms what I would
have<00:01:25.500> done<00:01:25.590> differently<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.580> position<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
have done differently is position the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.929 
have done differently is position the
arms<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.840> bit<00:01:28.049> better<00:01:28.439> or<00:01:28.829> maybe<00:01:29.040> put<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.579> stick

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
arms a bit better or maybe put a stick

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.460 
arms a bit better or maybe put a stick
between<00:01:30.150> them<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.630> they<00:01:30.780> don't<00:01:30.960> look<00:01:31.259> as

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
between them so they don't look as

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.850 
between them so they don't look as
awkward<00:01:31.979> or<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:33.180> brant<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.780> tree<00:01:33.990> branch<00:01:34.200> with
