00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:17.030 
see what kind of sound we're getting
with<00:02:08.250> just<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.820> guitar<00:02:08.970> no<00:02:09.840> pedal<00:02:15.830> okay<00:02:16.830> let's

with just the guitar no pedal okay let's

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.010 
with just the guitar no pedal okay let's
bring<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.610> pedal<00:02:17.850> in<00:02:17.970> it's<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.300> 50

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
bring the pedal in it's in 50

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:28.040 
bring the pedal in it's in 50
millisecond<00:02:19.680> mode<00:02:26.510> now<00:02:27.510> what<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.750> pedal<00:02:27.989> is

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
millisecond mode now what the pedal is

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.320 
millisecond mode now what the pedal is
doing<00:02:28.290> right<00:02:28.440> now<00:02:28.470> it's<00:02:28.709> pretty<00:02:28.890> subtle

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
doing right now it's pretty subtle

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.690 
doing right now it's pretty subtle
because<00:02:30.330> we're<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.959> shortest<00:02:31.920> delay<00:02:32.400> time

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
because we're in the shortest delay time

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.940 
because we're in the shortest delay time
if<00:02:33.000> we<00:02:33.690> raise<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.900> delay<00:02:34.290> time<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.560> bit<00:02:34.830> we

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
if we raise the delay time a bit we

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.199 
if we raise the delay time a bit we
should<00:02:34.980> be<00:02:35.190> able<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.430> hear<00:02:35.640> some<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.090> the

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
should be able to hear some of the

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:44.540 
should be able to hear some of the
effect<00:02:42.830> sounds<00:02:43.830> kind<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.070> like<00:02:44.250> an<00:02:44.400> early

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
effect sounds kind of like an early

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.710 
effect sounds kind of like an early
reflection<00:02:45.800> reverb<00:02:46.800> if<00:02:47.519> we<00:02:47.700> keep<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.120> delay

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
reflection reverb if we keep the delay

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.500 
reflection reverb if we keep the delay
time<00:02:48.930> down<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.950> really<00:02:50.190> notice<00:02:51.060> anything<00:02:51.450> I'm

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
time down to really notice anything I'm

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.550 
time down to really notice anything I'm
going<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.720> have<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.900> turn<00:02:52.050> up<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.290> effect

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
going to have to turn up the effect

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.890 
going to have to turn up the effect
level<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.250> feedback<00:02:53.519> level

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.960 

what<00:02:59.769> we're<00:02:59.890> getting<00:02:59.980> there<00:03:00.280> is<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.489> sort<00:03:00.939> of

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
what we're getting there is a sort of

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
effects you can create with a delay

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.949 
effects you can create with a delay
pedal<00:03:05.409> besides<00:03:05.920> just<00:03:06.280> echo<00:03:06.640> let's<00:03:07.629> check<00:03:07.840> out

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
pedal besides just echo let's check out

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.429 
pedal besides just echo let's check out
some<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.319> other<00:03:08.439> modes<00:03:10.079> this<00:03:11.079> is<00:03:11.379> the<00:03:13.439> 200

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
some of the other modes this is the 200

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.770 
some of the other modes this is the 200
millisecond<00:03:15.069> mode<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:15.970> we<00:03:16.090> get<00:03:16.269> some<00:03:16.599> more

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
millisecond mode so we get some more

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.849 
millisecond mode so we get some more
discreet<00:03:17.290> echoes<00:03:17.620> out<00:03:17.739> of<00:03:17.920> this<00:03:22.680> it's<00:03:23.680> kind<00:03:23.829> of

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
discreet echoes out of this it's kind of

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.729 
discreet echoes out of this it's kind of
what<00:03:24.010> we<00:03:24.040> call<00:03:24.220> a<00:03:24.280> slapback<00:03:24.819> echo<00:03:25.530> good<00:03:26.530> for

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
what we call a slapback echo good for

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:33.289 
what we call a slapback echo good for
country<00:03:26.890> picking<00:03:27.370> and<00:03:27.489> things<00:03:27.640> like<00:03:27.790> that

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.550 

let's<00:03:34.299> turn<00:03:34.540> that<00:03:34.750> up<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:35.019> little<00:03:35.139> bit<00:03:35.409> we'll

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
let's turn that up a little bit we'll

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.379 
let's turn that up a little bit we'll
get<00:03:35.680> some<00:03:35.799> more<00:03:35.920> discreet<00:03:36.340> echoes<00:03:36.670> maybe<00:03:37.090> some

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
get some more discreet echoes maybe some

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.860 
get some more discreet echoes maybe some
more<00:03:37.540> feedback<00:03:37.859> for<00:03:38.859> more<00:03:39.069> of<00:03:39.220> a<00:03:39.400> rich

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
more feedback for more of a rich

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:51.240 
more feedback for more of a rich
sounding<00:03:41.519> effect

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:04:03.270 

you

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.610 

ok<00:04:04.280> let's<00:04:04.550> check<00:04:04.730> out<00:04:04.910> the<00:04:05.030> next<00:04:05.330> mode<00:04:05.570> that<00:04:06.350> is

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
ok let's check out the next mode that is

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.700 
ok let's check out the next mode that is
the<00:04:07.430> 800<00:04:07.970> millisecond<00:04:08.510> mug<00:04:08.630> this<00:04:09.170> is<00:04:09.380> for<00:04:09.590> much

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
the 800 millisecond mug this is for much

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:10.360 
the 800 millisecond mug this is for much
longer

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
longer

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:36.390

discrete<00:04:11.000> echoes<00:04:11.420> as<00:04:12.130> you'll<00:04:13.130> hear

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.430 

let's<00:04:37.400> kind<00:04:37.610> of<00:04:37.700> affect<00:04:37.910> you<00:04:38.000> get<00:04:38.120> there

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
let's kind of affect you get there

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.160 
let's kind of affect you get there
pretty<00:04:39.440> classic<00:04:40.310> echo<00:04:40.880> effect<00:04:41.360> and<00:04:41.840> of<00:04:41.960> course

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
pretty classic echo effect and of course

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.460 
pretty classic echo effect and of course
you<00:04:42.350> can<00:04:42.530> make<00:04:43.040> it<00:04:43.480> last<00:04:44.480> a<00:04:44.690> lot<00:04:44.840> longer<00:04:44.900> using

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
you can make it last a lot longer using

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.450 
you can make it last a lot longer using
the<00:04:45.560> feedback<00:04:47.620> I'm<00:04:48.620> pretty<00:04:48.950> much<00:04:49.100> go<00:04:49.310> on

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
the feedback I'm pretty much go on

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.860 
the feedback I'm pretty much go on
forever<00:04:50.770> or<00:04:51.770> you<00:04:52.100> can<00:04:52.220> just<00:04:52.340> have<00:04:52.490> it<00:04:52.600> go<00:04:53.600> once

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
forever or you can just have it go once

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.280 
forever or you can just have it go once
and<00:04:55.210> of<00:04:56.210> course<00:04:56.420> you<00:04:56.480> can<00:04:56.600> also<00:04:56.750> affect<00:04:57.170> the

and of course you can also affect the

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.040 
and of course you can also affect the
level<00:04:57.650> of<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:58.400> effect<00:04:58.730> this<00:04:59.420> will<00:04:59.600> be<00:04:59.750> mostly

effect<00:05:01.390> and<00:05:02.390> of<00:05:03.350> course<00:05:03.590> you<00:05:03.680> can<00:05:03.800> turn<00:05:03.950> off

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
effect and of course you can turn off

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.590 
effect and of course you can turn off
the<00:05:04.190> effect<00:05:04.430> completely<00:05:04.610> with<00:05:04.910> that<00:05:04.940> now<00:05:07.600> last

mode on here is sort of a phrase
sampling<00:05:11.360> mode<00:05:12.460> there's<00:05:13.460> a<00:05:13.580> hold<00:05:13.850> mode<00:05:14.060> on<00:05:14.240> the

sampling mode there's a hold mode on the
dd6<00:05:14.780> as<00:05:14.960> well<00:05:15.110> but<00:05:15.290> it's<00:05:15.410> a<00:05:15.530> little<00:05:15.830> different

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
dd6 as well but it's a little different

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.810 
dd6 as well but it's a little different
this<00:05:17.270> one<00:05:17.570> basically<00:05:18.440> just<00:05:18.890> holds<00:05:19.460> whatever

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
this one basically just holds whatever

this one basically just holds whatever
you're<00:05:20.690> playing<00:05:21.080> as<00:05:22.010> long<00:05:22.340> as<00:05:22.520> you<00:05:22.610> hold<00:05:22.790> down

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
you're playing as long as you hold down

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.230 
you're playing as long as you hold down
the<00:05:23.300> pedal<00:05:23.630> so<00:05:24.410> if<00:05:24.620> I<00:05:24.740> were<00:05:24.920> to<00:05:25.130> play<00:05:25.640> a<00:05:25.670> trill

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
the pedal so if I were to play a trill

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.750 
the pedal so if I were to play a trill
something<00:05:26.690> like

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.980 

as<00:05:33.760> soon<00:05:34.030> as<00:05:34.120> I<00:05:34.210> let<00:05:34.360> go<00:05:34.480> of<00:05:34.570> the<00:05:34.660> pedal<00:05:34.870> it's

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
as soon as I let go of the pedal it's

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.830 
as soon as I let go of the pedal it's
going<00:05:35.140> to<00:05:35.200> stop<00:05:36.060> so<00:05:37.060> that's<00:05:37.150> the<00:05:37.360> hold<00:05:37.570> mode

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
going to stop so that's the hold mode

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.480 
going to stop so that's the hold mode
for<00:05:38.080> that<00:05:38.260> can<00:05:38.350> be<00:05:38.470> used<00:05:38.650> in<00:05:38.800> a<00:05:38.860> variety<00:05:39.010> of
