00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello girls here I am with the review of the 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.440
 Wednesday this time more than one 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.349
 review of a single product 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.219
 I will do a comparison review between 2 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.860
 mascara 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.139
 in particular I'm talking about better 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.529
 than set of the two faces and ours 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.769
 jazz that the sef now i'm trying from a 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.840
 quite a few of these mascaras and I have to say that if 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.210
 follow you for a while you know that I love the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.550
 pupa bug mascara however I have to say 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.160
 that these 2 mascara entered immediately 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.469
 in my favorites just because 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.570
 the effect they have is really a lot of motion 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.059
 nice the first yes I must say that he owes me 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.940
 like a little eyelash effect 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.070
 a Boragno say because these mascara 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.480
 give this super eyelash effect 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.989
 super full charges and since I love 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.629
 bump that absolutely gives this effect 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.420
 they could not even fall in love with these 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.070
 2 mascara release to the application of the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.070
 product and see each other again soon after 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.610
 well 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.180
 then as you could see they are 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.240
 almost similar 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:16.830
 better than sex stretches a lot 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.830
 eyelashes makes them very full and in having 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:25.020
 in the root we say at the base I wanted 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:27.900
 say and then opens them but doesn't comb them 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.400
 good as much as that of sephora 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.640
 because having this you brush the 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.840
 very small silicone you really succeed 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.790
 very very good 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.910
 to separate the lashes especially me 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.060
 like the three eyelash gestures 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.060
 lower as you have seen it lengthens them e 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.460
 separates them in an extraordinary way 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.020
 so absolutely when i saw it 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.700
 the effect of this mascara on the lashes 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.370
 I absolutely am inferior 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.340
 in love because the better band sex yes 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.760
 hunch up badly cracks up a little while 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.200
 this divides them a lot and none 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.490
 the mascara I tried has never given me 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.580
 this effect on the lower lashes 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.730
 as you saw in the application later 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.570
 the more you pass the better than sex and 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.000
 be much more lumpy than 3 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.100
 gen joke both but scale in my opinion 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.890
 two applications are already too many because 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.080
 therefore they tend to form lumps 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.660
 already two applications 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.300
 according to me it is the maximum the mascara of 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.760
 sephora to the small peach we say so 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.560
 that when you remove make-up practically 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.800
 mascara alive or in any case yes 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.600
 dissolves vico everywhere what not 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.790
 happens with too 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.120
 faced that really removes make-up along with 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.910
 so I think I have 2 mascaras there 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.959
 I absolutely recommend both 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.120
 excellent 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.680
 let's say this is fraccone to this 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.440
 small drawback of stripping 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.570
 but let's say you lose a little more than 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.630
 time in stocking but nothing 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.819
 exceptional maybe I don't recommend it 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.159
 precisely if 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.819
 first you a lot or if you have to go 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:08.780
 as I told you in the other video to see 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.340
 a sad movie or if you love ceremony in a 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.109
 event where maybe you can 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.819
 so absolutely move this 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.400
 maybe it's a bit to avoid 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.829
 that occasion is said this nothing me 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.840
 I can recommend both of these 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.590
 mascara because they are really phenomenal 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.599
 as you could see 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.949
 application always if precisely vi 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.960
 like this effect 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.699
 I hope this mini face review is 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.449
 liked it and above all I have been 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.389
 helpful 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.539
 see you on Friday with a surprise video 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.539
 Hello
