00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.250
 our 20 good ang the salt in the video was already 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.289
 teach and for all of you do not want 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.910
 learn how to make a servant of 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.859
 minecraft without ever good is a good thing 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.090
 simple but only that many think it is 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.520
 very difficult 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.770
 good first thing is to make you go 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.040
 I came here from the start menu and it's being 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.450
 well if your not windows 7 a level 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.329
 I do not know how it is 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:48.480
 You come here to run, but not 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:51.300
 I know how it is that I did not test coca ip 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.670
 the son is going to show what's left 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:59.780
 A little while above you will see that the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:03.480
 address on record this standard gatway 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:11.340
 most functional player any 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:13.290
 browser and type here the 192 that the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.619
 standard trigger 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.630
 other 68 1.1 you will have the part of the 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.430
 yours on your router 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.049
 I understand the user name without the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.970
 mine already had everything 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.549
 only it's mostly from me 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.470
 here below my dynamics if not 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.380
 for only you search on google adwords 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.790
 is putting in the description which we 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.530
 was dressed 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.659
 simply do not give me to someone who 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.259
 Do you know where it's going to open a page? 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.619
 similar and know good probably not 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.899
 it will look like the router is from the link 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.860
 only that such furniture will have this 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.630
 option here advancedit right site and 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.689
 Clicking on her feels good. 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.880
 only blind does not get out of the trash cultivation on the site 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.600
 of twitter and if you have in cash the deal 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.640
 then your business on the net that is 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.969
 virtual services and tank 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.229
 You have to find this is what you come for. 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.020
 here now 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.690
 inside this milk they see themselves as virtual 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.970
 services you add a century 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.709
 bd is that they do not have the cretz gene 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.280
 only that suits you any game 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:24.970
 You know the cup but we will not put it 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.459
 from minecraft which is right pedro that goes 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.160
 if time were here that point 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:34.330
 different from the team insert the four pv 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.580
 members can put the newspaper can 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.989
 to be at the door of the greatest 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.739
 craft and took and 55 aquino the final door 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.840
 common 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:48.940
 Do you know if you've noticed a detail? 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:03:00.790
 can not receive the dp can save the 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:03:04.630
 Okay, until then, it comes to me, it'll always be there. 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.940
 here and I'm going to remove it here I thought 'it will be 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.920
 a little but only that works and what not 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.680
 works until added 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.940
 there you have the chance of errors and hoff is 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.019
 that you put ipv4 ready was already just 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.530

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.910

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.209
