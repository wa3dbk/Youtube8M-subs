00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.080
 moin and welcome to my 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.629
 fast beginner guide to mechwarrior 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.730
 online if you have the game for the first time 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.769
 pulled then you have only trial max 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.179
 will have to start on the homescreen 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.179
 mac rag go to you the max again 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.680
 to be able to look more closely and I am 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.730
 now for you directly screen in mac 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:26.550
 app there are the class leaders max medium 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.740
 max barbara like max roth mix leading fair 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.179
 they have weakly planned armor 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.920
 very fast but not so many 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.870
 Weapons carry medium max are mostly 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.649
 one can still be relatively fast 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.120
 Maintain adequate number of weapons 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.300
 in a lot of mediterranean medium max 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.450
 stop remakes so heavy max are then 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.980
 even the maxi are also better for him 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.379
 which classes can be classified as 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.809
 example in which the catapult is 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.789
 a remake of the often for the fair 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.370
 Fighting is mostly geared towards 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.079
 massive rocket batteries you can get 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.340
 also convert accordingly for the 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.109
 relative melee with 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.840
 short-range rockets or similar 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.640
 hire who are the heaviest 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.049
 slowest the thickest ones with the biggest 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.630
 the heaviest armor and most 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.270
 weapons but also like popular destination on 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.070
 brief explanation of the battlefield 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.659
 the left side you see the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.549
 maximum speed the maximum 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.380
 Tonagel can not exceed 100 tons 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.380
 Wear and is at 100 tons of his 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.299
 weight celebrates 79 that is always 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.500
 because the relative value of the designated 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.119
 just the complete damage 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.570
 you align if you use your weapons 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.360
 at the same time shoots and also hits and 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.670
 The courtiers shoot important value in the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.850
 worth 1.2 it is desirable if you 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.840
 weapons use the heat generate 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.840
 There are a total of three weapons 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.850
 categories ballistic weapons energy 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.950
 weapons and rockets so miss neck 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.130
 generate energy weapons and rockets 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.899
 heat ballistic weapons rocket you 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.460
 and ballistic weapons need 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.880
 Ammunition, too, has to be in the back of my mind 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:02.479
 keep and 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.130
 the rest is relatively unimportant for beginners 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.509
 you just have to first 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.280
 decide what to run around here 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.020
 if you want to be slow of pig 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.180
 I want to be able to defy everything 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.390
 for it needs to plug in future 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.099
 or that went piece of the small fast 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.450
 scout for you or for your team 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.250
 all sorts of destinations in the distance already 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.569
 can find out because he is with 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.760
 his speed is the first one at the 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.310
 front is and the opponents just stop 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.360
 You can always aim for it 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:36.230
 your missile can stop in this 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.730
 case I will probably with that 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.040
 catapult surround environment alike 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.690
 a bit infotic if you are 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.680
 later enough credits collapsed there 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.350
 did you get after each match 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.000
 credits these are the ones down here 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.900
 normal standard is that i'm saying 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.670
 sometimes on average jena victory or defeat 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.739
 one hundred thousand credits then you can 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.410
 someday buy your own away from it 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.140
 that starts at 1.1 million and 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.180
 go to over 10 million 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.459
 border 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.350
 and if you have your own mac you have 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.060
 repair costs to him is the cost of 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.920
 pay for ammunition 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.010
 you do not have that with the sharks 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.120
 maxi are simply borrowed with 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.500
 which you can directly into the fight 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.030
 start over and over and over and over and over 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.730
 repeatedly and directly already 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.590
 sometimes you have to have your own mac 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.760
 a few seconds were the last thing 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.140
 I had was almost half believed 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.720
 minute so far also rash again 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.829
 came back and repaired was the trace 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.600
 you can just send it and you 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.220
 have no repair costs before 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.799
 munitions training costs I read just 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.680
 simply something you are doing relatively well 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.739
 That's how they are 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.620
 most important basics at least for 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.700
 first if you are a beginner and now 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.900
 I'll show you just yet 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.000
 fast a bit ingame footage 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.480
 so that your money as short as possible 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.720
 that is because he believes he is 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.670
 colleagues here the medium mac with for 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.220
 medium is a fucking fast 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.389
 speed because that's me 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.640
 relatively fast on the front and can 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:04.110
 show you a little something and co 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.540
 but before we wanted to start I wanted 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.560
 yet just say in his short time can 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.260
 Of course, not everything is important 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.490
 tell and what I have 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.080
 detailed tutorial on my channel 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.690
 if I'm interested in it all if you 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.269
 as again want to know exactly what phase 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.989
 is what happens when you have a mac 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.730
 want to buy 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.060
 what to look for and so on 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.320
 and so on , pull looks through the 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.460
 riding videos that is a total of one 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.380
 half an hour or something if you like that 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.690
 I would be glad to have time 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.690
 but now in the battle and co
