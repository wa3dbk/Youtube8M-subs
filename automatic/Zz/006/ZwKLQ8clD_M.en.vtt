the fan clips very nice design they kind

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.940 
the fan clips very nice design they kind
of<00:00:36.510> make<00:00:36.960> them<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.290> where<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.500> can<00:00:37.649> use<00:00:37.680> your

the<00:00:51.410> anti<00:00:52.410> vibration<00:00:52.620> mounts<00:00:54.559> but<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.739> does

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
the anti vibration mounts but that does

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.630 
the anti vibration mounts but that does
include<00:00:56.520> those<00:00:58.129> yeah<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.309> want<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.579> make

thing is and these fans are actually
mounted<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.870> little<00:01:04.110> too<00:01:04.350> low<00:01:05.659> it's<00:01:06.659> definitely

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
mounted a little too low it's definitely

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.700 
mounted a little too low it's definitely
will<00:01:07.260> not<00:01:07.409> clear<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:09.479> mounting<00:01:09.840> bracket<00:01:10.020> on

will not clear the mounting bracket on
that<00:01:11.159> middle<00:01:11.340> fan<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.320> this<00:01:13.320> front<00:01:13.619> fan<00:01:13.890> would

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
that middle fan and this front fan would

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.070 
that middle fan and this front fan would
not<00:01:14.310> clear<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:16.080> RAM<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:17.540> some<00:01:18.540> other<00:01:18.689> boards

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080

not clear the RAM on some other boards
it's<00:01:19.920> one<00:01:20.100> thing<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.369> do<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.970> watch<00:01:21.150> out

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
it's one thing you do have to watch out

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.149 
it's one thing you do have to watch out

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
you can however mount this per se if you

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.719 
you can however mount this per se if you
wanted<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:28.369> don't<00:01:29.369> think<00:01:29.430> that

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
nice sleeved cables on these fans it's

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.520 
nice sleeved cables on these fans it's
one<00:02:17.970> thing<00:02:18.000> i<00:02:18.180> can<00:02:18.330> say<00:02:18.510> i<00:02:18.540> really<00:02:18.930> do<00:02:19.050> like<00:02:19.260> in

one thing i can say i really do like in
there<00:02:19.940> pwm<00:02:20.940> fans<00:02:22.070> these<00:02:23.070> push<00:02:27.920> 13<00:02:28.920> it's<00:02:29.220> 900<00:02:29.850> to

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
there pwm fans these push 13 it's 900 to

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.850 
there pwm fans these push 13 it's 900 to
1300<00:02:30.750> RPM<00:02:32.060> pwm<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.360> i<00:02:33.840> believe<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.440> max

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
1300 RPM pwm and i believe the max

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.900 
1300 RPM pwm and i believe the max
airflow<00:02:35.519> is<00:02:36.590> 75<00:02:37.730> CFM<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.590> even<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.739> 100%<00:02:41.250> I

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
airflow is 75 CFM and even it 100% I

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.610 
airflow is 75 CFM and even it 100% I
actually<00:02:42.390> have<00:02:42.690> one<00:02:42.900> running<00:02:43.230> in<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.410> case

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
actually have one running in the case

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.100 
actually have one running in the case
right<00:02:43.830> now<00:02:43.860> it's<00:02:44.220> actually<00:02:44.580> quieter<00:02:45.150> running

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
right now it's actually quieter running

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.650 
right now it's actually quieter running
full<00:02:46.500> speed<00:02:46.739> then<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.880> lot<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.180> my<00:02:48.269> other<00:02:48.420> case

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
full speed then a lot of my other case

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.770 
full speed then a lot of my other case
