explaining why the ticket wire right
it's<00:00:13.050> a<00:00:13.139> good<00:00:13.290> choice<00:00:13.610> and<00:00:14.610> why<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:14.940> know<00:00:15.210> what

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
it's a good choice and why you know what

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.490 
it's a good choice and why you know what
why<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> good<00:00:15.809> different<00:00:16.110> bikes<00:00:16.290> are<00:00:16.470> for

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
why a good different bikes are for

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.300 
why a good different bikes are for
different<00:00:16.710> reasons

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
different reasons

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.050 
different reasons
all<00:00:18.119> right<00:00:18.390> um<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:20.070> for<00:00:20.310> example<00:00:20.820> for<00:00:20.939> the

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
all right um so for example for the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.910 
all right um so for example for the
Brompton<00:00:21.300> if<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.960> place<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.439> want<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.710> go<00:00:22.859> to

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
Brompton if the place you want to go to

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.830 
Brompton if the place you want to go to
is<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> building<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.150> you're<00:00:24.330> where<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.600> live

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
is a building and you're where you live

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.710 
is a building and you're where you live
it's<00:00:25.170> really<00:00:25.560> tight<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:26.910> want<00:00:27.090> maximum

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
it's really tight so you want maximum

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.870 
it's really tight so you want maximum
size<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.500> minimum<00:00:28.890> size<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.160> should<00:00:29.460> say<00:00:29.609> then

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
size the minimum size I should say then

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.370 
size the minimum size I should say then
the<00:00:30.029> Brompton<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.570> really<00:00:30.960> going<00:00:31.140> that's

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the Brompton is really going that's

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.830 
the Brompton is really going that's
where<00:00:31.590> they're<00:00:31.740> number<00:00:32.040> one<00:00:32.220> but<00:00:33.000> aside<00:00:33.660> from

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
where they're number one but aside from

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.360 
where they're number one but aside from
that<00:00:34.050> if<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.500> want<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.770> look<00:00:34.890> for<00:00:35.070> something

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
that if you want to look for something

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.400 
that if you want to look for something
like<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.610> funerai<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.420> better<00:00:36.660> ride<00:00:36.989> okay

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
like a funerai a better ride okay

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.950 
like a funerai a better ride okay
slightly<00:00:37.710> better<00:00:37.890> ride<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.480> also<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> better

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
slightly better ride and also a better

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.200 
slightly better ride and also a better
gearing<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:41.219> ticket<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.670> actually<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.030> great

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
gearing the ticket is actually a great

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.360 
gearing the ticket is actually a great
machine<00:00:42.360> okay<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.110> for<00:00:43.469> example<00:00:43.860> if<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.129> can

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
machine okay so for example if you can

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.619 
machine okay so for example if you can
bring<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.760> into<00:00:45.030> your<00:00:45.120> office<00:00:45.420> usually

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
bring this into your office usually

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.150 
bring this into your office usually
that's<00:00:45.750> most<00:00:46.020> difficult<00:00:46.379> places<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.800> office

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
that's most difficult places the office

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.220 
that's most difficult places the office
if<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.879> can<00:00:48.000> bring<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> office<00:00:48.870> then

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
if you can bring this in the office then

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.529 
if you can bring this in the office then
this<00:00:49.410> would<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> funerai<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.239> reason

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
this would be a funerai and the reason

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.350 
this would be a funerai and the reason
behind<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.110> couple<00:00:52.500> first<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.219> all<00:00:53.370> other

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
behind it is couple first of all other

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.819 
behind it is couple first of all other
than<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.629> frame<00:00:54.899> everything<00:00:55.289> else<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.739> a

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
than the frame everything else is a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.170 
than the frame everything else is a
standard<00:00:56.219> bike<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.910> left<00:00:58.250> like<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> proprietary

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
standard bike so left like a proprietary

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.180 
standard bike so left like a proprietary
parts<00:01:00.660> like<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.109> bump<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.039> do

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
parts like on the bump and so you do

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.770 
parts like on the bump and so you do
like<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.370> be<00:01:02.579> missing<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.940> derailleur<00:01:03.420> you

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
like a be missing of derailleur you

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.969 
like a be missing of derailleur you
can't<00:01:03.960> want<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.140> get<00:01:04.229> up<00:01:04.350> from<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.619> bottom

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
can't want to get up from a bottom

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.740 
can't want to get up from a bottom
dealer<00:01:05.250> where's<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.000> standardized<00:01:06.479> pot

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
dealer where's it's a standardized pot

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.179 
dealer where's it's a standardized pot
so<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:06.990> can<00:01:07.110> break<00:01:07.260> down<00:01:07.439> anywhere<00:01:07.890> they<00:01:08.130> can

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
so it can break down anywhere they can

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.550 
so it can break down anywhere they can
can<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:08.520> fixed<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.960> also<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.320> quick

release that you can take off the take

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.880 
release that you can take off the take

that we offer you get a flat which is a
lot<00:01:14.040> easier<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.490> deal<00:01:14.640> with<00:01:14.850> okay<00:01:15.060> all

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
lot easier to deal with okay all

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.370 
lot easier to deal with okay all
standardized<00:01:17.420> parts<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.720> also<00:01:19.110> has

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
standardized parts and also has

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.770 
standardized parts and also has
adjustability<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.880> front<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
adjustability on the front so the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.969 
adjustability on the front so the
Brompton<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.350> example<00:01:22.770> there's<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> very

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
Brompton for example there's a very

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.249 
Brompton for example there's a very
limited<00:01:23.369> adjustability<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> only

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
limited adjustability so just the only

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.810 
limited adjustability so just the only
place<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.619> know<00:01:25.710> justices<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.369> seat<00:01:26.580> height

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
place you know justices the seat height

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.880 
place you know justices the seat height
and<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.210> seat<00:01:27.450> moving<00:01:27.900> front<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.500> back<00:01:28.650> that's

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
and a seat moving front and back that's

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.499 
and a seat moving front and back that's
only<00:01:29.159> if<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.400> change<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.939> Brompton<00:01:30.180> see

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
only if you change the Brompton see

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.510 
only if you change the Brompton see
where<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> bike<00:01:31.380> party<00:01:31.770> has<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> capability<00:01:32.189> to

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
where the bike party has a capability to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.910 
where the bike party has a capability to
change<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.000> mean<00:01:33.210> adjusting<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.930> seat<00:01:34.170> forward

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
change I mean adjusting the seat forward

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.160 
change I mean adjusting the seat forward
backwards<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:35.939> change<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> stem<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.900> so

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
backwards you can change the stem and so

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.530
