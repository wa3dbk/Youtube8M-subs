00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.569
 united at lipstick I have sent 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.170
 today a do it yourself for you though 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.599
 before I say what it's about, I wanted 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.820
 a little more about this action here 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.289
 Report it was just one 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.260
 Magnolia series quite a few girls and 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.580
 guys do the row calls themselves 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.970
 we may already have the title in that 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.400
 could be terribly nice and yes what me 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.109
 because the waiting will be interesting but their 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.880
 can also like and in the infobox on 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.860
 click on the magnolia link 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.380
 there will be once again all the videos 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.340
 summarized on the page 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.910
 so that you are always informed 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.420
 and none of the great videos 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:52.289
 contrary I start today with one 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.949
 the heart of the subject and I have 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.750
 I really found the courage thanks to you 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.370
 to carry a dozen because I have me 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.739
 I really never dared to do well 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.300
 except at home because I have a total 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.760
 problem with my ears but there you have to 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.240
 you can not do anything and I love it 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.750
 Yes, I like to live cheesy and 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:16.939
 princess has and disney moderately and yes 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.939
 so I thought I show you 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.970
 book loop so there I am 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.170
 little problem with grinding and me 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.640
 would have given me a bit five pieces in the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:34.290
 made hair but I show you here 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.740
 we can do this loop and that 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.299
 we make the sold out wendt 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.869
 wanted to know how does stone work 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.869
 stay tuned 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.860
 So, let's start, as we already did 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.740
 Ever said a tie for it 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.140
 cloud your father's friend 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.200
 i have my group all buys the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.600
 quite a few colors to choose from exactly 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.150
 then just look how big how wide 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.590
 I would like to have the loop 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.920
 a little bit and then cut that 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.180
 simply at the desired location 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.580
 you think that the characters in front 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.830
 a little wider than the back I have 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.220
 now just solved the seam and have 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.720
 the simply with hot glue gun so 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.640
 collapsed and glued that to it 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.960
 is about the same width is now both 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.780
 just finish with the 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.270
 hot glue gun together and try 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.120
 then you can easily grind form 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.150
 world think that the syringe hides 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.980
 it me that looks you out there 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.270
 those really in the middle are him 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.940
 then again the rest of the tie 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.160
 and makes that a loop around it 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.320
 the loop a bend if you 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.200
 said it then simply cuts it 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.090
 also again and before then 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.810
 glue that together 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.370
 really the grind shape you have 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.170
 really so it really was for me 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.540
 the hardest part of the whole 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.930
 getting a shape is needed 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.760
 man exercise but I think you get 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.890
 It definitely looks in copy then 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.630
 Everything is really stuck together 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.760
 so that does not form the whole 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.230
 more now triggers a few 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.310
 then we make corrections 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.470
 actually not so good either 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.750
 I have finished with the idea 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.459
 found such snakes 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.730
 I just stick it again 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.830
 Hot cancer cells and ebola and 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.019
 I thought so when I went for it 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.550
 tinker wind Doing something different and 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.220
 Although I have made a white 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.720
 a few city stone decorated or me 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.790
 I just have a normal clasp 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.450
 taken there just leftover stone 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.910
 about with life 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.280
 tinkering fever bahr also looks very 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.120
 beautiful from the far off and the tail 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.580
 blue just 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.480
 I hope you liked that many 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.410
 I am very much fun to tinker 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.970
