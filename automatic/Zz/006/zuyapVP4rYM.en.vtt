00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.469
 good morning to all the boys today we are 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:18.300
 with our trusty nexus 4 to make you 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:22.560
 see a new resulting application 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.060
 from the motorola moto hicks then this is 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.779
 a camera that as you can see 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.179
 it is not exactly the classic of 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.270
 nexus 4 but this one here 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.270
 camera of the motion hicks we go immediately 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.320
 to see the tutorials that explain the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.430
 operation of this new one 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.210
 application time anywhere all caf 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.800
 or transformed polk shops so it will be enough 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.930
 a simple tap on the screen for per 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.770
 capture our photo as it will suffice 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:59.390
 hold your finger on the screen 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.390
 to have multiple shots 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.159
 sorry drive to well down to zoom then 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.260
 it will be enough to make a slide up not sly in 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.930
 low to adjust the zoom will do 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.360
 a swipe on each side for the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.759
 settings and the gallery 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.530
 as you can see we have this circle here 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.360
 on the side where there are all the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.290
 settings not all working after 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.240
 have of rho 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.220
 in detail while you see here opens the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.380
 gallery now this was test photos 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.460
 that I had previously done 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.159
 let's go back to ours 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.170
 camera as you see we also have the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.350
 possibility of front camera 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:49.159
 even if it's a bit jerky, you want it 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:52.940
 see the camera is still not very good 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:56.380
 front while we should n't 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:00.470
 for mode problems 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:06.260
 video recording you can see goes 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:09.110
 fine the kind of problem but 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.570
 we see the settings in them 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.590
 totality then the hdr does not work not 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:20.180
 it is really clickable not to be active 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.870
 flash instead it is settable his car on and 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.680
 off 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.540
 no problem here we have the 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.330
 touch to focus because as we said 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.970
 first to take the picture 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.900
 just tap anywhere on the 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.990
 screen 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.640
 enabling this setting we will have the 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.400
 possibility to focus the part 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.310
 tapped with me I turned it off because it didn't 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:48.320
 I like that I am one more for the 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.570
 quick shots so I have this one for you 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.120
 already shown slow motion is not 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:58.070
 can be activated as hdr even papabile 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.010
 the panorama mode is activated but in 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.100
 moment of shooting 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.820
 the crush application so we will have to 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.820
 reopen 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.489
 we have the possibility to geotag the 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.709
 our photos to silence the camera 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.890
 is the possibility of a quick capture 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.020
 but I haven't tried it yet but not 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.200
 works independently of evening 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:28.310
 then we activate or deactivate it 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.350
 now I keep it deactivated is one 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.830
 camera that as you can see then yes 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.980
 also based on the gallery 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:41.600
 even if it's not very well implemented 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.860
 now I went out by mistake and it is 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.510
 installable on practically any 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.310
 device 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:51.170
 I find myself between pk thanks to the colleagues of 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.910
 androidpolice.com soon we will have to do it 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.800
 an article about it so you can 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.850
 also find on our site 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.130
 the apk of a camera that is not in 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.050
 place the camera stokr to you 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:07.480
 see that the camera in the nexus is 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.810
 remained the same 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.430
 you can see why the application 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.250
 if I'm not mistaken it's called com punta 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.930
 motorola precisely room then in the case 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.950
 where you don't have a motorola you won't have 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.930
 problems in this regard 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.270
 in the case instead you are of the motorola us 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.250
 it will be a little bit more 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.110
 complicated to install this 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.760
 camera that I especially recommend 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.550
 the steps of being nexus for that 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.170
 implements the book shop then the click 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.850
 to a multiple than on the camera of 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:39.980
 nexus initially is not has not been 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.620
 implemented somehow in the future therefore for 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.930
 now from the earth a bit to try these 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.760
 these multiple shots even if the 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.340
 camera as an application not yet 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.000
 a greeting to all is very complete from 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.000
 tone
