is this teasing come and yeah I think
it's<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.509> communal<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.500> stiff<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.700> lot

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
it's just a communal a stiff and a lot

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.480 
it's just a communal a stiff and a lot
of<00:01:32.909> bristles<00:01:33.479> right<00:01:33.720> here<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.369> have

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
of bristles right here you can you have

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.160 
of bristles right here you can you have
to<00:01:35.610> steal<00:01:35.850> at<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.000> back<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.659> use<00:01:36.990> this

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
to steal at the back you can use this

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.289 
to steal at the back you can use this
for<00:01:37.380> teasing<00:01:37.710> for<00:01:38.340> parting<00:01:38.790> your<00:01:38.939> hair<00:01:39.000> and

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
for teasing for parting your hair and

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.690

I think just everyone should have
something<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.880> yeah<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:45.930> think

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
something like this so yeah I just think

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.700

lot of

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.349 
lot of
hair<00:02:05.740> clips<00:02:06.009> my<00:02:06.189> hair<00:02:06.429> there's<00:02:06.670> actually<00:02:07.149> use

hair clips my hair there's actually use
a<00:02:07.390> looking<00:02:07.780> discreet<00:02:08.140> so<00:02:08.289> very<00:02:08.500> good<00:02:08.739> I<00:02:08.890> use

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
a looking discreet so very good I use

just for the weekend because i think

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.350

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
they're in general short here so we have

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.819 
they're in general short here so we have
short<00:03:01.540> they<00:03:01.750> are<00:03:01.870> definitely<00:03:02.140> recommend

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
short they are definitely recommend

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.979 
short they are definitely recommend
getting<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.280> small<00:03:03.670> one<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:04.420> if<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:04.810> win

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.869 
getting a small one and if you win
you're<00:03:05.200> just<00:03:05.560> lucky<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.250> have<00:03:06.400> one<00:03:06.549> of<00:03:06.579> these

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
you're just lucky and have one of these

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.199 
you're just lucky and have one of these
and<00:03:07.299> you<00:03:08.170> know<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:08.709> turn<00:03:09.099> you<00:03:09.880> turn<00:03:10.060> it<00:03:10.180> down

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
and you know you turn you turn it down

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.879 
and you know you turn you turn it down
here<00:03:10.569> at<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.720> inside<00:03:11.079> there<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.380> no<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.799> know

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
here at the inside there is no you know

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.800 
here at the inside there is no you know
temperature<00:03:12.579> like<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.850> regulation<00:03:13.450> anything

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
temperature like a regulation anything

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.150 
temperature like a regulation anything
like<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:13.959> because<00:03:14.230> it's<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.560> very<00:03:14.709> simple<00:03:14.859> one

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
like that because it's a very simple one

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.449 
like that because it's a very simple one
I<00:03:15.370> think<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.389> heats<00:03:16.630> up<00:03:16.750> quite<00:03:17.109> quick<00:03:17.440> like<00:03:18.220> for

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
I think it heats up quite quick like for

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.430 
I think it heats up quite quick like for
such<00:03:18.639> a<00:03:18.670> small<00:03:18.880> one<00:03:19.239> but<00:03:19.389> maybe<00:03:19.630> because<00:03:20.200> it's

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
such a small one but maybe because it's

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.000 
such a small one but maybe because it's
so<00:03:20.590> small<00:03:20.620> things<00:03:21.130> up<00:03:21.310> pretty<00:03:21.489> fast<00:03:22.329> and<00:03:23.010> it's

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
so small things up pretty fast and it's

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.120 
so small things up pretty fast and it's
also<00:03:24.430> cools<00:03:24.880> out<00:03:25.180> loud<00:03:25.510> for<00:03:26.410> such<00:03:26.829> a<00:03:26.859> long<00:03:27.069> time

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
also cools out loud for such a long time

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.190 
also cools out loud for such a long time
