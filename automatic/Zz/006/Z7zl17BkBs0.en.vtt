00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.549
 far 2012 when she started 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.720
 develop sickly demand for smartphones 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:07.770
 began to appear dozens of new 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.500
 manufacturers 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.799
 such as magic star and on every corner 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.049
 sold an exact copy of the iPhone 4d 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.420
 and everyone tried to win their niche in 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.699
 the market for budget smartphones is there 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.980
 budget really cheap and what 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.340
 do you have to order how not to buy a cat 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.130
 in a bag or not how not to buy nokia 3110 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.369
 in the iPhone and you notice it on the shelf 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.559
 already familiar flight inscription does not look like 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.350
 he is nothing and the price is small if 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.230
 in short about how fly saved the company 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.379
 Thousands of lost smartphone knife arias 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.780
 here is our time you have 200 dollars and 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.570
 You want to buy not just a smartphone 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.820
 beautiful smartphone and so not so 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.760
 like everything and so that the words were cool 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.789
 octa core lcd type ips gorilla glass 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.800
 what to do fly tornado one is the one 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.439
 phone from which you test 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.520
 euphoria just looking at him looking at 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:13.650
 him otherwise then again on him and on check 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.900
 on the check and on it let's postpone the check 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.580
 and look at the detail without looking 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.640
 on the front panel do you understand what 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.950
 designer inspired with his sony xperia 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.500
 somehow there but still bevels on the back 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.100
 panels add some sophistication 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.590
 whether 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.619
 the front panel is perfect 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.990
 black there are no icon labels or 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.090
 control buttons looks very 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.579
 looks spectacular and very cool 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.799
 The table is collected all very strong holding in 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.680
 hand does not leave a sense of solidity 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.759
 although bevels in the corners are not very nice 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.970
 cut fingers 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.369
 although in fact it is difficult to imagine bevels 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.439
 which will be nice to cut your fingers 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.810
 front and rear glass is 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.020
 protective and that's just the front 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.750
 dragon tail and back gorilla voice from 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.820
 What did this arrangement choose? 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.730
 incomprehensible even the opinion that the dragon 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.280
 tayl pro 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.130
 and maybe even so, but there is 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.780
 large but oleophobic coating or 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.120
 completely absent or very 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.030
 poor quality and because wipe 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.760
 prints but extremely difficult in contrast 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.220
 from the back of the screen unlocking everything 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.650
 similarly noticeable sony notes but not 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.030
 Immediately you can understand what's wrong with the screen 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.080
 because the resolution is 1280 by 720 pixels and you 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.680
 you see clearly 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.960
 pixels and noise it turns out someone just 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.310
 did not bother to put in the firmware 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.650
 high-quality picture and 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.690
 preloaded chatty Persians just 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.880
 disgusting quality but if not 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.800
 they we would hardly have noticed how bad 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.860
 given api look around cope with 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.360
 black and blue but fades when 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.190
 the smallest angle 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.560
 but if you put a light saver 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.750
 this effect is almost invisible even 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.910
 the screen now appears at times clearer and 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.820
 more colorful in a tornado bath set 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.590
 almost pure android 4 4 2 of 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.030
 differences notice perhaps that function 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.160
 gesture recognition 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.230
 with which you can ask 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.300
 launch any application 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.150
 certain pattern on the locked 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.630
 the screen but the response to it is painful 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.630
 long 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.110
 but the presence of a double screen 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.180
 Tapu is a big plus budget 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.550
 device buttons under the screen as it was 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.980
 said before have no badges and 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.500
 when illuminated, also only 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.450
 points without any designation not 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.790
 I think this is a minus or a plus 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.330
 it's just that this chip is all because 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.950
 2012 remember who is responsible for what 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.690
 on top of the screen there is a diode for 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.600
 new event alerts or 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.850
 messages and this diode let's face it 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.660
 weakling he will make you look all 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.600
 notifications 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.730
 otherwise he will fall out your eyes yes and he does not 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.830
 stop flashing until you completely 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.209
 clear all new notifications 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.610
 performance second feature 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.650
 because of which it is worth paying attention to 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.950
 This device is installed here. 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.650
 newest eight-core mt 6592 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.660
 and one gigabyte of RAM in antutu it 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.280
 gaining 27 thousand points 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.530
 perhaps a record for this price 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.359
 level but still a graphics accelerator 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.549
 mali 450 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.799
 so performance in games is not always 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.800
 highest for example wot blitz 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.040
 graphics quality is average or even low 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.300
 and fps keeps at 37 42 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.760
 but asphalt 8 goes to the maximum 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.560
 graphics settings with subtle 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.750
 subsidence me and despite all this 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.120
 performance competition to him 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.740
 perhaps only zenfone 5 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.710
 sound quality is mediocre enough 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.260
 and like many manufacturers lower 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.229
 the placement of the dynamics of the fly was not crowned 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.330
 success low frequencies are barely audible a lot 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.510
 high and virtually absent 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.590
 1920 medium battery 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.320
 milliampere hours 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.390
 that for such a diagonal is very small 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.910
 but thin and not convex design 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.190
 dictated his terms yet put on 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.080
 high load it is enough 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.360
 my impressions of the camera end 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.400
 testing I could not add up 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.830
 manufacturer's statement installed 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.960
 at 13 megapixels and a lot of lenses and and 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.479
 the quality should be excellent with any 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.880
 shooting conditions in practice by day 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:21.490
 good lighting is enough 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.440
 good pictures but definitely they are 13 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.660
 megapixel size photos 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.120
 unequivocally interpolates in the bad 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.070
 lighting so generally some 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.870
 abnormal phenomena when hovering on 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.880
 subject and focus 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.350
 you see a good picture but when 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.360
 camera takes a picture 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.250
 intervenes whether some sober 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.530
 algorithms either a deranged balance 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.840
 white and the pictures are noisy and 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.970
 Wrong color correction is even worse 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.919
 when flash fires in one word 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.780
 left the idea that the same programmer 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.210
 who could not download quality 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.729
 pictures in the firmware could not and bring to 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.800
 crazy enough quality camera there 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:59.050
 proverb as a ship you call it so 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.000
 float and probably this proverb 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.599
 especially relevant in the world of mobile 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 industries 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:06.550
 After all, quite recently a fly phoenix came out and 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.229
 showed that fly didn't die in 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.720
 attempts to break through at least some 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.910
 the market and is able to compete for the market 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.949
 budget segment tornado van same 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.770
 bursts in like a fresh breeze in design 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:20.139
 shovel which and say nothing special and 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.389
 shows how you can make beautiful and 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:24.729
 powerful smartphone let not for the most 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:27.130
 small but unequivocally and things are small 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:29.449
 money is a certain chagrin of course it does not 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.550
 very high quality display and 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:32.779
 me by their camera algorithm but again 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.449
 looking at the check 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:38.059
 do you understand what more to expect for such 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:41.330
 money just can not imagine can not name 

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:41.839
 fly tornado van best state employees 2014 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.389
 of the year 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:47.240
 but I can definitely call him the most 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:50.139
 beautiful budget 2014 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.139
 and I have everything
