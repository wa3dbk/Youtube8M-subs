alright so this snapshot is going to be
rather<00:00:20.060> quick<00:00:20.420> there<00:00:20.810> really<00:00:21.320> wasn't<00:00:21.560> a<00:00:21.710> lot

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:21.829 
rather quick there really wasn't a lot

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:23.109 
rather quick there really wasn't a lot
of<00:00:21.860> changes<00:00:22.310> we're<00:00:22.430> gonna<00:00:22.550> be<00:00:22.669> talking<00:00:22.820> about

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
of changes we're gonna be talking about

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.780 
of changes we're gonna be talking about
the<00:00:23.329> beacons<00:00:23.750> first<00:00:24.140> now<00:00:24.919> they<00:00:25.369> have<00:00:25.520> a<00:00:25.550> bigger

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:25.790 
the beacons first now they have a bigger

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.420 
the beacons first now they have a bigger
range<00:00:26.119> which<00:00:26.630> is<00:00:26.779> amazing<00:00:27.169> because<00:00:27.680> we<00:00:28.310> can

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
range which is amazing because we can

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.769 
range which is amazing because we can
use<00:00:28.550> all<00:00:28.700> the<00:00:28.730> space<00:00:29.000> we<00:00:29.029> can<00:00:29.180> get<00:00:29.480> with<00:00:29.630> those

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
use all the space we can get with those

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.510 
use all the space we can get with those
things<00:00:29.989> they're<00:00:30.380> hard<00:00:30.529> enough<00:00:30.739> to<00:00:30.890> get<00:00:31.340> in<00:00:31.460> the

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
things they're hard enough to get in the

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.360 
things they're hard enough to get in the
first<00:00:31.730> place<00:00:32.170> so<00:00:33.170> to<00:00:33.230> start<00:00:33.500> off<00:00:33.710> the<00:00:34.100> first

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
first place so to start off the first

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.720 
first place so to start off the first
layer<00:00:34.700> was<00:00:35.180> um<00:00:35.660> old<00:00:36.320> diameter<00:00:36.980> was<00:00:37.160> thirty

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
layer was um old diameter was thirty

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.280 
layer was um old diameter was thirty
three<00:00:38.090> blocks<00:00:38.390> now<00:00:39.170> it<00:00:39.620> is<00:00:39.760> 41<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:41.660> second<00:00:42.110> one

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
three blocks now it is 41 the second one

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.500 
three blocks now it is 41 the second one
was<00:00:43.810> old<00:00:44.810> old<00:00:45.260> diameter<00:00:46.160> was<00:00:46.340> 49<00:00:46.910> blocks<00:00:47.210> now

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
was old old diameter was 49 blocks now

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.300 
was old old diameter was 49 blocks now
is<00:00:47.720> 61<00:00:48.320> blocks<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:49.370> third<00:00:49.610> layer<00:00:50.170> is<00:00:51.310> 65

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
is 61 blocks the third layer is 65

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.690 
is 61 blocks the third layer is 65
blocks<00:00:52.670> for<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.000> old<00:00:53.210> range<00:00:53.860> 8181<00:00:54.860> for<00:00:55.520> this

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
blocks for the old range 8181 for this

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.670 
blocks for the old range 8181 for this
pyramid<00:00:56.180> right<00:00:56.360> here<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:56.810> then<00:00:57.290> the<00:00:57.410> big

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
pyramid right here and then the big

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.100 
pyramid right here and then the big
block<00:00:58.010> which<00:00:58.820> was<00:00:59.060> they<00:00:59.390> basically<00:00:59.750> kind<00:00:59.990> of

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
block which was they basically kind of

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.140 
block which was they basically kind of
moved<00:01:00.410> it<00:01:00.530> up<00:01:00.650> and<00:01:00.860> then<00:01:01.100> so<00:01:01.340> this<00:01:01.520> old<00:01:01.790> one<00:01:02.000> was

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
moved it up and then so this old one was

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.390 
moved it up and then so this old one was
81<00:01:02.720> and<00:01:02.870> now<00:01:02.990> this<00:01:03.200> is<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.380> hundred<00:01:03.950> in<00:01:04.100> one

81 and now this is a hundred in one

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.179 
81 and now this is a hundred in one
block<00:01:04.820> diameter<00:01:05.479> which<00:01:06.140> is<00:01:06.350> about<00:01:06.619> 50<00:01:07.040> on<00:01:07.159> each

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
block diameter which is about 50 on each

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.709 
block diameter which is about 50 on each
side<00:01:07.579> and<00:01:07.850> that<00:01:08.360> is<00:01:08.509> amazing<00:01:08.960> I<00:01:09.710> love<00:01:10.249> it

planning<00:01:18.619> to<00:01:18.770> everybody<00:01:19.249> was<00:01:19.490> giving<00:01:19.789> it<00:01:19.909> so

00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:20.179 
planning to everybody was giving it so

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:22.660 
planning to everybody was giving it so
we'll<00:01:20.749> go<00:01:20.840> ahead<00:01:20.929> and<00:01:21.020> do<00:01:21.200> this<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:21.679> ok<00:01:22.460> so

we'll go ahead and do this and ok so

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.510 
we'll go ahead and do this and ok so
first<00:01:23.030> one<00:01:23.319> actually<00:01:24.319> I<00:01:24.710> guess<00:01:25.039> I<00:01:25.159> would<00:01:25.310> need

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
first one actually I guess I would need

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.249 
first one actually I guess I would need
a<00:01:25.579> button<00:01:26.030> I<00:01:26.240> guess<00:01:26.509> if<00:01:26.659> a<00:01:26.780> redstone<00:01:27.139> torch

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
a button I guess if a redstone torch

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.859 
a button I guess if a redstone torch
wouldn't<00:01:27.710> really<00:01:27.829> work<00:01:28.130> all<00:01:29.119> right<00:01:29.179> button<00:01:29.749> it

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
wouldn't really work all right button it

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.649 
wouldn't really work all right button it
is<00:01:30.020> so<00:01:30.530> previously<00:01:30.859> this<00:01:31.310> took<00:01:31.579> about<00:01:31.819> seven

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
is so previously this took about seven

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:40.449 
is so previously this took about seven
pieces<00:01:33.530> of<00:01:33.829> bone<00:01:34.009> meal<00:01:36.459> 1<00:01:37.459> 2<00:01:38.359> 3<00:01:39.069> so<00:01:40.069> takes<00:01:40.280> about

00:01:40.449 --> 00:01:40.459 
pieces of bone meal 1 2 3 so takes about

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:42.520 
pieces of bone meal 1 2 3 so takes about
three<00:01:40.819> pieces<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.450> we<00:01:41.780> can<00:01:41.929> try<00:01:42.229> this<00:01:42.289> a

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
three pieces and we can try this a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.800 
three pieces and we can try this a
couple<00:01:42.799> times<00:01:42.950> here<00:01:43.490> because<00:01:44.299> sometimes<00:01:44.659> it

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
couple times here because sometimes it

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.389 
couple times here because sometimes it
actually<00:01:44.929> does<00:01:45.289> range<00:01:45.649> you<00:01:45.979> can<00:01:46.009> get<00:01:46.310> away

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
actually does range you can get away

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.069 
actually does range you can get away
with<00:01:46.670> two<00:01:46.789> sometimes<00:01:47.270> sometimes<00:01:47.689> you<00:01:47.840> can<00:01:47.990> get

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
with two sometimes sometimes you can get

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.440 
with two sometimes sometimes you can get
away<00:01:48.200> with<00:01:48.409> three<00:01:48.709> to<00:01:51.459> thirty<00:01:52.459> so<00:01:52.759> most<00:01:53.329> of<00:01:53.389> the

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
away with three to thirty so most of the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.469 
away with three to thirty so most of the
time<00:01:53.659> it's<00:01:53.840> three<00:01:54.639> ok<00:01:55.639> let's<00:01:55.880> let's<00:01:56.240> try

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
time it's three ok let's let's try

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.649 
time it's three ok let's let's try
another<00:01:56.749> piece<00:01:57.170> of<00:01:57.380> block<00:01:58.009> here<00:01:58.279> let<00:01:58.459> me<00:01:58.659> there

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
another piece of block here let me there

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.359 
another piece of block here let me there
we<00:01:59.749> go<00:01:59.869> and<00:02:00.079> so<00:02:00.409> this<00:02:00.560> time<00:02:00.709> we<00:02:00.920> will<00:02:01.069> try<00:02:03.369> we'll

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
we go and so this time we will try we'll

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.899 
we go and so this time we will try we'll
try<00:02:04.399> like<00:02:05.149> wheat<00:02:05.840> or<00:02:06.109> no<00:02:06.439> will<00:02:06.619> try<00:02:06.829> melon<00:02:07.399> ok

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
try like wheat or no will try melon ok

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.180 
try like wheat or no will try melon ok
let's<00:02:08.209> from<00:02:08.360> melon<00:02:08.660> there<00:02:09.440> we<00:02:09.530> go<00:02:09.679> so

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
let's from melon there we go so

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.150 
let's from melon there we go so
previously<00:02:10.729> this<00:02:11.240> took<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.780> couple<00:02:12.770> pieces<00:02:13.010> of

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
previously this took a couple pieces of

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.650 
previously this took a couple pieces of
bone<00:02:13.400> meal<00:02:13.610> as<00:02:13.730> well<00:02:14.980> so<00:02:15.980> too<00:02:16.360> so<00:02:17.360> now<00:02:17.540> you're

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
bone meal as well so too so now you're

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.809 
bone meal as well so too so now you're
looking<00:02:18.080> at<00:02:18.230> about

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
looking at about

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.390 
looking at about
three<00:02:19.120> again<00:02:19.569> to<00:02:19.749> get<00:02:19.900> full<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:20.859> the<00:02:21.010> bone<00:02:21.159> meal

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
three again to get full so the bone meal

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.729 
three again to get full so the bone meal
overall<00:02:21.999> was<00:02:22.299> about<00:02:22.540> three<00:02:22.930> steps<00:02:23.230> we're<00:02:23.560> also

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
overall was about three steps we're also

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.399 
overall was about three steps we're also
going<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.099> test<00:02:24.310> out<00:02:24.489> on<00:02:24.639> a<00:02:24.730> tree<00:02:25.030> as<00:02:25.150> well<00:02:25.420> last

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
going to test out on a tree as well last

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.500 
going to test out on a tree as well last
time<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.709> was<00:02:26.739> only<00:02:26.950> two<00:02:27.249> so<00:02:27.609> that<00:02:27.939> is<00:02:28.150> not<00:02:28.480> a

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
time it was only two so that is not a

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.750 
time it was only two so that is not a
bad<00:02:28.989> change<00:02:29.560> but<00:02:30.159> let's<00:02:30.310> see<00:02:30.459> what<00:02:30.489> it<00:02:30.670> does

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
bad change but let's see what it does

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.110 
bad change but let's see what it does
old<00:02:30.939> trees<00:02:31.269> now<00:02:31.889> take<00:02:32.889> that<00:02:33.129> jump<00:02:33.639> on<00:02:33.909> this

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
old trees now take that jump on this

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.280 
old trees now take that jump on this
plane<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:34.959> tree<00:02:35.230> down<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:37.750> it's<00:02:37.930> definitely

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
plane the tree down so it's definitely

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.780 
plane the tree down so it's definitely
still<00:02:38.500> too<00:02:38.709> for<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.010> tree<00:02:39.280> which<00:02:39.489> I<00:02:39.730> don't

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
still too for the tree which I don't

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.780 
still too for the tree which I don't
really<00:02:40.090> mind<00:02:40.620> but<00:02:41.620> yet<00:02:41.799> so<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.250> bone<00:02:42.400> meal<00:02:42.609> did

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
really mind but yet so the bone meal did

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.270 
really mind but yet so the bone meal did
get<00:02:42.879> an<00:02:42.969> update<00:02:43.299> now<00:02:43.329> it's<00:02:43.840> basically<00:02:44.769> three

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
get an update now it's basically three

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.610 
get an update now it's basically three
for<00:02:45.579> any<00:02:45.730> plants<00:02:46.359> and<00:02:46.599> still<00:02:46.989> too<00:02:47.230> for<00:02:47.500> any

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
for any plants and still too for any

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.770 
for any plants and still too for any
trees<00:02:47.980> alright<00:02:48.969> so<00:02:49.150> if<00:02:49.299> you<00:02:49.389> look<00:02:49.599> in<00:02:49.749> your

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
trees alright so if you look in your

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.229 
trees alright so if you look in your
inventory<00:02:50.530> under<00:02:50.829> the<00:02:51.250> decoration<00:02:51.909> blocks

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
inventory under the decoration blocks

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.059 
inventory under the decoration blocks
you<00:02:52.629> can<00:02:52.870> see<00:02:53.079> that<00:02:53.109> there's<00:02:53.469> a<00:02:53.530> snow<00:02:53.799> block

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
you can see that there's a snow block

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.610 
you can see that there's a snow block
you<00:02:54.669> can<00:02:54.849> actually<00:02:55.060> stack<00:02:55.689> these<00:02:55.989> pieces<00:02:56.290> of

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
you can actually stack these pieces of

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.830 
you can actually stack these pieces of
stone<00:02:56.889> snow<00:02:57.459> now<00:02:57.760> so<00:02:58.090> let's<00:02:58.359> let's<00:02:58.569> go<00:02:58.750> ahead

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
stone snow now so let's let's go ahead

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.770 
stone snow now so let's let's go ahead
and<00:02:58.930> do<00:02:59.079> this<00:02:59.199> here<00:02:59.439> so<00:03:00.189> two<00:03:01.469> three<00:03:03.449> four<00:03:04.449> and

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
and do this here so two three four and

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.459 
and do this here so two three four and
that<00:03:04.930> looks<00:03:05.109> like<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.319> half<00:03:05.620> slab<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.340> me<00:03:07.469> six

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:08.469 
that looks like a half slab to me six

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:10.979 
that looks like a half slab to me six
and<00:03:08.769> then<00:03:09.189> here<00:03:09.430> let's<00:03:09.639> get<00:03:09.909> a<00:03:10.150> full<00:03:10.449> block<00:03:10.719> out

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
and then here let's get a full block out

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:18.360 
and then here let's get a full block out
so<00:03:11.290> you<00:03:11.439> know<00:03:12.689> snow<00:03:13.689> there<00:03:14.169> we<00:03:14.260> go<00:03:16.829> seven<00:03:17.829> maybe

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
so you know snow there we go seven maybe

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.159 
so you know snow there we go seven maybe
the<00:03:18.549> next<00:03:18.699> one<00:03:18.909> that<00:03:19.659> looks<00:03:19.870> like<00:03:19.959> we<00:03:20.109> still

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
the next one that looks like we still

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.780 
the next one that looks like we still
got<00:03:20.409> one<00:03:20.739> or<00:03:20.889> two<00:03:21.040> more<00:03:21.219> to<00:03:21.370> go<00:03:22.829> this<00:03:23.829> is<00:03:24.340> going

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
got one or two more to go this is going

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.360 
got one or two more to go this is going
to<00:03:25.449> have<00:03:25.989> a<00:03:26.019> huge<00:03:26.470> effect<00:03:26.680> on<00:03:26.979> white<00:03:27.220> people

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
to have a huge effect on white people

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.789 
to have a huge effect on white people
build<00:03:27.790> now<00:03:28.060> it's<00:03:28.900> basically<00:03:29.199> like<00:03:29.379> steps

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
build now it's basically like steps

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.309 
build now it's basically like steps
that's<00:03:30.400> pretty<00:03:30.549> awesome<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.930> one<00:03:32.079> thing<00:03:32.199> I

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
that's pretty awesome the one thing I

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.050 
that's pretty awesome the one thing I
did<00:03:32.500> want<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.769> try<00:03:33.069> out<00:03:33.280> those<00:03:33.519> to<00:03:33.759> see<00:03:33.879> if<00:03:33.970> you

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
did want to try out those to see if you

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.349 
did want to try out those to see if you
could<00:03:34.209> actually<00:03:34.389> collect<00:03:35.049> this<00:03:35.319> snow

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
could actually collect this snow

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.170 
could actually collect this snow
otherwise<00:03:37.359> is<00:03:37.629> still<00:03:38.079> useless<00:03:38.379> to<00:03:38.680> us<00:03:39.180> there

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
otherwise is still useless to us there

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.179 
otherwise is still useless to us there
we<00:03:40.269> go<00:03:40.419> so<00:03:40.659> I'm<00:03:40.870> gonna<00:03:40.989> go<00:03:41.169> ahead<00:03:41.199> and<00:03:41.470> give

well<00:04:30.480> okay<00:04:31.410> um<00:04:31.590> so<00:04:32.430> obviously<00:04:33.060> I<00:04:33.150> want<00:04:33.420> to<00:04:33.570> do

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
well okay um so obviously I want to do

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.810 
well okay um so obviously I want to do
this<00:04:33.930> in<00:04:34.310> single-player<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.430> don't<00:04:35.700> really

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
this in single-player I don't really

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.030 
this in single-player I don't really
want<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.120> do<00:04:36.180> this<00:04:36.210> in<00:04:36.450> creative<00:04:36.960> first<00:04:37.770> let's

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
want to do this in creative first let's

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.470 
want to do this in creative first let's
a<00:04:38.220> time<00:04:38.910> set<00:04:39.240> 0<00:04:40.010> then<00:04:41.010> we<00:04:41.190> will<00:04:41.310> do<00:04:41.460> game<00:04:41.820> mode<00:04:42.180> I

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
a time set 0 then we will do game mode I

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.270 
a time set 0 then we will do game mode I
can't<00:04:42.750> see<00:04:42.960> anything<00:04:43.110> because<00:04:43.440> fraps<00:04:43.830> is<00:04:44.100> in

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
can't see anything because fraps is in

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.060 
can't see anything because fraps is in
the<00:04:44.400> way<00:04:44.550> so<00:04:44.610> I'm<00:04:44.850> probably<00:04:44.970> typing<00:04:45.510> it<00:04:45.630> wrong

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
the way so I'm probably typing it wrong

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.000 
the way so I'm probably typing it wrong
game<00:04:47.070> mode<00:04:47.370> 0<00:04:48.140> okay<00:04:49.140> let's<00:04:49.470> go<00:04:49.590> ahead<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:49.800> give

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
game mode 0 okay let's go ahead and give

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.920 
game mode 0 okay let's go ahead and give
this<00:04:50.040> a<00:04:50.250> shot<00:04:50.280> first<00:04:51.210> we'll<00:04:51.330> try<00:04:51.540> it<00:04:51.570> with<00:04:51.810> the

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
this a shot first we'll try it with the

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.080 
this a shot first we'll try it with the
regular<00:04:52.320> one<00:04:52.590> so<00:04:53.010> regular<00:04:53.490> one<00:04:53.640> gave<00:04:53.850> us<00:04:54.000> a

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
regular one so regular one gave us a

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.000 
regular one so regular one gave us a
snowball<00:04:54.480> typical<00:04:54.900> we'll<00:04:55.590> try<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.770> cell

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
snowball typical we'll try the cell

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.870 
snowball typical we'll try the cell
touch<00:04:56.220> one<00:04:56.460> still<00:04:57.120> nothing<00:04:58.310> that<00:04:59.310> did<00:04:59.640> nothing

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
touch one still nothing that did nothing

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.290 
touch one still nothing that did nothing
at<00:05:00.210> all<00:05:00.360> and<00:05:00.630> we'll<00:05:00.750> try<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.050> shears<00:05:01.530> so<00:05:02.520> as<00:05:02.820> of

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
at all and we'll try the shears so as of

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.930 
at all and we'll try the shears so as of
right<00:05:03.360> now<00:05:03.630> I<00:05:03.870> don't<00:05:04.110> think<00:05:04.770> there<00:05:05.130> is<00:05:05.160> a<00:05:05.910> way

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
right now I don't think there is a way

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.010 
right now I don't think there is a way
to<00:05:06.330> collect<00:05:07.260> these<00:05:08.150> I'm<00:05:09.150> assuming<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:09.840> only

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
to collect these I'm assuming the only

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.630 
to collect these I'm assuming the only
way<00:05:10.169> you<00:05:10.230> could<00:05:10.500> get<00:05:10.620> them<00:05:10.770> to<00:05:10.800> stack<00:05:11.100> up<00:05:11.340> as<00:05:11.490> if

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
way you could get them to stack up as if

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.450 
way you could get them to stack up as if
by<00:05:12.060> making<00:05:12.480> it<00:05:12.630> snow<00:05:12.840> or<00:05:13.320> having<00:05:13.860> some<00:05:14.100> snow

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
by making it snow or having some snow

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.240 
by making it snow or having some snow
area<00:05:15.000> okay<00:05:15.780> so<00:05:15.840> I<00:05:16.020> wanted<00:05:16.320> to<00:05:16.380> try<00:05:16.500> this<00:05:16.710> out<00:05:17.010> as

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
area okay so I wanted to try this out as

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.220 
area okay so I wanted to try this out as
a<00:05:17.310> regular<00:05:18.270> world<00:05:18.450> too<00:05:18.780> so<00:05:18.930> what<00:05:19.050> we're<00:05:19.140> going

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
a regular world too so what we're going

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.350 
a regular world too so what we're going
to<00:05:19.320> do<00:05:19.440> is<00:05:19.530> we're<00:05:19.680> in<00:05:19.770> a<00:05:19.830> toggle<00:05:20.070> downfall<00:05:20.730> and

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
to do is we're in a toggle downfall and

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.880 
to do is we're in a toggle downfall and
since<00:05:21.630> we<00:05:21.780> are<00:05:21.810> in<00:05:21.960> snow<00:05:22.290> biome<00:05:22.470> it's<00:05:22.710> gonna

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
since we are in snow biome it's gonna

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.240 
since we are in snow biome it's gonna
start<00:05:23.070> snowing<00:05:23.250> and<00:05:23.730> I<00:05:24.480> kind<00:05:24.690> of<00:05:24.750> want<00:05:24.900> to<00:05:24.930> see

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
how long it's going to take if anything

how long it's going to take if anything
to<00:05:29.280> see<00:05:29.460> if<00:05:29.520> it's<00:05:29.640> going<00:05:29.790> to<00:05:29.850> stack<00:05:30.150> up<00:05:30.360> on<00:05:30.479> each

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630

these halves or these little snow blocks

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.170 
these halves or these little snow blocks
here<00:06:10.410> all<00:06:10.710> you've<00:06:11.070> got<00:06:11.310> to<00:06:11.340> do<00:06:11.580> is<00:06:11.820> go<00:06:12.000> into

here all you've got to do is go into

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.350 
here all you've got to do is go into
your<00:06:12.840> your<00:06:13.530> workbench<00:06:14.160> let<00:06:14.550> me<00:06:14.640> grab<00:06:14.880> gives

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
your your workbench let me grab gives

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.980 
your your workbench let me grab gives
himself<00:06:15.479> some<00:06:15.780> more<00:06:15.810> snow<00:06:16.400> take<00:06:17.400> 64<00:06:17.940> there<00:06:18.900> we

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
himself some more snow take 64 there we

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.930 
himself some more snow take 64 there we
go<00:06:19.140> and<00:06:19.350> you're<00:06:19.830> just<00:06:19.919> going<00:06:20.070> to<00:06:20.160> go<00:06:20.310> just<00:06:20.820> like

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
go and you're just going to go just like

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.300 
go and you're just going to go just like
this<00:06:21.470> and<00:06:22.470> it's<00:06:22.560> going<00:06:22.710> to<00:06:22.770> give<00:06:22.890> you<00:06:23.010> six

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
this and it's going to give you six

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.940 
this and it's going to give you six
pieces<00:06:23.550> of<00:06:23.820> snow<00:06:24.120> for<00:06:24.720> every<00:06:25.050> 3<00:06:25.440> that<00:06:25.650> you<00:06:25.800> lay

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
pieces of snow for every 3 that you lay

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.550 
pieces of snow for every 3 that you lay
down<00:06:25.979> and<00:06:26.520> this<00:06:27.419> is<00:06:27.600> how<00:06:27.750> you<00:06:27.780> would<00:06:28.200> collect

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
down and this is how you would collect

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.159 
down and this is how you would collect
your<00:06:28.710> snow<00:06:29.040> so<00:06:29.729> snow<00:06:30.030> actually<00:06:30.600> has<00:06:30.780> some

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
your snow so snow actually has some

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.380 
your snow so snow actually has some
pretty<00:06:31.500> cool<00:06:31.919> uses<00:06:32.340> now<00:06:32.760> you<00:06:33.330> can<00:06:33.539> do

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.390 
pretty cool uses now you can do

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.660 
pretty cool uses now you can do
I<00:06:34.450> would<00:06:35.290> imagine<00:06:35.500> some<00:06:35.890> pretty<00:06:36.100> cool<00:06:36.280> designs

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:36.670 
I would imagine some pretty cool designs

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.400 
I would imagine some pretty cool designs
with<00:06:36.880> this<00:06:37.060> just<00:06:37.270> like<00:06:37.480> just<00:06:37.840> by<00:06:37.960> looking<00:06:38.290> at

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.410 
with this just like just by looking at

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.430 
with this just like just by looking at
this<00:06:38.590> you<00:06:38.800> can<00:06:38.980> make<00:06:39.130> multi-layered<00:06:39.760> stairs

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
this you can make multi-layered stairs

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.740 
this you can make multi-layered stairs
you<00:06:41.440> can<00:06:41.590> build<00:06:41.860> stairs<00:06:42.130> up<00:06:42.430> way<00:06:42.820> slower<00:06:43.450> now

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750 
you can build stairs up way slower now

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.320 
you can build stairs up way slower now
so<00:06:44.110> I<00:06:44.440> mean<00:06:45.040> just<00:06:45.310> by<00:06:45.460> doing<00:06:45.520> this<00:06:45.880> we<00:06:46.090> walked

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
so I mean just by doing this we walked

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.930 
so I mean just by doing this we walked
up<00:06:46.450> a<00:06:46.540> quarter<00:06:46.840> of<00:06:46.870> a<00:06:46.990> block<00:06:47.610> so<00:06:48.610> just<00:06:48.790> remember

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:48.940 
up a quarter of a block so just remember

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.940 
up a quarter of a block so just remember
that<00:06:49.210> the<00:06:49.330> crafting<00:06:49.630> recipe<00:06:50.080> does<00:06:50.560> require

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:50.950 
that the crafting recipe does require

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.980 
that the crafting recipe does require
three<00:06:51.400> snow<00:06:51.610> blocks<00:06:51.910> I'm<00:06:52.450> actually<00:06:52.660> going<00:06:52.900> to

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:52.990 
three snow blocks I'm actually going to

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.070 
three snow blocks I'm actually going to
collect<00:06:53.200> snow<00:06:53.350> now<00:06:53.620> probably<00:06:53.970> so<00:06:55.080> that's

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 
collect snow now probably so that's

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.320 
collect snow now probably so that's
that's<00:06:56.380> really<00:06:56.710> gonna<00:06:56.830> do<00:06:57.040> it<00:06:57.070> for<00:06:57.400> the

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.330 
that's really gonna do it for the

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.230 
that's really gonna do it for the
snapshot<00:06:58.960> video<00:06:59.200> this<00:07:00.190> was<00:07:00.370> primarily<00:07:00.610> a

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 
your less of Minecraft with the bugs now

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.070 
your less of Minecraft with the bugs now
because<00:07:09.520> they<00:07:09.730> they<00:07:10.060> really<00:07:10.390> did<00:07:10.600> they<00:07:10.900> I

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 
because they they really did they I

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.220 
because they they really did they I
think<00:07:11.380> condensed<00:07:11.860> like<00:07:12.610> 20<00:07:13.150> bugs<00:07:13.450> I<00:07:13.720> think<00:07:13.990> so

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:14.230 
think condensed like 20 bugs I think so

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.690 
think condensed like 20 bugs I think so
they<00:07:14.440> did<00:07:14.650> a<00:07:14.680> really<00:07:14.890> good<00:07:15.040> job<00:07:15.100> of<00:07:15.280> that<00:07:15.490> so<00:07:15.550> I

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.700 
they did a really good job of that so I

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.160 
they did a really good job of that so I
