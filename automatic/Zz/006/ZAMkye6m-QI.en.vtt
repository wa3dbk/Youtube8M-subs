speed<00:00:12.480> we're<00:00:13.349> gonna<00:00:13.469> take<00:00:13.769> samples<00:00:14.280> here<00:00:14.519> from

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
speed we're gonna take samples here from

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.140 
speed we're gonna take samples here from
a<00:00:15.650> sea<00:00:16.650> rider<00:00:16.950> what<00:00:17.400> he's<00:00:17.550> doing<00:00:17.820> through<00:00:18.000> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
a sea rider what he's doing through the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.370 
a sea rider what he's doing through the
corner<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.070> a<00:00:20.070> good<00:00:20.730> B<00:00:20.970> rider<00:00:21.269> and<00:00:21.599> what<00:00:22.230> he's

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
corner and a good B rider and what he's

corner and a good B rider and what he's
doing<00:00:22.650> through<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.920> corner<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.519> hopefully

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
doing through the corner and hopefully

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.000 
doing through the corner and hopefully
that's<00:00:24.689> going<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.990> make<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.260> understand<00:00:25.800> some

that's going to make you understand some
things<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.429> you<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.699> work<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:27.380> so<00:00:28.380> here<00:00:28.560> we

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
have the C violet I reach he's from

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.410 
have the C violet I reach he's from
Bermuda<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.460> hope<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.730> had<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> lot<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.120> seat

Bermuda I hope you had a lot of seat
time<00:00:33.950> until<00:00:34.950> now<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.219> like<00:00:35.520> club<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> man<00:00:36.180> and

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
time until now I like club a man and

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.319 
time until now I like club a man and
when<00:00:37.559> he's<00:00:37.710> coming<00:00:38.040> into<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.280> corner<00:00:38.700> one<00:00:39.270> of

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
when he's coming into a corner one of

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.940 
when he's coming into a corner one of
the<00:00:39.390> things<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.870> notice<00:00:40.289> is<00:00:40.379> he's<00:00:40.559> taken

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the things you can notice is he's taken

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.830 
the things you can notice is he's taken
a<00:00:41.010> pretty<00:00:41.219> straight<00:00:41.700> line<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.360> corner

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
a pretty straight line and the corner

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.470 
a pretty straight line and the corner
not<00:00:42.989> sent<00:00:43.350> up<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> outside<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.789> then<00:00:45.329> at

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
not sent up on the outside and then at

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.779 
not sent up on the outside and then at
the<00:00:45.600> critical<00:00:46.050> transition<00:00:46.739> there's<00:00:46.949> a<00:00:47.039> lot<00:00:47.430> of

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
the critical transition there's a lot of

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.660 
the critical transition there's a lot of
hesitation<00:00:48.739> so<00:00:49.739> he<00:00:49.829> doesn't<00:00:50.129> really<00:00:50.280> carry<00:00:50.579> a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
hesitation so he doesn't really carry a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.990 
hesitation so he doesn't really carry a
speed<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.480> corner<00:00:51.899> here<00:00:52.609> you<00:00:53.609> can<00:00:53.789> see

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
speed to the corner here you can see

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.689 
speed to the corner here you can see
entering<00:00:54.899> from<00:00:55.170> inside<00:00:55.770> line<00:00:56.010> he<00:00:56.190> has<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.489> turn

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
entering from inside line he has to turn

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.430 
entering from inside line he has to turn
sharper<00:00:57.180> when<00:00:57.329> he<00:00:57.449> gets<00:00:57.629> into<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.989> corner<00:00:58.410> and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
sharper when he gets into the corner and

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.310 
sharper when he gets into the corner and
now<00:00:58.649> going<00:00:59.160> from<00:00:59.670> breaking<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.539> accelerating

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
now going from breaking to accelerating

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.650 
now going from breaking to accelerating
there's<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.559> big<00:01:02.039> hesitation<00:01:02.850> there<00:01:03.030> too<00:01:03.210> to

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
there's a big hesitation there too to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.350 
there's a big hesitation there too to
make<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.050> transition<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:06.000> here<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
make that transition and here on the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.270 
make that transition and here on the
other<00:01:06.480> hand<00:01:06.780> we're<00:01:06.960> going<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.320> trade

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
other hand we're going to have trade

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.820 
other hand we're going to have trade
green<00:01:08.640> has<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> good<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.480> rider<00:01:09.840> notice<00:01:10.620> how<00:01:10.770> he

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
green has a good be rider notice how he

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.060 
green has a good be rider notice how he
sets<00:01:11.190> up<00:01:11.460> from<00:01:12.120> the<00:01:12.270> outside<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.620> when<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.830> gets

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
sets up from the outside so when it gets

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.710 
sets up from the outside so when it gets
to<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.370> corner<00:01:14.640> he<00:01:14.790> doesn't<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.420> turn

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
to the corner he doesn't have to turn

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.480 
to the corner he doesn't have to turn
quite<00:01:16.440> as<00:01:16.620> sharp<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.440> carries<00:01:19.800> more<00:01:20.130> speed

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
quite as sharp and it carries more speed

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.200 
quite as sharp and it carries more speed
and<00:01:21.380> there's<00:01:22.380> not<00:01:22.620> much<00:01:22.890> as<00:01:23.130> hesitation<00:01:24.060> at

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
and there's not much as hesitation at

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.500 
and there's not much as hesitation at
all<00:01:24.330> at<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.960> critical<00:01:25.550> transition<00:01:26.550> setting

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
all at that critical transition setting

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.390 
all at that critical transition setting
it<00:01:27.600> all<00:01:27.750> up<00:01:27.780> using<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:28.500> brakes<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:29.040> right

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
it all up using the brakes just right

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.000 
it all up using the brakes just right
and<00:01:30.140> then<00:01:31.140> right<00:01:31.410> here<00:01:31.440> at<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.800> transition

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
and then right here at the transition

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.880 
and then right here at the transition
it's<00:01:32.670> from<00:01:32.910> braking<00:01:33.330> to<00:01:33.480> accelerating<00:01:34.230> no

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
it's from braking to accelerating no

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.970 
it's from braking to accelerating no
hesitation<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.790> between<00:01:36.440> of<00:01:37.440> course<00:01:37.500> that's

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
hesitation in between of course that's

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.400 
hesitation in between of course that's
faster<00:01:38.610> lap<00:01:38.790> times<00:01:39.150> carrying<00:01:39.840> more<00:01:40.050> speed

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
faster lap times carrying more speed

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.770 
faster lap times carrying more speed
momentum<00:01:40.700> okay<00:01:41.700> those<00:01:42.120> are<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.330> couple<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.660> nice

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
momentum okay those are a couple of nice

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.680 
momentum okay those are a couple of nice
tips<00:01:43.130> but<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.610> course<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.000> takes<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.360> little<00:01:45.540> bit

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
tips but of course it takes a little bit

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.830 
tips but of course it takes a little bit
more

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.660 

but<00:01:48.840> there<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.229> good<00:01:49.770> news<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.250> spent<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.640> last

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
but there is good news I spent the last

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.050 
but there is good news I spent the last
25<00:01:51.270> years<00:01:51.329> making<00:01:51.840> technique<00:01:52.380> DVDs<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.700> put

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
25 years making technique DVDs that put

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.270 
25 years making technique DVDs that put
all<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.020> steps<00:01:55.320> together<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:56.040> we<00:01:56.220> this

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
all the steps together so we this

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.440 
all the steps together so we this
include<00:01:57.060> speed<00:01:57.990> safety<00:01:58.530> results<00:01:59.210> hey<00:02:00.210> we're

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
include speed safety results hey we're

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.219
