of low-tech it's anything but low-tech I
can<00:01:35.400> tell<00:01:35.580> you<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.990> actual

characteristics of this paper are as

characteristics of this paper are as
good<00:01:40.770> or<00:01:40.830> better<00:01:41.250> than<00:01:41.940> what<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.270> get<00:01:42.480> from<00:01:42.720> you

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
good or better than what we get from you

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.720 
good or better than what we get from you
know<00:01:42.960> Georgia<00:01:43.350> Pacific<00:01:43.920> or<00:01:44.130> Boise<00:01:44.550> Cascade

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
know Georgia Pacific or Boise Cascade

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.820 
know Georgia Pacific or Boise Cascade
that<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.330> made<00:01:45.480> out<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.750> trees<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.620> there's

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
that is made out of trees so there's

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.080 
that is made out of trees so there's
nothing<00:01:47.070> not<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.370> like<00:01:47.640> about<00:01:47.700> this

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
nothing not to like about this

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.940 
nothing not to like about this
especially<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.170> fact<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.440> it<00:01:49.620> couldn't<00:01:49.890> be

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
especially the fact that it couldn't be

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.220 
especially the fact that it couldn't be
sold<00:01:50.510> competitively<00:01:51.510> it's<00:01:51.660> the<00:01:51.840> same<00:01:52.020> price

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
sold competitively it's the same price

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.500 
sold competitively it's the same price
so<00:01:52.890> there's<00:01:53.130> no<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.730> other<00:01:53.880> words<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.150> is<00:01:54.330> a

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
so there's no in other words this is a

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.380 
so there's no in other words this is a
this<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.230> a<00:01:55.410> way<00:01:55.650> of<00:01:55.920> taking<00:01:56.300> something<00:01:57.300> that

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
this is a way of taking something that

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.920 
this is a way of taking something that
would<00:01:57.510> have<00:01:57.600> been<00:01:57.720> burned<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:59.120> and<00:02:00.120> replacing

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
would have been burned and and replacing

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.140 
would have been burned and and replacing
a<00:02:01.170> substance<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.100> used<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.400> require<00:02:02.760> trees
