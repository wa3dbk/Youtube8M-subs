why<00:02:11.489> don't<00:02:11.730> we<00:02:11.819> do<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:11.970> all<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.450> why<00:02:12.629> don't<00:02:12.690> we

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
why don't we do it all that why don't we

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.080 
why don't we do it all that why don't we
do<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.650> because<00:02:14.310> we're<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:14.520> highly

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
do it and because we're so highly

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.030 
do it and because we're so highly
stressed<00:02:15.450> it's<00:02:15.690> an<00:02:15.780> area<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.410> holds<00:02:16.620> stress

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
stressed it's an area that holds stress

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.550 
stressed it's an area that holds stress
so<00:02:17.220> we

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
so we

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.860 
so we
Lys<00:02:17.739> now<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.310> could<00:02:18.610> do<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:18.880> five<00:02:19.090> times<00:02:19.420> you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
Lys now you could do that five times you

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.540 
Lys now you could do that five times you
could<00:02:20.020> do<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.200> ten<00:02:20.410> times<00:02:20.650> depends<00:02:21.370> how<00:02:21.489> long

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
could do it ten times depends how long

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.030 
could do it ten times depends how long
you<00:02:22.450> have<00:02:22.630> got<00:02:22.930> right<00:02:23.380> okay

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
you have got right okay

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.729 
you have got right okay
so<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.550> next<00:02:24.790> move<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.239> we<00:02:25.360> want<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.599> do<00:02:25.810> we

getting<00:03:47.200> warm<00:03:47.470> is<00:03:48.130> that<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.400> circulation

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
getting warm is that the circulation

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.750 
getting warm is that the circulation
boosted<00:03:49.510> absolutely<00:03:50.380> so<00:03:50.620> it's<00:03:50.769> instant<00:03:51.220> and

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
boosted absolutely so it's instant and

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.580 
boosted absolutely so it's instant and
with<00:03:52.000> that<00:03:52.150> circulation<00:03:52.690> we<00:03:52.959> get<00:03:53.079> that<00:03:53.230> lovely

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
with that circulation we get that lovely

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.920 
with that circulation we get that lovely
flow<00:03:54.190> of<00:03:54.310> oxygen<00:03:54.819> that<00:03:55.000> comes<00:03:55.239> up<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.840> the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
flow of oxygen that comes up to the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.620 
flow of oxygen that comes up to the
surface<00:03:56.109> of<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.560> skin<00:03:56.799> so<00:03:57.430> it's<00:03:57.970> a<00:03:58.120> mixture<00:03:58.510> of

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
surface of the skin so it's a mixture of

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
in there doesn't fit for a sucker very

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.310 
in there doesn't fit for a sucker very
like<00:04:58.510> a<00:04:58.540> scale<00:04:58.930> for<00:04:59.169> me<00:04:59.320> it's<00:04:59.950> a<00:05:00.070> muscle<00:05:01.169> but<00:05:02.169> we

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
like a scale for me it's a muscle but we

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.400 
like a scale for me it's a muscle but we
can<00:05:02.560> actually<00:05:02.860> it's<00:05:03.850> like<00:05:04.030> a<00:05:04.060> prayer<00:05:04.480> and<00:05:04.840> then

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
can actually it's like a prayer and then

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.610 
can actually it's like a prayer and then
we<00:05:05.530> come<00:05:05.770> up<00:05:05.950> right<00:05:06.430> to<00:05:06.700> here<00:05:06.840> so<00:05:07.840> that's<00:05:08.110> doing

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
we come up right to here so that's doing

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.760 
we come up right to here so that's doing
muscle<00:05:09.100> and<00:05:09.640> lymph<00:05:10.120> at<00:05:10.330> the<00:05:10.450> same<00:05:10.660> time<00:05:10.960> and

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
muscle and lymph at the same time and

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.409 
muscle and lymph at the same time and
it's<00:05:11.919> real<00:05:12.100> so<00:05:12.520> Eddie's<00:05:12.790> an<00:05:12.970> area<00:05:13.240> that's

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
it's real so Eddie's an area that's

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.600 
it's real so Eddie's an area that's
neglected<00:05:14.020> actually<00:05:14.500> this<00:05:14.830> part<00:05:15.160> we<00:05:15.280> actually

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
neglected actually this part we actually

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.659 
neglected actually this part we actually
walk<00:05:15.730> around<00:05:15.880> thinking<00:05:16.710> my<00:05:17.710> body's<00:05:17.979> too<00:05:18.400> rigid

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
walk around thinking my body's too rigid

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.159
