point<00:01:56.590> would<00:01:56.770> be<00:01:56.800> vital<00:01:57.220> signs<00:01:57.520> I<00:01:57.880> think

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
point would be vital signs I think

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.930 
point would be vital signs I think
especially<00:01:59.110> on<00:01:59.500> guitar<00:01:59.860> that<00:02:00.070> really<00:02:00.370> was

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
especially on guitar that really was

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.540 
especially on guitar that really was
repetitive<00:02:01.360> as<00:02:01.690> hell<00:02:01.900> so<00:02:02.800> I<00:02:02.830> mean<00:02:03.130> if<00:02:03.310> for<00:02:03.520> some

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
repetitive as hell so I mean if for some

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.280 
repetitive as hell so I mean if for some
reason<00:02:03.700> you're<00:02:04.120> not<00:02:04.270> going<00:02:04.480> to<00:02:04.540> get<00:02:04.659> one<00:02:04.990> song
