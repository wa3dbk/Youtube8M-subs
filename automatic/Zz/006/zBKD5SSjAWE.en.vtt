really<00:00:33.710> good<00:00:33.920> with<00:00:34.130> bikes<00:00:34.399> and<00:00:35.059> you<00:00:35.989> know<00:00:36.140> they

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
really good with bikes and you know they

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.139

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.049 
and if they see you behind him you know
that<00:00:39.829> they'll<00:00:40.010> let<00:00:40.160> you<00:00:40.250> filter<00:00:40.520> and<00:00:40.880> there

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
that they'll let you filter and there

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.430 
that they'll let you filter and there
they'll<00:00:41.329> need<00:00:41.780> to<00:00:41.809> space<00:00:42.140> it<00:00:42.170> let<00:00:42.350> you

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
they'll need to space it let you

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.830 
they'll need to space it let you
overtake<00:00:42.739> and<00:00:44.050> but<00:00:45.050> what<00:00:45.650> occasions<00:00:46.280> I<00:00:46.840> swear

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
overtake and but what occasions I swear

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.840

there<00:00:48.470> are<00:00:48.740> cars<00:00:49.070> out<00:00:49.280> there<00:00:49.310> that<00:00:49.700> will

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
there are cars out there that will

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.170 
there are cars out there that will
deliberately<00:00:50.830> move<00:00:51.830> over<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.580> stop<00:00:52.910> you<00:00:53.150> from

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180

deliberately move over to stop you from
filtering<00:00:53.870> parts<00:00:54.280> they'll<00:00:55.280> deliberately

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
filtering parts they'll deliberately

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.850 
filtering parts they'll deliberately
basically<00:00:56.330> just<00:00:56.510> try<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:56.840> pull<00:00:57.470> out<00:00:57.650> in<00:00:57.829> front

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
basically just try and pull out in front

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.740 
basically just try and pull out in front
of<00:00:58.310> you<00:00:58.430> to<00:00:58.610> stop<00:00:58.790> you<00:00:59.000> from<00:00:59.030> getting<00:00:59.329> ahead

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
of you to stop you from getting ahead

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.020 
of you to stop you from getting ahead
then<00:01:00.560> it's<00:01:00.740> almost<00:01:01.010> like<00:01:01.220> they<00:01:01.370> kind<00:01:01.910> of

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
then it's almost like they kind of

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.049 
then it's almost like they kind of
begrudge<00:01:02.990> the<00:01:03.230> fact<00:01:03.470> that<00:01:03.620> you<00:01:04.040> are<00:01:04.070> allowed

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
begrudge the fact that you are allowed

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.520 
begrudge the fact that you are allowed
to<00:01:05.449> pass<00:01:05.780> them<00:01:06.110> but<00:01:07.040> they<00:01:07.189> kind<00:01:07.670> of<00:01:07.759> appear<00:01:08.720> to

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
to pass them but they kind of appear to

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.050 
to pass them but they kind of appear to
have<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:09.799> attitude<00:01:09.950> well<00:01:10.369> fuck<00:01:10.700> you<00:01:10.729> on

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060
