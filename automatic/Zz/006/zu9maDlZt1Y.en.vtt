that<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.520> insane<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.670> me<00:01:53.700> absolutely<00:01:54.390> insane

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
that is insane to me absolutely insane

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.840 
that is insane to me absolutely insane
to<00:01:54.750> me<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.869> would<00:01:55.140> love<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.439> see<00:01:55.649> an<00:01:55.860> actual<00:01:56.250> MTS

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
to me I would love to see an actual MTS

to me I would love to see an actual MTS
infected<00:01:57.479> Kem<00:01:57.869> strike<00:01:58.020> it'd<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.530> pretty<00:01:58.740> tough

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
infected Kem strike it'd be pretty tough

00:01:58.979 --> 00:01:59.899 
infected Kem strike it'd be pretty tough
to<00:01:59.040> do<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> think<00:01:59.700> it'd<00:01:59.820> be<00:01:59.850> very

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
to do that I think it'd be very

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.940 
to do that I think it'd be very
difficult<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.600> do<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.960> lot<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.680> ones<00:02:01.860> that

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
difficult to do a lot of the ones that

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.649 
difficult to do a lot of the ones that
get<00:02:02.130> sent<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.549> me<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.670> think<00:02:02.909> we've<00:02:03.149> had<00:02:03.329> few

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
get sent in to me I think we've had few

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.440 
get sent in to me I think we've had few
a<00:02:04.020> couple<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.680> them<00:02:04.950> we're<00:02:05.189> just<00:02:05.460> way<00:02:06.119> too<00:02:06.180> much

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450
