 how do I take care of my 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.390
 hair just after braiding them and 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.300
 what am I doing concretely for 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.760
 and had it right after the braids so 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.520
 we start right away with 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.570
 protect and nurture them from the inside 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.100
 so it's not worth washing them 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.720
 right now I use my air 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.979
 mayonnaise so it's new products 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.300
 I use France love started 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.690
 not really a new product of use 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.610
 I used it for when I was 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.500
 curly actually and that it made me 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.010
 really good to my hair that's them 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.290
 rows of super soft super malleable 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.670
 exceptional so suddenly I said I 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.810
 will try again for my natural hair 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.910
 and it works as well 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.800
 so you can see I already used 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.810
 half of the pot I take my soul 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.450
 mayonnaise is immediately without washing 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.420
 my hair I will come to ask a 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.220
 mask actually put a mask so everything 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.440
 that's really to avoid 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.420
 handle the hair when they are 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.640
 attacked so the mask will come feed 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.019
 the hair tell him hero really but 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.810
 in fact you have to know something is that 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.330

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.250
 base the health of your hair 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.410
 so if you take good dark leather 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.930

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.610

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.160

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:10.739

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.100
 scalp massage it's always 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.900
 to circulate the blood at the level of 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.080

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.980
 the shoot is what you see the 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.980
 flexibility that 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.510
 since the kind I would put I do not have 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.810

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.820
 hair 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.580
 nothing at all so all I do 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.400
 it's hand- scrums and take off 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.950
 the dead hair by hand so no 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.100
 comb all that to avoid aggression 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.470
 the hair is done by hand for the 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.850

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:58.250
