00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.420
 welcome everyone to the channel guys and 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.549
 Today we will talk about how I and 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.980
 capable of this versatile machine 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.830
 And I will adapt to 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.800
 grind just such a piece under 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.539
 drill bit knife 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.460
 Here is the ultimate and not yet polished 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.029
 into the strip 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.730
 but now I'll show you how I do it. 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.969
 I do of course yes microns here I do not 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.020
 can you play ideals completely 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:42.989
 such technical needs 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:46.260
 quite fit well let me remind you 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.260
 that in the machine there are two coordinates here 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.649
 one that raises and lowers this 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.480
 the engine can also set its angle 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:01.140
 slope glad ordinata here that feeds 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:06.450
 the carriage side is moving like this 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:10.200
 correction runs out here to name 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.100
 how am I adapted all that is 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.689
 found just such a fit and and I 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.799
 used for pad grinding then 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.259
 there are blanks for a knife 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.630
 now i will install abrasives here 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.630
 stone and we will see how it all works 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.969
 that is, like this , we secured our workpiece 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.100
 as seen from below, I have already polished it well 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:41.670
 about so rough that there was a plane 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.590
 and this side will be polished now 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.270
 the second side, well, it does not work and that's all 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.319
 secure because there is not enough progress 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.349
 full length carriages 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.349
 Well, at least now we expose 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.320
 but 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:07.679
 rarely do you have a single 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.679
 Now I do not put a contract limit 

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:21.299
 this mount has dropped by now 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.299
 we will exhibit so now lower it 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.290
 spend the workpiece 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.330
 hold hands 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.069
 all and now so uncomplicated 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.129
 forward forward 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.000
 of course everything is better and only we are here 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.000
 we will grind 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.330
 so here we have this 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.330
 a thing. 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.230
 so this is the surface of us 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.170
 it turned out here the main plane is 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.390
 but here school irregularities here so 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.340
 this part we always grind everything before it 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.790
 know it be it used apparently 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.670
 on 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.590
 put push and so in general 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:04:01.220
 quite such a nice plane 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:04:03.280
 pretty quickly i would say it doing 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.780
 I, of course, will go a little bit 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:12.790
 cough well, in general, here is such a machine 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.810
 stations to them interesting name here 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.109
 this machine is called growl 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.700
 German rates really 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.209
 universally more and more with me 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.209
 surprises 

00:05:11.109 --> 00:05:18.559
 Well, and here in the end in general, here is such 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:20.299
 a piece of iron turned out uneven consider for 

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:23.559
 artisanal conditions are pretty good 

00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:26.929
 in general, so thank you for your attention 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:28.939
 put likes dislikes and of course not 

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:31.719
 forget to subscribe to the channel all 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:31.719
 happily bye
