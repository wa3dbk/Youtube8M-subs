00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
does bulge out a little bit which is

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.220 
does bulge out a little bit which is
where<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.520> actually<00:00:20.580> houses<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.990> actual

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
where it actually houses the the actual

where it actually houses the the actual
wireless<00:00:22.439> inductive<00:00:23.100> charging<00:00:23.460> part<00:00:23.760> itself

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
wireless inductive charging part itself

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.480

here there's the tutor band also
connects<00:00:26.820> into<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> phone<00:00:27.480> just<00:00:28.289> look<00:00:28.470> across

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
connects into the phone just look across

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.769 
connects into the phone just look across
there<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.070> can<00:00:29.189> see<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.490> output<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.970> 650

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
there you can see the output is 650

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.780 
there you can see the output is 650
million<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.470> approximately<00:00:31.679> two-thirds<00:00:32.550> of

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
million so approximately two-thirds of

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.850 
million so approximately two-thirds of
the<00:00:32.910> normal<00:00:33.690> charging<00:00:34.170> capacity<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.739> you

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
the normal charging capacity that you

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.900 
the normal charging capacity that you
get<00:00:35.040> off<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:36.170> microUSB<00:00:37.170> charger<00:00:37.739> just<00:00:38.730> take

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
get off the microUSB charger just take

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.490 
get off the microUSB charger just take
the<00:00:39.000> back<00:00:39.180> off<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.360> s3<00:00:42.079> literally<00:00:43.079> clips<00:00:43.320> on

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the back off the s3 literally clips on

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.930 
the back off the s3 literally clips on
exactly<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.010> size<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.340> these<00:00:44.460> two<00:00:44.520> terminals

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
exactly the size of these two terminals

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.940 
exactly the size of these two terminals
here<00:00:45.329> pop<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.750> there<00:00:45.930> which<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.230> how<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
here pop in there which is how the the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.990 
here pop in there which is how the the
phone<00:00:47.160> receives<00:00:47.550> its<00:00:47.760> power<00:00:49.489> so<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.610> fits<00:00:50.850> on

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
phone receives its power so it fits on

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.790 
phone receives its power so it fits on
nicely<00:00:51.480> first<00:00:51.930> thing<00:00:52.110> we'll<00:00:52.230> do<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.410> just<00:00:52.500> give

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
nicely first thing we'll do is just give

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.410 
nicely first thing we'll do is just give
you<00:00:52.829> an<00:00:52.980> idea<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.460> extra<00:00:53.789> thickness<00:00:54.090> three

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
you an idea of the extra thickness three

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.819 
you an idea of the extra thickness three
outs<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.840> phone<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.500> see<00:00:55.649> they've

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
outs of the phone so you can see they've

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.319 
outs of the phone so you can see they've
got<00:00:55.860> back<00:00:56.280> from<00:00:56.430> about<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> three<00:00:57.030> millimeter

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
got back from about a three millimeter

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.810 
got back from about a three millimeter
bolt<00:00:57.840> coming<00:00:58.199> at<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.620> back<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.579> phone

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
bolt coming at the back of the phone
