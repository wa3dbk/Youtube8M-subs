00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hi there I'm just here as content 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.549
 been to the mall and I have 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.560
 some small purchase is done 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.269
 I thought it would be nice to leave you after this 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.269
 in a kind of mini shoplog 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.590
 well I have visited blocks and have 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.220
 I bought two things first of all I have 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.410
 here form two ice creams and they are yes 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.260
 are made of silicone and I will 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.529
 more open and are two 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.480
 ijsvormpjes metz 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.830
 yes they look like such a silicone 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.390
 made here and you can just do it 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.649
 put liquid in and then there is one 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.090
 cap with 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.680
 and you put it on and then you just have to 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.700
 do a few hours in the freezer, such as 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.040
 nature 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.100
 yes freezes and you have it in 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.570
 This blue color and link but very 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.920
 nice to put yogurt in for example 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.250
 chairs imperial 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.079
 yes is jorrit ice cream making or you 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.430
 just sample lemonade 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.140
 and this length of very easy 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.239
 because they are only two must often come 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.699
 she's in 6 and that's a great thing the fits 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.440
 just not always ilse freezer 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.820
 so day to this very nice 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.820
 and these were 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.860
 So 399 dishes a bit pricey 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.600
 very nice work but you can just do it 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.310
 I mention it easy to wood 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.930
 very curious 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.140
 and then I also have it in the freezer 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.470
 ice cube bags and he just loved this one 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.590
 packages and on are at a level of 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.189
 bags that you can fill with water and them 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.869
 are also even luytens 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:34.290
 will just open one then 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:38.009
 maybe look it cruel 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.689
 this is rolling rolling in sets and 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.689
 you'll just untie 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.290
 then this is such a bag and what you do 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.720
 let's see 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.909
 you make it europe and then you can here 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.580
 the water at the French arch 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.229
 pour in and when you are full then 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.759
 you also stop and then the te can be as good 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.200
 no more cables often one is a bag 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.320
 has been used to two exactly how it 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.119
 works but in a different way anyway 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.320
 already full and the water he smells then 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.500
 not out so you can also just 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.510
 put it down and yes I like going very much 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.970
 nice to historic my drinks 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.040
 drink and for that two role it is 2 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.570
 suits me was a euro area blocks so 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.050
 I thought that was really nice to be with 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.030
 take 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.370
 I also went through the intersection 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.800
 and I have help south there 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.170
 she had the last things she had 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.090
 article about being written on her site and 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.820
 my mother would like that too 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.750
 so I brought this and that 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.920
 cost 3 euros 99 and further looked into it 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.780
 newspaper that they 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.970
 have red bull on offer and he 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.030
 is just know me well and know me 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.220
 ben will love red bull ben and this 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.230
 so are six packs and those in which 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.060
 for 499 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.070
 so that doesn't save a lot of money 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.470
 but if I can fall on a new apple 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.090
 save handshake that would also prefer further 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.730
 you really don't drink it every day or so 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.070
 so really just more if I live 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.360
 I am really looking forward to it but yes I did 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.579
 an almost offer I am right 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.200
 momentarily 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.340
 no matter how far I have been to the hema 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.950
 and I saw a lot of fun there 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.620
 I made things and restrained myself 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.360
 I have brought this notebook 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.269
 led smoke in other colors a bit 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.549
 I think coral green and blue 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.690
 I think but I have Jan 's rock 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.400
 taken along 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.560
 and the great thing about this project is 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.769
 that its a plastic 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.140
 yahoos is around it and that gives you here 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.920
 some more boxes where you can put papers 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.840
 to do 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.920
 behind this put carl papers in there 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.519
 of course you just continue it 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.810
 notebook and in the back you have more 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.030
 boxes 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.549
 where you can do election or balls 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.109
 and that is very nice here at the 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.180
 side is kind of fuck you guys 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.100
 you can zippers and you can 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.370
 just put all the papers on 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.870
 make notes in 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.940
 she just seemed like a super fine letter 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.700
 for example if you are a student 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.799
 or just the student or maybe 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.170
 block as I am again for example 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.940
 another student by the way so this one too 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.099
 very nice long story but I found 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.129
 It really is a very nice idea to have such a 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:10.379
 to have this notebook and found this or 250 so 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.930
 I also have this very nice necklace 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.670
 I had seen just like before and it is 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.889
 a golden chain with a kind 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.380
 from yes point or down arrow 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.329
 but I actually found that one too 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.650
 bit looks like one of us 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.139
 with you 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.060
 and I just really enjoyed it 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.410
 it just stands like that 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.280
 actually just fits every one 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.510
 outfit and this one is 395 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.880
 I also came across this very nice one 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.440
 wallet against them and I like it 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.210
 Prince just very nice because that is 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.229
 just the same as ours 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:46.260
 business cards and they call this one 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:48.120
 an ov wallets you think a 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.690
 very simple thing yes you have the inside 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.550
 two 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.220
 kind of packages that you can fit in 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.770
 and that's it so he's tasty 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.060
 really can be flat in any jacket 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.889
 if you don't feel like bringing a bag 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.660
 or if you go out for example then 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.539
 this might just be you just fun 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.210
 also do you license your debit card and 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.800
 more often not really actually need so 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.889
 that seems very nice to me 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.289
 and this was a 495 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.419
 and I also have a hema 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.530
 eyebrow pencil taken 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.690
 super long time since i was a hema 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.310
 used eyebrow pencil 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.810
 besides the use, actually often 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.030
 aqua brow is that a bit one 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.650
 liquid product but I like that 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.289
 a bit slower in that 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.660
 one to bring it and sometimes you 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:33.120
 too lazy so i thought i would gladly stayed 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.440
 ill you try a pencil because there 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.940
 I'm just a bit faster and normal 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.720
 on the days that don't have to be perfect 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.360
 to sit 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.800
 think we are very fine and pencil 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.360
 2 euros 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.220
 and last there I am at the 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.340
 been single and there must be a bag 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.449
 tortilla chips and this is with 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.979
 80 cents and I opted for this order 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.779
 it has a very nice shape 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:54.400
 more like a rectangle and that is 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:56.409
 very tasty to dip with 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.449
 actually and I just had a little bit too 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:00.520

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:02.620

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.629

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.729
 so line that I have now taken well 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:08.080
 that my purchases finally went to 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:10.719
