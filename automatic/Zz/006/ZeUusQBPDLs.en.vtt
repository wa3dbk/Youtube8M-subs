 fishing in Russia will be paid 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.290
 President Dmitry Medvedev signed 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.710
 amendments to the law on fisheries and 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.020
 preservation of aquatic biological resources for new 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.880
 standards for fish will have 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.679
 fork out not only 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:11.570
 industrialists and ordinary 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.570
 fishermen loner 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.210
 so let's and settle daughter 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.990
 many rivers may simply not 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.780
 afford 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.720
 meanwhile now in our country by 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.040
 Russian Fisheries Estimates 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.710
 amateur and sport fishing 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.030
 engaged in fifteen to 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.919
 twenty five million people 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.359
 virtually every sixth Russian 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.089
 that's how the law will act 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:31.279
 biostation country free pond 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.370
 then recorders 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.420
 what do you need to fish in the winter well 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.859
 surely warmer dress come 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:40.769
 drill holes in reservoirs 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.000
 throw a shelf and wait 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.210
 if you are lucky then you believe no amount 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.410
 here then if you understand the river moscow and 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.050
 many years ago and go fishing today 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.780
 you can absolutely free Constantin 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.770
 come here every weekend draw 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.260
 transport accessibility and the fact that 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.989
 fish is caught a variety 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.500
 federation question has 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.040
 not least 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.160
 I still have to look for tents of tons and a number of 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.980
 with ulissa conditions will be 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.110
 only in the evening can there still be ships 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.790
 meanwhile free ponds already in the very 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.240
 soon in Russia 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.509
 who can not stay in europe 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.730
 maybe just can't stand it 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.110
 Russia says we need 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.110
 I mentioned fish cards and liver mercenaries 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.680
 in the olden days long ago we have it 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.870
 will be called a voucher in 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.150
 similar rule in all russian 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.730
 regions compiled and 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.270
 approved in the list 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.020
 Taliban fishing grounds 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.110
 in fact, these are all large rivers and lakes 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.110
 which is found any fish interesting 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.170
 fisherman all and five fishing 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.030
 often rented out to merchants who 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.370
 will set a rule on them 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.560
 fishing and price 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.090
 and will also have to equip places 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.290
 recreation for its fishermen organized here 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.590
 to in such a way that 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.799
 but who needs people is granted on 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.880
 place to sleep 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.030
 if someone needs it there 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.259
 saturday sunday let's say on his israel 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.180
 river left 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.060
 well and on infrastructure 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.200
 which is related to the organization of fishing 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.960
 Meanwhile, in this approach have already been found 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.850
 the mass of opponents in the main part 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.119
 fishermen themselves first objections 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:17.949
 why should a commercial structure 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:19.679
 sell fishing rights 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:22.429
 state owned and second 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:24.039
 order pricing not 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:25.899
 duties let's say run fish in 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:28.649
 ponds or cleaning the shores of debris in 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:31.259
 the law does not clearly define all this 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:33.579
 depends on the goodwill of tenants 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.649
 pigeon about belfry threat voucher such 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:39.379
 there is no amount what cm of cis from avant 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:40.760
 just did not use 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.859
 cost in services my age 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.749
 at this year he provided his 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:48.749
 clients optimal 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.729
 beautiful life on this base 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:53.659
 so say experts from 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.739
 the common type of recreation fishing in 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.169
 Russia can turn into 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.379
 elite of course the number of fishery 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:00.989
 plots will fall far from all 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.049
 Russian reservoirs 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:02.990
 free 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.780
 also remain true as possible 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.240
 assume it is basically 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.200
 small creek rebel pond 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.370
 not representing 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.019
 no commercial value but also fish like 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.010
 rule there
