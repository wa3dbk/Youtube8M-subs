african-american audiences I find that

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.520 
african-american audiences I find that
I'm<00:03:22.730> typically<00:03:23.180> speaking<00:03:23.690> almost

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
I'm typically speaking almost

I'm typically speaking almost
exclusively<00:03:25.130> to<00:03:25.370> women<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:26.090> we<00:03:26.750> have<00:03:27.049> some

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
exclusively to women and we have some

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.050 
exclusively to women and we have some
very<00:03:27.560> significant<00:03:28.310> issues<00:03:28.609> that<00:03:28.760> we<00:03:28.880> have<00:03:28.970> to

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
very significant issues that we have to

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.750 
very significant issues that we have to
think<00:03:29.209> about<00:03:29.359> as<00:03:29.660> women<00:03:30.019> men<00:03:30.200> only<00:03:30.769> because<00:03:31.310> we

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
think about as women men only because we

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.780 
think about as women men only because we
tend<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.090> outlive<00:03:32.660> men<00:03:33.350> so<00:03:34.010> we<00:03:34.160> need<00:03:34.340> money<00:03:34.609> to

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
tend to outlive men so we need money to

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.110 
tend to outlive men so we need money to
work<00:03:34.940> for<00:03:35.000> us<00:03:35.329> longer<00:03:35.720> we<00:03:36.440> also<00:03:36.739> have<00:03:37.120> specific

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
work for us longer we also have specific

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.970 
work for us longer we also have specific
issues<00:03:38.480> where<00:03:38.690> we<00:03:38.930> have<00:03:38.959> time<00:03:39.350> out<00:03:39.620> of<00:03:39.889> the

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
issues where we have time out of the

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.860 
issues where we have time out of the
workforce<00:03:40.010> whether<00:03:41.000> those<00:03:41.239> raise<00:03:41.630> our

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
workforce whether those raise our

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.750 
workforce whether those raise our
children<00:03:42.109> and<00:03:42.650> so<00:03:43.010> it's<00:03:43.130> a<00:03:43.160> result<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.609> that<00:03:43.700> I

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
children and so it's a result of that I

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.699 
children and so it's a result of that I
caught<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.150> mommy<00:03:44.420> tax<00:03:44.840> I<00:03:45.170> didn't<00:03:45.500> name<00:03:45.680> it

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
caught the mommy tax I didn't name it

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.379 
caught the mommy tax I didn't name it
that<00:03:46.010> that<00:03:46.220> it's<00:03:46.400> been<00:03:46.579> called<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.910> mommy<00:03:47.120> tax

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
that that it's been called the mommy tax

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.170 
that that it's been called the mommy tax
when<00:03:47.989> you<00:03:48.019> lose<00:03:48.290> out<00:03:48.530> on<00:03:48.590> critical<00:03:49.160> years<00:03:49.639> of

when you lose out on critical years of
investing<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.410> so<00:03:51.739> we<00:03:52.250> know<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.549> understand

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
investing and so we know to understand

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.230

those issues and how to over

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.290 
those issues and how to over
but<00:03:54.960> I<00:03:55.050> understand<00:03:55.860> that<00:03:56.190> we<00:03:56.580> tend<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.060> make

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
but I understand that we tend to make

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.350 
but I understand that we tend to make
some<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:57.900> our<00:03:58.020> most<00:03:58.260> significant<00:03:59.360> investment

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
some of our most significant investment
