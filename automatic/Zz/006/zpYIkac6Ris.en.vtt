00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:19.220
 friends I look at him good morning I'm winter in this new episode that there 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.199
 we are preparing to face together 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.939
 essential topic 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.119
 little treated on word for the sound one 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.109
 real sound important and fundamental products will succeed in creating a 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.880
 own style if we think of the great bb king guitar masters 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.260
 robben ford 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.640
 stiv revokes jimi hendrix 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.250
 actually their language is part of it, which then was very often extremely 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.520
 the simple thing that characterized them is their sound 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.040
 their way of d 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.789
 use the expressive aspects to which goods 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.590
 fiberglass tourism 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.250
 I believe that a good musician without these elements cannot have one 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.449
 precise correspondence traced that 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.780
 try free time 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.720
 sentimental what the instrumental language or the scales the chords 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.720
 the triads and everything we are studying 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.660
 so I think it's time to start aligning these 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.660
 expect musician should just be able to give his audience 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.970
 when it's 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.900
 concert 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.619
 a big door reason the emotion goes through 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.820
 the elements we are going to see 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.370
 I think it is very important for other reasons 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.080
 the speech of good perhaps one of the most difficult states to play 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.300
 on the guitar but also on string instruments in general 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.260
 in the power vibrato music it represents the vast way to tune on the guitar 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.090
 the jimi hendrix notes and it's pretty good any note if we don't have 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.200
 a good vibrato 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.880
 every sentence every idea of ​​marotta pronunciation dumps will result in mourning 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.189
 because the listener often forgets about the router 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.350
 taranto courier have climbed interautonews san an instrument 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:02.570
 fixed alteration 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.110
 and as always small little nuances 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.929
 tuning are trolls 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.010
 wrong and therefore vibrato will be the element that will fix a fucking 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.370
 I have to give examples of the style of the great masters who then with me 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.059
 you will become a smartbox 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:23.839
 you just have to go and see first with a couple of examples 2 present and bb 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:25.599
 king because bb king 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.129
 extremely simple blues harp guitarist abb in the race perhaps the vibrato 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.949

 fioroni 74 musicians for ford blackmail 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.319
 who founded their style 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.739
 and if we go to listen to them well we will realize that in the tooth parts 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.339
 of their sori they are practically a sort of updated bb king 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:54.099
 they then wanted the style to become masters also on the guitar 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.919
 modern there is not much more TV 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.639
 let's see these examples 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.639
 example 1 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:08.209

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.779
 pentatonic already published on youtube can be a good approach with the

 Pope. who already have mobile usage 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.749
 if we see in this fragment of a sentence very simple reality 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.299
 there are so many things 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.299
 this is 70 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.959
 contains nothing 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.319
 which must be done precisely and quickly 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.159
 be careful because I often get letters from users that I can manage to 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.169
 pass the ropes 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.229
 often the wrong arm movement because otherwise

 superhero I have strength 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.060
 vertically 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:17.060
 probably our undivided good among ineffective we will publish dead while 

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:20.359
 the trick is to block an octopus there puts his hand 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.409
 with the force that bathes with wings and try to raise the ropes 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:28.389

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.969
 somehow and 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:44.050
 will be used will be used in secure account we want 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.050
 give a lot of emphasis to the phrase pull out an angry look 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:52.139
 mind when we want to give a sweeter melancholy character with the sentence 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.139
 we will use a softer vibrato 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:02.780
 so this micro fake made in different ways may already be in source 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:05.779
 of completely different phrases according to leaks 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.150
 batch let's train together to do this thing

 it's much better 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.990
 eh 15 we have three fingers attached
