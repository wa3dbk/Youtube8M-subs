00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.050
 all right 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:21.540
 in Barcelona and now in a video game 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.040
 and I also feel the same with banks 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.599
 from all over the world I love seeing the 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.439
 legacy of what I've done over 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:32.869
 my life how was that to conquer the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.869
 first and the two highest championships 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.629
 to black seville 6 and I reached the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.550
 world championship then that nobody 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.870
 I thought I would also do with the 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.870
 intercontinental there work 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:58.409
 and suddenly there was a conversation before 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.409
 to see who would win 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.340
 and the commission then decided that 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.340
 one of the two had to change 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.740
 but you enjoyed 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.520
 we enjoyed it was something really 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.090
 different to everything that had happened 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.090
 before wrestlemania 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.970
 there had always been two opponents 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.860
 fighting for a title we throw for 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.280
 forward with the idea we had something new 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.280
 what to try 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.770
 previously always online games 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.229
 we arrived with a dispute between two 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.820
 wrestlers normally someone had 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.820
 done something to someone's friend 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.600
 then the faces were a type 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.600
 good in front of another bad there was an angel 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.940
 it was time to settle accounts 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.130
 but that time they were two good guys 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.410
 face to face was in the skydome 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.450
 impressive transit the same as the 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.950
 size of the event for the time was a 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.230
 half-hour combat that there's no 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.970
 magnificent final movements the 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.430
 public did not stop getting up and 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.620
 sit loved them and did not know what 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.260
 what was going to happen in exchange for the clients 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.570
 of then now 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.630
 and of course it has changed in many 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.550
 aspects you see you see weslin now you think 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.620
 what has changed has done it in a way 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.450
 incredible in those times 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:48.040
 wrestlers we did not have any kind of 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:49.210
 nannies we did not have anyone that we 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.340
 will write the scripts or we 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.660
 will promote we did not have a 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.080
 costume department that does not 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.080
 existed 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:05.140
 I think everything has changed a lot and now 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.330
 It is 100% spectacle but in my time 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.250
 you had to use your talent to invent and 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.650
 develop the character on your own 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.510
 you should think the phrases the way 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.930
 promote you the keys that you would do in 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.510
 the ring 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.520
 type of final movements coordinate 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.980
 to see how the result would be with the 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.290
 each opponent's maneuvers was something that 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.860
 you had to invent and protect the 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.860
 other characters 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:40.230
 and now everything is very different there was no 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.300
 nobody that will vary the formula on 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.610
 alternator was the pioneer in the first 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.620
 place is an amazing person always 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.550
 It has been an honor to work with him in addition 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.550
 I had an impressive team 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.240
 but he was the first to develop a 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.160
 character as such faced a 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.590
 bunch of video tapes for months 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.080
 to see what we were doing longer than those 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.430
 tapes to find out what kind of 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.430
 character fit better with him 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.299
 obviously he found the undertaker with 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.730
 everything that surrounds his way of walking 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.070
 to speak what he did deserved the role 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.240
 and put all those things together until 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.240
 get the perfect character 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.389
 from there all the 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.970
 other characters who owe everything every 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.380
 little detail they owe to that maybe 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.930
 success is the result of a 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:46.520
 combination of the company and a vision to 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:51.919
 when creating this company one that 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:54.830
 would not exist without all these characters 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.330
 are now unique in their class the people are 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.900
 leave the money in it because they know that 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.639
 it's like that 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.050
 what they will find and return 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.050
 once and again 

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:06.360
 but there was a real part in the 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.439
 entertainment professionals 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.809
 then they did not have voices in their head 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:12.550
 to dictate what they should do 

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:14.319
 a difference between what to people 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.599
 he liked the characters from before and 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:18.279
 what are you looking for in the ones that now is not that 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:20.709
 go to get into the way of doing 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:23.909
 things is a business that is not mine but 

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:23.909
 many people do not know this 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:29.380
 the types of fraud 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.009
 talking about your return in a video game 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.270
 how have you seen yourself in there and what 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:43.349
 you think of millions of people who 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.349
 they want to be the world 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:47.510
 videos 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.920
 already 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.920
 friends kind good shipping 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:59.049
 and people are going to be really people 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:59.049
 it's going to be you 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.870
 is something special 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.920
 may not be able to express what 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.540
 means to me this to be in a 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.540
 video game selection in my character 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.970
 to talk to your friends who can 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:27.250
 between them and tell what they have 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.250
 already made all kinds of comments 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.140
 for me this is absolutely amazing 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.610
 from here I love to think that the 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.610
 people are going to feel something you know because 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.660
 because it's wonderful
