ground war it wasn't ground war was a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.200

boardwalk and I'm like you know what it

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.940 
boardwalk and I'm like you know what it
seems<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.790> me<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.390> mp7<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:07.290> acclaimed<00:01:07.770> it

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
seems to me like the mp7 I acclaimed it

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.160 
seems to me like the mp7 I acclaimed it
was<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.159> best<00:01:08.310> weapon<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.880> game<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:10.049> it

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
was the best weapon in the game but it

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.730 
was the best weapon in the game but it
seems<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.530> me<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.460> rate<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.909> fire<00:01:12.740> with

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
seems to me that the rate of fire with

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.100 
seems to me that the rate of fire with
the<00:01:13.890> silencer<00:01:14.580> see<00:01:15.119> they<00:01:15.240> changed<00:01:15.720> some<00:01:15.869> stuff

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the silencer see they changed some stuff

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.600 
the silencer see they changed some stuff
they<00:01:16.470> don't<00:01:16.590> really<00:01:16.799> tell<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.189> when<00:01:17.310> they<00:01:17.400> hot

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
they don't really tell you when they hot

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.420 
they don't really tell you when they hot
fixed<00:01:18.000> up<00:01:18.150> some<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.930> script<00:01:19.320> changes<00:01:19.890> but

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
fixed up some of the script changes but

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.749 
fixed up some of the script changes but
they<00:01:20.580> don't<00:01:20.759> know<00:01:21.000> what<00:01:21.299> what<00:01:21.750> changes<00:01:22.350> what

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
they don't know what what changes what

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.649 
they don't know what what changes what
I've<00:01:23.759> noticed<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:25.049> PP<00:01:25.409> 90<00:01:26.509> living<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
I've noticed that the PP 90 living the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.679 
I've noticed that the PP 90 living the
pp<00:01:28.140> 901<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.860> think<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.310> with<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> silencer

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
pp 901 I think it is with the silencer

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.460 
pp 901 I think it is with the silencer
is<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> lot<00:01:31.290> better<00:01:31.590> even<00:01:32.130> though<00:01:32.689> the<00:01:33.689> mp7<00:01:34.020> is

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
is a lot better even though the mp7 is

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.730 
is a lot better even though the mp7 is
better<00:01:34.920> at<00:01:35.189> long<00:01:35.430> distance<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.110> know<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.229> me

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
better at long distance so you know I me

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.460 
better at long distance so you know I me
a<00:01:37.770> rush<00:01:38.070> lot<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.520> get<00:01:38.700> into<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.939> lot<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.470> close

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
a rush lot and I get into a lot of close

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.370 
a rush lot and I get into a lot of close
