00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
platform Falls so yeah that kind of

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.530 
platform Falls so yeah that kind of
stinks<00:02:32.640> inside<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.880> chest

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
stinks inside the chest

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.500 
stinks inside the chest

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
very very important item at this point

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.700 
very very important item at this point
in<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.780> game<00:02:49.930> at<00:02:50.110> least<00:02:51.990> at<00:02:52.990> this<00:02:53.230> point<00:02:53.320> in

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
in the game at least at this point in

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.190 
in the game at least at this point in
time<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.190> probably<00:02:54.550> do<00:02:54.820> want<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.120> equip<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:55.900> on

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
time you probably do want to equip it on

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.050 
time you probably do want to equip it on
L<00:02:56.560> or<00:02:56.740> X<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:59.470> probably<00:02:59.830> also<00:02:59.980> want<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.430> equip

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
L or X you probably also want to equip

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.020 
L or X you probably also want to equip
the<00:03:01.600> Deku<00:03:01.960> sticks<00:03:02.380> and<00:03:02.680> probably<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.700> Deku

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
the Deku sticks and probably the Deku

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.600 
the Deku sticks and probably the Deku
nuts<00:03:04.240> as<00:03:04.420> well<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.900> then<00:03:05.770> if<00:03:06.100> you<00:03:06.250> need<00:03:06.430> to

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
nuts as well and then if you need to

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.820 
nuts as well and then if you need to
recover<00:03:06.880> health<00:03:07.270> there's<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:07.990> chest<00:03:08.260> up<00:03:08.530> there

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
recover health there's a chest up there

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.770 
recover health there's a chest up there
that<00:03:09.100> has<00:03:09.250> a<00:03:09.280> heart<00:03:09.700> container<00:03:10.120> so<00:03:10.570> that's

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
that has a heart container so that's

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.710 
that has a heart container so that's
useful<00:03:11.020> and<00:03:11.590> now<00:03:12.490> that<00:03:12.700> our<00:03:12.820> platform<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.540> gone

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
useful and now that our platform is gone

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.430 
useful and now that our platform is gone
whatever<00:03:14.140> shall<00:03:14.770> we<00:03:14.800> do<00:03:15.130> of<00:03:15.880> course<00:03:16.570> shoot<00:03:17.170> the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
whatever shall we do of course shoot the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.530 
whatever shall we do of course shoot the
ladder<00:03:17.650> because<00:03:18.280> that<00:03:18.550> makes<00:03:18.760> so<00:03:19.239> much<00:03:19.510> sense

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
ladder because that makes so much sense

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.540 
ladder because that makes so much sense
I<00:03:20.910> love<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.090> world<00:03:22.270> of<00:03:22.480> Nintendo<00:03:23.550> I'm

I love the world of Nintendo I'm
probably<00:03:24.790> gonna<00:03:24.970> point<00:03:25.300> out<00:03:25.420> like<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.660> million

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
probably gonna point out like a million

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.229 
probably gonna point out like a million
things<00:03:26.320> that<00:03:26.830> make<00:03:27.010> no<00:03:27.220> sense<00:03:27.520> in<00:03:27.760> this<00:03:27.970> game

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
things that make no sense in this game

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.990 
things that make no sense in this game
just<00:03:28.690> because<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.170> feel<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.800> need<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.040> like<00:03:30.790> for

climbing<00:03:47.290> up<00:03:47.440> you<00:03:47.680> can't<00:03:48.190> actually<00:03:48.400> do<00:03:48.730> that

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
climbing up you can't actually do that

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.400 
climbing up you can't actually do that
well<00:03:49.090> actually<00:03:49.330> you<00:03:49.540> can<00:03:49.870> do<00:03:50.080> this<00:03:50.230> without

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
well actually you can do this without

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.190 
well actually you can do this without
the<00:03:50.590> Sun<00:03:51.010> shot<00:03:51.340> but<00:03:51.820> I<00:03:51.970> can't<00:03:52.360> guarantee<00:03:52.660> your

the Sun shot but I can't guarantee your

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
odds of survival anyway you shoot the

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.800 
odds of survival anyway you shoot the

they<00:03:58.989> don't<00:03:59.140> feel<00:03:59.380> much<00:03:59.560> damage<00:04:00.070> and<00:04:00.220> then<00:04:00.310> you

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
they don't feel much damage and then you

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.790 
they don't feel much damage and then you
could<00:04:00.550> climb<00:04:00.880> your<00:04:01.150> way<00:04:01.209> up<00:04:01.600> to<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.530> very<00:04:02.680> top

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
could climb your way up to the very top

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.070 
could climb your way up to the very top

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
really isn't that useful though gives

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.690 
really isn't that useful though gives
you<00:06:14.300> unlimited<00:06:14.420> money<00:06:15.050> which<00:06:15.860> I<00:06:16.130> forget<00:06:16.520> if<00:06:16.610> I

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
you unlimited money which I forget if I

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.540 
you unlimited money which I forget if I
said<00:06:16.940> this<00:06:17.120> already<00:06:17.330> but<00:06:17.630> I<00:06:18.110> feel<00:06:18.920> like<00:06:19.040> rupees

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
said this already but I feel like rupees

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.410 
said this already but I feel like rupees
just<00:06:20.110> the<00:06:21.110> currency<00:06:21.710> is<00:06:21.860> so<00:06:22.190> useless<00:06:22.940> in<00:06:23.270> this

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:23.420 
just the currency is so useless in this

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.090 
just the currency is so useless in this
world<00:06:24.430> like<00:06:25.430> that<00:06:25.670> sword<00:06:26.090> and<00:06:26.740> we<00:06:27.740> can<00:06:27.890> head

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.100 
world like that sword and we can head

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.050 
world like that sword and we can head
back<00:06:28.310> out<00:06:28.550> to<00:06:28.610> the<00:06:29.360> center<00:06:30.310> is<00:06:31.310> the<00:06:31.490> skull<00:06:31.790> tore

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
back out to the center is the skull tore

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.130 
back out to the center is the skull tore
from<00:06:32.270> behind<00:06:33.220> boom<00:06:34.540> so

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:36.140 
from behind boom so

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.640 
from behind boom so
and<00:06:37.060> then<00:06:38.060> you<00:06:38.630> probably<00:06:38.840> saw<00:06:39.020> that<00:06:39.320> webbing

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
and then you probably saw that webbing

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.200 
and then you probably saw that webbing
when<00:06:39.830> we<00:06:39.950> first<00:06:40.190> entered<00:06:40.610> now<00:06:40.760> you<00:06:40.820> might

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
when we first entered now you might

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.870 
when we first entered now you might
think<00:06:41.630> that<00:06:41.900> you<00:06:42.530> can't<00:06:42.980> or<00:06:43.160> you<00:06:43.580> have<00:06:43.760> to

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 
think that you can't or you have to

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.150 
think that you can't or you have to
light<00:06:44.030> a<00:06:44.060> torch<00:06:44.510> to<00:06:44.960> get<00:06:45.320> through<00:06:45.680> it<00:06:45.830> which<00:06:45.980> is

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 
light a torch to get through it which is
