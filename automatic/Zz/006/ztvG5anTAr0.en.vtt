00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.380
 and 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.460
 I 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.460
 but 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.420

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:43.680
 I didnâ€™t know you had a cock 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:47.070
 I, too, cock I will remind me of eggs 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:53.370
 breakfast means getting up for reference 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:57.450
 stefani cocks don't carry eggs good morning 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.590
 who are hungry sure you have some appetite 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:04.890
 with all that noise last night starting 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.950
 k implies a lot of jokes and laughter without 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.260
 no joke and no laugh at all 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:16.740
 cute but you are so terrible snoring 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:20.850
 and I have not heard anything I'm the same you 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:27.630
 creepy cock but maybe you took 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:30.000
 someone snoring what you publish and a lot 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.970
 strange sounds when you develop these 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.520
 strange sounds help me sing they 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.280
 snore if someone and the hobbit 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.590
 do n't look at me i'm never 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.690
 life is not timid and if it is not written in 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.880
 your phone does not mean that you are so 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.180
 don't you have the loudest voice 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.240
 or the same year as mine even louder 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.000
 snoring is a low frequency sound wave 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.830
 time i heard nothing it was the one who 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.520
 slept farthest from me 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.530
 well, she has the flattest pillow everyone knows 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.799
 that these pillows are hard to breathe and 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.460
 i love gof pillows and for reference i'm not 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.679
 snore 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:13.290
 in general, but someone snore, I don't know 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.580
 they donated a new digital recorder and I 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.340
 just wanted to experience it 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.100
 arrange another overnight stay and write as 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:29.770
 we sleep and then everything becomes clear 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:30.940
 Of course 1 question exercises will help 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.680
 expand lungs 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:40.210
 this is definitely not hurry we will cancel snoring 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:47.290
 don't hear the eucalyptus expands 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:51.760
 the airways let all of us know not 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.280
 snore them in a dream in lol she is moist air 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.040
 helps to get rid of snoring and thin 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.700
 strip of tape on the nose 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:18.450
 Well, everything is ready 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:18.450

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.410

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.739

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:54.700

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.069
