the<00:00:52.929> first<00:00:53.170> thing<00:00:53.350> you'll<00:00:53.469> want<00:00:53.649> to<00:00:53.710> sort<00:00:53.920> out

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
the first thing you'll want to sort out

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.639 
the first thing you'll want to sort out
is<00:00:54.249> the<00:00:54.339> blade<00:00:54.549> the<00:00:55.420> plane<00:00:55.629> uses<00:00:56.139> a<00:00:56.170> blade<00:00:56.469> that

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
is the blade the plane uses a blade that

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.319 
is the blade the plane uses a blade that
is<00:00:56.799> skewed<00:00:57.069> at<00:00:57.249> 22<00:00:57.639> degrees<00:00:57.670> and<00:00:58.210> it's

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
is skewed at 22 degrees and it's

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.239 
is skewed at 22 degrees and it's
important<00:00:58.870> to<00:00:58.899> always<00:00:59.170> have<00:00:59.620> sharp<00:00:59.889> blades<00:01:00.129> in

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:00.249 
important to always have sharp blades in

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:02.189 
important to always have sharp blades in
your<00:01:00.370> tools<00:01:00.549> whether<00:01:01.329> you<00:01:01.479> use<00:01:01.569> a<00:01:01.600> jig<00:01:01.959> or
