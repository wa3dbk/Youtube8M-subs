00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.600
 now get out of the last boss 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.490
 first lsr part of the pride before that 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.400
 you can post you must, of course, the times 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.050
 total space, including respect the 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.450
 takes a while and if 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.880
 he manages the managed because he played 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.160
 here the gls he tactic is in it 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.800
 the whole world just gathers 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.890
 at the red mark and then go there 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:37.079
 and again players in the prisons 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.079
 put that means in one of these 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.550
 first of all these round circles you 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.080
 each at the corners and then would have 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.660
 of course from bohlen so that 's all 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.550
 just the only players yourself 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.030
 located inside themselves stain the surfaces 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.880
 So from now on blau.de gravel on yellow 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.040
 and then I have to play on this 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.560
 face and then it will be 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.210
 from yellow to blue and thus told 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.059
 now on the right one recommends oneself there 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.350
 turn off the player 40 remove the 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.640
 plates and the player in the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.249
 he gets trapped, of course 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.780
 left free 

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:15.399
 otherwise come again as 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.929
 they will be during the entire fight 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:24.219
 just collected from the tanks and 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:26.350
 drilled and then of course the clarify 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.450
 mechanics of the entire fight relates 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.329
 back again europeans 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.020
 interface to the middle indicator that 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:37.240
 it is spoiling or proudly displaying and 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.840

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.899
 Do you have other skills to expect 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.119

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.859
 counted in our written money 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.100
