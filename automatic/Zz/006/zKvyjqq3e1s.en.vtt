 a great pleasure that I find you 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.960

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.090
 just the video just released 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.380

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.640
 still full of information across 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.470
 which he presents to us well be well 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.880
 obviously the veterans prison 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.650
 the osiris event 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.090
 the new assault and his devices is 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.739
 really full of information in this 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.660
 video that besides I invite you to 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.430
 watch them and I wanted to come back 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.809
 on some screens that we can see 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.670
 in the video it's just 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.080
 new weapons of which there are trees 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.729
 exotic I do not know if they will 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.650
 all exotic anyway there is 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.420
 a few and you can see it at 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.070
 the these exotic weapons it will display the 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.900
 wolves you are so in the next dlc and 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.489
 whose event read from the queen 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.170
 always is it that these weapons have a 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.089
 really beautiful skin gold I want 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.850
 start with the first is all 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.769
 just this beautiful pistol then 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.909
 it really frankly me I'm kiffe the 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.600
 little screen of the gun but really 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.820
 magnificent 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.590
 so it's called dreg promises so the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.940
 promise of dresde to order eagles do not 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.409
 not really know who is the one 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.060
 maybe take a little longer 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.740
 next dlc you can it's a 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.750
 pistol that does damage 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.189
 electric cryo and watch out the little 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.380
 particularity of this weapon is that 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.549
 she equips herself with secondary weapons 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.329
 you see that we have to pick up 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.859
 open ammo 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.840
 simply to be able to recharge 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:27.429
 this weapon then this man has two 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.350
 special abilities like all 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:30.969
 weapons the first can in that sense that 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.280
 when you die and you 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:34.899
 reappear there will always be 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.219
 ammo whose loader this weapon 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.710
 really a very good ability 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.749
 especially for the pvp and the second 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.570
 ability of this weapon make that the 

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:45.249
 ricochet ammunition stalks targets 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.409
 So here it is really a very good 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:48.579
 capacity then we do not know yet 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.200
 I can not wait to see what 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.030
 simply stalking with the 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.890
 ammunition ricochet always is it that 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.719
 this man really looks very nice and 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.119
 I think a lot of you are going 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.159
 want to lute it and then the second 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.569
 in convoy through this dlc it's this 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.920
 beautiful shotgun then there the 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.630
 skin frankly I fell in 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.310
 when I saw a dinguerie 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.689
 you can see at the bottom left of 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.880
 the screen that this weapon can count 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.140
 up to 30 bullets in the magazine and 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.220
 through the little piece of video I 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.260
 puts you in rehearsal for 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.450
 you see this weapon shoot from 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.830
 gusts of five bullets so that's it 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.180
 makes six burst by 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.980
 by charge so here it is a weapon that 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.780
 looks devastating I hope everything 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.360
 simply that the scope will not be too 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.710
 abuse history of not doing too much in 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.570
 pvp or do I mean do not 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.550
 too much rage and those who do not 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.110
 and finally I wanted to go back to the 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.510
 last screen we see in this 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.900
 video it's this one you can see at 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.670
 left 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.850
 the character so it's an organist 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.830
 who carry pistols in the middle so the 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.720
 titan who carries the shotgun that 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.570
 I like to introduce you and to the right so 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.910
 yet another weapon then this weapon to 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.990
 a skin two snipers I'm not going too 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.930
 to advance on the fact that it is a 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.550
 sniper simply because you 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.420
 see that puggy is having a little fun 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.290
 put guns in arms 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.670
 secondary etc. 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.950
 maybe this weapon on a weapon 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.300
 main one does not know 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.130
 this weapon a skin that looks like 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.900
 a sniper and laveix always is it that 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.100
 this is to interest boussekine you can 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.390
 see that these three new weapons 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.160
 will therefore be present in the next 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.630
 neglected so do not hesitate to tell me what 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.490
 that you think of these weapons I love 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.930
 when in really we find that they 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.620
 have focused well on that it can 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.810
