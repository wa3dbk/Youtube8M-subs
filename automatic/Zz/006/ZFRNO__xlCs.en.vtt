a movie of my forward controls that uh I
took<00:00:08.210> from<00:00:08.419> my<00:00:08.799> 81<00:00:10.299> 750<00:00:11.299> and<00:00:12.459> had<00:00:13.459> these<00:00:13.579> four

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
took from my 81 750 and had these four

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.450 
took from my 81 750 and had these four
controls<00:00:14.269> in<00:00:14.389> a<00:00:14.480> box<00:00:14.749> waiting<00:00:15.650> for<00:00:16.100> this<00:00:16.190> day

Oh<00:00:18.369> 15<00:00:19.369> years<00:00:19.640> or<00:00:19.880> so<00:00:19.910> I<00:00:20.119> guess

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
Oh 15 years or so I guess

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.650

I'll<00:01:46.440> show<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.740> how<00:01:46.830> simple<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:48.030> had<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
I'll show you how simple the I had to

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.070 
I'll show you how simple the I had to
cut<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:50.479> adjustment<00:01:52.220> thing<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:54.450> put<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> rod

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
cut the adjustment thing and put a rod

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.249 
cut the adjustment thing and put a rod
in<00:01:55.500> between<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:57.360> weld<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.750> up<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:58.049> kind<00:01:58.229> of

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
in between and weld it up it's kind of

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.609 
in between and weld it up it's kind of
rough<00:01:58.470> but<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:59.100> know<00:01:59.189> what<00:01:59.720> it's<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:01.350> way<00:02:01.500> it

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
rough but you know what it's the way it

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.620 
rough but you know what it's the way it
is<00:02:01.740> for<00:02:01.950> now

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
is for now

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.770 
is for now
cut<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.720> out<00:02:03.840> took<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.170> out<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.470> a<00:02:04.500> test<00:02:04.740> band

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
cut it out took it out for a test band

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:15.050 
cut it out took it out for a test band
works<00:02:06.780> just<00:02:07.049> fine

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.750 

and<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.180> attachment

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.250 

what<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:21.790> like<00:02:22.000> about<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.480> doing<00:02:23.019> forward

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
what I like about this doing forward

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.350 
what I like about this doing forward
controls<00:02:23.680> this<00:02:23.830> way<00:02:24.069> is<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:27.209> engine<00:02:28.209> is

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
controls this way is that the engine is

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.790 
controls this way is that the engine is
a<00:02:28.420> what<00:02:28.989> do<00:02:29.050> they<00:02:29.140> call<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.470> stressed

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
a what do they call that a stressed

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.170 
a what do they call that a stressed
member<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:30.280> frame<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.930> there's<00:02:32.110> no<00:02:32.200> down<00:02:32.410> tubes

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
member of frame so there's no down tubes

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.580 
member of frame so there's no down tubes
in<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.360> front<00:02:34.599> of<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.750> engine<00:02:35.019> of<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.349> first

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
in the front of the engine of the first

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.490 
in the front of the engine of the first
there<00:02:35.860> are<00:02:35.920> no<00:02:35.980> frame<00:02:36.310> down<00:02:36.640> tubes<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:38.290> the

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
there are no frame down tubes in the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.949 
there are no frame down tubes in the
front<00:02:38.709> of<00:02:38.799> the<00:02:38.860> engine<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.569> engine<00:02:40.870> is

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
front of the engine so the engine is

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.559 
front of the engine so the engine is
exposed<00:02:41.470> fully<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.610> that's<00:02:43.150> one<00:02:43.360> of<00:02:43.480> the

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
exposed fully and that's one of the

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.330 
exposed fully and that's one of the
features<00:02:44.170> that<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.500> most<00:02:45.540> like<00:02:46.540> about<00:02:47.340> the

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
features that I most like about the

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.380 
features that I most like about the
Virago<00:02:48.970> it's<00:02:49.720> my<00:02:49.900> favorite<00:02:51.180> part<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.299> it

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
Virago it's my favorite part of it

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.470 
Virago it's my favorite part of it
almost<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:52.959> guess<00:02:52.989> you<00:02:53.290> might<00:02:53.410> say
