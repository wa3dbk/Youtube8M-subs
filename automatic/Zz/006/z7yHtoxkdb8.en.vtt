we<00:00:00.240> all<00:00:00.390> know<00:00:00.630> it<00:00:00.989> the<00:00:01.170> FI<00:00:01.500> just<00:00:01.680> expect<00:00:02.190> them

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
we all know it the FI just expect them

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.190 
we all know it the FI just expect them
to<00:00:02.370> sound<00:00:02.850> amazing<00:00:03.449> but<00:00:03.689> can<00:00:04.020> be<00:00:04.170> very

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
to sound amazing but can be very

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:15.379 
to sound amazing but can be very
microphonic<00:00:05.040> and<00:00:05.279> very<00:00:05.549> noisy<00:00:13.910> so<00:00:14.910> what<00:00:15.210> can

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
microphonic and very noisy so what can

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.450 
microphonic and very noisy so what can
we<00:00:15.509> do<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.870> minimize<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.320> noise<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.220> have<00:00:17.430> a

have<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.180> take<00:00:21.359> drastic<00:00:21.600> measures<00:00:22.170> like<00:00:22.410> by<00:00:22.560> 5

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
have to take drastic measures like by 5

have to take drastic measures like by 5
to<00:00:23.070> 7<00:00:23.340> tubes<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.820> find<00:00:24.029> one<00:00:24.240> that's<00:00:24.480> designed

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
to 7 tubes to find one that's designed

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.540 
to 7 tubes to find one that's designed
it's<00:00:25.170> been<00:00:25.320> done<00:00:25.500> before<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.890> have<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> bucket

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
it's been done before I have a bucket

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.710 
it's been done before I have a bucket
full<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.789> noisy<00:00:27.269> tubes

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
full of noisy tubes

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.689 
full of noisy tubes
I<00:00:27.750> bought<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.619> can<00:00:28.830> do<00:00:28.980> nothing<00:00:29.189> with<00:00:29.550> them

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
I bought and can do nothing with them

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.520 
I bought and can do nothing with them
then<00:00:30.570> if<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:30.990> find<00:00:31.199> one<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.470> has<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> low<00:00:32.040> noise

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
then if we find one that has a low noise

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.740 
then if we find one that has a low noise
we<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:34.680> use<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> shock<00:00:35.219> mount<00:00:35.460> socket<00:00:36.329> like<00:00:36.540> I'm

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
we can use a shock mount socket like I'm

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.869 
we can use a shock mount socket like I'm
using<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.230> my<00:00:37.260> aims<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.950> isolate<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.520> from<00:00:38.610> any

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
using in my aims to isolate it from any

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.459 
using in my aims to isolate it from any
vibrations<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.600> might<00:00:39.750> be<00:00:39.870> transmitted

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
vibrations that might be transmitted

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.090 
vibrations that might be transmitted
through<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.680> chassis<00:00:42.680> many<00:00:43.680> times<00:00:43.920> you'll

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
through the chassis many times you'll

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.880 
through the chassis many times you'll
find<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.640> isn't<00:00:44.969> enough<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.379> shock

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
find it it isn't enough to have it shock

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.680 
find it it isn't enough to have it shock
mounted<00:00:47.340> since<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.760> tube<00:00:47.969> gas<00:00:48.329> also

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
mounted since the tube gas also

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.290 
mounted since the tube gas also
resonates<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.559> transmits<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.640> vibration

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
resonates and transmits that vibration

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.240 
resonates and transmits that vibration
to<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.480> whole<00:00:51.629> tube<00:00:51.870> structure<00:00:52.230> making<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
to the whole tube structure making the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.160 
to the whole tube structure making the
relavant<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:54.180> look<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.420> see<00:00:54.629> what<00:00:54.780> happens

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
relavant just look and see what happens

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.990 
relavant just look and see what happens
when<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.379> grab<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.860> glass<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.340> tube<00:00:56.610> while

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
when I grab the glass of the tube while

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.209 
when I grab the glass of the tube while
playing<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.600> note<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.350> resonates<00:00:58.890> through

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
playing a note that resonates through

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:19.219 
playing a note that resonates through
the<00:00:59.340> glass

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.289 

you<00:01:20.229> can<00:01:20.380> of<00:01:20.469> course<00:01:20.740> use<00:01:21.009> tube<00:01:21.369> dampeners<00:01:21.969> and

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
you can of course use tube dampeners and

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.120 
you can of course use tube dampeners and
that<00:01:22.570> will<00:01:22.810> reduce<00:01:23.079> the<00:01:23.439> resonating<00:01:23.829> glass

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
that will reduce the resonating glass

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.990 
that will reduce the resonating glass
vibration<00:01:24.909> but<00:01:25.450> to<00:01:25.659> really<00:01:26.079> have<00:01:26.289> a<00:01:26.500> serious

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
vibration but to really have a serious

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.419 
vibration but to really have a serious
quieting<00:01:28.000> effect<00:01:28.119> you<00:01:29.049> will<00:01:29.200> need<00:01:29.469> to<00:01:29.829> have

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
quieting effect you will need to have

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.149 
quieting effect you will need to have
most<00:01:30.909> of<00:01:31.149> the<00:01:31.299> glass<00:01:31.509> surface<00:01:31.929> dentin<00:01:32.409> to<00:01:33.009> add

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
most of the glass surface dentin to add

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.609 
most of the glass surface dentin to add
more<00:01:33.520> mass<00:01:33.789> for<00:01:34.420> this<00:01:34.630> I'm<00:01:34.929> wrapping<00:01:35.289> the<00:01:35.319> tube

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
more mass for this I'm wrapping the tube

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.620 
more mass for this I'm wrapping the tube
in<00:01:35.770> a<00:01:35.829> 1/8<00:01:36.189> inch<00:01:36.459> thick<00:01:36.549> silicone<00:01:37.299> sheet

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
in a 1/8 inch thick silicone sheet

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.870 
in a 1/8 inch thick silicone sheet
that's<00:01:38.259> held<00:01:38.530> together<00:01:38.679> by<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.100> horse<00:01:39.429> clamp

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
that's held together by a horse clamp

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.270 
that's held together by a horse clamp
fastened<00:01:40.719> all<00:01:41.319> together

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
fastened all together

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.249 
fastened all together
this<00:01:42.700> will<00:01:42.880> really<00:01:43.209> quiet<00:01:43.539> down<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:44.020> tube

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
this will really quiet down the tube

00:01:44.259 --> 00:02:19.890 
this will really quiet down the tube
check<00:01:44.890> this<00:01:45.069> out

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.990 

but<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.890> really<00:02:21.160> doesn't<00:02:21.459> matter<00:02:21.550> how<00:02:21.790> much

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
but it really doesn't matter how much

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.150 
but it really doesn't matter how much
time<00:02:22.209> you<00:02:22.269> spend<00:02:22.629> isolating<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.290> EFA<00:02:23.650> t-62

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
time you spend isolating the EFA t-62

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.339
