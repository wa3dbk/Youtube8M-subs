really<00:00:21.240> incredible<00:00:21.869> battery<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
really incredible battery to to the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.099 
really incredible battery to to the
equation<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:23.880> how<00:00:24.029> big<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.689> batteries

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
equation so how big is this batteries

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.410 
equation so how big is this batteries
it's<00:00:25.260> thirty<00:00:25.500> three<00:00:25.710> hundred<00:00:25.980> million<00:00:26.420> so

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
it's thirty three hundred million so
