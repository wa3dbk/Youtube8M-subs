00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello everyone welcome to the channel to 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.540
 explain some of the strategies 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.549
 what else do I use to upload rounds in 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.290
 this map and good first of all tell you 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:12.389
 that you are going to need one of the canes 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.040
 I recommend the fire stick because 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.530
 It is the simplest to manufacture in my 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.660
 opinion and in this way we are going to 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.640
 get many pieces practically 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.400
 without wanting it you already know that two of them 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.950
 they are in generator number 6 and 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.170
 that the other one we have to win by killing 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.880
 to the fan of the soldier and also the disk what 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.200
 we found where the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.329
 church so we can do it very 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.829
 quickly does not need as much as 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.570
 better the wind you need to climb to 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.760
 the giants take the pieces down 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.679
 going up I know I do not like the ice that 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.469
 you need to scoop out all the 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:45.149
 pieces or like the lightning that is 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.530
 quite complicated in my opinion because 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.120
 you have to go with the tank from one side to 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.129
 another taking a piece jumping from a 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.870
 side by side pending the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.960
 zombies so in this way I think that 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.489
 the fire is the best to climb 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.069
 rounds here you see that they kill me so 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.629
 I also recommend having resuscitation 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:02.729
 fast I do not know very well how it's called anymore 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.290
 you know the blue ferc that is worth 500 points 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.710
 on this map and that you have it to the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.680
 right just as they reappear 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.240
 number 1 in the other part that we're going to 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.220
 need to go up round is going to be a 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.260
 improved weapon and what I do in this 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.420
 map is always to catch a weapon from the 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.280
 wall then in the mind 40 the stc and the 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.860
 It improved to improve, you know you have 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.630
 that go to the generator and the six 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.100
 generators activate them and then go to 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.899
 pack up before the area is 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.580
 of the excavation and he has the weapon 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.530
 will cost five thousand points as in all 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.140
 the loaves so good this way and 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.270
 already having a cane and a weapon 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.920
 improved what we're going to do is going to be 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.590
 zombie balls as you are watching 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.450
 what am I going to try doing and then 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.550
 let's put them all in front we're going to 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.810
 start killing them and when we see that 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.520
 there are too many and that we try 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.200
 corraling we're going to use the cane of 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.789
 fire this way country when you get to 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.729
 rounds very easily you're not going to 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.619
 need a lot of effort because you see 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.929
 that leaves them all scorched this 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.570
 it looks like a crematorium and without it it seems like 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.740
 is and in this way you are going to kill very 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.240
 easily here you see that they touch me 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.600
 sangretón and also be very careful 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.429
 of those who come too close and another 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.009
 of the recommendations is to have titan the 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.360
 titan's advantage for me is 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.090
 essential to have it like this or if not in 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.220
 any family map 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.170
 because if you're not going to put up with it 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.480
 hardly very hard because with 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.280
 two touches that milestone so good with 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.620
 those two recommended advantages with the 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.910
 cane with the improved weapon then what 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.489
 next that we're going to need they're going to 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.739
 be two others but the ones that 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.310
 I recommend I are with the fast speed 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.380
 tail and the other one that I recommend is the 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.720
 of this mine that will allow us 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.860
 run faster on the map you know 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.750
 that there is an area on the map that there is 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.190
 mud then for that area we're going to 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.010
 run very slowly and we can 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.780
 catch the zombies from the round 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.890
 15 or so they start to run pretty there 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.870
 some that start to run a lot 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.000
 so this way we're going to have 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.180
 advantage over them I also recommend 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.790
 come by this exploration area go 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.739
 circling on one side for another go 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.130
 doing accumulations as I said 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.530
 and avoid generator zones 2 and 3 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.209
 Better not go to the lab not return to 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.250
 laboratory for nothing unless 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.320
 want to catch again 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.820
 to the vice network because if you do not go 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.890
 cornered is what happens to me a lot 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.750
 when this map that arrived there I go to 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.120
 for the rival and if I do not go crisis in the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.520
 Corrada does not come to make soldiers 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.550
 from round 8 then take out 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.310
 another 8 rounds in 16 I just think 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.050
 that goes out and catches you there and that fixed that 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.360
 we kill you if you do not have a cane if you do not 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.190
 you have an improved way it kills you and with 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.280
 dancing I ended up killing him always 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.780
 so good is a pretty tactic 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.580
 quite simple does not have much this 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.830
 map did not remind me much to the map 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.220
 if you do not nume the tactics of the map and if 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.600
 do not number that word map with tablets 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.790
 I was going from one place to another I do not know if what 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.500
 you will remember because it is one of 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.100
 which I like the most and as you see 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.300
 with him with him 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.580
 said this with the cane is amazing 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.990
 they do not die practically it 's very simple 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.540
 here you see with the fire stick of a 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.310
 side by side throwing fireballs there 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.080
 is that I have killed to advance alone only 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.720
 of two bullets worth two bullets with the 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.190
 cane for which it is quite useful and already 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.780
 I always say that you go through this area 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.720
 be very careful because they can 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.989
 corralling and the journey we will serve 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.760
 nothing as you see I have 26,000 points 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.920
 Scatter is in points to buy 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.540
 improved weapon bullets as long as 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.610
 you want as long as you can always 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.130
 and when there are no enemies because this 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.810
 way you will not spend the 25,000 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.030
 points are not spent as much as 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.460
 you want to say you have to buy a lot 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.930
 very much and still would not end it 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.370
 spending from 10 to buy all the 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.470
 people now you know that in this 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.860
 map you can get to have 6 pers 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.750
 but wrong 5 is worth what 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.300
 with the shovel and then the 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.520
 blood that I will explain in a video like that 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.259
 how good you see here tells me the 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.449
 travel for nothing because more will erase and 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:58.270
 gastón riva that is to say he has spent me 500 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.280
 points that is not the worst thing to have come 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.240
 so far to see - spent not if it is not 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.830
 the fact that I have been returned to 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.930
 cornered here as you see I'm already 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.150
 cornered again so have a lot 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.580
 Be careful with that be careful not that 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.740
 happen because if that happens you're going to die 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.780
 you are going to die and I say I recommend the area 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.300
 in front of where the 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.529
 exploration to throw yourself around there 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.710
 also if you want in the generator 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:23.110
 number 5 as you see until the general 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.029
 number 4 and you do the ball there 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.400
 and if you want in the tunnel, kill them 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:29.169
 all as you want but you always have a 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.960
 cane and an improved weapon that's what 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.270
 better not also I recommend pulling 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.419
 box box strips is put that the m 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.520
 80 it might be called machine gun 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:42.009
 if I'm not wrong and that the best is with 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.449
 that weapon is going to be milk because you're going to 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.610
 have the cane you are going to have that weapon 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.529
 improved you will not need anything else 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.150
 just maybe it's the ones that you 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:50.380
 you want no bullets that I do not believe because that 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.020
 weapon has a lot of 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.700
 how do you try to corral me again 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.840
 that I told you to be careful and 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.340
 Well, you are going to see that the gameplay 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.620
 short but hey then he starts giving me 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.630
 turns does not kill anyone and in the last 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.100
 round the one that reached 22 if it had 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.680
 I was more attentive I would have had the 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.750
 advantages well and others could have 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.250
 easily reach 30-40 without 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.140
 no problem and have brought it to you 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.300
 channel but you know I was recording 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.950
 the life of zombies of canes and others and 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.110
 when you finish the cane you have nothing 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.450
 more to do is more yesterday finishing the 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.220
 of ice that I went up to the canal what I did 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.020
 was to go to the game because I was bored 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.280
 not so good this has been all 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.330
 I hope you liked it I hope that you 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.510
 have served I hope that I have 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:31.150
 delighted the video and you know how to practice it 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.550
 if you have any doubt or any tactic 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.420
 that you do better, you put it on 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.420
 next goodbye
