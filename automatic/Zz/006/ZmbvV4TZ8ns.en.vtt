00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.080
 the garrison of the village of Donetsk was held 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.190
 instructing amine with saturna 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.440
 explosive objects are told 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.230
 per 32 mouth and brigade ghost callsign 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.470
 Cairo, I will explain now a little about 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.470
 me 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:25.970
 let's start the smallest here is mine moment 2 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:35.570
 infantry mine pressure action 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.739
 push button here's a key 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.010
 rotates 90 degrees 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.630
 pulled out all mine gets up in combat 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.579
 platoon 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:49.620
 dripped put sprinkled everything and left through 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:56.520
 a few minutes mine got up in combat 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:01:00.170
 a platoon to demine it is needed like me 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.610
 I burn either a treasure hunter because 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.610
 regular mine detectors will not take either 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.610
 probe 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:14.479
 shoot her very easily if you found her 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:19.770
 she poses no threat here 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:22.590
 you and get them somewhere just 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.850
 you throw out well and that's what I am of course 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:33.539
 miscarriage well and somewhere destroy here 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:35.299
 there are specialists who do here there are two 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.240
 traffic jams 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:42.200
 which you are scampering here here 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:47.810
 the tube here is on the stake is not a needle 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:53.399
 which hits the blasting cap and 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:56.909
 an explosion occurs there is flooded spent if 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.649
 here these corks unscrew come out 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:04.709
 the detonator then mine will be neutralized 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:06.509
 frag mine this is mine actually 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:09.030
 how I give a lot of it all that 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.179
 we have bye here right now bye 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.179
 the presence of 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:22.480
 Mina Mon-50 Mina more serious course 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:35.660
 she put somewhere 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:45.950
 stuck in the ground like this on pegs 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:47.480
 find either here like a tripod and vinci 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.250
 there is something special 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:57.220
 bracket he for example a tree either 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:00.070
 just where its like that so much 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:06.670
 ways 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:09.260
 here this hole is sight 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.130
 really sight mine aimed 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:16.840
 actions 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:19.790
 you and you look at the sight to 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.300
 the fragmentation was roughly directed 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.520
 here's the arrow for, and even 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.780
 it says here that this is the direction to 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:33.320
 the enemy is not so shrapnel shot 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.950
 grenade from a grenade launcher here it is not 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:45.640
 so it worked to destroy 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:51.980
 here is mine too man like this mine 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:57.730
 frag directional but it's already won 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:04:02.120
 100 respectively this is a more powerful mine 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:05.380
 more than a warrior and as well as her or put 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:11.660
 here are the brackets on the pegs somewhere 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:16.989
 the tree is also special there to her 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:20.960
 sight but it is set separately 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:24.080
 the inconvenience of this mine is that she has 

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:31.729
 too have the same than he 200 here 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:36.680
 she is such a powerful killer 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:38.770
 too narrow a bunch of shards it rather 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:48.860
 specifically directed 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:51.279
 here you need to send it further TMC m-62 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.900
 the most common mine 

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:56.930
 anti-tank which is here 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:00.460
 used here there is still 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:05.210
 so-called 57 but she rarely comes across here 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:07.969
 therefore rarely used here 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:12.770
 fuse twisted accordingly 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:17.889
 tank runs over or car or you can foot 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:21.229
 knock here the fuse is pressed through here 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:25.219
 there is a tablet that explodes 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:29.349
 here comes an explosion directed here 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:29.349
 eight and a half kilograms of trotyl and 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:37.039
 accordingly a good explosion is obtained 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:41.229
 and here it is poured this practice here 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:46.279
 flooded spent on what it means taip 62 m 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:49.839
 This tank precisely 62 year the 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:55.099
 there is no release of this particular mine 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:59.060
 when this mine was invented and introduced 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:06:05.059
 troops letter m means that mine 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:09.339
 it is in a metal case there are such 

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:09.339
 same mines plastic case 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:20.840
 then there is 62 n 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:25.760
 tm 62b by swamp mine is just 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:28.970
 spent compressed eating rag mines 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.389
 Ie options such mines enough 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.250
 lot 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:38.330
 Here is a plastic mine than convenient or by 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:40.729
 marshy something that again does not see them 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:48.830
 mine detector state that is the one that 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:50.750
 reacts to the metal mines filled 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:56.260
 here it is specifically mine filled 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:07:01.400
 the marine mixture is written by n. 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:05.110
 it is a mixture of sea a mixture of spending 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:09.070
 hexogen and aluminum powder 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:11.660
 well there in certain pro under proportions 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.389
 there are mines just t 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:17.510
 who are fueled by TNT is just 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:22.419
 mines that are tg which is fueled and 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:25.479
 spent hexogen foot in principle 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:28.479
 all sorts of mixes are enough to kill 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:28.479
 human
