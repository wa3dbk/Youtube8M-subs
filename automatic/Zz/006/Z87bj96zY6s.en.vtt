that one rocky that one is called

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.110 
that one rocky that one is called
Dimetrodon<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.120> Dimetrodon

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
Dimetrodon this is a Dimetrodon

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.229 
Dimetrodon this is a Dimetrodon
Dimetrodon<00:00:57.570> weren't<00:00:58.469> really<00:00:58.800> dinosaurs<00:00:59.579> but

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
Dimetrodon weren't really dinosaurs but

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.750 
Dimetrodon weren't really dinosaurs but
then<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.809> round<00:01:01.170> off<00:01:01.379> for<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.980> dinosaurs<00:01:02.520> and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
then we round off for the dinosaurs and

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.149 
then we round off for the dinosaurs and
