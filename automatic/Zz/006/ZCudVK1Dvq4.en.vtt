00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 y'all healthy dudes all congratulations on 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.160
 patch she barracks for 4000 of course 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.870
 sylvanoy today we will meet more 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.540
 one patch innovation 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.080
 namely the new map of the tomb of the queen 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.240
 spiders 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.490
 many have already played on it and 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.590
 add some opinion as usual we 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.140
 analyze mechanics timings useful 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.570
 trivia and talk about strategy games 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:30.630
 I remind you that we are here 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:33.000
 begin new card belongs to the class 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.680
 collective and represents some 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.360
 Blackheart Bay hybrid 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.120
 in the sense that the resources collected 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.760
 drop out at death they must pass a 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.980
 ghost mines took cards appearing 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.020
 monsters following the lines for demolition 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.030
 fortifications enemy player tasks 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.670
 collect crystals that fall out 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.149
 after the death of the warriors of the spiders and the enemy 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.399
 heroes 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.350
 collected crystals can be handed over to one 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.230
 of the two altars which are between 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.000
 lines here and here when one team 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.800
 will collect enough 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.170
 crystals on the battlefield are summoned 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.270
 rotate in three directions at once 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.450
 there are no observation towers on the map 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.460
 mercenary camps total 41 boss top 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.350
 map parts 2 fight camps 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.810
 central part and bottom of the map 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.729
 settled down one siege camp that 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.650
 concerns timings the opportunity to pass 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.140
 crystals appear from the beginning of the game 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.270
 and the change itself takes only 5 seconds 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.159
 neutral mercenary camp appears 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.680
 as usual in the second minute of you 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.479
 appears on 3 them and the cats we are already good 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.810
 know as they are the same as on 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.210
 other cards namely 3 4 and 5 minutes for 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.759
 siege fighting camps and for the boss 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.310
 accordingly the weavers themselves are called for 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.710
 15 seconds for unlimited time and 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.930
 there is until they are killed that's all 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.119
 perhaps by timing so go to 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.000
 important note the first wave of weavers 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.750
 will cost you 50 crystals each 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.750
 the following 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.479
 on the back of the crystal that is more than 55 60 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.880
 65 and so on during the existence 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.189
 weavers as well as 15 seconds after them 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.500
 atari destruction unavailable for delivery 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.210
 There are several types of crystal 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.750
 not visually different 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.820
 of 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.100
 keeps a different amount of crystals 1 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.050
 or 5 also would like to note that 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.820
 when kachek is summoned on the battlefield 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.040
 neutral camps on the military but becoming 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.870
 disappears from the card after calling weavers 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.810
 appears exactly on that line 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.370
 where are your minions right now 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.860
 on this map as well as on others everything 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.780
 starts with laning but here it has 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.030
 special tight form since he 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.130
 is the main source of crystals 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.830
 planets and ends almost to 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.780
 the end of the game and this is caused by 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.300
 sufficient sparse arrangement 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.730
 heroes on the map also cost who wears and 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.700
 designed to weaver who attacks all 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.830
 three lines simultaneously forcing the team 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.220
 separate for protection sure you 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.780
 noted for myself that this is one of the most 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.730
 prolonged cards this is caused by 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.160
 this time until dispersed Stu 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.170
 the gameplay on it is the most chaotic and not 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.720
 coordinated as there is no clear 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.030
 the priority of the action event card is pretty 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.459
 weak and does not give a clear advantage 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.860
 without well thought out implementation together 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.110
 with the boss or other dimensional 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.150
 a certain imbalance in the card makes presence 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.000
 boss whose call does not tighten all 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.549
 team strength in one place by itself 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.010
 weavers do good damage though 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.650
 enemy fortifications but their survival 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.630
 short without support they may not even 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.730
 walk to the fortifications and die under 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.780
 vollee bash a huge role on the map 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.280
 play ganks 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.340
 and the presence is not a real amount 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.920
 shelters and the card structure itself make it easy 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.870
 players this task is a good implementation 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.730
 weavers available respected in only two 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.980
 cases when as a result of ganka or 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.410
 teamfight your by is in 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.170
 most or when you pick up the boss 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.450
 or other measures to help with tires or 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.180
 the same split is necessary with confidence 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.370
 say one card ambiguously long 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.030
 compared to other event cards 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.500
 controversial 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.500
 capture boss and mercenary camps 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.959
 is a priority for this 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.030
 maps are also great team timings 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.430
 availability of two collection points and 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.530
 short time putting them pushes 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.170
 the player to take them almost in passing 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.819
 at any moment what does the control of these 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.799
 points are not particularly important 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.350
 difference from the same blackbird bay 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.840
 By the way, this is probably one of the few gifts 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.910
 where ulta sylvana can go perfectly 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.490
 on bribing the standards of sight of having everything 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.370
 one boss and his emergency 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.620
 the importance of the tombs on the map gives players 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.750
 come from other moba that feeling 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.440
 lost farm and endless 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.479
 linings 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.669
 and this is probably the card on which 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:38.099
 its first line is its strategy 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.960
 implementation of the map namely the teams on and 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:43.050
 it's hard enough to win 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.639
 free then your advice recommendations a 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.710
 also comments on this map 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.080
 leave in the comments to help 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.590
 it is better to sort out this map to others 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.210
 to the players 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.310
 subscribe to the channel not to 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.030
 miss new videos and was you 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.009
 Kherson 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.009
 be happy to hear
