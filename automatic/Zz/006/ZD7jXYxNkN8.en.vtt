 hello girls then heaven can t play off something a bit special a 

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:25.589
 idea that came to mind I guarantee nothing we try together not 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.199
 love tried to do it 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:33.020
 commented no the immortal I'm looking for mascara more than a 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:35.590
 the slow fibers of the mtv mascara 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.210
 like those and vitality 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.090
 but they have a slight post hoc 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.170
 I was thinking but the other night while I was choking 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.210
 livescore bellesi appinter maybe a little misshapen that one can and must throw in 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.430
 you 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.260
 nice to change them and finely and then use them together with the mascara to see a 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.380
 moment the effect that makes beautiful obviously I have not tried to do so so there is not 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.310
 feel if we try together and then we try to cut we come from mckenzie 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.850
 and try to cut finely 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.330
 seville in this species of 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
 jar 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.630
 let's try to cut them finely let's see if I can make them see it ea 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.450
 very finely 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.030
 the cuddles 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.790
 two of the most puzzles for a while on the bottom 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.790
 let's continue 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.249

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:21.469
 here for this the filino cook 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.629
 now we can even throw away because false eyelashes also have 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.499
 glitter 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:29.449

 i love you quantcast very finely 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.829
 because we always had to throw in the trash 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.399
 I'm thinking of you anyway I'm here 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.849
 then 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.779
 even a girl told me last night and her mother 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:52.319
 did this job here 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.239
 when I was younger 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.829
 with hair 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.709
 maybe 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.709
 I don't go for size with tufts of hair because in short 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:04.299
 sorry but 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.999
 crack and pretty hair though so we can do it 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:11.569
 if we really see it it is a job that is good 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:18.679
 we open ris parma houses really saved a lot of money girls 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:38.959

 since I don't even have lol lamellar 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.599
 as a page - then 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.419
 I don't know that the result should come they are pedretti 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.399
 because they are really very finely chopped 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:06.399
 and for now what is the name of the mascara 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:11.559

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:14.389
 so now for photos 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:17.459
 let's try to use them for mascara layers 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.459
 and let's see for a moment 

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:24.159

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:39.080

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.620
 and here we are, uhm, let's take a pass of mascara and then another 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.620

 lot n I do not put the thousand high michelettis to apply on lye 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.740
 it's a rapture 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.979
 what comes out we make an eye with this night eye song without 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.870
 we share the difference together 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.870
 then 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.240
 I already have many sians, however 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.400
 this mascara is beautiful 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:27.300
 now quickly 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.300
 let's go to 

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:35.809
 would you take penis 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:46.569
 happy tittarelli 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:49.569
 on the eyelashes 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.199
 prostrate of mascara 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:06.779

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.590
 i'm well 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:35.879
 cook course 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:37.270
 now let's put it 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.270
 on the other eye only the mascara 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.800
 despite this 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.800
 has a very good mascara we see effect on 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:14.979
 these are the 2 syringes 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.580
 this one seems quite longer 

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:24.990
 at the sight 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.800
 then of course if you want you can drain me mascara 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.169
 directly by aquarium 

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:32.889
 more full-bodied mascara 

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:38.440
 heyy and I could go on with changes the layers of mascara I stopped 

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:40.629
 in 2 layers just to let you see 

00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:41.689

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:43.659
 but it seems to me who and 

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:46.009
 the lines to the name 

00:07:46.009 --> 00:07:47.849
 it is never wrong 

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:49.689
 it's not bad to eat 

00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:51.819
 therefore for cans 

00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:57.099

00:07:57.099 --> 00:08:01.090
