00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.560
 hi friends from youtube here felipe de 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.720
 back with the seventh installment of the 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.849
 curiosities of video games dire 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.310
 some obvious curiosities and others not 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.770
 so obvious but before I start I want to 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.840
 ask them a favor if they know curiosities 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.480
 please send them with pleasure 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.230
 I will show in upcoming videos xd I hope 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.960
 they do 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.880
 well let's start, I'll start with a 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.329
 curiosity that left me impressed 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.950
 I guess they know the ball fighters 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.290
 these characters that have a balloon in 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.090
 his head and they appeared in nes good 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.120
 what happens is that these would come out in 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.220
 vélez yes in melee nintendo made a beta 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.320
 of them but they were never playable 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.180
 Nintendo had to make a difficult 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.690
 decision between the fighters ball and the 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.340
 ice climber and well you know who won 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.740
 he was also about to enter 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.750
 super smash bros brawl doing the threesome 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.869
 of nes games with ice climber yes 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.610
 Pitt but for some reason he could not 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.159
 be incorporated as in the game 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.579
 previous perhaps in the smash bros 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.650
 ultimate has been incorporated into brawl if 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.430
 you use luigi and you throw an object towards 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.100
 down 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.960
 This will distort the face I do is 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.170
 the only character that has a shield 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.150
 different from the others in brawn mario 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.180
 he is the only character who has 5 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.790
 special moves if you put mario 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.010
 link kirby pikachu in a battle in 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.150
 any of the three is more this will be 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.010
 more competitive 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.430
 the characters will make stronger attacks 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.619
 and obviously more damage the end is more than 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.600
 Kirby can be infinite for this you must 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.700
 have to olimar at the moment that kirby 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.009
 make the movement start to take off 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.320
 pikmin these will be absorbed by the 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.090
 kirby's pot over and over and over and over and over and over 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.460
 again 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.619
 xp on stage the shamus can be 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.680
 see jumping from c's smash stage 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.020
 bros melee in it is more than 64 the tomato 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.810
 it heals 100 of damage and the heart leaves you 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.360
 with 0 percentage damage in brawn the tomato 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.450
 they heal 50 damage and the heart only 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.400
 100 leaving the smash in the mario 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.980
 galaxy 2 in the galaxy flames 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.540
 chilling you can see some aliens 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.540
 that are supposedly trees 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.200
 in the final battle it is said that bushehr 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.790
 it would be transformed into came to be but 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.459
 for lack of time nintendo decided 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.760
 cancel that idea imagine it in the 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.409
 final battle would have been more epic 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.810
 before I continue to tell you that this 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.819
 curiosity got her paulillo one a 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.469
 friend of youtube an excellent what in 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.719
 January who knows how to support the 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:49.599
 nintenderos in the description I leave 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:52.280
 the link of your channel so that they visit it 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.859
 it is said that wii had started to 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.569
 develop the 2001 nintendo wise that 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.849
 game cube would not triumph like them 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.859
 They were waiting but they decided to release it 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.099
 since the nintenderos could not be 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:06.290
 lose a new way of playing nintendo 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.769
 this means that nintendo is the only 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.719
 company that gives everything for the client x of 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:15.560
 now as you know this does not come to them 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:17.450
 the head something does not remember the role of 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.549
 nintendo melee club that I showed you 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.129
 in I do not know which good part that can 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.739
 hold said thing in kid icarus 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.900
 uprising in a chapter that I do not remember 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.849
 the number we must reach the castle of 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.099
 jellyfish before entering this one 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.510
 we will have to face a boss and in 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.599
 we can appreciate the 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.879
 of the trifuerza on its wings in this 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.950
 game also appear the subway is pit 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.950
 he knows but he does not want to tell us who 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.959
 are another curiosity is that in some 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.140
 levels an enemy can turn you into 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.079
 the aubergine of the ice climber in spite 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.000
 that it has pick wings can not fly 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:55.400
 now let's go with the trick you can get 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.769
 the augmented reality letters of the kid 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.310
 Icarus totally free here are the 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.310
 shows 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.440
 good now that you know how to print it 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:40.720
 has said x of in sonic generations in 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.630
 radical highway can be seen nice in 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.180
 the bottom if you turn the track map 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.400
 behind the mario kart 7 this will have a 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.229
 great resemblance to the map that appears in 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.560
 the stage of mario kart of smash 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:55.750
 bros brawl ps vita is the first console 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.810
 of zombie in having a complete crosshead 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.360
 like that of the nintendo controls in 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.450
 donkey kong country 2 the characters do not 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.490
 know mathematics x de henán gliders 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.400
 space level 2 of the golden eggs 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.970
 is inspired by the world 11 of super 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.990
 mario bros in super mariobros 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.169
 remastered a message appears 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.670
 subliminal in the world 12 appears the 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.690
 word sex on the wall 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.980
 no matter how much damage to the tails, it will never die 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.020
 remember that in the first part they 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.270
 I said there were only six emeralds in 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.940
 the sonic 1 good now I discovered why 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.770
 7 are in the sounds to the creators of 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.830
 sound liked a lot dragon ball z 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.990
 that's why 7 emeralds come out would be like 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.940
 the seven spheres of the sonic dragon 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.280
 transforms into super sonic because it's 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.930
 Inspired by the Super Saiyan Ying 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.910
 says that shade is inspired by 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.860
 vegueta that can be seen in your 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.710
 attitude and in his hatred towards sonic and 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.690
 silver is inspired by logs in the 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.700
 sound casino you can see some 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:59.150
 things similar to the capitan's shield 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:02.240
 america super mario bros 2 is the first 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.700
 mario in having more than 8 worlds in sonic 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.950
 unleashed sonic transforms into wolf and 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.720
 link in zelda twilight princess also 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.810
 he does that makes reference to 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.970
 'twilight' in super mario kart there is a 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:17.150
 small censorship which can be seen in 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.310
 the Japanese version if you finish the game 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.870
 first of all with pitching user these 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.420
 they will drink alcohol from the bottle that 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.880
 Wii and black appears in award 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.979
 and the black remote wii are totally 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.449
 transparent 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:31.519
 from new super mario bros wii in 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:34.580
 forward you can move mario in the 

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:37.429
 credits when you defeat bowser this 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.619
 will return in a second round in mario 

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:41.659
 parties in the duel to exploit the 

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:43.699
 pump with bowser face can be 

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:46.369
 appreciate the symbol of samos on the floor 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:49.009
 in the rosarium of mario kart rosalina 

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:50.899
 7 you can see a maxi star besides 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:53.419
 the planet appears where you 

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:55.249
 you find the red star in the 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:58.639
 woohoo circuit you can see a 

00:06:55.249 --> 00:07:00.649
 wii airship wii control 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.779
 would be the same as dreamcast but as 

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:05.089
 nintendo saw very advanced technology 

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:08.300
 They decided to make a screen much more 

00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:10.639
 big and tactile you could say that this 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.259
 character of donkey kong country 2 is 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:14.569
 a fusion between sonic and collage 

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:16.759
 remember that in the 90s nintendo and sega 

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:19.610
 they were rivals and they threw any 

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:21.589
 indirect in their games in the lounge 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.719
 crank and you can see the killer arcade 

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:26.239
 instinct and also a picture of where it was 

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:28.189
 on the wall in the game room of 

00:07:26.239 --> 00:07:30.829
 schwank and you can see the balloons of 

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:33.440
 Donkey Kong Country at Donkey Kong 

00:07:30.829 --> 00:07:36.290
 country 3 the bear of the bazaar says 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.390
 can help you in exchange for 500 rupees and 

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:41.600
 in a show more you can see mordecai 

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:43.460
 playing game boy and good friend this was 

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.530
 the seventh part I regret having 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.480
 delayed almost three months is that the 

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:49.490
 school is very heavy and not always 

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.100
 I have the internet at hand to be able 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.170
 put together the video I hope you have 

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:57.970
 enjoyed and see you in three 

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.970
 months with the eighth part xd
