00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.600
 the water wants to tell us something 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.669
 it flows, it jumps, it flutters, it chases, it calls you 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.870
 attention as a child that you do not 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:15.329
 If one day someone did case 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.370
 Doctor Masarweh Moto is a researcher 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:20.220
 Japanese who studies the influence of 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.720
 nature in the water according to him the water 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.450
 remember the places where you have been 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.860
 and this is reflected in the form of their 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.960
 crystals 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.070
 the closer to nature more 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.160
 pretty are the farther away I knew 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.530
 from him a year ago by chance and it's 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.800
 curious because I do not remember in what 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.480
 moment I decided to follow his steps on a motorcycle 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.469
 collected water samples from many 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.679
 sites 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.679
 I settle for a few waterfalls 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:57.000
 lakes pure water and less pure and clear 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.390
 also the water that we drink freshly 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.579
 taken from the spring I became a 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.280
 enthusiastic collector of messages 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.490
 of water the motorcycle glasses spoke 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.270
 of water but from the beginning of a 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.810
 almost magical secret form I felt that 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.229
 they talked about me after all we're not 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.789
 water a water that feels that you think 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:27.300
 doubt and get excited and then it happened 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:30.179
 so without further esteemed mister on a motorcycle I 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.780
 fascinate your work could you go see me 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.780
 Japanese 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.979
 I left my samples and weeks later 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.369
 they returned to my hands turned into 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.369
 Photos 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.000
 and the closer the water is to the 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.539
 Most beautiful nature is the shape of your 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.539
 crystals
