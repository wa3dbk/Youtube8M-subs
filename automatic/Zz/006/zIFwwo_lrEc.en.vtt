00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
like miracles and killer would gang up

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.580 
like miracles and killer would gang up
on<00:01:59.460> him<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.030> don't<00:02:00.240> understand<00:02:00.780> why<00:02:00.810> you

would team up with that again you don't
I<00:02:03.930> mean<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.290> doesn't<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.799> doesn't<00:02:04.829> make<00:02:05.189> sense

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
I mean it doesn't it doesn't make sense

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.109 
I mean it doesn't it doesn't make sense
to<00:02:05.640> me<00:02:05.930> but<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.259> don't<00:02:08.160> know<00:02:08.340> me<00:02:08.520> maybe<00:02:08.879> they

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
to me but I don't know me maybe they

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.210 
to me but I don't know me maybe they
resolve<00:02:09.599> their<00:02:09.810> issues<00:02:10.080> maybe<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.979> know

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
resolve their issues maybe you know

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.350 
resolve their issues maybe you know
we've<00:02:11.310> gotten<00:02:11.580> over<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.820> stuff<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.330> just

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
yeah it's just I don't know it doesn't

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.780 
yeah it's just I don't know it doesn't
make<00:02:18.840> sense<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.200> me<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.410> mean<00:02:19.680> I'm<00:02:20.190> curious<00:02:20.550> to

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
make sense to me I mean I'm curious to

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.910 
make sense to me I mean I'm curious to
see<00:02:21.000> how<00:02:21.330> they<00:02:21.480> do<00:02:21.540> at<00:02:21.930> gfinity<00:02:22.290> when<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.740> comes

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
see how they do at gfinity when it comes

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.650 
see how they do at gfinity when it comes
up<00:02:23.070> you<00:02:23.190> know<00:02:23.310> maybe<00:02:23.490> they'll<00:02:23.790> win<00:02:24.030> again<00:02:24.330> but

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
up you know maybe they'll win again but

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.290 
up you know maybe they'll win again but
i<00:02:25.100> don't<00:02:26.100> know<00:02:26.160> i<00:02:26.190> know<00:02:26.370> i<00:02:26.460> don't<00:02:26.790> like<00:02:26.940> i<00:02:27.150> said

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
i don't know i know i don't like i said

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.480 
i don't know i know i don't like i said
i<00:02:27.330> don't<00:02:27.450> believe<00:02:27.750> in<00:02:28.070> fixing<00:02:29.070> something<00:02:29.280> if

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
i don't believe in fixing something if

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.240 
i don't believe in fixing something if
it<00:02:29.580> isn't<00:02:29.850> broken<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.740> you<00:02:31.740> know<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:32.070> i'm

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
it isn't broken and you know that i'm

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.800 
it isn't broken and you know that i'm
assuming<00:02:32.580> they<00:02:33.000> have<00:02:33.150> their<00:02:33.300> own<00:02:33.330> reasons<00:02:33.570> for

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
assuming they have their own reasons for

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.290 
assuming they have their own reasons for
doing<00:02:34.080> what<00:02:34.140> they<00:02:34.290> did<00:02:34.350> but<00:02:34.860> i<00:02:35.240> still<00:02:36.240> don't

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
doing what they did but i still don't

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.110 
doing what they did but i still don't
agree<00:02:36.540> with<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.110> like<00:02:37.590> i<00:02:37.680> said<00:02:37.890> if<00:02:38.670> your<00:02:38.940> team

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
agree with it I like i said if your team

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.970 
agree with it I like i said if your team
is<00:02:39.150> doing<00:02:39.480> well<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.050> your<00:02:40.230> team<00:02:40.440> just<00:02:40.710> won<00:02:40.920> a

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
is doing well and your team just won a

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.530 
is doing well and your team just won a
championship<00:02:41.280> there's<00:02:41.850> no<00:02:42.000> reason<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.450> change

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
championship there's no reason to change

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.710 
championship there's no reason to change
your<00:02:42.900> team<00:02:43.110> there<00:02:43.320> really<00:02:43.560> isn't<00:02:43.890> but<00:02:44.820> like<00:02:45.660> i

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
your team there really isn't but like i

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.360 
your team there really isn't but like i
said<00:02:45.750> i'm<00:02:45.990> not<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.200> pro<00:02:46.380> player<00:02:46.410> i<00:02:46.650> don't<00:02:47.130> know

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
said i'm not a pro player i don't know

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.620 
said i'm not a pro player i don't know
why<00:02:47.580> they<00:02:47.730> do<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.970> things<00:02:48.000> they<00:02:48.240> do<00:02:48.390> sometimes

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
why they do the things they do sometimes

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.140 
why they do the things they do sometimes
so<00:02:49.320> there's<00:02:49.740> got<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.280> be<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.370> reason<00:02:50.520> behind<00:02:50.760> it

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
so there's got to be a reason behind it

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.180 
so there's got to be a reason behind it
maybe<00:02:51.510> they<00:02:51.660> think<00:02:51.720> they'll<00:02:52.050> be<00:02:52.470> somehow<00:02:52.830> be

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
maybe they think they'll be somehow be

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.170 
maybe they think they'll be somehow be
even<00:02:53.550> stronger<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:54.120> don't<00:02:54.330> know<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:55.490> yeah<00:02:56.490> so

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
even stronger I don't know and yeah so

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.120 
even stronger I don't know and yeah so
thanks<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:58.170> got<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.620> know<00:02:58.709> thanks<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.040> you

so I I don't know I I might make a

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.850 
so I I don't know I I might make a
separate<00:03:15.930> video<00:03:16.050> about<00:03:16.380> that<00:03:16.560> i'm<00:03:16.680> not<00:03:16.739> sure

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
separate video about that i'm not sure

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.140 
separate video about that i'm not sure
but<00:03:17.900> yeah<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.290> later<00:03:20.160> on<00:03:20.310> today<00:03:20.519> i'm<00:03:20.760> going<00:03:20.970> to

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.460 
get a complexity video out i did a test
on<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:23.970> i<00:03:24.209> recorded<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:24.989> i'm<00:03:25.140> gonna<00:03:25.290> show
