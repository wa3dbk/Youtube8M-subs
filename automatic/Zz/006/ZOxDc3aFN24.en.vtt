00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.800 
it is on your image you want to drag it
up<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.840> corner<00:02:04.579> make<00:02:05.579> sure<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.850> fits<00:02:06.119> then

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
up to the corner make sure it fits then

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.050 
up to the corner make sure it fits then
go<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.990> edit<00:02:08.509> free<00:02:09.509> transform<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.879> it<00:02:11.879> already

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
go to edit free transform and it already

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.820 
go to edit free transform and it already
fits<00:02:12.360> my<00:02:12.540> image<00:02:12.840> but<00:02:13.050> some<00:02:13.349> of<00:02:13.470> them<00:02:13.620> won't

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
fits my image but some of them won't

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.030 
fits my image but some of them won't
they<00:02:14.129> might<00:02:14.849> be<00:02:14.970> too<00:02:15.120> small<00:02:15.300> or<00:02:15.720> too<00:02:15.780> big<00:02:16.040> but

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
they might be too small or too big but

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.190 
they might be too small or too big but
when<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.310> do<00:02:17.459> want<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.790> drag<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.239> you<00:02:18.840> hit<00:02:18.989> this

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
when you do want to drag it you hit this

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.320 
when you do want to drag it you hit this
you<00:02:19.500> hold<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.950> shift<00:02:20.190> key<00:02:20.310> on<00:02:20.760> your<00:02:21.150> keyboard

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
you hold the shift key on your keyboard

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.860 
you hold the shift key on your keyboard
and<00:02:21.660> then<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:22.530> drag<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.569> then<00:02:24.569> that<00:02:24.720> way

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
and then you drag it and then that way

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.220 
and then you drag it and then that way
it<00:02:25.050> won't<00:02:25.170> get<00:02:25.440> completely<00:02:26.190> distorted

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
it won't get completely distorted

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.070 
it won't get completely distorted
because<00:02:28.230> if<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:29.220> don't<00:02:29.520> hold<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.390> can<00:02:30.780> get

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
because if you don't hold it it can get

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.960 
because if you don't hold it it can get
really<00:02:31.349> too<00:02:31.620> started<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.160> mean<00:02:32.370> if<00:02:32.519> you<00:02:32.640> want<00:02:32.849> to

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
really too started I mean if you want to

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.089 
really too started I mean if you want to
do<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.239> come<00:02:33.420> but<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:34.019> like<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.830> keep<00:02:34.950> it

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
do that you come but I like to keep it

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.550 
do that you come but I like to keep it
that<00:02:35.250> way<00:02:35.280> nice<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.640> simple<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:37.200> next<00:02:37.440> thing

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
that way nice and simple the next thing

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.140 
that way nice and simple the next thing
you'll<00:02:37.680> notice<00:02:37.890> is<00:02:38.220> there<00:02:38.550> is<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.700> white<00:02:38.940> box

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
you'll notice is there is a white box

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.369 
you'll notice is there is a white box
next<00:02:39.599> to<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:40.739> layer<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.610> just<00:02:44.610> them

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
next to the layer and that is just them

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.009 
next to the layer and that is just them
so<00:02:46.379> that<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.590> can<00:02:46.769> erase<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.310> off<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.420> face<00:02:48.599> or

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
so that you can erase it off the face or

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.540 
so that you can erase it off the face or
on<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.290> eyes<00:02:49.470> or<00:02:49.860> let's<00:02:50.160> say<00:02:50.280> there's<00:02:50.489> a

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
on the eyes or let's say there's a

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.220 
on the eyes or let's say there's a
snowflake<00:02:50.970> somewhere<00:02:51.629> you<00:02:51.780> really<00:02:52.050> don't

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
snowflake somewhere you really don't

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.160 
snowflake somewhere you really don't
want<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.530> or<00:02:52.739> even<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.489> flare<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.750> double

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
want it or even the flare so you double

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.460 
want it or even the flare so you double
click<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:56.340> mask<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:57.390> then<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:57.989> go<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.140> hit

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
click it the mask and then you go to hit

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.860 
click it the mask and then you go to hit
your<00:02:58.650> paintbrush<00:02:59.159> make<00:02:59.879> sure<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.360> opacity<00:03:00.569> is

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
your paintbrush make sure the opacity is

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.960 
your paintbrush make sure the opacity is
all<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.170> way<00:03:01.230> up<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.440> 100<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.569> black<00:03:03.569> erases

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
all the way up to 100 and black erases

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.000 
all the way up to 100 and black erases
and<00:03:06.510> later<00:03:06.750> so<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.350> want<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.650> make<00:03:07.770> sure<00:03:07.800> it's

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
and later so you want to make sure it's

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.550 
and later so you want to make sure it's
black<00:03:08.220> then<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.500> double<00:03:10.500> click<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.930> you

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
black then you double click it and you

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.330 
black then you double click it and you
can<00:03:13.740> erase<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.250> any<00:03:15.060> way<00:03:15.270> you'd<00:03:15.450> like<00:03:19.190> if<00:03:20.190> you

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
can erase it any way you'd like if you

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.670 
can erase it any way you'd like if you
want<00:03:20.550> to<00:03:20.640> paint<00:03:20.880> back<00:03:21.150> on<00:03:23.960> you<00:03:24.960> can<00:03:25.200> put<00:03:25.590> it

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
want to paint back on you can put it

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.410 
want to paint back on you can put it
right<00:03:25.710> back<00:03:25.890> onto<00:03:26.130> by<00:03:26.820> hitting<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.360> white<00:03:27.740> box

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
right back onto by hitting the white box

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:37.210 
right back onto by hitting the white box
so<00:03:30.420> I'm<00:03:30.510> just<00:03:30.720> going<00:03:30.960> to<00:03:31.350> put<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:31.980> back<00:03:32.160> here

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
so let's hit butt off again let's say I

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.950 
so let's hit butt off again let's say I
want<00:03:49.470> some<00:03:51.740> winter<00:03:52.740> haze<00:03:53.360> make<00:03:54.360> sure<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.570> click

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
want some winter haze make sure I click

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.960 
want some winter haze make sure I click
the<00:03:55.170> eye<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.710> click<00:03:55.920> on<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.370> actual<00:03:56.730> layer

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
the eye and click on the actual layer

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:06.090 
the eye and click on the actual layer
drag<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:58.080> down<00:03:58.970> and<00:03:59.970> drag<00:04:00.420> it<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.570> my<00:04:00.720> image

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:14.119 

I'm<00:04:06.850> going<00:04:07.210> to<00:04:07.570> mask<00:04:07.810> off<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.320> face<00:04:08.530> again

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.520 

and<00:04:14.219> if<00:04:14.670> you<00:04:14.790> notice<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.719> can<00:04:15.900> also<00:04:16.079> change

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
and if you notice you can also change

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.050 
and if you notice you can also change
the<00:04:17.009> opacity<00:04:17.910> on<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:19.229> actual<00:04:19.739> layer<00:04:19.979> too<00:04:20.310> so

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
the opacity on the actual layer too so

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.850 
the opacity on the actual layer too so
it's<00:04:21.209> at<00:04:21.329> 12<00:04:21.630> percent<00:04:21.750> I<00:04:22.109> figured<00:04:22.590> that<00:04:22.740> would

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
it's at 12 percent I figured that would

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.040 
it's at 12 percent I figured that would
be<00:04:22.889> a<00:04:23.009> nice<00:04:23.220> one<00:04:23.789> to<00:04:23.850> go<00:04:24.300> with<00:04:24.570> but<00:04:24.720> you<00:04:24.900> can

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
be a nice one to go with but you can

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.529 
be a nice one to go with but you can
also<00:04:25.430> make<00:04:26.430> it<00:04:26.460> a<00:04:26.789> little<00:04:27.389> less<00:04:28.020> or<00:04:28.940> more<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.240> I

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
also make it a little less or more and I

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:31.580 
also make it a little less or more and I
was<00:04:30.690> saying<00:04:30.900> you<00:04:31.080> don't<00:04:31.199> want<00:04:31.320> it<00:04:31.380> that<00:04:31.560> much

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
was saying you don't want it that much
