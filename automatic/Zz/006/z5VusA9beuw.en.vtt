I've got for you here and this one has
been<00:00:17.490> out<00:00:17.730> for<00:00:18.150> quite<00:00:18.180> some<00:00:19.020> time<00:00:19.050> it's<00:00:19.529> called

been out for quite some time it's called

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.040 
been out for quite some time it's called
the<00:00:19.859> age<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.369> cubes<00:00:20.760> add<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.390> certainly<00:00:21.840> looks

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the age of cubes add it certainly looks

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.990 
the age of cubes add it certainly looks
quite<00:00:22.529> interesting<00:00:23.100> at<00:00:23.279> first<00:00:23.310> glance<00:00:23.789> you

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
quite interesting at first glance you

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.880 
quite interesting at first glance you
might<00:00:24.210> be<00:00:24.330> thinking<00:00:24.449> well<00:00:24.660> yeah<00:00:25.500> what<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
might be thinking well yeah what the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.380 
might be thinking well yeah what the
hell<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.640> think<00:00:27.119> it's<00:00:27.210> actually

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
hell is this I think it's actually

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.990 
hell is this I think it's actually
pretty<00:00:27.990> cool<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.650> basically<00:00:29.010> turns<00:00:29.310> all<00:00:29.640> of

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
pretty cool it basically turns all of

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.939 
pretty cool it basically turns all of
the<00:00:30.119> age<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.330> empires<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:31.019> resources<00:00:31.650> and

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
the age of empires to resources and

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.790 
the age of empires to resources and
terrains<00:00:32.460> into<00:00:33.270> flat<00:00:33.719> color<00:00:34.079> textures<00:00:34.590> and

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
terrains into flat color textures and

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.209 
terrains into flat color textures and
cubes<00:00:35.640> as<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.510> can<00:00:36.719> probably<00:00:37.200> tell<00:00:37.440> we<00:00:38.160> are

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
cubes as you can probably tell we are

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.680 
cubes as you can probably tell we are
going<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.370> be<00:00:38.460> using<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.820> little<00:00:39.000> psychic<00:00:39.329> here

while<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.660> fact<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.469> think<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:55.829> been

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
while and in fact I think it's been

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.920 
while and in fact I think it's been
almost<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.309> year<00:00:56.340> since<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:57.000> was<00:00:57.090> updated<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.719> I

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
almost a year since it was updated and I

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.660 
almost a year since it was updated and I
died<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.559> don't<00:00:58.920> know<00:00:58.980> I've<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.219> not<00:00:59.489> got

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
died I don't know I've just not got

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.700 
died I don't know I've just not got
around<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.120> covering<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.109> it's<00:01:01.350> kind<00:01:01.620> of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
around to covering this it's kind of

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.950 
around to covering this it's kind of
stuff<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.520> want<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.760> start<00:01:03.030> doing<00:01:03.570> some

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
we've got our standard resources we've

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.210 
we've got our standard resources we've
got<00:01:11.790> wood<00:01:12.030> food<00:01:12.570> gold<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.320> stone<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:14.070> they

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
got wood food gold and stone but they

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.550 
got wood food gold and stone but they
are<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:14.729> cubes<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.229> see<00:01:16.350> at<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.470> top

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
are now cubes and you can see at the top

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.950 
are now cubes and you can see at the top
there<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> UI<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:18.000> has<00:01:18.150> been<00:01:18.299> updated<00:01:18.780> as

there on the UI it has been updated as

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.990 
there on the UI it has been updated as
well<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.439> represent<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.100> we<00:01:20.490> have<00:01:20.640> wood<00:01:20.850> is

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
well to represent that we have wood is

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.440 
well to represent that we have wood is
green<00:01:21.180> food<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.229> red<00:01:22.500> gold<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> yellow<00:01:24.060> and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
green food is red gold is a yellow and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.649 
green food is red gold is a yellow and
stone<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> grey<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.100> what<00:01:26.970> Bob's<00:01:27.330> going<00:01:27.570> to

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
stone is a grey and what Bob's going to

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.929 
stone is a grey and what Bob's going to
go<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.960> chop<00:01:28.619> some<00:01:28.829> resources<00:01:29.280> we've<00:01:29.549> got<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
go and chop some resources we've got the

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.179 
go and chop some resources we've got the
trees<00:01:30.360> here<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.290> map<00:01:31.470> which<00:01:31.710> are<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
trees here on the map which are the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.730 
trees here on the map which are the
large<00:01:32.460> cubes<00:01:32.909> easy<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.750> spot<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.320> if<00:01:34.619> we

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
large cubes easy to spot and if we

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.289 
large cubes easy to spot and if we
right-click<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.520> see<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.880> once<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
right-click we can see that once the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.700 
right-click we can see that once the
tree<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.659> actually<00:01:37.079> chopped<00:01:37.350> down<00:01:37.530> they

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
tree is actually chopped down they

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.670 
tree is actually chopped down they
become<00:01:37.979> smaller<00:01:38.880> cubes<00:01:39.600> as<00:01:39.869> well<00:01:40.259> every

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
become smaller cubes as well every

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.620 
become smaller cubes as well every
single<00:01:40.950> tree<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.610> game<00:01:41.790> no<00:01:42.210> matter<00:01:42.329> what

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
single tree in the game no matter what

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.200 
single tree in the game no matter what
type<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.829> green<00:01:44.220> cube<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.060> is

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
type it is is a green cube and this is

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.700 
type it is is a green cube and this is
actually<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> snow<00:01:45.840> pine<00:01:46.170> tree<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.470> would<00:01:46.680> you

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
actually a snow pine tree in would you

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.310 
actually a snow pine tree in would you
believe<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.340> Ed's<00:01:47.610> not<00:01:48.420> snowy<00:01:48.750> at<00:01:48.930> all<00:01:49.079> it's

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
believe it Ed's not snowy at all it's

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.530 
believe it Ed's not snowy at all it's
just<00:01:49.380> green<00:01:49.740> very<00:01:50.520> simplistic<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.299> I

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
just green very simplistic and I

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.030 
just green very simplistic and I
actually<00:01:51.720> really<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.770> way<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.009> looks

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
actually really like the way it looks

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.969 
actually really like the way it looks
unfortunately<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.420> UI<00:01:54.720> hasn't<00:01:55.259> updated<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
unfortunately the UI hasn't updated and

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.330 
unfortunately the UI hasn't updated and
the<00:01:56.759> cubes<00:01:57.450> aren't<00:01:58.170> shown<00:01:58.409> off<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.799> UI<00:01:58.979> here

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the cubes aren't shown off the UI here

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.709 
the cubes aren't shown off the UI here
it's<00:01:59.490> still<00:01:59.700> these<00:01:59.880> standard<00:02:00.360> resources

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
it's still these standard resources

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.030 
it's still these standard resources
there<00:02:01.170> but<00:02:01.350> there<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.530> go<00:02:01.619> there's<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> bit<00:02:01.950> of

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
there but there you go there's a bit of

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.740 
there but there you go there's a bit of
stone<00:02:02.250> we've<00:02:02.729> also<00:02:02.880> got<00:02:03.060> these<00:02:03.180> sure<00:02:03.479> fish

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
stone we've also got these sure fish

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.889 
stone we've also got these sure fish
here<00:02:04.020> which<00:02:05.009> are<00:02:05.189> these<00:02:05.369> little<00:02:05.520> red<00:02:06.360> or<00:02:06.630> Bobby

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
here which are these little red or Bobby

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.320 
here which are these little red or Bobby
ones<00:02:07.229> we<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:08.069> go<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.520> gather<00:02:08.640> some<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.119> that

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
ones we can go and gather some of that

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.720 
ones we can go and gather some of that
just<00:02:09.989> casting<00:02:10.440> our<00:02:10.560> net<00:02:10.739> out<00:02:10.920> catching<00:02:11.310> some

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
just casting our net out catching some

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.220 
just casting our net out catching some
cubes<00:02:12.120> why<00:02:12.330> not<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.989> we've

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
cubes why not and we've

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.680 
cubes why not and we've
also<00:02:13.440> got<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.769> deep<00:02:14.129> sea<00:02:14.400> fish<00:02:14.700> as<00:02:14.909> well<00:02:15.330> which

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
also got the deep sea fish as well which

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.320 
also got the deep sea fish as well which
are<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.370> four<00:02:17.370> squares<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.909> are<00:02:18.060> kind<00:02:18.239> of

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
are the four squares that are kind of

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.390 
are the four squares that are kind of
bobbing<00:02:18.540> up<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.840> down<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:19.049> bit<00:02:19.319> bigger<00:02:19.590> and

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
bobbing up and down a bit bigger and

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.680 
bobbing up and down a bit bigger and
these<00:02:20.610> ones<00:02:20.940> over<00:02:21.150> here<00:02:21.180> these<00:02:21.450> are<00:02:21.510> the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
these ones over here these are the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.960 
these ones over here these are the
forage<00:02:22.019> bushes<00:02:22.409> and<00:02:22.560> all<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.220> animals<00:02:23.610> all<00:02:23.849> of

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
forage bushes and all the animals all of

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.670 
forage bushes and all the animals all of
the<00:02:24.090> board<00:02:24.450> ear<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.049> all<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.260> stuff

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
the board ear and all of that stuff

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.710 
the board ear and all of that stuff
remains<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.519> same<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.239> only<00:02:27.450> the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
remains the same it is only the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.190 
remains the same it is only the
resources<00:02:28.970> like<00:02:29.970> this<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.420> are<00:02:30.660> available

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
resources like this that are available

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.890 
resources like this that are available
in<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.769> cube<00:02:32.040> form<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.640> fortunately<00:02:33.540> the

in the cube form and fortunately the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.890 
in the cube form and fortunately the
deer<00:02:34.140> have<00:02:34.440> not<00:02:34.709> be<00:02:34.890> transformed<00:02:35.700> into<00:02:35.970> their

deer have not be transformed into their
cubic<00:02:37.260> cousins<00:02:37.739> we<00:02:38.190> also<00:02:38.310> had<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.580> farms<00:02:39.000> as

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
cubic cousins we also had the farms as

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.850 
cubic cousins we also had the farms as
well<00:02:39.329> which<00:02:39.540> have<00:02:39.690> been<00:02:39.780> updated<00:02:40.290> which<00:02:40.680> look

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
well which have been updated which look

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.680 
well which have been updated which look
really<00:02:41.129> cool<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:41.700> really<00:02:42.329> like<00:02:42.510> these

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
really cool I I really like these

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.140 
really cool I I really like these
textures<00:02:43.379> this<00:02:44.250> isn't<00:02:44.549> actually<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.849> placed

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
textures this isn't actually a placed

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.180 
textures this isn't actually a placed
fun<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.569> is<00:02:45.599> just<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.930> terrain<00:02:46.319> but<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.099> would

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
fun this is just a terrain but you would

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.589 
fun this is just a terrain but you would
be<00:02:47.250> able<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.549> gather<00:02:47.730> from<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.030> one<00:02:48.360> this<00:02:48.540> is

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
be able to gather from this one this is

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.619 
be able to gather from this one this is
the<00:02:48.780> farm<00:02:49.739> as<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.160> is<00:02:50.280> built<00:02:50.579> and<00:02:50.819> that<00:02:51.299> is<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
the farm as it is built and that is the

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.390 
the farm as it is built and that is the
farm<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.470> will<00:02:52.590> be<00:02:52.620> gathering<00:02:53.099> from

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
farm that you will be gathering from

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.880 
farm that you will be gathering from
well<00:02:54.390> it's<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.599> hundred<00:02:54.930> percent<00:02:55.049> complete<00:02:55.680> and

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
well it's a hundred percent complete and

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.009 
well it's a hundred percent complete and
then<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.400> course<00:02:56.430> we<00:02:56.819> have<00:02:56.970> got<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.180> depleted

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
then of course we have got the depleted

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.349 
then of course we have got the depleted
farm<00:02:58.290> as<00:02:58.530> well<00:02:58.859> it's<00:02:59.310> really<00:02:59.519> simple<00:02:59.730> now<00:03:00.150> it

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
farm as well it's really simple now it

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.150 
farm as well it's really simple now it
certainly<00:03:00.629> makes<00:03:00.750> things<00:03:00.870> very<00:03:01.109> easy<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.859> see

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
certainly makes things very easy to see

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.460 
certainly makes things very easy to see
you<00:03:02.549> can<00:03:02.670> see<00:03:02.790> Bob<00:03:03.030> here<00:03:03.299> walking<00:03:03.750> over<00:03:04.170> the

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
you can see Bob here walking over the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.759 
you can see Bob here walking over the
shallows<00:03:05.190> we've<00:03:05.790> also<00:03:05.940> got<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.769> shallow

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
shallows we've also got the shallow

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.920 
shallows we've also got the shallow
water<00:03:08.069> we've<00:03:08.489> got<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.910> medium<00:03:09.390> water<00:03:09.569> and<00:03:09.870> a

water we've got the medium water and a

water we've got the medium water and a
deep<00:03:10.140> water<00:03:10.410> we've<00:03:11.040> also<00:03:11.190> got<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.519> ton<00:03:11.849> of<00:03:11.879> other

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
deep water we've also got a ton of other

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.380 
deep water we've also got a ton of other
terrains<00:03:12.720> as<00:03:12.989> well<00:03:13.260> just<00:03:13.680> simplified<00:03:14.549> and<00:03:14.879> I

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
terrains as well just simplified and I

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.210 
terrains as well just simplified and I
don't<00:03:15.660> know<00:03:15.780> what<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:16.019> is<00:03:16.049> about<00:03:16.349> this<00:03:16.530> mod<00:03:17.040> but

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
don't know what it is about this mod but

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.640 
don't know what it is about this mod but
it<00:03:17.340> certainly<00:03:17.579> has<00:03:17.940> quite<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.690> bit<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:18.989> charm<00:03:19.349> to

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
it certainly has quite a bit of charm to

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.490 
it certainly has quite a bit of charm to
it<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.919> I<00:03:20.280> don't<00:03:20.489> know<00:03:20.700> if<00:03:20.910> I<00:03:21.120> could<00:03:21.180> do<00:03:21.690> kind

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
it and I don't know if I could do kind

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.559 
it and I don't know if I could do kind
of<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:23.040> know<00:03:23.069> look<00:03:23.400> at<00:03:23.519> this<00:03:23.730> for<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.030> long<00:03:24.239> time

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
of you know look at this for a long time

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.870 
of you know look at this for a long time
but<00:03:24.870> it<00:03:25.349> certainly<00:03:25.590> makes<00:03:25.889> things<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.549> little

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
but it certainly makes things a little

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.210 
but it certainly makes things a little
bit<00:03:27.030> interesting<00:03:27.569> we've<00:03:27.690> got<00:03:27.840> ice<00:03:28.049> snow<00:03:28.560> we

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
bit interesting we've got ice snow we

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.680 
bit interesting we've got ice snow we
got<00:03:29.400> road<00:03:29.760> in<00:03:30.030> here<00:03:30.269> we<00:03:30.389> got<00:03:30.540> all<00:03:30.660> the

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
got road in here we got all the

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.240 
got road in here we got all the
different<00:03:30.989> types<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.349> grass<00:03:31.680> we've<00:03:31.950> got<00:03:32.099> the

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
different types of grass we've got the

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.940 
different types of grass we've got the
dirt<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:32.880> all<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.150> air<00:03:33.329> the<00:03:33.829> what's<00:03:34.829> it

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
dirt and all the air the what's it

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.210 
dirt and all the air the what's it
called<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.569> desert<00:03:36.569> stuff<00:03:36.870> as<00:03:37.079> well<00:03:37.290> it's<00:03:37.620> it

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
called the desert stuff as well it's it

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.190 
called the desert stuff as well it's it
looks<00:03:38.430> really<00:03:38.790> nice<00:03:39.150> we've<00:03:39.630> also<00:03:39.780> got<00:03:40.019> the

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
looks really nice we've also got the

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.729 
looks really nice we've also got the
terrain<00:03:41.299> sort<00:03:42.299> of<00:03:42.419> guidelines<00:03:42.930> these<00:03:43.230> squares

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
terrain sort of guidelines these squares

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.009 
terrain sort of guidelines these squares
on<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.069> terrain<00:03:44.849> which<00:03:45.329> does<00:03:45.569> make<00:03:45.599> it<00:03:45.930> easier

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
on the terrain which does make it easier

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.050 
on the terrain which does make it easier
to<00:03:46.349> kind<00:03:46.560> of<00:03:46.709> see<00:03:46.950> hills<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.519> stuff<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:47.970> in

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
to kind of see hills and stuff and in

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.460 
to kind of see hills and stuff and in
fact<00:03:48.209> took<00:03:48.359> a<00:03:48.450> little<00:03:48.630> demonstration<00:03:48.959> over

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
fact took a little demonstration over

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.839 
fact took a little demonstration over
here<00:03:49.650> you<00:03:50.040> can<00:03:50.190> see<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.400> little<00:03:50.639> bit<00:03:50.790> of

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
here you can see a little bit of

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.120 
here you can see a little bit of
elevation<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.810> does<00:03:51.989> make<00:03:52.139> it<00:03:52.349> certainly<00:03:53.010> a

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
elevation it does make it certainly a

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.220 
elevation it does make it certainly a
little<00:03:53.400> bit<00:03:53.549> easier<00:03:53.639> to<00:03:54.030> see<00:03:54.480> exactly<00:03:54.720> where

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
little bit easier to see exactly where

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.129 
little bit easier to see exactly where
the<00:03:55.380> hills<00:03:55.590> are<00:03:55.889> and<00:03:56.099> I<00:03:56.340> know<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:57.139> standard

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
the hills are and I know in the standard

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.470 
the hills are and I know in the standard
game<00:03:58.290> without<00:03:58.470> this<00:03:58.799> texture<00:03:59.370> modpack<00:03:59.910> it

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
game without this texture modpack it

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.849 
game without this texture modpack it
can't<00:04:00.690> be<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:00.810> little<00:04:00.900> bit<00:04:01.079> difficult<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.650> see

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
can't be a little bit difficult to see

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.800 
can't be a little bit difficult to see
exactly<00:04:02.129> where<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:02.730> hills<00:04:02.940> are<00:04:03.269> so<00:04:03.510> it

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
exactly where the hills are so it

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.059 
exactly where the hills are so it
certainly<00:04:03.959> makes<00:04:04.200> things<00:04:04.319> slightly<00:04:04.829> easier

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
certainly makes things slightly easier

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.740 
certainly makes things slightly easier
in<00:04:05.400> that<00:04:05.519> respect<00:04:05.910> we've<00:04:06.269> also<00:04:06.419> got<00:04:06.599> the

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
in that respect we've also got the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.809 
in that respect we've also got the
cliffs<00:04:07.169> which<00:04:07.440> personally<00:04:08.040> I<00:04:08.160> think<00:04:08.220> are<00:04:08.760> a

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
cliffs which personally I think are a

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.390 
cliffs which personally I think are a
little<00:04:09.150> bit<00:04:09.389> strange<00:04:09.980> it's<00:04:10.980> really<00:04:11.160> difficult

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
little bit strange it's really difficult

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.369 
little bit strange it's really difficult
to<00:04:11.699> kind<00:04:11.819> of<00:04:11.940> see<00:04:12.120> what's<00:04:12.329> going<00:04:12.629> on<00:04:12.750> here<00:04:12.989> it

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
to kind of see what's going on here it

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:14.960 
to kind of see what's going on here it
is<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.620> little<00:04:13.799> bit<00:04:13.949> almost<00:04:14.190> of<00:04:14.519> an<00:04:14.609> optical

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
is a little bit almost of an optical

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.879 
is a little bit almost of an optical
illusion<00:04:15.060> with<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.229> higher<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.769> lower

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
illusion with the higher and lower

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.969 
illusion with the higher and lower
ground<00:04:17.359> there's<00:04:18.359> no<00:04:18.449> actual<00:04:18.799> gradient<00:04:19.799> it's

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
ground there's no actual gradient it's

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.490 
ground there's no actual gradient it's
just<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.669> way<00:04:20.789> the<00:04:20.970> cliffs<00:04:21.239> work<00:04:21.599> and<00:04:22.109> I<00:04:22.320> don't

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
just the way the cliffs work and I don't

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.740 
just the way the cliffs work and I don't
know<00:04:22.590> it<00:04:22.800> sadly<00:04:23.130> looks<00:04:23.419> interesting<00:04:24.419> to<00:04:24.599> say

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
know it sadly looks interesting to say

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.930 
know it sadly looks interesting to say
the<00:04:24.780> least<00:04:24.930> but<00:04:25.349> it<00:04:25.680> does<00:04:26.130> get<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.370> little

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
the least but it does get a little

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.820 
the least but it does get a little
weird<00:04:27.270> when<00:04:27.600> the<00:04:27.720> cliffs<00:04:27.990> are<00:04:28.200> all<00:04:28.260> kind<00:04:28.740> of

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
weird when the cliffs are all kind of

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.310 
weird when the cliffs are all kind of
mushed<00:04:29.100> up<00:04:29.250> like<00:04:29.520> that<00:04:29.730> we<00:04:30.660> also<00:04:30.840> do<00:04:31.110> have

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
mushed up like that we also do have

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.040 
mushed up like that we also do have
though<00:04:31.560> I<00:04:31.770> just<00:04:31.800> noticed<00:04:32.460> my<00:04:33.300> resources<00:04:33.930> at

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
though I just noticed my resources at

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.990 
though I just noticed my resources at
the<00:04:34.140> top<00:04:34.290> they've<00:04:34.470> gone<00:04:34.590> different<00:04:35.280> color<00:04:35.460> why

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
the top they've gone different color why

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000 
the top they've gone different color why
is<00:04:36.360> that<00:04:36.480> why<00:04:36.840> they<00:04:37.050> now<00:04:37.170> you<00:04:37.200> why<00:04:37.650> they<00:04:37.800> white

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
is that why they now you why they white

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.610 
is that why they now you why they white
why<00:04:38.730> they<00:04:38.940> now<00:04:39.090> red<00:04:39.360> they're<00:04:39.990> flashing<00:04:40.290> at<00:04:40.590> me

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
why they now red they're flashing at me

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.350 
why they now red they're flashing at me
I<00:04:40.770> didn't<00:04:41.190> even<00:04:41.250> notice<00:04:41.520> that<00:04:41.730> before<00:04:42.000> that's

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
I didn't even notice that before that's

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.690 
I didn't even notice that before that's
really<00:04:42.630> cool<00:04:42.890> but<00:04:43.890> what<00:04:44.040> they<00:04:44.160> are<00:04:44.250> certainly

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
really cool but what they are certainly

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.610 
really cool but what they are certainly
certainly<00:04:45.270> like<00:04:45.570> about<00:04:45.900> this<00:04:46.020> mod<00:04:46.230> is<00:04:46.380> the

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
certainly like about this mod is the

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.980 
certainly like about this mod is the
ability<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:47.400> do<00:04:47.490> some<00:04:47.700> pretty<00:04:48.120> weird<00:04:48.360> stuff<00:04:48.540> I

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
ability to do some pretty weird stuff I

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.990 
ability to do some pretty weird stuff I
decided<00:04:49.500> to<00:04:49.680> make<00:04:49.710> a<00:04:49.830> tower<00:04:50.130> of<00:04:50.310> cubes<00:04:50.790> right

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
decided to make a tower of cubes right

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.390 
decided to make a tower of cubes right

wherever you like so there you go I made

a<00:05:03.060> little<00:05:03.210> I<00:05:03.750> don't<00:05:03.960> know<00:05:04.200> if<00:05:04.320> that's

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
a little I don't know if that's

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.560 
a little I don't know if that's
technically<00:05:04.950> an<00:05:05.100> optical<00:05:05.460> illusion<00:05:05.520> but<00:05:06.480> it

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
technically an optical illusion but it

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.930 
technically an optical illusion but it
was<00:05:06.660> inspired<00:05:07.110> by<00:05:07.230> one<00:05:07.530> anyway<00:05:08.040> and<00:05:08.280> I'd

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
was inspired by one anyway and I'd
