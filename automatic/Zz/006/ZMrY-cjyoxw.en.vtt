yet I think it's like probably next week
or<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.560> know<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.710> guess<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.010> upcoming<00:00:26.220> Sunday

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699

or you know I guess this upcoming Sunday
or<00:00:26.789> whatever<00:00:27.060> they'll<00:00:28.050> be<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.380> anime<00:00:28.680> but

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
or whatever they'll be in the anime but

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.310 
or whatever they'll be in the anime but
it's<00:00:29.609> more<00:00:29.789> chronomaly<00:00:30.330> support<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.050> her

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
it's more chronomaly support and her

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.380 
it's more chronomaly support and her
like<00:00:31.529> be<00:00:31.859> support<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.759> thought<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.300> was

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
like be support so I thought it was

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
it being the most usable I mean the only

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
don't use that as often I guess there's

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.899 
don't use that as often I guess there's
a<00:01:28.110> few<00:01:28.229> decks<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.560> still<00:01:28.829> do<00:01:28.979> but<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.490> mean

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
a few decks that still do but I mean

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.460 
a few decks that still do but I mean
it's<00:01:30.060> not<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:30.900> not<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.079> where<00:01:31.439> I

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
it's not like it's not like where I

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.300 
don't know six months ago to a year ago
or<00:01:33.689> seemed<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:33.990> every<00:01:34.259> deck<00:01:34.409> used<00:01:34.799> rescue

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
or seemed like every deck used rescue

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.940 
or seemed like every deck used rescue
rabbit<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.750> mean<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.350> won't<00:01:37.500> really<00:01:37.590> combo

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
rabbit so I mean it won't really combo

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.050 
rabbit so I mean it won't really combo
against<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.369> guess<00:01:38.549> too<00:01:38.759> well<00:01:38.909> because

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
against that I guess too well because

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.120 
against that I guess too well because
not<00:01:39.360> many<00:01:39.750> people<00:01:39.960> use<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.530> good<00:01:41.009> thing

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
not many people use it a good thing

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.710 
not many people use it a good thing
about<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.400> though<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.700> when<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.270> isn't<00:01:42.630> to

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
about it though is that when it isn't to

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.300 
about it though is that when it isn't to
the<00:01:42.750> Graveyard<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.649> get<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> heraldic

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the Graveyard you can get to a heraldic

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.069 
the Graveyard you can get to a heraldic
these<00:01:44.790> monsters<00:01:45.149> from<00:01:45.360> your<00:01:45.540> deck<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.930> send

these monsters from your deck and send

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.929 
these monsters from your deck and send
them<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.409> graveyard<00:01:46.619> which<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.759> really

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
them to the graveyard which can really

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.460 
them to the graveyard which can really
come<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.240> handy<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.689> way<00:01:48.780> Hera<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.320> beasts

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
come in handy the way Hera like beasts

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.020 
come in handy the way Hera like beasts
or<00:01:49.619> how<00:01:49.799> they<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.159> seen<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.670> graveyard

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
or how they can like seen the graveyard

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.870 
or how they can like seen the graveyard
and<00:01:51.180> everything<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.770> it<00:01:52.770> comes<00:01:53.610> with<00:01:53.759> them

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
and everything to it comes with them

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.719 
and everything to it comes with them
pretty<00:01:54.090> nicely<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:55.189> am<00:01:56.189> glad<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.700> is

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
pretty nicely I am glad that it is

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.020 
pretty nicely I am glad that it is
generic<00:01:57.210> card<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.290> don't<00:01:58.500> see<00:01:58.880> really<00:01:59.880> any

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
generic card but I don't see really any

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.490 
generic card but I don't see really any
other<00:02:00.119> art<00:02:00.360> type<00:02:00.540> using<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.899> anyway<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.259> I

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
other art type using it anyway so I

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.170 
other art type using it anyway so I
guess<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.890> really<00:02:01.920> isn't<00:02:02.460> much<00:02:02.640> point<00:02:02.670> for<00:02:03.119> it

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
guess it really isn't much point for it

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.270 
guess it really isn't much point for it
to<00:02:03.270> be<00:02:03.360> generic<00:02:03.869> alright<00:02:04.590> maybe<00:02:04.770> just<00:02:05.130> make<00:02:05.250> a

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
to be generic alright maybe just make a

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.709 
to be generic alright maybe just make a
little<00:02:05.399> bit<00:02:05.549> easier<00:02:06.119> if<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.270> use<00:02:06.390> some<00:02:06.600> other

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
little bit easier if you use some other

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.930 
little bit easier if you use some other
level<00:02:07.560> force<00:02:07.799> with<00:02:08.039> your<00:02:08.129> LTV<00:02:08.459> that's<00:02:08.819> about

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
level force with your LTV that's about

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.540 
level force with your LTV that's about
it<00:02:09.170> so<00:02:10.170> yeah<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.649> don't<00:02:10.739> know<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.370> cool

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
it so yeah I don't know it's a cool

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.949 
it so yeah I don't know it's a cool
number<00:02:11.700> card<00:02:12.090> if<00:02:12.239> for<00:02:12.360> some<00:02:12.390> reason<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.840> kind

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
number card if for some reason that kind

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.490 
number card if for some reason that kind
of<00:02:12.989> monetary<00:02:13.230> number

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
of monetary number

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.260 
of monetary number
because<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.980> artwork<00:02:14.280> out<00:02:14.370> no<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.610> looks<00:02:14.760> just

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
because the artwork out no it looks just

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.330 
because the artwork out no it looks just
kind<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.540> similar<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.870> me<00:02:16.140> leap<00:02:16.980> maybe<00:02:17.190> it's

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
kind of similar to me leap maybe it's

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.090 
kind of similar to me leap maybe it's
just<00:02:17.400> me<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:18.930> don't<00:02:19.440> know<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.710> feel<00:02:19.860> like<00:02:19.920> it

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
just me and I don't know I feel like it

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.800 
just me and I don't know I feel like it
could<00:02:20.190> have<00:02:20.310> been<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.460> little<00:02:20.940> bit<00:02:21.120> better<00:02:21.330> but

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
could have been a little bit better but

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.720 
could have been a little bit better but
you<00:02:22.620> know<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.890> can't<00:02:23.130> wait<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.340> add<00:02:23.490> another

of the turn you contribute one Cromley

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.120 
of the turn you contribute one Cromley
monster<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.230> control<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.680> target<00:03:10.860> one

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310

tank and destroy that target this one

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.699 
tank and destroy that target this one
seems<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.720> little<00:03:18.810> bit<00:03:18.989> more<00:03:19.110> usable<00:03:19.500> even

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
seems a little bit more usable even

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.340 
seems a little bit more usable even
though<00:03:20.610> it's<00:03:20.760> not<00:03:20.910> generic<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.630> makes<00:03:22.110> sense

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
though it's not generic it makes sense

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.229 
though it's not generic it makes sense
anyway<00:03:22.830> like<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.130> said<00:03:23.160> because<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:24.150> know

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
anyway like I said because you know

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.520 
anyway like I said because you know
you're<00:03:24.420> gonna<00:03:24.510> only<00:03:24.690> use<00:03:24.870> this<00:03:24.989> with<00:03:25.170> Cromley

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
you're gonna only use this with Cromley

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.690 
you're gonna only use this with Cromley
just<00:03:25.709> like<00:03:25.830> what<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.100> last<00:03:26.280> one<00:03:26.430> you're<00:03:26.580> gonna

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
just like what the last one you're gonna

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.070 
just like what the last one you're gonna
use<00:03:26.880> it<00:03:26.970> with<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.120> arc<00:03:27.239> top<00:03:27.390> you<00:03:27.810> know<00:03:27.930> her

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
use it with the arc top you know her

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.620 
use it with the arc top you know her
Louise<00:03:28.580> this<00:03:29.580> one<00:03:29.790> key<00:03:29.880> combo<00:03:30.209> pretty<00:03:30.480> well

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
Louise this one key combo pretty well

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.810 
Louise this one key combo pretty well
with<00:03:30.780> number<00:03:30.989> 33<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.620> mean<00:03:31.920> number<00:03:32.190> 33<00:03:32.610> could<00:03:32.730> be

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
with number 33 I mean number 33 could be

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.009 
with number 33 I mean number 33 could be
a<00:03:32.850> little<00:03:32.970> bit<00:03:33.120> more<00:03:33.239> useful<00:03:33.390> because<00:03:33.750> of<00:03:33.959> the

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
a little bit more useful because of the

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.320 
a little bit more useful because of the
whole<00:03:34.170> bring<00:03:35.130> in<00:03:35.250> somebody's<00:03:35.670> attack<00:03:36.030> points

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
whole bring in somebody's attack points

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.449 
whole bring in somebody's attack points
or<00:03:36.450> monsters<00:03:37.080> attack<00:03:37.320> points<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.650> zero<00:03:37.769> so<00:03:38.400> you

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
or monsters attack points to zero so you

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.280 
or monsters attack points to zero so you
inflict<00:03:38.910> more<00:03:39.060> damage<00:03:39.120> so<00:03:39.630> I<00:03:39.900> can<00:03:40.080> see<00:03:40.170> how

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
inflict more damage so I can see how

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.319 
inflict more damage so I can see how
that<00:03:40.380> could<00:03:40.560> work<00:03:40.590> pretty<00:03:40.890> well<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.370> being<00:03:42.269> a

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
that could work pretty well and being a

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.370 
that could work pretty well and being a
ring<00:03:42.450> for<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:42.840> might<00:03:42.989> be<00:03:43.079> a<00:03:43.140> little<00:03:43.200> bit

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
ring for it it might be a little bit

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.840 
ring for it it might be a little bit
easier<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.680> bring<00:03:43.860> this<00:03:43.980> one<00:03:44.160> out<00:03:44.280> not<00:03:44.610> too<00:03:44.730> bad

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
easier to bring this one out not too bad

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.490 
easier to bring this one out not too bad
with<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.060> stats<00:03:45.299> either<00:03:45.660> that's<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:46.140> pretty

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
with the stats either that's a pretty

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.880 
with the stats either that's a pretty
nice<00:03:46.680> defense<00:03:46.980> I'm<00:03:47.130> 2500<00:03:47.910> that's<00:03:48.360> pretty<00:03:48.570> good

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
nice defense I'm 2500 that's pretty good

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.110 
nice defense I'm 2500 that's pretty good
so<00:03:49.890> yeah<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.040> do<00:03:50.250> like<00:03:50.579> this<00:03:50.700> one<00:03:50.850> a<00:03:50.880> little<00:03:50.940> bit

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
so yeah I do like this one a little bit

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.009 
so yeah I do like this one a little bit
better<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.390> looks<00:03:51.540> like<00:03:51.630> they're<00:03:51.750> both<00:03:51.870> gonna

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
better it looks like they're both gonna

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.860 
better it looks like they're both gonna
be<00:03:52.110> rares<00:03:52.320> too<00:03:52.590> for<00:03:52.769> the<00:03:52.860> set<00:03:53.100> no<00:03:53.910> idea<00:03:54.209> what

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
be rares too for the set no idea what

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.420 
be rares too for the set no idea what
they'll<00:03:55.049> be<00:03:55.079> for<00:03:55.320> us<00:03:55.440> of<00:03:55.590> course<00:03:55.709> in<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:55.980> TCG

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
they'll be for us of course in the TCG

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.009 
they'll be for us of course in the TCG
hopefully<00:03:56.790> not<00:03:56.940> too<00:03:57.060> my<00:03:57.180> rarities<00:03:57.390> I<00:03:57.780> want<00:03:57.959> to

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
hopefully not too my rarities I want to

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.300 
hopefully not too my rarities I want to
edition<00:03:58.260> my<00:03:58.350> collections<00:03:58.739> no<00:03:58.920> matter<00:03:59.100> you

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
edition my collections no matter you

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.470 
edition my collections no matter you
know<00:03:59.370> don't<00:03:59.640> matter<00:03:59.790> if<00:03:59.880> they're<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.299> worst

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
know don't matter if they're the worst

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.789 
know don't matter if they're the worst
number<00:04:00.840> cards<00:04:01.049> ever<00:04:01.200> I'm<00:04:01.320> something<00:04:01.500> into<00:04:01.769> my

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
number cards ever I'm something into my

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.650 
number cards ever I'm something into my
collections<00:04:02.250> but<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:02.940> do<00:04:03.000> like<00:04:03.299> both<00:04:03.450> these

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
collections but I do like both these

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.140 
collections but I do like both these
number<00:04:03.930> cards<00:04:03.959> but<00:04:04.380> I<00:04:04.650> think<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.220> number<00:04:05.489> 36<00:04:05.970> is

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
number cards but I think a number 36 is

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.090 
number cards but I think a number 36 is
the<00:04:06.180> better<00:04:06.480> one<00:04:06.690> of<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.930> two<00:04:07.110> I<00:04:07.320> can<00:04:07.829> see<00:04:07.980> me

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
the better one of the two I can see me

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.280 
the better one of the two I can see me
using<00:04:08.670> this<00:04:08.910> card<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.450> I<00:04:09.630> am<00:04:09.959> gonna<00:04:10.110> be

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
using this card and I am gonna be

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.229 
using this card and I am gonna be
testing<00:04:10.590> out<00:04:10.709> chronomaly<00:04:11.310> is<00:04:11.579> a<00:04:11.640> bit<00:04:11.820> more<00:04:12.030> now

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
testing out chronomaly is a bit more now

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.120 
testing out chronomaly is a bit more now
with<00:04:12.420> all<00:04:12.540> this<00:04:12.660> other<00:04:12.810> support<00:04:13.260> I<00:04:13.320> mean<00:04:13.500> you

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
with all this other support I mean you

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.319 
with all this other support I mean you
know<00:04:14.220> all<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.489> support<00:04:14.760> of<00:04:14.820> cannolis<00:04:15.299> and

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
know all the support of cannolis and

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:16.729 
know all the support of cannolis and
gravekeeper's<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.079> everything<00:04:16.320> in<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.500> set

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
gravekeeper's and everything in the set

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.190 
gravekeeper's and everything in the set
I<00:04:17.010> have<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.519> lot<00:04:17.700> of<00:04:17.729> testing<00:04:18.090> to<00:04:18.180> do<00:04:18.269> so<00:04:18.810> yeah<00:04:18.930> I

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
I have a lot of testing to do so yeah I

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.080 
I have a lot of testing to do so yeah I
think<00:04:19.650> this<00:04:19.799> is<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:20.010> better<00:04:20.190> one<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:20.700> I<00:04:20.970> think

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
think this is the better one and I think
