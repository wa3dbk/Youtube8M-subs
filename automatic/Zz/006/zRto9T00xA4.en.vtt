games<00:00:40.260> were<00:00:40.469> really<00:00:40.770> about<00:00:40.980> building<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.609> base

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
games were really about building a base

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.939 
games were really about building a base
defending<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.780> base<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.320> building<00:00:43.859> an

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
defending that base and building an

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:45.439 
defending that base and building an
assault<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.430> army<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.940> could<00:00:45.090> go<00:00:45.180> attack

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
assault to army that you could go attack

assault to army that you could go attack
the<00:00:45.719> other<00:00:45.840> base<00:00:46.050> first<00:00:46.500> thing<00:00:46.739> we<00:00:46.859> said<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.489> we

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090
