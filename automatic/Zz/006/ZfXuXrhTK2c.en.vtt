00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
really small detail over there is really

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.400 
really small detail over there is really
bothering<00:03:04.520> me<00:03:04.940> so<00:03:05.450> it's<00:03:05.630> one<00:03:05.840> to<00:03:06.020> one<00:03:06.050> right

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
bothering me so it's one to one right

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.680 
bothering me so it's one to one right
now<00:03:06.590> actually<00:03:06.830> it's<00:03:07.310> not<00:03:07.460> one<00:03:07.640> two<00:03:07.790> three

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.270 

we're<00:03:11.690> doing<00:03:11.990> just<00:03:12.020> a<00:03:12.260> piss<00:03:12.440> two<00:03:12.680> out<00:03:12.830> of<00:03:12.860> three

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
we're doing just a piss two out of three

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.230 
we're doing just a piss two out of three
so<00:03:13.550> you<00:03:13.640> can<00:03:13.850> win<00:03:14.030> Sal<00:03:14.540> afrezza<00:03:15.140> I<00:03:16.240> really

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
so you can win Sal afrezza I really

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.940 
so you can win Sal afrezza I really
think<00:03:17.360> it's<00:03:17.570> cell<00:03:17.780> cell<00:03:18.140> has<00:03:18.320> a<00:03:18.350> higher<00:03:18.650> power

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
think it's cell cell has a higher power

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.740 
think it's cell cell has a higher power
level<00:03:19.430> but<00:03:19.610> I'm<00:03:19.700> not<00:03:19.850> really<00:03:20.030> sure<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.600> goes

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
level but I'm not really sure it goes

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.860 
level but I'm not really sure it goes
all<00:03:21.020> into<00:03:21.320> skill<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:22.010> whatnot<00:03:22.610> skill<00:03:23.180> yeah
