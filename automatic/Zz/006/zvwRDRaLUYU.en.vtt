00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.820
 who has any break 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.710
 welcome to second decisive episode 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.360
 after bringing in our video 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:19.470
 previous received thousands of 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:24.449
 visualizations in less than this for 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.740
 seek revenge 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.779
 in this second he put in the past 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.220
 then show on dragon ball once 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.769
 don't answer the question we hold 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.300
 all in line, maybe some kids 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.120
 kabul where the summaries of the super are spoken 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.680
 sayan the black body theory there 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.719
 teaches that all objects emit 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.160
 light also an apple of the glasses from 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.039
 sun a plate of pasta 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.020
 but not always this visible light and 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.879
 that is why we are not bright at 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.039
 example to make light to ours 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.039
 pasta we have to bring it about 900 degrees 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.910
 ready the light depends on the temperature 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.500
 at normal temperatures along with you light 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.480
 infrared while at temperature 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.000
 higher and 900 degrees and put light 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.350
 visible the law of via in tells us that 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.720
 the wavelength is inversely 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.150
 proportional to the temperature for a 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.130
 super sayan the wavelength and 578 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.200
 nanometers with a simple step 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.979
 algebraic we get a temperature of 5 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.270
 mila grande goku when it has to face 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.000
 super villains turns into super sayan 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.740
 and it becomes as bright as our south a 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.810
 how much energy wastes goals to stay 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.369
 transformed into a whole episode from the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.320
 reads about balls man knowing that the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.630
 average surface of a human body is of 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.820
 about 1.5 square meters we get 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.070
 the energy of 6 by 10 to ten joules 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.130
 but someone from where it takes all this 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.350
 simple energy from food our hero 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.240
 where to eat about 50,000 cheeseburgers 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.490
 and the McDonald's to release the bar 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.439
 here is explained the legendary hunger of the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.360
 super sayan who has us during the series 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.740
 amazed making us see huge 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.320
 binge and why hair instead of 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.719
 stay normal fly up simple 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.670
 the emanated energy generates cells 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.550
 convective of hot air that are here 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.830
 read of 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.720
 normal therefore tend to rise i 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.050
 hair rises thanks to the wind that is 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.810
 comes to create would have ruined the video 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.820
 Today there are questions 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.630
 yes tell me but as the eyes do to 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.630
 become blue 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.200
 well if I liked the video I am 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.770
 forget to write to the physical channel 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.770
 we grow up
