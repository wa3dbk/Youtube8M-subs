fingers as a guide all right when we're

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.130 
fingers as a guide all right when we're
starting<00:02:56.940> we<00:02:57.180> can<00:02:57.360> probably<00:02:57.690> get<00:02:57.959> with<00:02:58.110> that

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
starting we can probably get with that

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.670 
starting we can probably get with that
rocking<00:02:58.769> motion<00:02:58.799> like<00:02:59.519> this<00:03:01.160> so<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.430> get<00:03:03.120> my

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
rocking motion like this so I get my

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.920 
rocking motion like this so I get my
product<00:03:04.680> if<00:03:04.889> I<00:03:05.459> have<00:03:05.639> something<00:03:05.970> round<00:03:06.420> it's<00:03:06.810> a

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
product if I have something round it's a

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.479 
product if I have something round it's a
little<00:03:07.200> bit<00:03:07.319> more<00:03:07.470> difficult<00:03:07.980> at<00:03:08.160> the

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
little bit more difficult at the

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.280 
little bit more difficult at the
beginning<00:03:08.880> because<00:03:09.359> it<00:03:09.600> tends<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.930> want<00:03:10.200> to

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
beginning because it tends to want to

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.750 
beginning because it tends to want to
roll<00:03:10.470> so<00:03:11.040> you're<00:03:11.190> going<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.370> have<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.579> be<00:03:11.730> a

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
roll so you're going to have to be a

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.660 
roll so you're going to have to be a
little<00:03:11.940> bit<00:03:12.150> stronger<00:03:12.540> with<00:03:12.870> your<00:03:12.900> claw<00:03:13.670> I'm

little bit stronger with your claw I'm
going<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.060> square<00:03:15.359> it<00:03:15.510> off<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:16.430> at<00:03:17.430> the

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
going to square it off and at the

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.190 
going to square it off and at the
beginning<00:03:18.209> again<00:03:18.840> if<00:03:18.959> you're<00:03:19.079> not

I'm<00:05:19.590> going<00:05:19.740> to<00:05:19.770> go<00:05:19.950> an<00:05:20.100> eighth<00:05:20.250> of<00:05:20.430> an<00:05:20.520> inch

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
I'm going to go an eighth of an inch

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.150 
I'm going to go an eighth of an inch
well<00:05:20.910> most<00:05:21.840> of<00:05:22.050> us<00:05:22.200> tend<00:05:22.440> at<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.710> beginning<00:05:23.040> to

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
well most of us tend at the beginning to

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.940 
well most of us tend at the beginning to
cut<00:05:23.370> more<00:05:23.760> than<00:05:23.790> a<00:05:24.600> larger<00:05:25.320> slice<00:05:25.470> than<00:05:25.860> we

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
cut more than a larger slice than we

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.300 
cut more than a larger slice than we
think

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
think

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.950 
think
so<00:05:26.700> when<00:05:26.850> eighth<00:05:27.030> of<00:05:27.270> an<00:05:27.360> inch<00:05:27.480> is<00:05:27.780> very<00:05:28.650> small

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
so when eighth of an inch is very small

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.950 
so when eighth of an inch is very small
we<00:05:30.960> really<00:05:31.410> want<00:05:31.770> to<00:05:31.919> get<00:05:32.250> we<00:05:33.180> want<00:05:33.330> to<00:05:33.480> look<00:05:33.720> at

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
we really want to get we want to look at

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.530 
we really want to get we want to look at
it<00:05:34.230> step<00:05:34.650> back<00:05:34.950> and<00:05:35.220> this<00:05:35.730> is<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.210> hard<00:05:36.450> part

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
it step back and this is the hard part

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.320 
it step back and this is the hard part
going<00:05:37.200> straight<00:05:37.710> down<00:05:37.740> all<00:05:38.430> the<00:05:38.940> way<00:05:39.030> through

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
going straight down all the way through

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.750 
going straight down all the way through
an<00:05:39.570> eighth<00:05:39.720> of<00:05:39.930> an<00:05:40.080> inch<00:05:40.200> so<00:05:40.680> we<00:05:40.860> have<00:05:41.010> 1/8<00:05:41.580> of

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
an eighth of an inch so we have 1/8 of

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.480 
an eighth of an inch so we have 1/8 of
an<00:05:41.880> inch<00:05:41.970> slice<00:05:42.330> now<00:05:43.050> we<00:05:43.710> go<00:05:43.890> another<00:05:44.190> eighth

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
an inch slice now we go another eighth

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.980 
an inch slice now we go another eighth
of<00:05:44.730> an<00:05:44.850> inch<00:05:45.000> and<00:05:47.240> we<00:05:48.240> start<00:05:48.540> to<00:05:48.690> make<00:05:48.720> our

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
of an inch and we start to make our

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.790 
of an inch and we start to make our
julienne

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
julienne

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:56.090
