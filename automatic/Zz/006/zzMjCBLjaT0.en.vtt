good job you know your ABCs so this map

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.959 
good job you know your ABCs so this map
is<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.769> real<00:00:13.980> cliffhanger<00:00:14.280> no<00:00:14.670> pun<00:00:14.849> intended

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969

because you will be literally hanging

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.220 
because you will be literally hanging
off<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.490> side<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.910> map<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.359> here's<00:00:19.020> one

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
off the side of the map and here's one

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.540 
off the side of the map and here's one
spot<00:00:19.500> that's<00:00:19.529> pretty<00:00:19.800> simple<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.160> just<00:00:20.279> saw

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
spot that's pretty simple you just saw

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.250 
spot that's pretty simple you just saw
him<00:00:20.699> hanging<00:00:20.939> out<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.480> grass<00:00:21.600> there<00:00:22.080> it's

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
him hanging out in the grass there it's

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.570 
him hanging out in the grass there it's
like<00:00:22.500> impossible<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:23.010> see<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.250> if<00:00:23.369> you've<00:00:23.460> got

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
like impossible to see you if you've got

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.519 
like impossible to see you if you've got
a<00:00:23.609> ghillie<00:00:23.820> suit<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.269> then<00:00:24.810> another<00:00:25.050> spot<00:00:25.380> is

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
a ghillie suit and then another spot is

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.290 
a ghillie suit and then another spot is
right<00:00:25.800> here<00:00:26.039> if<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.220> lay<00:00:26.369> down<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.880> on<00:00:27.090> that

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
right here if you lay down in on that

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.580 
right here if you lay down in on that
rock<00:00:27.539> it's<00:00:27.720> pretty<00:00:27.900> difficult<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.289> find<00:00:28.470> you

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
rock it's pretty difficult to find you

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.290 
rock it's pretty difficult to find you
but<00:00:29.070> those<00:00:29.160> are<00:00:29.310> some<00:00:29.490> pretty<00:00:29.519> basic<00:00:29.849> spots

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
but those are some pretty basic spots

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.120 
but those are some pretty basic spots
that<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:31.170> know<00:00:31.289> people<00:00:31.320> might<00:00:31.650> bump<00:00:31.890> into<00:00:31.980> you

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
that you know people might bump into you

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.190 
that you know people might bump into you
accidentally<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:33.210> these<00:00:33.600> spots<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.079> we're

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
accidentally but these spots that we're

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.450 
accidentally but these spots that we're
going<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> show<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.559> now<00:00:34.770> hanging<00:00:35.160> off<00:00:35.309> the

going to show you now hanging off the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.040 
going to show you now hanging off the
edge<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.790> map<00:00:36.000> no<00:00:36.420> one<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.870> going<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
edge of the map no one is going to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.990 
edge of the map no one is going to
accidentally<00:00:37.440> find<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.890> because<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.610> kind

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
accidentally find you because it's kind

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.900 
accidentally find you because it's kind
of<00:00:39.120> ridiculous<00:00:39.410> just<00:00:40.489> hanging<00:00:41.489> off<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> side

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
of ridiculous just hanging off the side

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.010 
of ridiculous just hanging off the side
of<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.090> cliff<00:00:42.120> why<00:00:42.450> would<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.690> go<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.899> look

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
of a cliff why would you go and look

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.709 
of a cliff why would you go and look
there<00:00:43.550> so<00:00:44.550> there's<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.910> one<00:00:45.120> there<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.600> then

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
there so there's that one there and then

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.029 
there so there's that one there and then
there's<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.020> one<00:00:46.230> which<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.649> know<00:00:46.829> some

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
there's this one which you know some

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.490 
there's this one which you know some
some<00:00:47.309> people<00:00:47.550> may<00:00:47.730> know<00:00:47.940> because<00:00:48.270> it's

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
some people may know because it's

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.270 
some people may know because it's
unfortunately<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.590> has<00:00:49.710> become<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> common

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
unfortunately it has become a common

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.889 
unfortunately it has become a common
boosting<00:00:50.820> spot<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.149> Afghan<00:00:51.480> which<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.719> really

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
boosting spot on Afghan which is really

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.279 
boosting spot on Afghan which is really
a<00:00:51.960> pity<00:00:52.170> because<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> great<00:00:52.980> spot<00:00:53.340> and

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
a pity because it is a great spot and

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.450 
a pity because it is a great spot and
but<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.620> good<00:00:55.770> thing<00:00:55.890> there<00:00:56.039> are<00:00:56.070> other

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
but it's a good thing there are other

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.130 
but it's a good thing there are other
spots<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.030> cliff<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.600> people<00:00:57.989> will

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
spots on this cliff that people will

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.660 
spots on this cliff that people will
probably<00:00:58.350> not<00:00:58.649> check<00:00:58.980> because<00:00:59.129> they'll<00:00:59.340> just

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
probably not check because they'll just

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.740 
probably not check because they'll just
assume<00:00:59.789> you're<00:01:00.059> going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.239> fall<00:01:00.359> off<00:01:00.390> because

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
assume you're going to fall off because

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.119 
assume you're going to fall off because
it<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.930> pretty<00:01:01.079> recalculates<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.010> can

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
it is pretty recalculates that you can

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.100 
it is pretty recalculates that you can
just<00:01:02.309> stand<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.850> edge<00:01:02.940> there<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.840> there's

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
just stand on the edge there so there's

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.929 
just stand on the edge there so there's
that<00:01:04.260> one<00:01:04.439> over<00:01:04.559> there<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.280> rock<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
that one over there on that rock and to

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.280 
that one over there on that rock and to
get<00:01:06.090> there<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:06.810> use<00:01:06.840> these<00:01:07.049> cones

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
get there you can just use these cones

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.289 
get there you can just use these cones
as<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> reference<00:01:07.860> point<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.280> guess<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:09.090> just

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
as a reference point I guess you just

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.910 
as a reference point I guess you just
drop<00:01:09.689> down<00:01:09.869> onto<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.170> rock<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
drop down onto this rock and the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.920 
drop down onto this rock and the
pathways<00:01:11.310> clearly<00:01:11.760> lit<00:01:11.939> out<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:12.720> not

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
pathways clearly lit out so it's not

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.109 
pathways clearly lit out so it's not
very<00:01:13.080> difficult<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.590> get<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.920> at<00:01:14.490> all<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.970> have

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
very difficult to get to at all you have

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.060 
very difficult to get to at all you have
to<00:01:15.150> worry<00:01:15.240> about<00:01:15.390> falling<00:01:15.689> because<00:01:16.070> you

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
to worry about falling because you

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.140 
to worry about falling because you
already<00:01:17.520> know<00:01:17.729> what<00:01:17.820> you're<00:01:17.880> gonna<00:01:17.970> be

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
already know what you're gonna be

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.460 
already know what you're gonna be
walking<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.540> because<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> pathway<00:01:19.290> right

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
walking on because of the pathway right

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.969 
walking on because of the pathway right
there<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.540> now<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.750> spot<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.560> one<00:01:22.799> is

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
there and now this spot this one is

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.760 
there and now this spot this one is
again<00:01:23.310> pretty<00:01:23.880> simple<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:24.630> out<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.259> all<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
again pretty simple but out of all the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.289 
again pretty simple but out of all the
edges<00:01:26.100> all<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> spots<00:01:26.790> were<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.030> going<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
edges all the spots were you going the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.910 
edges all the spots were you going the
edge<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.630> cliff<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.080> guess<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.590> could<00:01:28.799> be

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
edge of the cliff I guess this could be

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.679 
edge of the cliff I guess this could be
called<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.250> hardest<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:30.270> basically<00:01:30.540> what

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
called the hardest but basically what

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:31.580 
called the hardest but basically what
you're<00:01:30.750> going<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.960> want<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.140> do<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.409> just

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
some odd reason they jump off the cliff

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.630 
some odd reason they jump off the cliff

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
side of the map together go for it I

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.219 
side of the map together go for it I
know<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.520> spot<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.970> some<00:01:51.570> people<00:01:51.689> may<00:01:51.990> know

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
know this spot is some people may know

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.050 
know this spot is some people may know
it<00:01:52.409> because<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.890> has<00:01:53.100> been<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.460> YouTube<00:01:53.790> before

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
it because it has been on YouTube before

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.730 
it because it has been on YouTube before
basically<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:54.780> jump<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.409> barrels

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
basically you just jump on the barrels

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.069 
basically you just jump on the barrels
there<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.729> only<00:01:56.820> fits<00:01:57.240> one<00:01:57.360> or<00:01:57.719> two<00:01:57.840> people

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
and I probably only recommend using one

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.859 
and I probably only recommend using one
person<00:02:01.049> because<00:02:01.670> people<00:02:02.670> kinda<00:02:03.540> do<00:02:03.659> know<00:02:03.840> that

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
spot it's not very unusual

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.369 
spot it's not very unusual
people<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.450> go<00:02:06.570> there<00:02:06.920> but<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.220> one<00:02:08.250> here<00:02:08.970> is

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
people to go there but this one here is

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.530 
people to go there but this one here is
no<00:02:10.379> one's<00:02:10.560> gonna<00:02:10.739> find<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.220> here<00:02:11.540> biggest

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
no one's gonna find you here biggest

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.600 
no one's gonna find you here biggest
reason<00:02:12.780> being<00:02:12.930> you're<00:02:13.769> going<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.129> be<00:02:14.190> outside

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
reason being you're going to be outside

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.280 
reason being you're going to be outside
the<00:02:14.670> radiation<00:02:15.300> zone<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.780> no<00:02:15.900> one's<00:02:16.080> going<00:02:16.230> to

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
the radiation zone and no one's going to

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.350 
the radiation zone and no one's going to
expect<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.739> can<00:02:16.920> survive<00:02:17.310> there<00:02:17.640> so

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
expect you can survive there so

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.610 
expect you can survive there so
basically<00:02:18.629> if<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.840> go<00:02:18.930> behind<00:02:19.080> this<00:02:19.319> little

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
basically if you go behind this little

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.180 
basically if you go behind this little
barrier<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:21.480> are<00:02:21.870> fully<00:02:22.440> hidden<00:02:22.799> and<00:02:23.069> no

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
barrier you are fully hidden and no

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.740 
barrier you are fully hidden and no
one's<00:02:23.310> going<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.489> check<00:02:23.670> there<00:02:23.849> so<00:02:24.299> overall

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
one's going to check there so overall

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.780 
one's going to check there so overall
I'd<00:02:24.900> say<00:02:24.930> Afghans<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.530> very<00:02:25.739> simple<00:02:26.099> maps<00:02:26.310> HL<00:02:26.580> g

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
I'd say Afghans a very simple maps HL g

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.479 
I'd say Afghans a very simple maps HL g
