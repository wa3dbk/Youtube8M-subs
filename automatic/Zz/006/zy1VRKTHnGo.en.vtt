to be a very popular hotspot for

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.220 
to be a very popular hotspot for
training<00:00:08.730> not<00:00:09.480> really<00:00:09.660> training<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:10.019> meant

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230

like<00:00:10.380> money-making<00:00:11.190> back<00:00:11.610> in<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.849> day<00:00:12.030> like

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
like money-making back in the day like

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.959 
like money-making back in the day like
after<00:00:12.630> free<00:00:12.809> trade<00:00:13.110> around<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.830> time<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.070> 2011

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
after free trade around the time of 2011

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.390 
after free trade around the time of 2011
early<00:00:15.150> 2012<00:00:15.740> after<00:00:16.740> EEOC

early 2012 after EEOC

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.519 
early 2012 after EEOC
they<00:00:17.609> kind<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.910> died<00:00:18.060> off<00:00:18.090> on<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:19.109> popularity

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
they kind of died off on the popularity

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.290 
they kind of died off on the popularity
is<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:20.100> not<00:00:20.250> there<00:00:20.430> anymore<00:00:20.699> because<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
is just not there anymore because the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.840 
is just not there anymore because the
items<00:00:21.600> just<00:00:21.810> went<00:00:22.080> plummeting<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.070> they<00:00:23.730> are

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
items just went plummeting and they are

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.000 
items just went plummeting and they are
just<00:00:24.090> not<00:00:24.269> worth<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.750> but<00:00:25.080> because<00:00:25.380> legacy<00:00:25.859> is

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
just not worth it but because legacy is

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.740 
just not worth it but because legacy is
coming<00:00:26.310> back<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> lot<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.910> items<00:00:27.210> are<00:00:27.330> going<00:00:27.599> up

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
coming back a lot of items are going up

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.140 
coming back a lot of items are going up
and<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.529> items<00:00:28.830> are<00:00:28.920> just<00:00:29.070> unstable<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:30.119> I

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
and the items are just unstable so I

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.880 
and the items are just unstable so I
felt<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.630> was<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.779> perfect<00:00:30.990> time<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.650> do

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
felt like it was a perfect time to do

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.799 
felt like it was a perfect time to do
the<00:00:32.009> revs<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.850> was<00:00:33.149> planning<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.510> doing<00:00:33.570> this

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
the revs I was planning on doing this

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.420 
the revs I was planning on doing this
loot<00:00:33.930> video<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.230> long<00:00:34.410> time<00:00:34.469> ago<00:00:34.680> but<00:00:35.130> today

loot video a long time ago but today
seems<00:00:35.880> like<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.120> perfect<00:00:36.450> day<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.540> do<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.780> so

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
seems like the perfect day to do it so

seems like the perfect day to do it so

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
time made it a lot more fun than it was

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.290 
time made it a lot more fun than it was
and<00:00:49.680> they<00:00:49.860> came<00:00:50.070> with<00:00:50.250> me<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.399> revs<00:00:50.760> every<00:00:51.149> time

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
and they came with me to revs every time

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.060 
and they came with me to revs every time
I<00:00:51.329> went<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:52.020> way<00:00:52.140> it'd<00:00:52.260> be<00:00:52.350> harder<00:00:52.680> for<00:00:52.710> us<00:00:52.920> to

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
I went that way it'd be harder for us to

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.319 
I went that way it'd be harder for us to
get<00:00:53.190> crashed<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.789> was<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.149> better

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
get crashed it was just a better

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.360 
get crashed it was just a better
experience<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:54.989> all<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.320> us<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.829> initially<00:00:56.340> I

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
experience for all of us so initially I

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.010 
experience for all of us so initially I
was<00:00:56.670> streaming<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.629> streamed<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
was streaming this and I streamed the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.599 
was streaming this and I streamed the
first<00:00:58.199> hundred<00:00:58.410> kills<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:59.160> let<00:00:59.309> me<00:00:59.399> tell<00:00:59.550> you

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
first hundred kills but let me tell you

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.400 
first hundred kills but let me tell you
it<00:00:59.789> was<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> complete<00:01:00.420> disaster<00:01:00.750> because<00:01:01.230> we

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
it was a complete disaster because we

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.950 
it was a complete disaster because we
kept<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.739> getting<00:01:01.829> crashed<00:01:02.250> by<00:01:02.460> two<00:01:02.520> or<00:01:02.879> three

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
kept on getting crashed by two or three

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.020 
kept on getting crashed by two or three
douches<00:01:03.979> that<00:01:04.979> followed<00:01:05.369> our<00:01:05.489> stream<00:01:05.729> just

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
douches that followed our stream just

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.300 
douches that followed our stream just
try<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.330> find<00:01:06.540> our<00:01:06.659> worlds<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.049> we<00:01:07.650> did<00:01:07.920> every

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
try to find our worlds and we did every

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.830 
try to find our worlds and we did every
measure<00:01:08.549> possible<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.390> make<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.630> where<00:01:09.750> they

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
measure possible to make it where they

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.510 
measure possible to make it where they
couldn't<00:01:10.110> crash<00:01:10.260> us<00:01:10.500> they<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.100> kept<00:01:11.460> on

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
couldn't crash us they just kept on

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.130 
couldn't crash us they just kept on
randomly<00:01:11.970> hopping<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.450> finding<00:01:12.750> us<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.049> was

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
randomly hopping and finding us it was

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.499 
randomly hopping and finding us it was
really<00:01:13.470> stupid<00:01:13.650> but<00:01:14.010> um<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.150> guys<00:01:15.240> probably

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
really stupid but um you guys probably

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.999 
really stupid but um you guys probably
seen<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.780> stream<00:01:16.140> maybe<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.500> had<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> lot<00:01:16.920> of

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
seen that stream maybe I had a lot of

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.800 
seen that stream maybe I had a lot of
viewers<00:01:17.250> at<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> time<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.540> didn't

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
viewers at the time but if you didn't

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.570 
viewers at the time but if you didn't
that's<00:01:19.020> what<00:01:19.259> happened<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.860> that's<00:01:20.280> why<00:01:20.400> we

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
that's what happened and that's why we

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.100 
that's what happened and that's why we
didn't<00:01:20.790> stream<00:01:21.000> any<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.450> because<00:01:21.840> it's

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
didn't stream any of this because it's

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.350 
didn't stream any of this because it's
just<00:01:22.170> too<00:01:22.380> risky<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.729> wasn't<00:01:24.000> like<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.210> was

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
just too risky and it wasn't like I was

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.090 
just too risky and it wasn't like I was
risking<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.780> much<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.290> wasn't<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.830> lost

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
risking that much it wasn't like I lost

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.890 
risking that much it wasn't like I lost
that<00:01:26.250> much<00:01:26.400> when<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.580> died<00:01:26.850> once<00:01:27.240> or<00:01:27.390> twice<00:01:27.570> um

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
that much when I died once or twice um

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.870 
that much when I died once or twice um
it<00:01:28.409> was<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.740> annoying<00:01:29.040> because<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.670> really

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it was just annoying because it really

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.550 
it was just annoying because it really
made<00:01:30.060> me<00:01:30.210> not<00:01:30.420> want<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.689> do<00:01:30.810> revs<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.350> really

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
made me not want to do revs and I really

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.080 
made me not want to do revs and I really
wanted<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.799> finish<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.460> another<00:01:33.000> thing

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
wanted to finish this so another thing

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.300 
wanted to finish this so another thing

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
you guys might be wondering is how did I

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.679 
you guys might be wondering is how did I
track<00:01:35.549> my<00:01:35.579> kills<00:01:35.939> because<00:01:36.180> they<00:01:36.329> are<00:01:36.450> like

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
track my kills because they are like

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.859 
track my kills because they are like
Brandon<00:01:37.189> xp4<00:01:38.189> kills<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.210> way<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.390> counted<00:01:39.750> my

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
Brandon xp4 kills the way I counted my

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.960 
Brandon xp4 kills the way I counted my
kills<00:01:40.079> was<00:01:40.350> bringing<00:01:40.770> my<00:01:40.920> ectoplasm<00:01:41.759> adder

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
kills was bringing my ectoplasm adder

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.210 
kills was bringing my ectoplasm adder
which<00:01:42.509> gives<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.869> 15<00:01:43.290> experience<00:01:43.770> per<00:01:44.009> kill

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
which gives you 15 experience per kill

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.740 
which gives you 15 experience per kill
but<00:01:44.490> for<00:01:44.670> me<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:44.880> 30<00:01:45.119> because<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.479> have

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
but for me it's 30 because I do have

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.990 
but for me it's 30 because I do have
double<00:01:46.170> prayer<00:01:46.649> experience<00:01:46.829> right<00:01:47.250> now<00:01:47.280> so

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
double prayer experience right now so

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.940 
double prayer experience right now so
that's<00:01:48.210> how<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.360> counted<00:01:48.689> one<00:01:48.750> kills<00:01:49.110> 30<00:01:49.409> XP<00:01:49.770> so

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
that's how I counted one kills 30 XP so

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.249 
that's how I counted one kills 30 XP so
I<00:01:49.979> needed<00:01:50.220> 30,000<00:01:50.850> prayer<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.960> could<00:01:52.110> found

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
I needed 30,000 prayer and I could found

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.359 
I needed 30,000 prayer and I could found
resetting<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.770> every<00:01:52.950> time<00:01:53.070> we<00:01:53.189> went<00:01:53.280> to

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
resetting it every time we went to

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.670 
resetting it every time we went to
Barrow<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.060> wouldn't<00:01:54.360> like<00:01:54.509> ruin<00:01:54.869> my<00:01:54.899> prayer

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
Barrow so I wouldn't like ruin my prayer

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.319 
Barrow so I wouldn't like ruin my prayer
thing<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.130> that's<00:01:56.280> how<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.430> counted<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.090> did

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
thing so that's how I counted it I did

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.120 
thing so that's how I counted it I did
get<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.659> about<00:01:58.049> exactly<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> thousand<00:01:58.979> kills

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
get to about exactly a thousand kills

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.910 
get to about exactly a thousand kills
maybe<00:01:59.430> give<00:01:59.820> or<00:01:59.939> take<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.299> or<00:02:00.420> two<00:02:00.649> in<00:02:01.649> either

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
maybe give or take one or two in either

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.069 
maybe give or take one or two in either
direction<00:02:02.219> but<00:02:02.850> I'm<00:02:03.180> pretty<00:02:03.630> accurate<00:02:04.020> on

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
direction but I'm pretty accurate on

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.469 
direction but I'm pretty accurate on
1,000<00:02:04.560> kills<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.979> yeah<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.299> gear<00:02:06.450> I

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
1,000 kills and yeah so for the gear I

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.020 
1,000 kills and yeah so for the gear I
just<00:02:06.780> use<00:02:06.930> basic<00:02:07.590> warband<00:02:08.039> gear<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.580> we<00:02:08.879> did

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
just use basic warband gear and we did

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.960 
just use basic warband gear and we did
use<00:02:09.239> team<00:02:09.479> capes<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:10.020> identify<00:02:11.009> each<00:02:11.220> other<00:02:11.430> so

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
use team capes to identify each other so

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.520 
use team capes to identify each other so
if<00:02:12.120> we<00:02:12.270> saw<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> white<00:02:12.750> dot<00:02:12.989> we<00:02:13.200> would<00:02:13.349> know

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
if we saw a white dot we would know

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.320 
if we saw a white dot we would know
it's<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.770> PK<00:02:14.010> or<00:02:14.040> not<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.760> yeah<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:14.940> think<00:02:15.090> that's

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
it's a PK or not and yeah I think that's

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.670 
it's a PK or not and yeah I think that's
all<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.540> guys<00:02:15.630> need<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.959> know<00:02:16.020> about<00:02:16.230> revs

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
all you guys need to know about revs

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.590 
all you guys need to know about revs

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
other than that they're really bad

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.930 
other than that they're really bad

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.699 
experience no charms and they are quite
boring<00:02:21.209> unless<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.780> get<00:02:21.870> very<00:02:22.200> very<00:02:22.470> lucky

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
boring unless you get very very lucky

to kick off the salute video right away

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.760 
to kick off the salute video right away
like<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.060> think<00:02:27.120> on<00:02:27.390> my<00:02:27.450> fifth<00:02:27.900> or<00:02:28.050> sixth<00:02:28.350> kill

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
like I think on my fifth or sixth kill

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.979 
like I think on my fifth or sixth kill
I<00:02:28.800> got<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.130> saradomin<00:02:29.640> statuette<00:02:30.330> from<00:02:30.630> an<00:02:30.750> imp

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
I got a saradomin statuette from an imp

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.050 
I got a saradomin statuette from an imp
which<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.440> pretty<00:02:31.830> funny<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.790> thought<00:02:32.940> it

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
which is pretty funny and I thought it

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.940 
which is pretty funny and I thought it
was<00:02:33.120> 750<00:02:33.810> K<00:02:33.989> but<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.260> was<00:02:34.410> kind<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.620> confused

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
was 750 K but I was kind of confused

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.260 
was 750 K but I was kind of confused
because<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.250> haven't<00:02:35.430> done<00:02:35.550> revs<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.090> long

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
because I haven't done revs and so long

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.140 
because I haven't done revs and so long
it<00:02:36.450> was<00:02:36.569> actually<00:02:36.989> 400<00:02:37.560> K<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.459> is<00:02:38.610> fine

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
it was actually 400 K and that is fine

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.000 
it was actually 400 K and that is fine
by<00:02:39.390> me<00:02:39.569> that<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.900> great<00:02:40.260> for<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.650> beginning

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
by me that is great for the beginning

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.830 
by me that is great for the beginning
and<00:02:41.160> then<00:02:41.550> not<00:02:41.730> too<00:02:41.850> long<00:02:41.880> after<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.600> got<00:02:42.810> a

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
and then not too long after I got a

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.780 
and then not too long after I got a
zamorak<00:02:43.290> medallion<00:02:44.010> which<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.220> not<00:02:44.489> too<00:02:44.640> bad

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
zamorak medallion which is not too bad

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.820 
zamorak medallion which is not too bad
either<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.090> think<00:02:45.360> it's<00:02:45.570> like<00:02:45.690> 100<00:02:46.230> K<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.440> believe

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
either I think it's like 100 K I believe

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.400 
either I think it's like 100 K I believe
um<00:02:47.070> they<00:02:47.850> do<00:02:47.910> add<00:02:48.180> up<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:48.690> mean<00:02:48.989> it's<00:02:49.110> nothing
