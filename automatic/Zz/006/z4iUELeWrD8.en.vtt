00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
back like a year ago and I never did

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.070 
back like a year ago and I never did
shit<00:04:30.940> with<00:04:31.090> it<00:04:31.180> because<00:04:31.390> I<00:04:31.450> was<00:04:31.570> so<00:04:31.840> pissed

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080

shit with it because I was so pissed
tomorrow<00:04:32.410> one<00:04:32.560> for<00:04:32.710> two<00:04:32.860> a<00:04:32.890> year<00:04:33.100> ago<00:04:33.310> I

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
tomorrow one for two a year ago I

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.460 
tomorrow one for two a year ago I
noticed<00:04:34.210> that<00:04:34.420> like<00:04:34.690> a<00:04:34.720> lot<00:04:34.930> of<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.080> buildings

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
noticed that like a lot of the buildings

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.350 
noticed that like a lot of the buildings
they<00:04:35.710> put<00:04:35.980> like<00:04:36.220> holes<00:04:36.670> in<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:36.910> roof<00:04:37.090> for<00:04:37.270> no

they put like holes in the roof for no
apparent<00:04:37.450> reason<00:04:37.690> so<00:04:38.590> I<00:04:38.650> guess<00:04:38.800> like<00:04:39.040> fucking

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
apparent reason so I guess like fucking

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.980 
apparent reason so I guess like fucking
you<00:04:39.970> know<00:04:40.090> air<00:04:40.330> strikes<00:04:42.090> anyway<00:04:43.090> win<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:43.810> game

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
you know air strikes anyway win the game

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.200 
you know air strikes anyway win the game
