looking at my target I don't necessarily
sight<00:03:07.510> down<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.140> air<00:03:08.380> shaft<00:03:08.410> I'm<00:03:09.130> looking<00:03:10.120> at

sight down the air shaft I'm looking at

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.840 
sight down the air shaft I'm looking at
my<00:03:10.600> target<00:03:10.900> it's<00:03:11.290> instinctive<00:03:12.070> shooting<00:03:12.130> and

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
my target it's instinctive shooting and

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.180 
my target it's instinctive shooting and
it<00:03:13.240> takes<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.600> lot<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.780> practice<00:03:14.290> but<00:03:14.320> once<00:03:15.010> you

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
it takes a lot of practice but once you

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.400 
it takes a lot of practice but once you
get<00:03:15.640> used<00:03:15.850> to<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.120> it's<00:03:16.480> quite<00:03:16.900> comfortable

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
get used to it it's quite comfortable

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.360 
get used to it it's quite comfortable
and<00:03:17.769> easy<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.130> do<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:19.300> releasing<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:20.200> air

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.310 
and easy to do and releasing the air
generally<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.489> want<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.910> stay<00:03:22.150> within<00:03:22.540> the

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320

generally you want to stay within the
limit<00:03:23.800> of<00:03:23.920> your<00:03:24.340> ability<00:03:25.120> to<00:03:25.150> shoot

so<00:03:30.400> learn<00:03:30.760> what<00:03:31.090> distance<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:31.600> can<00:03:31.780> shoot<00:03:31.989> and

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
so learn what distance you can shoot and

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.520 
so learn what distance you can shoot and
