like a this it's kind of round on the
side<00:02:28.170> right<00:02:28.290> here<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.710> on<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.760> v2<00:02:30.030> it's<00:02:30.420> a

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
side right here and on the v2 it's a

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.150 
side right here and on the v2 it's a
little<00:02:30.690> bit<00:02:30.780> more<00:02:30.870> pointy<00:02:31.320> er<00:02:31.440> like<00:02:31.740> an<00:02:31.890> egg

you know you have a fat side a little
skinny<00:02:33.720> side<00:02:33.990> so<00:02:34.710> it's<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:35.010> little<00:02:35.100> bit

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
skinny side so it's a little bit

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.710 
skinny side so it's a little bit
difference<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.940> not<00:02:36.120> sure<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.420> your<00:02:36.450> just

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
difference to it not sure of your just

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.150 
difference to it not sure of your just
monitors<00:02:37.110> just<00:02:37.260> kind<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.680> inner<00:02:37.920> from

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
monitors just kind of inner from

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.400 
monitors just kind of inner from
shipping<00:02:38.760> or<00:02:38.880> not<00:02:39.030> but<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.960> does<00:02:40.170> look<00:02:40.350> a

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
shipping or not but it does look a

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.260 
shipping or not but it does look a
little<00:02:40.650> bit<00:02:41.160> different<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.880> just<00:02:42.060> want<00:02:42.210> to

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
little bit different and I just want to

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.420 
little bit different and I just want to
point<00:02:42.480> out<00:02:42.630> for<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.840> guys

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
so here's well before I get to the main

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.260 
so here's well before I get to the main
board<00:02:47.460> show<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.700> guys<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.940> difference

rubber balls down here you can see I

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.040 
rubber balls down here you can see I
already<00:02:58.910> replaced<00:02:59.910> this<00:03:00.090> motors<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.630> from<00:03:00.870> my

out<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.820> receiver<00:03:51.209> so<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.570> can't<00:03:51.780> really

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
out the receiver so you can't really

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.360 
out the receiver so you can't really
guess<00:03:52.500> they're<00:03:52.620> trying<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.800> hide<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.250> or

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
guess they're trying to hide it or

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.490 
guess they're trying to hide it or
something<00:03:53.670> I'm<00:03:53.820> not<00:03:54.060> sure<00:03:54.120> but<00:03:54.570> it's<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.739> 26<00:03:56.670> 31

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
something I'm not sure but it's a 26 31

really<00:04:01.830> noticed<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:02.910> but<00:04:03.150> side-by-side

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900

change<00:04:04.709> my<00:04:04.920> focus<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.370> little<00:04:05.430> bit<00:04:05.580> more<00:04:05.790> and

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
change my focus a little bit more and

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.040 
change my focus a little bit more and
the<00:04:07.890> v2<00:04:08.340> is<00:04:08.489> missing<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.150> two<00:04:09.390> ports<00:04:09.810> over

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
the v2 is missing the two ports over

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.949 
the v2 is missing the two ports over
here<00:04:10.290> unlike<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.160> first<00:04:11.370> one<00:04:11.519> so<00:04:11.940> you<00:04:12.690> go<00:04:12.810> hook

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
here unlike the first one so you go hook

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.570 
here unlike the first one so you go hook
up<00:04:13.050> bytes<00:04:13.320> to<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.650> first<00:04:13.980> one<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.430> can

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
up bytes to the first one and you can

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.050 
up bytes to the first one and you can
also<00:04:14.730> update<00:04:15.090> it<00:04:15.510> and<00:04:15.630> on<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.769> v2<00:04:17.060> there's

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
also update it and on the v2 there's

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.840 
also update it and on the v2 there's
really<00:04:18.810> no<00:04:19.019> course<00:04:19.320> there's<00:04:19.680> holes<00:04:20.010> I<00:04:20.310> guess

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
really no course there's holes I guess

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.730 
really no course there's holes I guess
for<00:04:21.120> you<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.299> start<00:04:21.539> on<00:04:21.630> wires<00:04:21.989> connectors

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
for you to start on wires connectors

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.409 
for you to start on wires connectors
whatnot<00:04:23.310> I'm<00:04:23.550> not<00:04:23.760> actually<00:04:23.910> sure<00:04:24.060> if<00:04:24.300> it

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
whatnot I'm not actually sure if it

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.750 
whatnot I'm not actually sure if it
works<00:04:24.600> or<00:04:24.870> not<00:04:24.930> so<00:04:25.710> you<00:04:25.770> guys<00:04:25.919> might<00:04:26.100> have<00:04:26.130> to

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
works or not so you guys might have to

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.630 
works or not so you guys might have to
Tech<00:04:26.910> walk<00:04:27.180> here<00:04:27.420> and<00:04:27.630> see<00:04:27.960> if<00:04:28.770> these<00:04:29.370> little

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
Tech walk here and see if these little

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.000 
Tech walk here and see if these little
holes<00:04:29.940> are<00:04:30.300> actually<00:04:30.450> functional<00:04:31.200> would<00:04:31.890> be

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
holes are actually functional would be

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.260 
holes are actually functional would be

this<00:04:33.510> one<00:04:33.690> is<00:04:33.780> very<00:04:34.020> easy<00:04:34.160> to<00:04:35.160> hook<00:04:35.220> up<00:04:35.370> lights

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
this one is very easy to hook up lights

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.350 
this one is very easy to hook up lights
you<00:04:35.670> just<00:04:35.850> hook<00:04:36.000> up<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.870> know<00:04:36.990> a<00:04:37.020> little<00:04:38.360> LED

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
you just hook up you know a little LED

around unlike this one you have this
right<00:04:42.960> here<00:04:43.050> so<00:04:43.970> one<00:04:44.970> thing<00:04:45.090> I<00:04:45.120> did<00:04:45.300> notice

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
right here so one thing I did notice

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.290 
right here so one thing I did notice
when<00:04:45.660> I<00:04:45.720> was<00:04:45.840> flying<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.350> v2<00:04:46.680> was<00:04:47.210> whoop<00:04:48.210> the

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
when I was flying the v2 was whoop the

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.790 
when I was flying the v2 was whoop the
new<00:04:48.420> firmware<00:04:48.750> that's<00:04:49.170> already<00:04:49.350> installed

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
new firmware that's already installed

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.830 
new firmware that's already installed
onto<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.310> v2<00:04:50.610> from<00:04:50.760> what<00:04:50.880> I<00:04:50.910> heard<00:04:51.060> it<00:04:51.360> just

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
onto the v2 from what I heard it just

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.990 
onto the v2 from what I heard it just
pretty<00:04:52.260> much<00:04:52.350> eliminates<00:04:52.980> any<00:04:53.250> drifting

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
pretty much eliminates any drifting

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.570 
pretty much eliminates any drifting
unlike<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.780> v1<00:04:55.170> to<00:04:55.320> v1<00:04:55.500> when<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:55.800> fly<00:04:56.070> for<00:04:56.370> about

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
unlike the v1 to v1 when I fly for about

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.390 
unlike the v1 to v1 when I fly for about
a<00:04:57.210> minute<00:04:57.540> or<00:04:57.720> two<00:04:57.900> it<00:04:58.530> tends<00:04:58.770> to<00:04:58.830> want<00:04:59.100> to<00:04:59.190> drop

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
a minute or two it tends to want to drop

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.340 
a minute or two it tends to want to drop
off<00:04:59.580> on<00:04:59.790> direction<00:05:00.300> and<00:05:00.480> now<00:05:00.600> I<00:05:00.630> would<00:05:01.140> always

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
off on direction and now I would always

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.310 
off on direction and now I would always
have<00:05:01.680> to<00:05:01.710> come<00:05:02.220> back<00:05:02.400> and<00:05:02.550> add<00:05:02.670> some<00:05:02.880> trim

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
have to come back and add some trim

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.220 
have to come back and add some trim
unlike<00:05:04.320> the<00:05:04.770> v2<00:05:05.100> pretty<00:05:05.580> much<00:05:05.760> from<00:05:06.300> start<00:05:06.690> to

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
unlike the v2 pretty much from start to

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.670 
unlike the v2 pretty much from start to
in<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:08.600> trimming<00:05:09.600> is<00:05:09.720> just<00:05:10.020> pretty<00:05:10.230> much<00:05:10.410> dead

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
in the trimming is just pretty much dead

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.500 
in the trimming is just pretty much dead
on<00:05:10.710> there's<00:05:11.160> no<00:05:11.400> need<00:05:11.580> for<00:05:11.610> any<00:05:11.910> trimming<00:05:12.390> on

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
on there's no need for any trimming on

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.300 
on there's no need for any trimming on
the<00:05:12.630> radio<00:05:12.960> which<00:05:13.560> is<00:05:13.680> a<00:05:13.710> good<00:05:14.010> thing<00:05:14.040> because

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
the radio which is a good thing because

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.830 
the radio which is a good thing because
you<00:05:14.520> know<00:05:14.730> sometimes<00:05:15.270> when<00:05:15.420> you<00:05:15.540> having<00:05:15.720> too

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
much fun you just forget to reset your

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.490 
much fun you just forget to reset your
trim<00:05:20.610> for<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.060> next<00:05:21.360> battery<00:05:21.720> unlike<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.140> v1

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
trim for the next battery unlike the v1

trim for the next battery unlike the v1
and<00:05:22.530> already<00:05:22.860> broke<00:05:23.070> a<00:05:23.100> prop<00:05:23.430> on<00:05:23.550> this<00:05:23.730> one<00:05:23.910> so

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.220 
replace and this is why I got the v2
because<00:05:36.030> it<00:05:36.180> was<00:05:36.270> cheaper<00:05:36.810> and<00:05:36.960> you<00:05:37.020> got<00:05:37.200> a

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
because it was cheaper and you got a

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.840 
because it was cheaper and you got a
radio<00:05:37.590> so<00:05:37.950> you<00:05:38.010> know<00:05:38.250> it's<00:05:38.430> a<00:05:38.520> two-for-one

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
radio so you know it's a two-for-one

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.700 
radio so you know it's a two-for-one
deal<00:05:39.060> plus<00:05:39.780> I<00:05:39.960> don't<00:05:40.020> have<00:05:40.320> the<00:05:40.530> us<00:05:41.900> B<00:05:42.900> or<00:05:43.110> us<00:05:43.440> to

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
deal plus I don't have the us B or us to

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.860 
deal plus I don't have the us B or us to
cable<00:05:44.430> to<00:05:44.550> do<00:05:44.700> any<00:05:44.850> update<00:05:45.270> in<00:05:45.390> a<00:05:45.450> first<00:05:45.720> place

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
cable to do any update in a first place

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.240 
cable to do any update in a first place
so<00:05:46.140> I<00:05:46.350> have<00:05:46.650> no<00:05:46.830> need<00:05:47.100> for<00:05:47.340> the<00:05:47.940> more<00:05:48.120> expensive

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
so I have no need for the more expensive

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.360 
so I have no need for the more expensive
ladybird<00:05:50.250> or<00:05:50.700> v1<00:05:51.590> v2<00:05:52.590> you<00:05:52.950> know<00:05:53.070> it's<00:05:53.190> a<00:05:53.250> lot

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
ladybird or v1 v2 you know it's a lot

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.090 
ladybird or v1 v2 you know it's a lot
cheaper<00:05:53.640> and<00:05:54.030> I<00:05:54.390> also<00:05:54.930> what<00:05:55.260> I<00:05:55.290> did<00:05:55.650> notice<00:05:55.800> is

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
cheaper and I also what I did notice is

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.990 
cheaper and I also what I did notice is
uh<00:05:56.840> there's<00:05:57.840> no<00:05:58.110> telemetry<00:05:59.040> feature<00:05:59.550> on<00:05:59.790> here

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
uh there's no telemetry feature on here

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.600 
uh there's no telemetry feature on here
so<00:06:00.180> you<00:06:00.240> if<00:06:00.780> you<00:06:00.930> flying<00:06:01.410> with<00:06:01.590> your<00:06:01.770> Devo<00:06:02.130> 8's

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
so you if you flying with your Devo 8's

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.080 
so you if you flying with your Devo 8's
or<00:06:03.170> any<00:06:04.170> of<00:06:04.350> your<00:06:04.500> telemetry<00:06:05.160> feature<00:06:05.550> radios

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
or any of your telemetry feature radios

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.390 
or any of your telemetry feature radios
you<00:06:06.750> can't<00:06:07.050> read<00:06:07.440> the<00:06:07.680> voltage<00:06:08.040> of<00:06:08.250> the

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
you can't read the voltage of the

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.340 
you can't read the voltage of the
battery<00:06:08.430> so<00:06:09.330> that<00:06:09.630> could<00:06:09.840> be<00:06:09.870> a<00:06:10.020> bad<00:06:10.320> thing

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
battery so that could be a bad thing

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.290 
battery so that could be a bad thing
could<00:06:10.890> be<00:06:11.010> a<00:06:11.040> good<00:06:11.280> thing<00:06:11.490> but<00:06:11.760> you<00:06:11.910> know<00:06:11.940> I

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
could be a good thing but you know I

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.810 
could be a good thing but you know I
don't<00:06:12.840> really<00:06:13.020> use<00:06:13.890> that<00:06:13.920> feature<00:06:14.280> too<00:06:14.640> much

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
don't really use that feature too much

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.370 
don't really use that feature too much
anyways<00:06:15.210> because<00:06:15.420> I<00:06:15.570> set<00:06:15.780> my<00:06:15.900> timer<00:06:16.140> when<00:06:16.350> I

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
anyways because I set my timer when I

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.800 
anyways because I set my timer when I
fly<00:06:16.680> always<00:06:17.040> know<00:06:17.430> when<00:06:18.060> I<00:06:18.090> land<00:06:18.390> how<00:06:18.660> long

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
fly always know when I land how long

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.150 
fly always know when I land how long
I've<00:06:18.930> been<00:06:19.050> flying<00:06:19.320> and<00:06:19.620> just<00:06:19.650> pretty<00:06:19.950> much

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
I've been flying and just pretty much

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.520 
I've been flying and just pretty much
land<00:06:20.520> after<00:06:20.790> like<00:06:20.940> six<00:06:21.210> minutes<00:06:21.660> so<00:06:21.870> the

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
land after like six minutes so the

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.530 
land after like six minutes so the
telemetry<00:06:22.830> feature<00:06:23.370> is<00:06:23.700> not<00:06:23.910> really<00:06:24.240> needed

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540 
telemetry feature is not really needed

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.870 
telemetry feature is not really needed
just<00:06:24.840> because<00:06:25.230> you<00:06:25.410> can't<00:06:25.650> even<00:06:25.740> see<00:06:26.430> the<00:06:26.520> GPS

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
just because you can't even see the GPS

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.580 
just because you can't even see the GPS
feature<00:06:27.180> and<00:06:27.690> you<00:06:27.750> can<00:06:27.900> even<00:06:28.050> see<00:06:28.410> the

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
feature and you can even see the

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.110 
feature and you can even see the
temperature<00:06:29.130> up<00:06:29.190> the<00:06:29.310> motor<00:06:29.520> all<00:06:29.730> you<00:06:29.820> can<00:06:29.970> do

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
temperature up the motor all you can do

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.570 
temperature up the motor all you can do
is<00:06:30.300> see<00:06:31.020> the<00:06:31.170> voltage<00:06:31.380> of<00:06:31.800> the<00:06:31.920> battery<00:06:32.070> which

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
is see the voltage of the battery which

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.220 
is see the voltage of the battery which
you<00:06:32.880> know<00:06:33.030> could<00:06:33.300> be<00:06:33.420> a<00:06:33.480> good<00:06:33.660> thing<00:06:33.720> but<00:06:33.990> I

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
you know could be a good thing but I

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.340 
you know could be a good thing but I
would<00:06:34.800> rather<00:06:34.920> save<00:06:35.400> that<00:06:35.790> I<00:06:36.030> would<00:06:36.420> say<00:06:36.690> it's

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
would rather save that I would say it's

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.040 
would rather save that I would say it's
like<00:06:37.440> another<00:06:37.940> forty<00:06:38.940> bucks<00:06:39.180> and<00:06:39.480> it's<00:06:39.930> got

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.670 
like another forty bucks and it's got
the<00:06:40.140> v2

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.290 
the v2
it's<00:06:40.919> a<00:06:41.009> lot<00:06:41.190> cheaper<00:06:41.220> and<00:06:41.850> I<00:06:41.940> got<00:06:42.060> this<00:06:42.120> phone

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
it's a lot cheaper and I got this phone

just<00:06:54.539> the<00:06:54.660> same<00:06:54.900> I<00:06:55.169> didn't<00:06:55.710> really<00:06:55.889> notice

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 
just the same I didn't really notice

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.420 
just the same I didn't really notice
anything<00:06:56.370> of<00:06:56.699> difference<00:06:57.479> about<00:06:57.750> it<00:06:57.900> and<00:06:58.430> the

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
anything of difference about it and the

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.430 
anything of difference about it and the
D<00:06:59.580> before<00:06:59.729> you<00:07:00.449> could<00:07:00.690> do<00:07:00.840> flips<00:07:01.199> with<00:07:01.320> this

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
D before you could do flips with this

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.080 
D before you could do flips with this
one<00:07:01.590> except<00:07:01.860> on<00:07:02.009> the<00:07:02.100> binding<00:07:02.400> process<00:07:02.639> you

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.090 
one except on the binding process you

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.659 
one except on the binding process you
just<00:07:03.300> gotta<00:07:03.479> put<00:07:04.410> the<00:07:04.560> rato<00:07:04.710> up<00:07:04.979> follow<00:07:05.550> the

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:05.669 
just gotta put the rato up follow the

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:07.640 
just gotta put the rato up follow the
instructions<00:07:06.180> when<00:07:06.449> the<00:07:06.539> light<00:07:06.690> blinks<00:07:07.199> you

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:07.650 
instructions when the light blinks you

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.189 
instructions when the light blinks you
know<00:07:07.800> once<00:07:08.580> it<00:07:08.669> it<00:07:09.120> binds<00:07:09.419> you<00:07:09.780> just<00:07:09.990> pretty

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 
know once it it binds you just pretty

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:12.200 
know once it it binds you just pretty
much<00:07:10.410> move<00:07:10.710> it<00:07:10.830> up<00:07:11.039> and<00:07:11.250> down<00:07:11.340> four<00:07:11.639> times<00:07:11.850> and

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.210 
much move it up and down four times and

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.129 
much move it up and down four times and
that<00:07:12.300> light<00:07:12.389> will<00:07:12.509> turn<00:07:12.600> green<00:07:12.720> which<00:07:13.110> means

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:13.139 
that light will turn green which means

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:15.140 
that light will turn green which means
you're<00:07:13.530> in<00:07:13.620> three<00:07:13.860> axes<00:07:14.190> mode<00:07:14.400> and<00:07:14.789> you're

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:15.150 
you're in three axes mode and you're

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.969 
you're in three axes mode and you're
still<00:07:15.360> have<00:07:15.509> that<00:07:15.660> six<00:07:15.960> axis<00:07:16.320> mode<00:07:16.500> for<00:07:16.800> that

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:16.979 
still have that six axis mode for that

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:19.879 
still have that six axis mode for that
you<00:07:17.190> know<00:07:17.280> self<00:07:17.849> leveling<00:07:18.330> and<00:07:18.650> stable<00:07:19.650> flight

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:19.889 
you know self leveling and stable flight

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:22.100 
you know self leveling and stable flight
and<00:07:20.190> you<00:07:20.550> can<00:07:20.669> still<00:07:20.910> put<00:07:21.240> in<00:07:21.330> 3d<00:07:21.599> mode<00:07:21.750> except

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.110 
and you can still put in 3d mode except

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.350 
and you can still put in 3d mode except
there's<00:07:22.320> there's<00:07:22.530> no<00:07:22.710> switches<00:07:23.220> on<00:07:23.430> here<00:07:24.180> to

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 
there's there's no switches on here to

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.879 
there's there's no switches on here to
put<00:07:24.599> into<00:07:24.810> flight<00:07:25.110> mode<00:07:25.139> which<00:07:25.500> is<00:07:25.620> a<00:07:25.650> downside

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:25.889 
put into flight mode which is a downside

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:29.480 
put into flight mode which is a downside
but<00:07:26.270> cheaper<00:07:27.270> package<00:07:27.720> means<00:07:28.490> more

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.490 
but cheaper package means more

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.159 
but cheaper package means more
affordability<00:07:30.030> so<00:07:30.570> that's<00:07:30.750> pretty<00:07:30.960> good<00:07:31.110> for

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:31.169 
affordability so that's pretty good for

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:32.900 
affordability so that's pretty good for
you<00:07:31.380> guys<00:07:31.530> too<00:07:31.830> so<00:07:32.039> that's<00:07:32.190> pretty<00:07:32.400> much<00:07:32.490> it<00:07:32.639> of

from Walkera so thanks for watching guys
and<00:07:39.660> also<00:07:40.139> you<00:07:40.800> guys<00:07:40.889> are<00:07:41.039> probably<00:07:41.130> wondering

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:41.310 
and also you guys are probably wondering

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.490 
and also you guys are probably wondering
how<00:07:41.669> this<00:07:41.789> thing<00:07:41.970> flies<00:07:42.139> pretty<00:07:43.139> much<00:07:43.349> it

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:43.500 
how this thing flies pretty much it

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.040 
how this thing flies pretty much it
flies<00:07:43.710> just<00:07:44.310> like<00:07:44.580> the<00:07:44.820> original<00:07:45.300> one<00:07:45.330> which<00:07:45.750> I

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.050 
flies just like the original one which I

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.689 
flies just like the original one which I
already<00:07:46.560> have<00:07:46.680> a<00:07:46.710> video<00:07:46.919> on<00:07:47.130> there<00:07:47.430> so<00:07:47.639> you

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:47.699 
already have a video on there so you

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:51.980 
already have a video on there so you
guys<00:07:48.349> probably<00:07:49.349> won't<00:07:49.740> see<00:07:50.070> a<00:07:50.599> another<00:07:51.599> video

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:51.990 
guys probably won't see a another video

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:53.779 
guys probably won't see a another video
up<00:07:52.229> to<00:07:52.349> v2<00:07:52.710> unless<00:07:52.979> you<00:07:53.099> guys<00:07:53.250> make<00:07:53.550> enough

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:53.789 
up to v2 unless you guys make enough

00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:55.159 
up to v2 unless you guys make enough
requests<00:07:54.150> and<00:07:54.449> I'll<00:07:54.539> probably<00:07:54.750> end<00:07:54.900> up<00:07:54.960> doing

00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:55.169 
requests and I'll probably end up doing

00:07:55.169 --> 00:07:58.129 
requests and I'll probably end up doing
it<00:07:55.380> if<00:07:55.500> you<00:07:55.620> guys<00:07:55.770> asked<00:07:56.729> me<00:07:56.849> to<00:07:57.060> or<00:07:57.300> this<00:07:57.630> or

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:03.300 
difference between the two which is not

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.689 
difference between the two which is not
a<00:08:03.479> lot<00:08:03.810> at<00:08:04.050> all<00:08:04.110> to<00:08:04.500> be<00:08:04.590> honest<00:08:04.919> so<00:08:05.460> there<00:08:05.610> you
