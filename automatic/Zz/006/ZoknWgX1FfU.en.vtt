00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 primarily choosing whole coat 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.020
 whether or not to target your 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.120
 taste first everything else in 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.710
 depending on the design and blood given 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.519
 case you can watch several 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:18.570
 examples this is made of a solid coat 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.910
 mink with the applied method of dissolution in 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.010
 in this version you will see perfectly 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.070
 performed also from a mink coat 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.369
 but whisk you see it is made already from 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.810
 pieces of great wearing fur coats from 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.540
 mink lobster 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.960
 but for the full gram of harmony you 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.649
 you see this fur coat is also trimmed with fur from 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.079
 Russia is a prominent cat here you see 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.640
 slightly funny original but in 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.170
 first i want to draw your 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.140
 attention to coat it 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.090
 with a low nap here you see to 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.829
 perform what kind of frame told from 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.620
 forehead mink and she is not so 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.789
 fluffy little effect applied 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.160
 haircuts 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.570
 but in this case you see a noise which 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.559
 was not cut 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.150
 and it is made of zolkova skins 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.020
 about wearability naturally take 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.590
 says that to be made out entirely 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.570
 their skins she will be a little more noska but 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.869
 in the case when we talk about a fur coat from 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.060
 pieces we find ourselves at the threshold 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.520
 a large selection we can as often as possible 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.020
 change this coat because they are more 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.650
 budget and also you can find fur coats 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.920
 your dream different location 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.650
 skins 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.150
 may be interesting beautiful drawing in 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.380
 In this case, you see perfectly 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.040
 coat made lighter shade of white 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.439
 and 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.390
 combined bluish color of mink but 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.579
 I draw your attention not only that she 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.869
 dropped out of fox mink here yet 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.110
 applied very nicely 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.659
 interesting method of shearing itself still 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.079
 trimmed collar and more beautiful 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.770
 snow-white scribe also from bruise you 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.909
 can wear almost anytime 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.049
 in autumn or winter she is pretty 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.049
 light and warm
