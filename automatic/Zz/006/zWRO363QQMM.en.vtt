00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.990 
of it of course we're only seeing the
single-player<00:00:27.190> announcement<00:00:28.190> or<00:00:28.310> reveal<00:00:28.760> for

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
this and the plot I like the idea of the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.099 
this and the plot I like the idea of the
plot<00:00:33.140> like<00:00:33.739> a<00:00:33.770> private<00:00:34.280> institution<00:00:35.109> kinda

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109 
plot like a private institution kinda

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:38.229 
plot like a private institution kinda
like<00:00:36.199> Blackwater<00:00:36.920> it's<00:00:37.190> a<00:00:37.249> private<00:00:37.519> military

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
like Blackwater it's a private military

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.799 
like Blackwater it's a private military
is<00:00:39.159> combating<00:00:40.159> against<00:00:40.760> like<00:00:40.940> governments<00:00:41.600> of

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
is combating against like governments of

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.559 
is combating against like governments of
the<00:00:42.050> world<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:43.100> I<00:00:43.550> think<00:00:43.760> that's<00:00:44.030> pretty<00:00:44.300> cool

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:44.569 
the world and I think that's pretty cool

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:46.599 
the world and I think that's pretty cool
it<00:00:44.780> kind<00:00:45.050> of<00:00:45.140> raises<00:00:45.710> some<00:00:46.100> questions<00:00:46.280> about

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:46.609 
it kind of raises some questions about

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:49.149 
it kind of raises some questions about
how<00:00:46.969> powerful<00:00:47.539> you<00:00:47.659> would<00:00:47.839> let<00:00:48.079> a<00:00:48.350> private

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
how powerful you would let a private

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.889 
how powerful you would let a private
military<00:00:51.069> organization<00:00:52.069> grow<00:00:52.460> and<00:00:52.999> what<00:00:53.749> they

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
military organization grow and what they

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.069 
military organization grow and what they
could<00:00:54.079> possibly<00:00:54.109> do<00:00:54.979> if<00:00:55.879> they<00:00:56.120> got<00:00:56.359> to<00:00:56.629> be<00:00:56.780> too

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
could possibly do if they got to be too

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.410 
could possibly do if they got to be too
big<00:00:57.409> in<00:00:57.739> someone<00:00:58.190> in<00:00:58.399> power<00:00:58.670> like<00:00:59.059> Kevin

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
big in someone in power like Kevin

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.389 
big in someone in power like Kevin
Spacey<00:00:59.809> who<00:01:00.469> I<00:01:00.499> think<00:01:00.620> is<00:01:00.859> going<00:01:00.889> to<00:01:01.159> be<00:01:01.219> an

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
Spacey who I think is going to be an

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.849 
Spacey who I think is going to be an
awesome<00:01:01.670> villain<00:01:02.299> it's<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:03.079> idea<00:01:03.409> that<00:01:03.469> they

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
awesome villain it's the idea that they

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:06.190 
awesome villain it's the idea that they
want<00:01:04.100> to<00:01:04.220> combat<00:01:04.640> against<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.720> government

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
want to combat against the government

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.870 
want to combat against the government
try<00:01:06.500> to<00:01:06.560> take<00:01:06.860> things<00:01:07.130> over<00:01:07.430> trying<00:01:07.670> to<00:01:07.760> take

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
try to take things over trying to take

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.030 
try to take things over trying to take
over<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.090> world<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:09.290> it<00:01:09.650> should<00:01:09.830> be<00:01:09.860> a<00:01:09.980> very

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
over the world so it should be a very

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.970 
over the world so it should be a very
cool<00:01:10.640> story<00:01:11.120> and<00:01:11.450> I<00:01:12.080> will<00:01:13.010> enjoy<00:01:13.310> it<00:01:13.640> I<00:01:14.060> think

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
cool story and I will enjoy it I think

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.370 
cool story and I will enjoy it I think
and<00:01:16.030> as<00:01:17.030> far<00:01:17.360> as<00:01:17.420> some<00:01:17.720> of<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:17.900> things<00:01:18.140> that<00:01:18.200> we

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
and as far as some of the things that we

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.470 
and as far as some of the things that we
saw<00:01:18.590> in<00:01:18.620> the<00:01:18.890> trailer<00:01:18.920> how<00:01:19.490> it<00:01:19.670> relates<00:01:20.300> the

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
saw in the trailer how it relates the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.510 
saw in the trailer how it relates the
multiplayer<00:01:21.050> there's<00:01:21.800> some<00:01:22.010> things<00:01:22.250> that<00:01:22.340> i

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
multiplayer there's some things that i

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.250 
multiplayer there's some things that i
saw<00:01:22.790> that<00:01:23.060> i<00:01:23.180> would<00:01:23.360> not<00:01:23.540> be<00:01:23.600> too<00:01:23.930> happy<00:01:24.050> with

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
saw that i would not be too happy with

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.680 
saw that i would not be too happy with
that<00:01:25.040> if<00:01:25.310> they<00:01:25.520> showed<00:01:25.820> up<00:01:26.060> in<00:01:26.210> multiplayer

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
that if they showed up in multiplayer

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.660 
that if they showed up in multiplayer
that<00:01:27.170> grenade<00:01:27.500> that<00:01:27.710> he<00:01:27.800> just<00:01:28.010> threw<00:01:28.280> was<00:01:28.460> kind

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
that grenade that he just threw was kind

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.890 
that grenade that he just threw was kind
of<00:01:28.700> I<00:01:28.760> got<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:29.120> wall<00:01:29.600> hacker<00:01:29.960> made<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:31.040> I<00:01:31.900> think

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
of I got a wall hacker made and I think

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.360 
of I got a wall hacker made and I think
that<00:01:33.050> could<00:01:33.200> be<00:01:33.260> annoying<00:01:33.620> but<00:01:33.920> it<00:01:34.280> would

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
that could be annoying but it would

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.430 
that could be annoying but it would
probably<00:01:34.400> be<00:01:34.730> even<00:01:34.970> more<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:35.720> knowing<00:01:36.080> two

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
probably be even more and knowing two

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.770 
probably be even more and knowing two
campers<00:01:37.220> that<00:01:37.280> try<00:01:37.730> to<00:01:37.760> sit<00:01:38.030> inside<00:01:38.150> buildings

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
campers that try to sit inside buildings

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.520 
campers that try to sit inside buildings
so<00:01:39.350> it<00:01:39.590> might<00:01:39.800> be<00:01:39.830> a<00:01:39.980> good<00:01:40.430> anti<00:01:41.180> camper<00:01:42.050> type

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
so it might be a good anti camper type

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.280 
so it might be a good anti camper type
revealing<00:01:43.490> device<00:01:43.910> which<00:01:44.390> might<00:01:44.660> not<00:01:44.870> be<00:01:45.020> so

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
revealing device which might not be so

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.830 
revealing device which might not be so

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
know how effective it'll be or if it'll

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.040 
know how effective it'll be or if it'll
even<00:02:24.220> be<00:02:24.459> in<00:02:24.700> multiplayer<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.690> could<00:02:25.930> be

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
even be in multiplayer it could be

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.860 
even be in multiplayer it could be
annoying<00:02:26.349> to<00:02:26.709> have<00:02:26.830> portable<00:02:27.550> campers<00:02:28.060> but

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
annoying to have portable campers but

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.140 
annoying to have portable campers but
kind<00:02:29.650> of<00:02:29.769> saw<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.130> in<00:02:30.280> black<00:02:30.459> ops<00:02:30.640> 2<00:02:30.760> with<00:02:31.120> the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
kind of saw that in black ops 2 with the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.699 
kind of saw that in black ops 2 with the
riot<00:02:31.630> shield<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:32.049> you<00:02:32.200> plant<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.560> ground

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
riot shield that you plant in the ground

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.640 
riot shield that you plant in the ground
but<00:02:33.160> it<00:02:33.610> wasn't<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.120> effective<00:02:34.989> so<00:02:35.230> I<00:02:35.440> guess

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
but it wasn't that effective so I guess

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.530 
but it wasn't that effective so I guess
it<00:02:35.769> just<00:02:35.799> depends<00:02:36.340> how<00:02:36.519> effective<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.150> is<00:02:37.180> in

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
it just depends how effective it is in

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.160 
it just depends how effective it is in
the<00:02:38.290> multiplayer<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:40.000> I'm<00:02:40.480> not<00:02:40.780> getting<00:02:41.019> my

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
the multiplayer but I'm not getting my

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.140 
the multiplayer but I'm not getting my
expectations<00:02:42.160> up<00:02:42.400> every<00:02:42.670> time<00:02:42.819> i<00:02:42.910> get<00:02:43.030> my

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
expectations up i get let down so trying

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.110

to have low expectations and we'll just
