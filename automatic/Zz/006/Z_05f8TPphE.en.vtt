00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:10.960 
okay I'm now at the loot that after our

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.380 
okay I'm now at the loot that after our
apartment<00:00:11.530> and<00:00:11.680> then<00:00:11.910> for<00:00:12.910> last<00:00:15.119> two<00:00:16.119> weeks

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
apartment and then for last two weeks

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.130 
apartment and then for last two weeks
actually<00:00:16.630> I<00:00:16.900> or<00:00:17.710> fix<00:00:18.520> and<00:00:18.789> set<00:00:19.150> a<00:00:19.390> swamp<00:00:19.869> cooler

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
actually I or fix and set a swamp cooler

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.330 
actually I or fix and set a swamp cooler
in<00:00:20.949> New<00:00:21.190> Mexico<00:00:21.550> this<00:00:21.670> is<00:00:21.820> kind<00:00:22.119> of<00:00:22.300> a<00:00:23.340> western

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
in New Mexico this is kind of a western

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.250 
in New Mexico this is kind of a western
style<00:00:24.430> of<00:00:24.789> air<00:00:25.029> conditioner<00:00:25.600> and<00:00:25.779> then<00:00:26.080> this

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
style of air conditioner and then this

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.010 
style of air conditioner and then this
works<00:00:26.859> are<00:00:27.220> very<00:00:27.580> different<00:00:28.270> three<00:00:28.660> from<00:00:28.990> the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
works are very different three from the

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.859 
works are very different three from the
conventional<00:00:30.119> air<00:00:31.119> conditioner<00:00:31.630> this<00:00:31.779> is

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
conventional air conditioner this is

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.299 
conventional air conditioner this is
very<00:00:32.050> primitive<00:00:32.379> way<00:00:32.680> of<00:00:33.030> sending<00:00:34.030> cool<00:00:34.480> with

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
very primitive way of sending cool with

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.280 
very primitive way of sending cool with
air<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:37.329> toe<00:00:37.450> inside<00:00:38.380> and<00:00:38.620> this<00:00:39.250> is<00:00:39.430> actually

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
air to toe inside and this is actually

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.080 
air to toe inside and this is actually
evaporate<00:00:41.579> cool<00:00:42.579> like<00:00:43.510> water<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:45.309> used<00:00:45.640> for

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
evaporate cool like water is used for

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.930 
evaporate cool like water is used for
cooling<00:00:46.570> out<00:00:46.840> putting<00:00:47.469> up<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.700> hot

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
cooling out putting up so hot

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.030 
cooling out putting up so hot
temperature<00:00:49.450> inside<00:00:49.719> apartments<00:00:50.350> so<00:00:50.500> this<00:00:50.980> is

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
temperature inside apartments so this is

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.510 
temperature inside apartments so this is
very<00:00:51.190> primitive<00:00:51.489> and<00:00:52.059> then<00:00:55.530> very<00:00:56.530> easy<00:00:56.829> to

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
very primitive and then very easy to

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.610 
very primitive and then very easy to
actually<00:00:57.670> fix<00:00:58.120> body<00:00:58.480> take<00:00:58.780> out<00:00:58.930> some<00:00:59.110> time<00:00:59.320> to

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
actually fix body take out some time to

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.029 
actually fix body take out some time to
fix<00:01:00.190> our<00:01:00.399> three<00:01:00.670> okay<00:01:01.360> this<00:01:01.600> I<00:01:01.840> you<00:01:02.590> can<00:01:02.770> see<00:01:03.010> I

fix our three okay this I you can see I

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.429 
fix our three okay this I you can see I
paint<00:01:03.670> or<00:01:04.740> outside<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:07.060> you<00:01:07.929> can<00:01:08.079> see<00:01:08.259> what

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
there are promise baking

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.820 
there are promise baking
so<00:01:33.650> this<00:01:33.950> working<00:01:34.490> in<00:01:34.730> here<00:01:35.030> from<00:01:35.479> sound<00:01:35.830> and
