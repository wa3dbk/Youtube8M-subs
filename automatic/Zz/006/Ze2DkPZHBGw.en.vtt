brains<00:01:25.770> know<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.280> goal<00:01:26.900> then<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.170> link<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.100> with

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
brains know the goal then I link in with

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.120 
brains know the goal then I link in with
their<00:01:29.400> previous<00:01:29.760> experience<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.830> asked<00:01:31.830> them

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
their previous experience I asked them

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.070 
their previous experience I asked them
if<00:01:32.250> they<00:01:32.400> already<00:01:32.640> know<00:01:32.970> any<00:01:33.450> words<00:01:33.780> for<00:01:33.960> the
