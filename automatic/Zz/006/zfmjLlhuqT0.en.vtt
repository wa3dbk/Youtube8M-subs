00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
that's kind of hard not to do and then

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.439 
that's kind of hard not to do and then
you<00:00:44.300> want<00:00:44.510> to<00:00:44.600> seal<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.620> fibers<00:00:46.100> with<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:47.210> gel

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
one more time that way you don't have a

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.819 
one more time that way you don't have a
fallout<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:50.660> if<00:00:50.870> it<00:00:50.989> falls<00:00:51.140> off<00:00:51.379> it's<00:00:51.590> okay

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
fallout and if it falls off it's okay

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:09.440
