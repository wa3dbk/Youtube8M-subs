00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
commander it's kind of a game of paper

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.160 
commander it's kind of a game of paper
rock<00:01:53.910> scissors<00:01:53.940> and<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.630> starts<00:01:54.930> with<00:01:55.050> the

rock scissors and it starts with the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.870 
rock scissors and it starts with the
Jets<00:01:55.440> each<00:01:55.710> team's<00:01:56.010> got<00:01:56.220> two<00:01:56.370> Jet's<00:01:56.670> one

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
your teams at Jetts down well what's

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.890 
your teams at Jetts down well what's
that<00:02:02.580> dude<00:02:02.820> that's<00:02:03.060> more<00:02:03.270> than<00:02:03.330> likely<00:02:03.600> going

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
that dude that's more than likely going

that dude that's more than likely going
to<00:02:03.960> free<00:02:04.290> up<00:02:04.470> their<00:02:05.340> jets<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.970> kill<00:02:06.150> your

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
to free up their jets to kill your

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.660 
to free up their jets to kill your
helicopters<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.470> their<00:02:07.800> helicopters<00:02:08.489> to

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
helicopters and their helicopters to

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.219 
helicopters and their helicopters to
kind<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:08.940> do<00:02:09.179> whatever<00:02:09.509> they<00:02:09.659> want<00:02:09.869> whether

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
kind of do whatever they want whether

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.559 
kind of do whatever they want whether
they<00:02:10.349> get<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.709> attack<00:02:10.979> helicopter<00:02:11.610> or<00:02:11.790> if

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
they get the attack helicopter or if

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.020 
they get the attack helicopter or if
there<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> little<00:02:13.500> bird<00:02:13.769> or<00:02:13.920> scout<00:02:14.190> flying

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
there is a little bird or scout flying

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.440 
there is a little bird or scout flying
around<00:02:15.330> but<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.170> just<00:02:16.590> doesn't<00:02:16.800> end<00:02:17.100> there

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
around but it just doesn't end there

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.280 
around but it just doesn't end there
usually<00:02:18.450> jets<00:02:18.900> are<00:02:19.020> going<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.200> pester<00:02:19.560> attack

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
usually jets are going to pester attack

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.649 
usually jets are going to pester attack
boats<00:02:20.439> and<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.069> LEDs<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.819> AAA<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.450> map

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
boats and the LEDs the AAA and the map

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.649 
boats and the LEDs the AAA and the map
and<00:02:22.930> if<00:02:23.799> they're<00:02:24.250> not<00:02:24.430> being<00:02:25.120> pestered<00:02:25.599> by

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
and if they're not being pestered by

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.929 
and if they're not being pestered by
jets<00:02:26.109> they<00:02:26.680> can<00:02:26.859> kind<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.189> beat<00:02:27.340> up<00:02:27.459> on<00:02:27.609> your

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
jets they can kind of beat up on your

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.630 
jets they can kind of beat up on your
attack<00:02:28.239> folks<00:02:28.510> in<00:02:28.810> LEDs<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:29.469> it's<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.709> whole

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
attack folks in LEDs so it's a whole

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.539 
attack folks in LEDs so it's a whole
little<00:02:31.390> cycle<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:32.140> what<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.709> Jets<00:02:33.010> are<00:02:33.250> doing

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
little cycle of what the Jets are doing

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.580 
little cycle of what the Jets are doing
and<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.760> course<00:02:34.000> there<00:02:34.209> are<00:02:34.409> infantry<00:02:35.409> hell

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
and of course there are infantry hell

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.819 
and of course there are infantry hell
locked<00:02:36.040> abilities<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:37.150> Agulhas<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:38.109> course

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
locked abilities the Agulhas of course

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.280 
locked abilities the Agulhas of course
but<00:02:39.129> that<00:02:39.370> only<00:02:39.790> goes<00:02:39.879> so<00:02:40.060> far<00:02:40.299> especially

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
but that only goes so far especially

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.839 
but that only goes so far especially
when<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.590> flight<00:02:41.799> ceiling<00:02:42.250> is<00:02:42.370> what<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.819> is

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
when the flight ceiling is what it is

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.729 
when the flight ceiling is what it is
and<00:02:43.329> we<00:02:43.780> haven't<00:02:44.109> even<00:02:44.200> talked<00:02:44.560> about

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
and we haven't even talked about

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.920 
and we haven't even talked about

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
commander mode this one-way function

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.539 
commander mode this one-way function
usually<00:02:47.260> because<00:02:47.409> there's<00:02:47.560> usually<00:02:47.739> only<00:02:48.069> one

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
usually because there's usually only one

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.569 
usually because there's usually only one
commander<00:02:49.480> who<00:02:49.629> could<00:02:49.810> pop<00:02:50.019> a<00:02:50.230> c-130<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:51.489> if

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
commander who could pop a c-130 that if

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.879 
commander who could pop a c-130 that if
it<00:02:51.670> dies<00:02:51.849> they<00:02:52.150> can<00:02:52.299> pop<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.659> a<00:02:52.840> couple<00:02:53.409> seconds

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
it dies they can pop it a couple seconds

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.289 
it dies they can pop it a couple seconds
later<00:02:54.099> and<00:02:54.310> they're<00:02:54.489> a<00:02:54.519> pain<00:02:54.849> in<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.060> ass<00:02:55.269> to

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
later and they're a pain in the ass to

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.929 
later and they're a pain in the ass to
kill<00:02:55.720> there's<00:02:56.620> an<00:02:56.859> altitude<00:02:57.310> bug<00:02:57.700> with<00:02:57.849> the

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:57.939 
kill there's an altitude bug with the

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.179 
kill there's an altitude bug with the
jets<00:02:58.209> that<00:02:58.389> can't<00:02:58.629> hit<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.290> then<00:03:00.099> of

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:00.189 
jets that can't hit it and then of

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.789 
jets that can't hit it and then of
course<00:03:00.250> TV<00:03:00.669> missiles<00:03:01.000> only<00:03:01.180> do<00:03:01.299> 21<00:03:01.840> damage<00:03:02.409> and

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
course TV missiles only do 21 damage and

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.250 
course TV missiles only do 21 damage and
again<00:03:03.760> there's<00:03:03.970> usually<00:03:04.239> only<00:03:04.419> one<00:03:04.720> commander

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
again there's usually only one commander

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.050 
again there's usually only one commander
so<00:03:05.409> that's<00:03:05.590> not<00:03:05.799> exactly<00:03:06.010> fair<00:03:06.220> but<00:03:06.700> I<00:03:06.849> learned

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
so that's not exactly fair but I learned

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.000 
so that's not exactly fair but I learned
something<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.480> other<00:03:07.599> day<00:03:07.840> I'd<00:03:08.409> been<00:03:08.680> in<00:03:08.709> the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
something the other day I'd been in the

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.099 
something the other day I'd been in the
fun<00:03:09.669> ship<00:03:09.879> gunship<00:03:10.209> several<00:03:10.510> times<00:03:10.720> that<00:03:10.989> I've

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
fun ship gunship several times that I've

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.080 
fun ship gunship several times that I've
taken<00:03:11.319> a<00:03:11.560> random<00:03:11.829> damage<00:03:12.430> it's<00:03:12.609> like<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.730> tick

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
taken a random damage it's like a tick

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.539 
taken a random damage it's like a tick
but<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:13.930> hits<00:03:14.200> for<00:03:14.439> five<00:03:14.680> or<00:03:14.709> six<00:03:15.159> or<00:03:15.310> seven

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
but it hits for five or six or seven

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.159 
but it hits for five or six or seven
damage<00:03:15.849> as<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.269> spawn<00:03:16.780> in<00:03:17.079> on<00:03:17.439> a<00:03:17.669> filthy<00:03:18.669> more

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
damage as I spawn in on a filthy more

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.960 
damage as I spawn in on a filthy more
sneaky<00:03:20.169> sneaky<00:03:21.010> little<00:03:21.189> guy<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.790> I'm<00:03:21.879> gonna

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
sneaky sneaky little guy and I'm gonna

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.809 
sneaky sneaky little guy and I'm gonna
mess<00:03:22.209> this<00:03:22.359> up<00:03:22.540> because<00:03:23.370> tree<00:03:24.370> kind<00:03:24.609> of<00:03:24.669> gets

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
mess this up because tree kind of gets

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.009 
mess this up because tree kind of gets
in<00:03:24.909> the<00:03:24.970> way<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.150> should<00:03:25.599> have<00:03:25.690> gone<00:03:25.750> for<00:03:25.930> the

in the way I should have gone for the

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.420 
in the way I should have gone for the
heads<00:03:26.169> like<00:03:26.349> I<00:03:26.500> let's<00:03:26.680> just<00:03:26.829> body<00:03:27.099> shot<00:03:27.340> this

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
heads like I let's just body shot this

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.129 
heads like I let's just body shot this
guy<00:03:27.549> but<00:03:27.849> I'll<00:03:27.940> wait<00:03:28.120> there's<00:03:28.510> more<00:03:28.750> but<00:03:28.959> I've

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
at CTU right now so I think that'll

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.119 
at CTU right now so I think that'll
change<00:04:08.470> us<00:04:08.769> somebody<00:04:09.040> plops<00:04:09.729> down<00:04:10.000> a<00:04:10.060> nasty

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
change us somebody plops down a nasty

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.849 
change us somebody plops down a nasty
jdam<00:04:12.129> so<00:04:12.340> this<00:04:12.489> is<00:04:12.609> when<00:04:12.729> I<00:04:12.760> kind<00:04:12.970> of<00:04:13.150> panic

i noticed there's a rib and attack boat
behind<00:04:45.100> me<00:04:45.430> and<00:04:45.880> I'm<00:04:46.270> hoping<00:04:46.660> that<00:04:47.230> it<00:04:47.650> doesn't

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
behind me and I'm hoping that it doesn't

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.000 
behind me and I'm hoping that it doesn't
look<00:04:48.040> this<00:04:48.250> way<00:04:48.490> because<00:04:49.180> a<00:04:49.360> couple<00:04:49.600> 25<00:04:50.200> or<00:04:50.530> 30

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
look this way because a couple 25 or 30

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.820 
look this way because a couple 25 or 30
in<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.700> ass<00:04:51.850> and<00:04:52.300> I'm<00:04:52.780> gone<00:04:53.080> but<00:04:53.350> if<00:04:53.560> that's

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
in the ass and I'm gone but if that's

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.790 
in the ass and I'm gone but if that's
not<00:04:54.160> enough<00:04:55.230> there's<00:04:56.230> going<00:04:56.290> to<00:04:56.410> be<00:04:56.440> an<00:04:56.560> l<00:04:56.650> EV

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
not enough there's going to be an l EV

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.130 
not enough there's going to be an l EV
that's<00:04:57.310> quickly<00:04:57.610> gonna<00:04:58.330> join<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:58.720> party<00:04:59.050> and

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
that's quickly gonna join the party and

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.530 
that's quickly gonna join the party and
I<00:04:59.200> get<00:04:59.380> lucky<00:04:59.560> here<00:04:59.920> he's<00:05:00.220> either<00:05:00.540> disabled

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
I get lucky here he's either disabled

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.340 
I get lucky here he's either disabled
beached<00:05:02.230> and<00:05:02.820> Ola<00:05:03.820> there's<00:05:04.540> a<00:05:04.630> rib<00:05:04.870> gunner<00:05:05.110> I

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
beached and Ola there's a rib gunner I

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.520 
beached and Ola there's a rib gunner I
probably<00:05:05.919> could<00:05:06.400> have<00:05:06.430> magnum<00:05:07.030> mines<00:05:07.540> but

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
probably could have magnum mines but

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.280 
probably could have magnum mines but
three<00:05:09.280> body<00:05:09.520> shots<00:05:09.880> will<00:05:10.330> do<00:05:10.540> the<00:05:10.990> trick<00:05:11.169> but

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
three body shots will do the trick but

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.659 
three body shots will do the trick but
if<00:05:11.530> he<00:05:11.650> quickly<00:05:11.919> would<00:05:12.190> have<00:05:12.280> jerked<00:05:12.490> that

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
if he quickly would have jerked that

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.970 
if he quickly would have jerked that
around<00:05:12.970> there's<00:05:13.270> no<00:05:13.510> way<00:05:13.870> I<00:05:14.200> would<00:05:14.770> have<00:05:14.800> been

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
around there's no way I would have been

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.320 
around there's no way I would have been
able<00:05:15.100> to<00:05:15.310> hit<00:05:15.460> him<00:05:15.669> and<00:05:15.910> that's<00:05:16.060> something

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
able to hit him and that's something

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.300 
able to hit him and that's something
that<00:05:16.510> whenever<00:05:16.900> I'm<00:05:17.230> a<00:05:17.260> rib<00:05:17.560> gunner<00:05:17.830> it's

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
that whenever I'm a rib gunner it's
