00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
get to the specs first the wheel is 72

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.189

millimeter contact patch what that
contact<00:00:35.910> thought<00:00:36.090> you're<00:00:36.210> going<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.480> for

contact thought you're going to do for

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.600 
contact thought you're going to do for
you<00:00:36.719> having<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.350> smaller<00:00:37.800> width<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
you having that smaller width of the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.459 
you having that smaller width of the
wheel<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.270> gonna<00:00:39.510> really<00:00:39.690> let<00:00:39.960> your<00:00:40.140> release

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
wheel is gonna really let your release

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.290 
wheel is gonna really let your release
point<00:00:40.710> be<00:00:40.980> much<00:00:41.250> much<00:00:41.430> quicker<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.850> much<00:00:42.030> more

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
point be much much quicker and much more

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.420 
point be much much quicker and much more
defined<00:00:42.629> as<00:00:42.899> well<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.710> doesn't<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> medium

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
defined as well it doesn't a medium

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.360 
defined as well it doesn't a medium
sized<00:00:44.700> core<00:00:45.120> not<00:00:45.660> too<00:00:45.870> way<00:00:45.989> before<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:46.739> it

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
sized core not too way before but it

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.200 
sized core not too way before but it
does<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.149> larger<00:00:49.050> than<00:00:49.200> normal<00:00:49.410> core

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
does have that larger than normal core

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.439 
does have that larger than normal core
I'm<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.360> gonna<00:00:51.480> make<00:00:51.750> slides<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:53.610> lot<00:00:54.059> easier

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
I'm just gonna make slides a lot easier

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.450 
I'm just gonna make slides a lot easier
to<00:00:54.539> make<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> aware<00:00:55.530> pattern<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.309> wheel

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
to make the aware pattern of the wheel

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.540 
to make the aware pattern of the wheel
more<00:00:56.670> consistent<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.360> well<00:00:57.920> also<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.430> an

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
more consistent as well also it's an

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.880 
more consistent as well also it's an
offset<00:01:00.030> bearing<00:01:00.510> seat<00:01:00.750> that's<00:01:01.500> going<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.800> do

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
offset bearing seat that's going to do

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.039 
offset bearing seat that's going to do
is<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.609> physically<00:01:03.210> means<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> bearing

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
is it physically means that the bearing

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.039 
is it physically means that the bearing
is<00:01:04.519> kind<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:05.880> not<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.390> release<00:01:06.570> under<00:01:06.840> set

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
is kind of like not to release under set

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.600 
is kind of like not to release under set
and<00:01:07.229> not<00:01:07.320> side<00:01:07.590> set<00:01:07.890> but<00:01:08.100> somewhere<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
and not side set but somewhere in the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.719 
and not side set but somewhere in the
middle<00:01:08.640> between<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.090> two<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.740> offset<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.310> you

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
middle between the two so offset so you

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.580 
middle between the two so offset so you
can't<00:01:12.060> flip<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.920> to<00:01:13.920> increase<00:01:14.729> wear<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.720> like

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
can't flip it to increase wear but like

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.160 
can't flip it to increase wear but like
I<00:01:16.770> said<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.450> core<00:01:18.450> does<00:01:18.810> help<00:01:19.049> with<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
I said the the core does help with the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.320 
I said the the core does help with the
wear<00:01:19.380> pattern<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.860> keeps<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.159> consistent<00:01:20.330> they

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
wear pattern it keeps it consistent they

I haven't written them for for two too
long<00:01:53.050> yet<00:01:53.260> so<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.850> I<00:01:55.240> mean<00:01:55.450> durability<00:01:55.960> so<00:01:56.140> far

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
long yet so the I mean durability so far

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.880 
long yet so the I mean durability so far
is<00:01:56.710> fine<00:01:57.520> as<00:01:57.700> far<00:01:57.850> as<00:01:57.910> I<00:01:58.030> can<00:01:58.090> see<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.890> in

is fine as far as I can see and in

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.040 
is fine as far as I can see and in

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
general it's a good all-around cycle and

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.969 
general it's a good all-around cycle and
we<00:02:02.740> like<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:03.010> a<00:02:03.070> lot<00:02:03.190> so<00:02:03.460> if<00:02:04.390> you<00:02:04.770> looking<00:02:05.770> for<00:02:05.950> a
