00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.380
 And, well , I came here today to make a 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.240
 tour with you guys the fastest I hate 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.069
 make the big think you are too 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.830
 how to calculate this new 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.090
 hydropan yields 400 and 600 for 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.509
 the following go here in this gear 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:20.220
 here on top of settings the bic game 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.300
 of the mark of the three options here one thing 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.609
 the options 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.609
 Then you will open the game. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:38.579
 so here already in the game when colliding and tim is 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:40.649
 my result here gave 20 babies in the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.290
 belly is centralized grant - already 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.090
 is bigger than the new design is that 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.460
 Can you count in English? 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.879
 It's just that there is a shortcut that I 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.100
 I found the internet because it's who can 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.199
 to use the pv of the rule that we do to 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.559
 people take the value of the baby because of 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:03.750
 duck still value of ipva is my design 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:06.780
 who gave in 2001 the debt and four or 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.050
 five times when I step close to shift 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.860
 0 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:15.850
 here in that position that the sale is 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.260
 to enroll right from the can play yes 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.440
 while up here is much more 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.660
 faster than the 40 babies of the 20th 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:28.330
 I figured I 'm going to put what I kiss in the 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:36.120
 item that in the case including the time 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:36.120
 This is 49 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.490
 So I talk about the galley so it calculates 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.560
 although the new resolution is only 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.560
 find a bar is there, thanks
