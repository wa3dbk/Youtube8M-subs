 I loved Christmas but that Christmas Eve 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.290
 it was different since his dad did not have 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.560
 work and that's why she had no money 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.150
 to buy fruit toys or sweets 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.130
 to give the child god 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.260
 That night, Camilo and his family 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.900
 they celebrated together the good night at home 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.840
 they prepared rice and beans pancakes 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.820
 everything before midnight the bells of 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.129

 inside your heart in the church 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.290
 Camila left because she felt embarrassed 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.180
 for not having an offering when 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.159
 he soon heard the voice of the angel of 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.770
 stone of the sacristy who told him 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.460

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.570
 he knelt and dropped a tear 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.270
 about the poor offering he was carrying between 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.610
 his arms in contact with that tear 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.520
