00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.269
 very good Hello everyone I am sp 26 and 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.070
 welcome to this new tutorial in the 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:11.259
 I want to show you how to create or do 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.230
 the best effects or filters for 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:17.110
 your photographs these filters or 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.240
 effects are therefore similar to those 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.380
 we could get on the page 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.599
 instagram that the truth that remain 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.609
 pretty good and I think they give it a 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.769
 touch the photos well enough 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.109
 interesting and quite beautiful and good 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.750
 a lot of people, it's pretty 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:35.170
 difficult to achieve these effects in 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.510
 photoshop I think that as photoshop is 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.350
 a tool that is complex worth 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.360
 you need to have knowledge about 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.100
 her to know how to handle a bit of everything 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.930
 theme of the layers and so on and good 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.059
 I understand that people find it 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.500
 complicated then what are we going to bring 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.980
 in this tutorial is a tool 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.260
 totally free with which we 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.590
 we will be able to apply them to our 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.380
 photos a filters effects totally 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.960
 incredible and that without a doubt 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.720
 are equal or better than those 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.280
 we can get in instagram worth good 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.870
 has said all this let's proceed with 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.790
 the tutorial and as always the link 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.380
 download the official page will be on 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.780
 the description of the video so you go to 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.390
 the description and it will send you to this 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.600
 page in question agreement as you see 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.270
 we have the name of the software that is 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.280
 vintage and good below we have 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.460
 a brief description of what is the 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.380
 program it as you see this is what 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.990
 make the graphical interface of said 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.300
 software is very intuitive and very easy 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.040
 the program comes English but I'm going to 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.710
 explain more or less so that you see 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.119
 that really is very easy to apply 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.300
 all the effects that we have 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.830
 available is good as you see we have 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.259
 different photos that we can see 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.630
 shows the effects that are going to 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.780
 applying and to download it we give in 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.940
 download vintage is worth simply 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.290
 We click here and automatically 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.790
 discharge weighs 15 megabytes is quite not 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.560
 occupies much the truth and well then 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.970
 we can get pretty results 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.069
 good then once downloaded what 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.580
 what we are going to do is click on the 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.740
 installer we say that we execute it 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.290
 let's go that if we're going to minimize this 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.030
 so that it does not get in the way and as you see 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.310
 We can select only in German and 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.390
 Chinese in English we are obviously going to 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.190
 stay with English we give in ok a 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.690
 Once done this we give in following 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.360
 how the assistant of 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.520
 installation of the 2014 version and you 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.100
 We give in nets accept the agreement of 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.690
 license we give you in nets here we could 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.400
 introduce our own name in this 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.740
 case I'm going to leave it as admin we give 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.480
 in net to proceed and here what 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.790
 let's do is select where 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.380
 I usually always want to install 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.900
 been the things in the same place as 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.970
 as you well know to have them well 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.620
 located then we place it in the 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.050
 hard drive where we want to install and 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.940
 we give in ok to continue with the 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.420
 installation we give in neds tells us 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.590
 that will occupy about 27 7 megabytes 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.319
 and we give Danish to continue 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.300
 We say that net and will create an icon 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.010
 on the desk to open it good 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.440
 let's let you create icons 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.420
 of the desk for good to have it 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.890
 located and if you already know where 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.480
 so you do not have to trace 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.629
 no icon on the desktop 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.849
 we give in net and install to finalize 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.370
 As you can see, the installation is quite 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:30.060
 fast pretty simple here opens us 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.799
 again the page and well we mark the 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.099
 popcorn to launch the program and 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.480
 finish is there we have it perfect 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.470
 good as you see we are already in the 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.910
 graphic interface of this software will 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.430
 you will see that it is very easy to load 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.069
 images edit them apply them 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.170
 filters is a very fast way and 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.230
 simple that with which I believe that 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.819
 that we can get good 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.010
 results with the photos so we're going to 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.840
 we can introduce an image of the 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.390
 next way we give here click and 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.069
 open we would do what is the folder 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.690
 where we have available the 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.250
 images in this case I have it here 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.410
 it's from this photo of the bridge of san 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.730
 francisco and to introduce it only 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.680
 he gives it to us and we select it 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.349
 with the mouse and we introduce it inside 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.120
 of the work area of the software is worth 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.470
 as you see here we have it and the only thing 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.630
 we can do good the only thing we can 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.859
 do several things but watch for 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.199
 explain what are really 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.750
 interesting and that we are interested 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.550
 to us are these although they are so 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.350
 where does he put company where are the 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.570
 different tonalities and filters that 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.510
 we can apply to the 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:39.320
 photography as you see we have 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:41.510
 quite a lot of them and well as I say they are 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.850
 very similar to those that appear in 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:47.360
 instagram is worth as you see they are pretty 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:50.190
 similar I like this a lot 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.080
 as I said before very similar to the 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.770
 that appear in Instagram and we get 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.379
 results then 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.060
 very similar clear very similar and 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:02.150
 well we can apply different things 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:05.300
 as they are the file that would be what they are 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:08.370
 the shadows are these that we can put to 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.580
 in the photo we have them 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.949
 ok let's put this we can 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.080
 put a frame we can choose between 7 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.900
 different frames 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.479
 and we have them we can select what 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.280
 it is an area of the photo simply 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.020
 we make a rectangle in the image and 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.060
 there we would have it to go back to 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.530
 back we give in reset and there what 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.870
 we would have again as it was at 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.370
 Obviously we can start 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.349
 defeat her by clicking on this 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.289
 tool here we can apply 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:38.789
 contrast and brightness in this other we have 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.420
 here this menu is worth with which we 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.700
 we will be able 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.980
 and go moving through the different 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.930
 options that are available in this 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.570
 software and you can see what good 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.730
 we apply the contrast or we do not apply it 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.230
 well we can add more or less 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.230
 contrast more or less brightness 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.230
 evidently 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:01.350
 to our taste everything here we can 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.600
 set the image size height 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.610
 and width we can enter the pixels 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.080
 that we want to keep the 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.950
 image is very simple what we are going to 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.970
 do is give upl and agree 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.970
 we say yes 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.070
 and he tells us that he has finished reading 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.130
 in ok and we would have it here san 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.620
 francisco copy 1 and this would be the origin 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.140
 the original is worth this would be what we have 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.020
 used to apply the filters 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.670
 and this one that we have edited with this 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.500
 software as you see we get 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.630
 results that are pretty good and that 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.670
 Without a doubt, I hope that you 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.100
 like not with this I'm going to fire 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.630
 but simply that this tutorial 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.730
 I liked most of all that I have 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.100
 served and if so, leave a like a
