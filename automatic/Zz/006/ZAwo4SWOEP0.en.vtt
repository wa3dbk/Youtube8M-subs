00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.439
 good to all guys today i hope it takes 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.070
 how to bring the medicines of the mother 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.840
 of 3 for a trevor I do not know if all of it 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.230
 they know why we say it is a little bit one 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.969
 strange thing but fine story happens 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.829
 this happens late story mom asks 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.850
 of medicines and no longer makes me go into 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.020
 three-hour home 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.399
 now that he will have to kill the video 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.399
 see the trip a little 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.640
 or that the real and true part begins here 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.960
 let's say concrete video from when it was 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.180
 as many because with this point 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.130
 inter al a spoiler who does not want that 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.500
 this part is dusted in the video 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.740
 can simply go to minute 222 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.620
 where the spoiler practically endless me 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.820
 I recommend you close at 22 22 if not 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.820
 you want to see the beautiful spoiler 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.400
 in this way they made me reborn 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.709
 with franklin I did not play in 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.959
 this point thinking that making me 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.720
 reborn with franklin was like one 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.110
 kind of related mission so I have 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:39.060
 I took Franklin's bike and I'm a customer 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.060
 course from home work

 [Music] 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.260
 they are the ones who are world made 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.120
 the whole fucking journey I understand that 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.130
 it takes no use because the 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.260
 door does not open then I decide 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.700
 practically spreading in three bars the 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.430
 our very dear friend trevor st 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.530
 annoying some people to the sea he 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.820
 in a snap of fingers ops is found 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.000
 at the sea 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.470
 just in ten seconds more or less not 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.770
 because in any case we have made a 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.700
 very long journey for you the top 5 6 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.650
 minutes is that anyway 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.060
 represents the solution to bring the 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.810
 medicines that the mother of three bodies 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:16.190
 asks take for whom to mom's 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:18.710
 trouble since he didn't see a instead 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.280
 play it for those who live here in front of the 

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:23.360
 china enough state is not true oh well 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.460
 then anyway who wants to see it 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.170
 he drove one thanks to this 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.600
 Shoots more or less a point left 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.760
 to talk to you for a moment I recommend the 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.320
 like the inscription a second comment 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.370
 atoms of this have been used to play 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.900
 gender 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.920
 and how there is no follow up with 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:45.170
 of the boys
