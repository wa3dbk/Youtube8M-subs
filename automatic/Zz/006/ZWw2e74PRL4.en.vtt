as<00:02:14.200> retractable<00:02:14.860> sprit<00:02:15.160> which<00:02:15.280> i<00:02:15.370> think<00:02:15.430> is

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
as retractable sprit which i think is

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.020 
as retractable sprit which i think is
pretty<00:02:15.670> neat

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
pretty neat

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.280 
pretty neat
so<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:16.300> boat<00:02:16.450> would<00:02:16.569> be<00:02:16.720> really<00:02:16.900> good<00:02:17.050> for
