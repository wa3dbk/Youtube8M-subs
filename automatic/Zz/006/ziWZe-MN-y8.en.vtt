 Rafael Diaz Beijing was the name of the fruit 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:31.960
 she tomatoes 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.710
 which means as much as Pisa leaves those with scars 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.660
 from the New World the plant was brought to Spain 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.490
 where her first rose leaves were eaten and for weeks 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.670
 Brecht worried cramps 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.580
 such a shock in Spain 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.790
 leave that then for many 50 years in Europe no tomatoes of the GTS 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.560
 The breakthrough comes in 1890, claims a French politician 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.560
 Coach Norbert Dickel magazine he would even have some of them if necessary 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.150
 that in large quantities and experience it nevertheless 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.450
 the first hole of the mainland was unstoppable 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.329
 today the tomato grows the parade of pop or euro around the world 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:15.549
 but of the 300,000 pounds, just a handful today is actually in 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:16.790
 offer 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.680
 the new voices do not seem to be about taste but rather 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.969
 Criticism of the yield and the so-called tour has made it that one manages 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.300
 a contract gets from about 150 kilograms per square meter to 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.860
 End of 11 toxic amounts 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.799
 you can not imagine 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.350
 compared to the second 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.369
 to have the neck as we cultivate 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.369
 we have a yield of about two kilograms per square meter 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.920
 Every year Reach knows what he's talking about 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.780
 At home in Burgenland he grows 3200 varieties himself 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.390
 from the industrial production of tomato he holds nothing 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.790
 here as I apply to a few strict rules yes for hobby gardeners 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.880
 too early cultivation the cold is poison for the plants 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.700
 one from Witten and the plant in the air to propel no rods attitude 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.220
 The Paradeiser Kaiser leaves the plant floor space and especially the 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.220
 Volkssport casting is sure to put an end to it 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:16.780
 it is good to understand it too 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.440
 Schwerin is very relaxing the activity in the garden but for the 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.700
 Planting it is the most urgent bread to be poured in Prague too much 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.019
 Beijing she no root system and Daum the heavy rain has happened and very often 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.829
 that means getting sick with the band 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.220
 The farmer has set himself the goal without a flood 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.189
 to preserve numerous varieties for the future 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.809
 but not all that continues today 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:44.079

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.269

 Bitburg breeding 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:51.809
 and this lesson we have kept 400 second reduced 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:53.249
 we would like 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:55.469
 I can do it in the next 20 years 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:56.879
 high damage 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.540
 Social miserable there stand up to 19 that the city of Biel are 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.389
 change the contract 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.139
 that counts with the seething 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.380
 have been accused of climate change 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.819
 that is our goal 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.689
 but even then the old varieties will not be at the same distance 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.619
 not at all all year round 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:19.979
 The season of the tomato does not last for ten weeks, by the way 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.979
 Vegetable summer is literally a ferry

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:34.720
 so to speak 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.180
 Ladies and gentlemen, that's what we call the name of the entire sector today 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.240
