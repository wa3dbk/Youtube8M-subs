it's up everybody it's brendan here at

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.710 
it's up everybody it's brendan here at
the<00:00:02.340> board<00:00:02.550> and<00:00:02.669> tires<00:00:02.879> office<00:00:03.330> student<00:00:03.510> in

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
the board and tires office student in

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.960 
the board and tires office student in
their<00:00:03.870> flex<00:00:04.140> test<00:00:04.410> for<00:00:04.650> you<00:00:04.740> this<00:00:05.460> time<00:00:05.520> we

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
their flex test for you this time we

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.890 
their flex test for you this time we
have<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.390> machete<00:00:07.170> GT<00:00:07.550> so<00:00:08.550> this<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:09.059> basically

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
have the machete GT so this is basically

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.270 
have the machete GT so this is basically
the<00:00:11.330> sister<00:00:12.330> board<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:12.990> machete<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:14.099> one

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
the sister board to the machete this one

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.700 
the sister board to the machete this one
has<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.460> little<00:00:14.639> bit<00:00:14.880> different<00:00:15.240> profile<00:00:15.710> it's

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
has a little bit different profile it's

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.800 
has a little bit different profile it's
pretty<00:00:17.130> similar<00:00:17.460> it's<00:00:17.850> got<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.240> early<00:00:18.600> rise

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
pretty similar it's got the early rise

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.109 
pretty similar it's got the early rise
nose<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.500> tail<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.980> it's<00:00:20.130> about<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.910> same

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
nose and tail and it's about the same

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.599 
nose and tail and it's about the same
size<00:00:21.390> on<00:00:21.630> each<00:00:22.160> so<00:00:23.160> it's<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.400> really

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
size on each so it's a really

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.220 
size on each so it's a really
symmetrical<00:00:24.060> board<00:00:24.570> or<00:00:24.750> right<00:00:24.960> probably

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
symmetrical board or right probably

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.410 
symmetrical board or right probably
fairly<00:00:25.830> well<00:00:26.039> eat<00:00:26.220> away<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.820> major

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
fairly well eat away the major

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.849 
fairly well eat away the major
difference<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.199> center<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.590> board

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
difference is in the center of the board

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.290 
difference is in the center of the board
the<00:00:29.550> standard<00:00:30.300> machete<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:31.040> flat<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the standard machete is flat and the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.420 
the standard machete is flat and the
machete<00:00:33.630> GT<00:00:33.870> actually<00:00:34.559> has<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> really<00:00:35.100> mild

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
machete GT actually has a really mild

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.299 
machete GT actually has a really mild
camber<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.570> help<00:00:36.809> with<00:00:37.500> some<00:00:37.710> more<00:00:37.890> control

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
camber to help with some more control

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.660 
camber to help with some more control
and<00:00:39.290> give<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.440> little<00:00:40.649> more<00:00:40.890> range<00:00:41.190> as<00:00:41.460> far

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
and give it a little more range as far

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.180 
and give it a little more range as far
as<00:00:41.760> what<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.090> write<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.010> this<00:00:44.010> is

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
as what you can write it in and this is

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.639 
as what you can write it in and this is
a<00:00:44.219> seven<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.210> their<00:00:45.420> flex<00:00:45.690> scale<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.260> let's<00:00:46.469> see

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
a seven on their flex scale so let's see

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.880 
a seven on their flex scale so let's see
how<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:46.980> one<00:00:47.160> does<00:00:50.239> porn<00:00:51.239> insiders

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
how this one does porn insiders

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.420 
how this one does porn insiders
freeriders<00:00:52.890> real<00:00:53.370> reviews

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.330 

that's<00:00:59.430> like

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
that's like

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.299 
that's like
so<00:01:02.240> this<00:01:02.390> board<00:01:02.720> is<00:01:02.900> definitely<00:01:03.890> a<00:01:03.920> little<00:01:03.980> bit

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
so this board is definitely a little bit

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.670 
so this board is definitely a little bit
super<00:01:04.730> viewing<00:01:05.530> than<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:07.070> standard<00:01:07.430> machete

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
super viewing than the standard machete

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.140 
super viewing than the standard machete
probably<00:01:09.680> mostly<00:01:10.010> because<00:01:10.250> of<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.640> camber<00:01:11.060> in

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
probably mostly because of the camber in

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.240 
probably mostly because of the camber in
the<00:01:11.270> center<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:12.380> you<00:01:12.440> can<00:01:12.590> see<00:01:12.800> there's<00:01:13.010> not<00:01:13.220> a

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
the center so you can see there's not a

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.450 
the center so you can see there's not a
lot<00:01:13.670> of<00:01:13.700> flex<00:01:14.240> there<00:01:14.479> in<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:14.690> middle<00:01:14.870> board

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
lot of flex there in the middle board

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.950 
lot of flex there in the middle board
see<00:01:16.460> most<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:16.880> it<00:01:17.030> will<00:01:17.120> come<00:01:17.300> in<00:01:17.479> right<00:01:17.690> under

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
see most of it will come in right under

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.890 
see most of it will come in right under
here<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:20.090> other<00:01:20.210> interesting<00:01:20.660> about

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
here and the other interesting about

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.440 
here and the other interesting about
these<00:01:21.140> is<00:01:21.710> they're<00:01:22.100> actually<00:01:22.610> if<00:01:22.760> a<00:01:22.910> sidewall

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
these is they're actually if a sidewall

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.920 
these is they're actually if a sidewall
deck<00:01:23.750> from<00:01:24.650> here<00:01:25.070> to<00:01:25.520> here<00:01:25.910> and<00:01:26.600> then<00:01:26.660> they

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
deck from here to here and then they

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.840 
deck from here to here and then they
transition<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.530> a<00:01:27.680> cap<00:01:27.950> construction<00:01:28.190> for<00:01:28.790> the

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
transition to a cap construction for the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.180 
transition to a cap construction for the
nose<00:01:29.000> and<00:01:29.210> tail<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:30.560> might<00:01:30.770> have<00:01:30.979> a<00:01:31.010> little

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
nose and tail and I might have a little

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.400 
nose and tail and I might have a little
something<00:01:31.460> to<00:01:31.700> do<00:01:31.850> with<00:01:32.000> how<00:01:32.150> stiff<00:01:32.450> it<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:32.720> in

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
something to do with how stiff it is in

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.290 
something to do with how stiff it is in
the<00:01:33.920> center

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.550 

very<00:01:39.990> much<00:01:40.380> very<00:01:40.800> leave<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:41.970> front<00:01:42.320> nose<00:01:43.320> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
very much very leave in front nose to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.230 
very much very leave in front nose to
tail<00:01:43.800> on<00:01:44.010> this<00:01:44.160> one<00:01:45.020> also<00:01:46.020> very<00:01:46.290> easy<00:01:46.620> to

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
tail on this one also very easy to

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.030 
tail on this one also very easy to
really<00:01:48.240> pull<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.660> up<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.960> stay<00:01:49.380> balanced<00:01:49.860> on

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
really pull it up and stay balanced on

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.370 
really pull it up and stay balanced on
the<00:01:50.130> nose<00:01:50.340> there<00:01:53.570> you<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.750> see<00:01:54.780> well<00:01:55.170> as<00:01:55.260> I'm

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
the nose there you can see well as I'm

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.980 
the nose there you can see well as I'm
flexing<00:01:55.920> you'll<00:01:56.070> see<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.340> flex<00:01:56.670> here<00:01:57.120> and<00:01:57.690> then

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
flexing you'll see it flex here and then

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:08.710 
flexing you'll see it flex here and then
it'll<00:01:58.140> roll<00:01:58.350> into<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.920> rocker<00:01:59.220> area<00:01:59.670> there

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.860
