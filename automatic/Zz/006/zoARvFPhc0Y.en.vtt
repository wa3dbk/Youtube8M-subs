00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.930
 years later when 77 was born.

 simply atari 2600 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.729
 The console arrived in Brazil in 1983 for 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.439
 here was also a phenomenon of sales and 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.070

 were 14 years of commercial history 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:32.829
 in this period it is estimated that 40 million 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.659
 Island units were sold the 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.049

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.060
 billions of dollars 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.440
 The truth is that these 14 years 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.110
 made internal 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.439
 today about to complete 36 years of 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.689

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:05.349
 working and always remembered in sessions 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.179
 nostalgic with friends brings a 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:08.679
 Very cool feeling if in childhood I 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.539
 I do not know what it's like to be an employee. 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.290
 people who did not live in that era is 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:17.940
 boring coarse and then loses 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.350
 a filet of the history of the videogame and 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.459
 until this generation the first 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.410
 involving games 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.450
 should think a little more attention and 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.930
 This is amazing, I hope a game, come on. 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.480
 puts on hear the sound is a stirred açaí speak 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.090
 Here is the time I saw a little face 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.639
 it's okay 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.069
 one thing about the atari is fact since the 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:40.359
 original owners of the 70's 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.480
 to new owners 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:44.470
 what attracts the most is the simplest 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.840
 gameplay of titles 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.030
 even because with 8-bit quality 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.910
 it would be difficult to engage the public with 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.980
 any other affirmed 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.930
 the game was not fun to play 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.800
 no one to play just because he is handsome 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.480
 understood 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.460
 nowadays they can do a lot of 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.530
 game need new consoles de de novo 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.630
 generations that are beautiful and wonderful and 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.550
 They're boring to play then we 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.110
 can disguise the music with the 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.080
 graphics and note did not have it was 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.490
 pure gameplay and is exactly why 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.010
 this characteristic 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:17.190
 the easy gameplay that the concept of 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.080
 games of the atari 2600 serve to this day 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.560
 inspiration for developers of 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.420
 most modern games as his grandfather was the 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.820
 casual games that we both venus 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.880
 mobile is then the most current games are 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.070
 the tablet cell phone day 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.650
 actually in the version that atari templates 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:38.160
 Because they are games and plays is for one 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.780
 time does not have 36 hours to finish in 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.250
 I do not think that this is a 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.840
 great value of it if nowadays then 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.030
 This day, people work hard to 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.260
 him to make the new games that are 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.960
 recently manufacturing one of the creators 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.000
 of the brand in the afternoon was in 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.440
 lombo chu did not attend the campus party 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.570
 and 2013 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.940
 we talked to him even about 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.250
 the application for bankruptcy of atari at the beginning 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.990
 of the year 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.180
 they have sherman hair 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.340
 think of it as a chess move 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.340
 was a financial move to separate the 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.010
 toxic and destructive french tar ip 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.690
 I suppose it was the right thing to 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.580
 be made and now I'm willing to 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.470
 involve the resurgence of the brand 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.209
 It's been horrible since we joined this 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.260
 but it will not be 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.260
 of course not 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.320
