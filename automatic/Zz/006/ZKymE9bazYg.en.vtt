00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.940 
love that to go down in history books
and<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.900> fact<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.200> we<00:00:40.410> were<00:00:40.500> too<00:00:40.680> little

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
and the fact that we were too little

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.280 
and the fact that we were too little
down<00:00:41.100> as<00:00:41.310> well<00:00:41.460> kind<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.970> adds<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.750> yeah

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
down as well kind of adds to it so yeah

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.710 
down as well kind of adds to it so yeah
I<00:00:43.500> think<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:43.980> got<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.550> be<00:00:44.670> other<00:00:47.600> we<00:00:48.600> all

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
I think it's got to be other we all

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.510 
I think it's got to be other we all
played<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.200> think<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.530> little<00:00:49.650> bit<00:00:49.860> above<00:00:50.160> our

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
played I think a little bit above our

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.729 
played I think a little bit above our
normal<00:00:51.180> standards<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.260> had<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
normal standards and it had to be the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.080 
normal standards and it had to be the
case<00:00:52.890> for<00:00:53.190> us<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.460> get<00:00:53.580> anything<00:00:53.670> out<00:00:53.970> of<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
case for us to get anything out of the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.820 
case for us to get anything out of the
game<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.510> was<00:00:54.630> a<00:00:54.690> bit<00:00:54.900> starstruck<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.530> be<00:00:55.620> fair

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
game it was a bit starstruck to be fair

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.430 
game it was a bit starstruck to be fair
because<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:56.519> players<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.720> look<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:58.019> to<00:00:58.230> and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
because the players you look up to and

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.710 
because the players you look up to and
admire<00:00:58.650> to<00:00:59.010> be<00:00:59.160> like<00:00:59.339> her<00:00:59.660> standing<00:01:00.660> there

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
admire to be like her standing there
