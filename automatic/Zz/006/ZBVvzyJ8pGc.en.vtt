00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.809
 retreat when paid this comic 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.530
 saw there is a box written down the price and 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.449
 as if I saw a silhouette see on and asked 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.280
 that there can buy this comedian said 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.630
 what can the type be discounted because as 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.330
 there will be an old number and it costs only 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.799
 80 rubles though 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.200
 online stores the opposite when 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.549
 number 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.770

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.390
 feast on a launched X-men crossover 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.460

 previous book right first avenger 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.180
 such a comic is darker than 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.040
 previous more black and white 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:14.220

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.490
 quite interesting to read about stories 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.380

 now about the avengers continuation first 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:41.970
 very stylish for over thickness up to 1 part 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:44.240
 it will be thicker than this 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.400
 it is noticeable that the book is thicker 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.820
 you can video we will not seem here 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:57.350
 so it was necessary to release it seems to me yes 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:06:01.800
 immediately either the ninth number or 9 10 kopecks 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.460
 but actually all thanks to all 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.790
