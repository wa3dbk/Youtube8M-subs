little bit about the key of a song it is
basically<00:00:48.160> let's<00:00:48.489> talk<00:00:49.030> about<00:00:49.179> the<00:00:49.809> scale

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
basically let's talk about the scale

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.579 
basically let's talk about the scale
that<00:00:51.519> that<00:00:51.670> song<00:00:51.909> is<00:00:52.059> based<00:00:52.300> around<00:00:52.480> so<00:00:53.079> and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
that that song is based around so and

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:55.889 
that that song is based around so and
usually<00:00:53.890> we<00:00:54.249> talk<00:00:54.460> about<00:00:54.640> in<00:00:55.449> terms<00:00:55.480> of<00:00:55.809> a

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
usually we talk about in terms of a

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.250 
usually we talk about in terms of a
major<00:00:56.140> scale<00:00:56.589> so<00:00:57.600> let's<00:00:58.600> play<00:00:58.749> a<00:00:58.780> G<00:00:59.050> major

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
major scale so let's play a G major

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.459 
major scale so let's play a G major
scale

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.799 

we<00:01:03.010> know<00:01:03.129> that<00:01:03.280> our<00:01:03.430> route<00:01:03.760> or<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.150> tonic<00:01:04.659> the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
we know that our route or the tonic the

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.050 
we know that our route or the tonic the
first<00:01:05.140> note<00:01:05.440> of<00:01:05.619> that<00:01:05.740> scale<00:01:06.190> is<00:01:07.200> G<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.820> we

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
first note of that scale is G so we

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.380 
first note of that scale is G so we
build<00:01:10.360> our<00:01:10.540> chords<00:01:11.110> off<00:01:11.380> of<00:01:11.830> that<00:01:12.070> we<00:01:12.280> have<00:01:12.520> G

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
build our chords off of that we have G

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.680 
build our chords off of that we have G
major<00:01:13.420> chord<00:01:13.810> a<00:01:14.560> minor<00:01:14.920> chord<00:01:15.490> B<00:01:15.909> minor<00:01:16.210> chord

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
major chord a minor chord B minor chord

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.680 
major chord a minor chord B minor chord
we<00:01:16.960> can<00:01:17.080> go<00:01:17.229> up<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.530> scale<00:01:17.680> like<00:01:18.009> that

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
we can go up the scale like that

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.330 
we can go up the scale like that
we<00:01:19.690> can<00:01:19.840> also<00:01:19.990> say<00:01:20.530> that<00:01:20.860> if<00:01:21.009> we're<00:01:21.190> going<00:01:21.280> to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
we can also say that if we're going to

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.359 
we can also say that if we're going to
base<00:01:22.000> a<00:01:22.030> song<00:01:22.570> around<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.500> notes<00:01:23.740> found<00:01:24.130> in

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
base a song around the notes found in

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.100 
base a song around the notes found in
that<00:01:24.549> scale<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:26.259> in<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.560> key<00:01:26.770> of<00:01:27.090> G<00:01:28.090> so<00:01:28.330> all

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
that scale it's in the key of G so all

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.020 
that scale it's in the key of G so all
the<00:01:29.259> chords<00:01:29.590> that<00:01:29.740> we<00:01:29.860> play<00:01:30.070> in<00:01:30.220> that<00:01:30.399> song<00:01:30.729> the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
the chords that we play in that song the

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.300 
the chords that we play in that song the
C<00:01:31.299> would<00:01:31.600> be<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.869> four<00:01:32.170> chord<00:01:32.619> in<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.039> key<00:01:33.070> of

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
C would be the four chord in the key of

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.580 
C would be the four chord in the key of
G<00:01:33.880> because<00:01:34.030> it's<00:01:34.299> built<00:01:34.539> based<00:01:35.050> off<00:01:35.289> of<00:01:35.470> the

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
G because it's built based off of the

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.490 
G because it's built based off of the
fourth<00:01:35.920> note<00:01:36.159> of<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.369> scale<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.659> D<00:01:37.960> would<00:01:38.320> be

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
fourth note of the scale the D would be

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.370 
fourth note of the scale the D would be
the<00:01:38.710> fifth<00:01:39.220> chord<00:01:39.610> because<00:01:40.569> it's<00:01:40.810> based<00:01:41.200> on

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
the fifth chord because it's based on

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.340 
the fifth chord because it's based on
the<00:01:41.530> fifth<00:01:41.800> note<00:01:42.039> of<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.490> G<00:01:42.520> scale<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:44.140> it<00:01:44.229> all

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
the fifth note of the G scale so it all

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.359 
the fifth note of the G scale so it all
relates<00:01:44.800> back<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:46.659> scale<00:01:47.170> so<00:01:47.830> that<00:01:48.159> now

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
relates back to that scale so that now

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.090 
relates back to that scale so that now
we<00:01:48.429> know<00:01:48.610> what<00:01:48.729> a<00:01:48.789> key<00:01:49.090> is<00:01:49.560> how<00:01:50.560> do<00:01:50.619> you<00:01:50.770> find

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
we know what a key is how do you find

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.570 
we know what a key is how do you find
out<00:01:51.399> what<00:01:52.119> a<00:01:52.179> key<00:01:52.509> of<00:01:52.780> a<00:01:52.960> song<00:01:53.200> is<00:01:53.440> well<00:01:53.710> here's

a<00:01:54.640> good<00:01:54.789> rule<00:01:55.030> of<00:01:55.060> thumb<00:01:55.210> there<00:01:56.050> are

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
a good rule of thumb there are

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.100 
a good rule of thumb there are
exceptions<00:01:56.860> to<00:01:57.130> it<00:01:57.250> because<00:01:57.670> well<00:01:58.300> music<00:01:58.990> is

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
hear the sound the way of 4 chord sounds

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.230 
hear the sound the way of 4 chord sounds
versus<00:06:12.960> the<00:06:13.230> root<00:06:13.470> chord<00:06:13.860> say<00:06:14.280> in<00:06:14.520> F<00:06:14.760> our<00:06:15.030> root

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
versus the root chord say in F our root

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.600 
versus the root chord say in F our root
chord<00:06:15.570> is<00:06:16.220> half<00:06:17.220> a<00:06:17.790> 4<00:06:18.330> chord<00:06:18.630> would<00:06:18.720> be<00:06:19.610> b-flat

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
chord is half a 4 chord would be b-flat

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:28.709 
chord is half a 4 chord would be b-flat
and<00:06:20.940> like<00:06:21.300> I<00:06:21.450> played<00:06:21.690> in<00:06:21.870> that<00:06:21.900> song

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:32.219 

so<00:06:29.199> that's<00:06:29.439> four<00:06:30.299> and<00:06:31.299> see<00:06:31.569> how<00:06:31.719> that<00:06:31.929> sounds

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:32.229 
so that's four and see how that sounds

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:34.799 
so that's four and see how that sounds
that<00:06:32.559> wants<00:06:32.889> to<00:06:33.009> go<00:06:33.399> to<00:06:33.459> that<00:06:33.969> tongue<00:06:34.299> so<00:06:34.509> even

00:06:34.799 --> 00:06:34.809 
that wants to go to that tongue so even

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:38.850 
that wants to go to that tongue so even
if<00:06:34.929> we<00:06:35.049> ended<00:06:35.409> here<00:06:36.179> your<00:06:37.179> ear<00:06:37.779> would<00:06:38.229> sort<00:06:38.769> of

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
if we ended here your ear would sort of

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.589 
if we ended here your ear would sort of
lead<00:06:39.069> you<00:06:39.309> to<00:06:39.459> wards<00:06:41.969> and<00:06:42.969> you<00:06:43.089> can<00:06:43.209> hum<00:06:43.389> that

lead you to wards and you can hum that
note<00:06:43.899> and<00:06:44.139> eventually<00:06:44.829> find<00:06:45.129> it

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:47.219 
note and eventually find it
