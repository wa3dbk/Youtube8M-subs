00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:07.029
 very good to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:09.910
 this new video of the channel sony anilla 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:13.299
 today I wanted to talk about a super topic 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.579
 serious that I have even put on my glasses 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.650
 because I thought that good even though 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:20.980
 situation required us 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.099
 I 'm going to give you five tips on how 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.519
 start making photo sessions with 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.949
 strangers the greeting of later in this 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:33.220
 new video from my channel and good and 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.320
 start with the 5 tips at the time of 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.290
 start making photo sessions with 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.180
 unknown first advice and I think that 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.520
 the most important thing in fact I'm going to 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.990
 put the lid back on because it is 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.990
 apart pretty serious 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.970
 this first advice is going to be the one of never 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.500
 never go alone to a session either boy 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.940
 be it girl but even if it sounds a bit 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.130
 sexist feminist because I do not care 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.979
 connotation may have this comment 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.650
 the that especially if you're a girl ever 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.020
 go alone but this advice goes so much 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.260
 as if it's starting act doing the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.450
 photographs as if you are model as if 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.159
 you are a stylist makeup artist 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.590
 whatever it is 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.229
 because it was always noticed that I started 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.229
 with a second advice is going to be the one 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.270
 always carry a clear idea of what 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.700
 we want to do in this session does 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.159
 they gave me the advice to take a 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.770
 piece of paper and make a small sketch with 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.829
 the idea that we would like to translate into a 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.950
 photography to get a clear idea 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:44.289
 and to get a good picture 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.840
 structured we are going to have to get 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.939
 a good mental library of 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.880
 photograph how this is done 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:55.750
 visiting a huge amount a huge amount 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:59.140
 photography and photo pages 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.020
 third council speaks a lot if you have not 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.369
 has been when we started 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.679
 do sessions we are not very 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.200
 used to not being with people who 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:12.060
 we do not know at all because they are created as 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.060
 that awkward silence 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.459
 as I get that we can create it 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:25.000
 some discomfort with both the model and 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:27.520
 either photographer with old age who can 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.069
 create true discomfort 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.560
 discomfort in then at the time of the 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.930
 session something that helps a lot very much 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.020
 that was another piece of advice that they gave me 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.720
 relatively little to carry either 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.230
 your ipod or carry your laptop and carry 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.599
 a nice selection of music the room 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.730
 advice will consist in trying 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.640
 explain it as best as possible before the 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.940
 session to our or our model of 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.310
 thought or what session idea do we have 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.220
 this will speed up the session a lot 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.260
 I was going to avoid too many moments of 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.090
 discomfort and many moments of 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.750
 indecision at the time of being doing 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.750
 the photograph 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.220
 if you like 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.110
 keep doing well 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.030
 the fifth and last council is going to 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.030
 to be reassuring 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.130
 we will look like a super singing advice 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.730
 but I really relaxed a lot 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.350
 a lot when it comes to looking for people 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.930
 it seems a bit difficult to try 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.390
 contact for people who know people who 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.780
 know how to make up things to do photography 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.910
 but I really recommend you all 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.220
 the people that are in the 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.940
 way to learn to be photographers the 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.740
 to always catch familiar people 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.050
 forget about the previous tips and 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.200
 really to start the best thing is to catch 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.510
 family friends overwhelming the 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.090
 photography and then once you already 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.430
 So let's have some control let's know more 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.450
 or less direct who we are doing 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.480
 the photograph 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.120
 in getting a certain skill once 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.670
 we are able to do these things well 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.090
 we already went to do sessions with 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.090
 unknown and nothing chicuelos I hope that 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.669
 this tutorial west these five tips 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.550
 have been very patient 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.830
 really, I 'm always going to go 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.550
 repeating the same thing this is patience 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.250
 practice practice patience and seriously 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.350
 always always we will always get to 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.200
 that goal of starting to do these 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.360
 famous cc sessions of these sessions 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.639
 of exchange with people with lots of 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.280
 experience and we with more still 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:50.010
