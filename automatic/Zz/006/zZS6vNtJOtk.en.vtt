okay<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.079> can<00:01:37.290> take<00:01:37.470> your<00:01:37.650> time<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:39.000> now<00:01:39.750> you

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
okay you can take your time and now you

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.109 
okay you can take your time and now you
can<00:01:40.140> see<00:01:40.409> I'm<00:01:40.680> joining<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.579> corners<00:01:42.000> like
