hello<00:00:10.650> again<00:00:10.800> I'm<00:00:11.309> glad<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.610> be<00:00:11.639> back<00:00:11.730> with<00:00:12.150> you

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
hello again I'm glad to be back with you

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.700 
hello again I'm glad to be back with you
and<00:00:12.690> I've<00:00:12.840> got<00:00:13.019> what<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.200> hope<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.620> an

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
and I've got what I hope is an

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.829 
and I've got what I hope is an
interesting<00:00:13.950> problem<00:00:14.580> in<00:00:14.670> statics<00:00:15.210> today<00:00:15.570> I

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
interesting problem in statics today I

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.439 
interesting problem in statics today I
was<00:00:16.710> thinking<00:00:16.830> about<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.369> last<00:00:17.670> night<00:00:17.880> what

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
was thinking about this last night what

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.560 
was thinking about this last night what
if<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.720> had<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.960> beam<00:00:20.060> okay<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.330> we're<00:00:21.449> gonna

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
if you had a beam okay and we're gonna

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.390 
if you had a beam okay and we're gonna
assume<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.289> weight<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.949> theme<00:00:23.160> is

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
assume that the weight of the theme is

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.370 
assume that the weight of the theme is
negligible<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.150> weighs<00:00:24.570> something<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.260> it's

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
negligible it weighs something but it's

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.439 
negligible it weighs something but it's
low<00:00:25.560> enough<00:00:25.800> we<00:00:25.949> don't<00:00:26.130> really<00:00:26.279> care<00:00:26.580> we<00:00:27.269> can

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
low enough we don't really care we can

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.820 
low enough we don't really care we can
ignore<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.900> still<00:00:28.109> get<00:00:28.230> about<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.650> right

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
ignore and still get about the right

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.150 
ignore and still get about the right
answer<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.750> it's<00:00:30.750> pinned<00:00:31.199> at<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.560> left<00:00:31.920> end

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
answer and it's pinned at the left end

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.850 
answer and it's pinned at the left end
and<00:00:32.369> I'll<00:00:32.460> call<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.910> point<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.500> and<00:00:34.500> let's<00:00:34.770> say

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
and I'll call that point a and let's say

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.680 
and I'll call that point a and let's say
there's<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.219> big<00:00:35.489> weight<00:00:35.790> hanging<00:00:36.210> from<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
there's a big weight hanging from the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.340 
there's a big weight hanging from the
middle<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:38.809> thousand<00:00:39.809> Newtons<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.290> I'll

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
middle of it a thousand Newtons and I'll

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.970 
middle of it a thousand Newtons and I'll
call<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.860> point<00:00:41.190> B<00:00:41.719> all<00:00:42.719> right<00:00:42.870> now<00:00:43.050> right

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
call this point B all right now right

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.190 
call this point B all right now right
now<00:00:44.010> obviously<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.149> beam<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.600> gonna<00:00:45.750> fall

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
now obviously this beam is gonna fall

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.920 
now obviously this beam is gonna fall
right<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.640> forces<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.360> moments<00:00:48.539> are

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
right the the forces and the moments are

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.660 
right the the forces and the moments are
not<00:00:49.170> balanced<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.010> there's<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.489> an

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
not balanced so there's going to be an

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.360 
not balanced so there's going to be an
acceleration<00:00:51.320> well<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.829> know<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> obvious

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
acceleration well you know the obvious

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.670 
acceleration well you know the obvious
thing<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.579> do<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.090> put<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.570> force<00:00:55.050> up<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
thing to do is to put a force up on the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.319 
thing to do is to put a force up on the
other<00:00:55.829> end<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.399> if<00:00:56.520> we<00:00:56.640> don't<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:57.059> that

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
other end but what if we don't do that

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.439 
other end but what if we don't do that
what<00:00:57.510> if<00:00:57.629> at<00:00:57.780> Point<00:00:58.109> C<00:00:58.530> here<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:59.129> have<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> big

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
what if at Point C here we have a big

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.579 
what if at Point C here we have a big
moment<00:01:00.840> okay<00:01:01.829> moment<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:03.059> no<00:01:03.270> force<00:01:03.719> all

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
moment okay moment but no force all

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.490 
moment okay moment but no force all
right<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.430> would<00:01:05.580> be<00:01:05.820> like<00:01:06.119> if<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.540> had<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> at

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
right that would be like if I had a at

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.969 
right that would be like if I had a at
that<00:01:07.860> at<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.970> point<00:01:09.240> see<00:01:09.630> here<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.170> had<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.650> big

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
that at that point see here I had a big

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.340 
that at that point see here I had a big
force<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.640> way<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.180> big<00:01:12.420> force<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.110> way

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
force that way and a big force that way

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.649 
force that way and a big force that way
that<00:01:13.830> gave<00:01:14.130> me<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> moment<00:01:15.000> all<00:01:15.330> right<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
that gave me a moment all right the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.359 
that gave me a moment all right the
forces<00:01:16.080> cancel<00:01:16.320> out<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:16.799> there's<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.100> net

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
forces cancel out but there's a net

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.820 
forces cancel out but there's a net
moment<00:01:17.670> that's<00:01:17.970> what<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.540> okay<00:01:18.830> well

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
moment that's what that is okay well

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.469 
moment that's what that is okay well
what<00:01:20.159> would<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.610> like<00:01:20.640> would<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.330> be

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
what would that be like would it be

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.679 
what would that be like would it be
possible<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.520> make<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.850> beam<00:01:24.180> stay

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
possible to make this beam stay

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.770 
possible to make this beam stay
horizontal<00:01:25.340> just<00:01:26.340> with<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.549> moment<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.330> don't

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
horizontal just with that moment I don't

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.670 
horizontal just with that moment I don't
know<00:01:27.960> let's<00:01:28.229> try<00:01:28.439> it

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
know let's try it

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.999 
know let's try it
um<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.820> remember<00:01:30.420> given<00:01:31.049> find<00:01:31.350> solution

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
um so remember given find solution

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.679 
um so remember given find solution
answer<00:01:32.430> that's<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.729> format<00:01:33.210> we're<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
answer that's the format we're going to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.310 
answer that's the format we're going to
use<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> given<00:01:36.049> okay<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.170> is

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
use so this is the given okay this is

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.719 
use so this is the given okay this is
all<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.619> information<00:01:37.860> we've<00:01:38.250> got<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.460> guess<00:01:38.640> I

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
all the information we've got I guess I

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.789 
all the information we've got I guess I
better<00:01:38.850> give<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.090> some<00:01:39.590> dimensions<00:01:40.590> here

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
better give you some dimensions here

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.560 
better give you some dimensions here
that's<00:01:40.979> 500<00:01:42.350> millimeters<00:01:43.350> half<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.520> meter<00:01:44.729> and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
that's 500 millimeters half a meter and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.090 
that's 500 millimeters half a meter and
so<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.869> that

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.200 

all<00:01:51.100> right<00:01:51.250> so<00:01:51.400> that's<00:01:51.460> all<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.760> dimension

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
all right so that's all the dimension

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.460 
all right so that's all the dimension
turns<00:01:52.600> out<00:01:52.750> you<00:01:52.810> don't<00:01:52.900> even<00:01:53.110> really<00:01:53.230> need

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
turns out you don't even really need

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.980 
turns out you don't even really need
this<00:01:53.650> one<00:01:53.860> but<00:01:53.980> I'll<00:01:54.070> put<00:01:54.220> it<00:01:54.280> in<00:01:54.430> there<00:01:54.610> okay

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
this one but I'll put it in there okay

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.080 
this one but I'll put it in there okay
so<00:01:56.470> what<00:01:56.950> are<00:01:57.010> we<00:01:57.130> supposed<00:01:57.250> to<00:01:57.520> find<00:01:57.790> how<00:01:58.030> do

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
so what are we supposed to find how do

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.210 
so what are we supposed to find how do
we<00:01:58.330> know<00:01:58.540> when<00:01:58.780> we've<00:01:58.930> answered<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.470> question

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:17.729 

okay<00:02:03.900> moment<00:02:05.850> required<00:02:09.960> to<00:02:11.190> keep<00:02:13.800> beam

okay<00:02:21.239> is<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.349> possible<00:02:22.859> it<00:02:22.950> seems<00:02:23.159> like<00:02:23.340> it

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
okay is that possible it seems like it

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.520 
okay is that possible it seems like it
ought<00:02:23.609> to<00:02:23.640> be<00:02:23.760> well<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.900> next<00:02:25.109> step<00:02:25.379> is

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
ought to be well the next step is

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.300 
ought to be well the next step is
solution<00:02:25.859> number<00:02:26.129> GFS<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:27.120> soap<00:02:27.629> your<00:02:27.810> solution

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.099 

well<00:02:32.310> when<00:02:32.879> you're<00:02:33.000> doing<00:02:33.359> a<00:02:33.480> solution<00:02:33.989> in

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
well when you're doing a solution in

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.110 
well when you're doing a solution in
statics<00:02:34.680> what<00:02:35.040> do<00:02:35.099> you<00:02:35.159> always<00:02:35.310> do<00:02:35.640> first<00:02:35.939> you

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
statics what do you always do first you

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.330 
statics what do you always do first you
always<00:02:36.390> do<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.780> Freebody<00:02:37.290> diagram<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.159> that's

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
always do a Freebody diagram so that's

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.220 
always do a Freebody diagram so that's
what<00:02:38.489> I'm<00:02:38.609> gonna<00:02:38.700> do<00:02:38.879> first<00:02:39.120> there<00:02:39.450> and

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
what I'm gonna do first there and

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.539 
what I'm gonna do first there and
there's<00:02:40.379> really<00:02:40.530> only<00:02:40.650> one<00:02:40.980> thing<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.310> can

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
there's really only one thing you can

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.539 
there's really only one thing you can
draw<00:02:42.319> Freebody<00:02:43.319> diagram<00:02:43.980> that's<00:02:44.159> the<00:02:44.370> beam

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
draw Freebody diagram that's the beam

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.490 
draw Freebody diagram that's the beam
itself<00:02:44.909> now<00:02:45.180> before<00:02:45.569> I<00:02:45.599> do<00:02:45.719> this<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:46.139> have<00:02:46.349> to

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
itself now before I do this I have to

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.250 
itself now before I do this I have to
define<00:02:46.829> a<00:02:46.889> coordinate<00:02:47.280> system<00:02:48.019> alright<00:02:49.019> so

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
define a coordinate system alright so

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.899 
define a coordinate system alright so
I'm<00:02:49.409> gonna<00:02:49.560> do<00:02:49.829> that<00:02:49.859> like<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.459> pretty<00:02:50.819> much

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
I'm gonna do that like I pretty much

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.339 
I'm gonna do that like I pretty much
always<00:02:51.299> do<00:02:53.299> I've<00:02:54.299> said<00:02:54.540> this<00:02:54.689> before<00:02:54.900> but<00:02:55.139> in

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
always do I've said this before but in

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:56.809 
always do I've said this before but in
case<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.680> haven't<00:02:55.829> caught<00:02:56.129> this<00:02:56.280> on<00:02:56.489> some<00:02:56.700> of

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
case you haven't caught this on some of

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.960 
case you haven't caught this on some of
the<00:02:56.909> other<00:02:57.120> videos<00:02:58.079> I<00:02:58.620> find<00:02:59.370> it's<00:02:59.549> helpful<00:02:59.700> to

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
the other videos I find it's helpful to

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.849 
the other videos I find it's helpful to
use<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.299> same<00:03:00.510> coordinate<00:03:00.959> system<00:03:01.109> every

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
use the same coordinate system every

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.550 
use the same coordinate system every
time<00:03:01.889> you<00:03:02.340> know<00:03:02.430> we<00:03:02.549> have<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:03.030> but<00:03:03.780> when<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.290> use

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
time you know we have to but when I use

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.619 
time you know we have to but when I use
the<00:03:04.739> same<00:03:04.950> coordinate<00:03:05.310> system<00:03:05.430> every<00:03:06.000> time<00:03:06.030> I

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
the same coordinate system every time I

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.629 
the same coordinate system every time I
make<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.019> lot<00:03:07.260> fewer<00:03:07.439> mistakes<00:03:07.769> I<00:03:08.159> tend<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.459> mess

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
make a lot fewer mistakes I tend to mess

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.280 
make a lot fewer mistakes I tend to mess
up<00:03:08.819> less<00:03:09.030> often<00:03:09.269> now<00:03:09.540> there<00:03:09.719> are<00:03:09.840> some<00:03:09.989> times

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
up less often now there are some times

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.140 
up less often now there are some times
when<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:10.620> when<00:03:11.099> you<00:03:11.189> don't<00:03:11.430> want<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.849> use<00:03:12.000> this

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
when you when you don't want to use this

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.459 
when you when you don't want to use this
coordinate<00:03:12.480> system<00:03:12.629> if<00:03:12.989> there's<00:03:13.169> something

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:13.469 
coordinate system if there's something

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.099 
coordinate system if there's something
in<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.650> funny<00:03:13.919> angle<00:03:14.159> if<00:03:14.969> I<00:03:15.269> don't<00:03:15.599> have<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.840> real

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
in a funny angle if I don't have a real

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.839 
in a funny angle if I don't have a real
good<00:03:16.319> reason<00:03:16.530> otherwise<00:03:16.950> I'll<00:03:17.310> use<00:03:17.549> this<00:03:17.700> one

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
good reason otherwise I'll use this one

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.399 
good reason otherwise I'll use this one
if<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.090> have<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.239> good<00:03:18.450> reason<00:03:18.659> not<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:18.989> use<00:03:19.230> this

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
if I have a good reason not to use this

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.309 
if I have a good reason not to use this
one<00:03:19.560> I'll<00:03:19.680> change<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.419> okay<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:22.079> what<00:03:22.200> do<00:03:22.260> we

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
one I'll change it okay so what do we

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.039 
one I'll change it okay so what do we
have<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.829> mostly<00:03:23.069> kind<00:03:23.459> of<00:03:23.519> force<00:03:24.049> possibly

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
have that mostly kind of force possibly

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.530 
have that mostly kind of force possibly
I'll<00:03:25.290> call<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.889> X<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.669> another<00:03:26.940> one<00:03:27.180> here

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
I'll call that a X and another one here

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.349 
I'll call that a X and another one here
I'll<00:03:28.379> call<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.949> Y<00:03:29.280> all<00:03:29.669> right<00:03:29.879> a<00:03:30.030> in<00:03:30.269> the

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
I'll call a Y all right a in the

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.330 
I'll call a Y all right a in the
x-direction<00:03:30.659> a<00:03:31.229> in<00:03:31.379> the<00:03:31.470> y-direction

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
x-direction a in the y-direction

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.610 
x-direction a in the y-direction
I<00:03:32.370> have<00:03:32.819> assumed<00:03:33.239> directions<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.079> just<00:03:34.260> assumed

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
I have assumed directions I just assumed

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.469 
I have assumed directions I just assumed
the<00:03:34.739> positive<00:03:35.250> directions<00:03:35.519> if<00:03:35.879> it<00:03:35.970> turns<00:03:36.239> out

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:36.479 
the positive directions if it turns out

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.439 
the positive directions if it turns out
I'm<00:03:36.659> wrong<00:03:36.979> then<00:03:37.979> a<00:03:38.280> Y<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.909> X<00:03:39.150> will<00:03:39.299> just

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449 
I'm wrong then a Y and a X will just

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.089 
I'm wrong then a Y and a X will just
have<00:03:39.599> a<00:03:39.629> negative<00:03:39.900> sign<00:03:40.319> on<00:03:40.349> them<00:03:40.680> that's<00:03:40.949> all

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
have a negative sign on them that's all

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.219 
have a negative sign on them that's all
right<00:03:41.239> and<00:03:42.239> I've<00:03:42.389> got<00:03:43.370> thousand<00:03:44.370> Newtons<00:03:44.729> here

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:45.229 
right and I've got thousand Newtons here

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:48.170 
right and I've got thousand Newtons here
make<00:03:46.229> sure<00:03:46.260> I'm<00:03:46.530> still<00:03:46.650> in<00:03:46.919> frame<00:03:47.220> okay<00:03:47.639> and

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
make sure I'm still in frame okay and

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.969 
make sure I'm still in frame okay and
I've<00:03:48.389> got<00:03:48.599> this<00:03:48.780> moment<00:03:49.379> here<00:03:49.590> at<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.709> other

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:49.979 
I've got this moment here at the other

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.270 
I've got this moment here at the other
end<00:03:50.250> okay<00:03:51.209> moment<00:03:52.049> about<00:03:52.290> see<00:03:52.709> that's<00:03:52.979> it

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
end okay moment about see that's it

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.880 
end okay moment about see that's it
there's<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.729> Freebody<00:03:54.180> diagram

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.860 

okay<00:03:59.430> so<00:03:59.490> I've<00:03:59.640> got<00:03:59.820> a<00:03:59.850> free<00:04:00.120> body<00:04:00.300> diagram

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
okay so I've got a free body diagram

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.840 
okay so I've got a free body diagram
that's<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:01.290> first<00:04:01.560> step<00:04:01.860> here<00:04:02.100> so<00:04:02.580> what's<00:04:02.730> the

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
that's the first step here so what's the

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.310 
that's the first step here so what's the
next<00:04:03.030> step<00:04:03.300> write<00:04:03.540> in<00:04:03.660> equations<00:04:04.200> of

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
next step write in equations of

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.500 
next step write in equations of
equilibrium<00:04:04.850> so<00:04:05.850> I<00:04:07.700> wish<00:04:08.700> this<00:04:08.850> was<00:04:09.060> a<00:04:09.090> shorter

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
name for Asians at equilibrium remember

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.780 
name for Asians at equilibrium remember
this<00:04:13.350> thing<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.740> supposed<00:04:13.800> to<00:04:14.040> be<00:04:14.190> static<00:04:14.640> it's

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
this thing is supposed to be static it's

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.789 
this thing is supposed to be static it's
not<00:04:14.910> supposed<00:04:15.240> to<00:04:15.330> be<00:04:15.480> moving<00:04:15.750> so<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.560> sum<00:04:16.769> of

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
not supposed to be moving so the sum of

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.170 
not supposed to be moving so the sum of
all<00:04:16.980> the<00:04:17.100> forces<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.700> sum<00:04:17.820> of<00:04:17.940> all<00:04:18.060> the

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
all the forces and sum of all the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.610 
all the forces and sum of all the
moments<00:04:18.359> have<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.930> be<00:04:19.079> zero

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
moments have to be zero

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.970 
moments have to be zero
well<00:04:20.090> again<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.269> can<00:04:21.480> solve<00:04:21.720> for<00:04:22.079> all<00:04:22.890> the

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
well again I can solve for all the

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.680 
well again I can solve for all the
vertical<00:04:23.220> forces<00:04:23.670> set<00:04:23.970> them<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.300> zero<00:04:24.510> and

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
vertical forces set them to zero and

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.690 
vertical forces set them to zero and
solve<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.050> moment<00:04:25.440> set<00:04:25.620> them<00:04:25.830> to<00:04:26.040> zero<00:04:26.250> and

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
solve the moment set them to zero and

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.050 
solve the moment set them to zero and
that<00:04:26.850> will<00:04:26.970> work<00:04:27.830> do<00:04:28.830> I<00:04:28.860> care<00:04:29.310> what<00:04:29.430> a<00:04:29.490> x<00:04:29.760> and<00:04:29.970> a

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
that will work do I care what a x and a

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.270 
that will work do I care what a x and a
y<00:04:30.090> are<00:04:30.540> I<00:04:30.780> don't<00:04:31.350> really<00:04:31.530> care<00:04:31.770> if<00:04:31.919> I<00:04:31.980> knew<00:04:32.130> what

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
y are I don't really care if I knew what

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.470 
y are I don't really care if I knew what
they<00:04:32.400> were<00:04:32.460> I<00:04:32.580> wouldn't<00:04:32.940> do<00:04:33.000> anything<00:04:33.210> with

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
they were I wouldn't do anything with

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.600 
they were I wouldn't do anything with
them<00:04:33.600> so<00:04:34.169> let's<00:04:34.350> do<00:04:34.560> this<00:04:34.710> let's<00:04:34.770> sum<00:04:35.250> sum<00:04:35.550> of

them so let's do this let's sum sum of

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.730 
them so let's do this let's sum sum of
the<00:04:35.669> moments<00:04:35.910> about<00:04:36.180> point<00:04:36.360> a<00:04:36.840> since<00:04:37.560> there'll

generator we don't have to figure about
the<00:04:43.890> only<00:04:44.040> thing<00:04:44.310> we<00:04:44.430> won't<00:04:44.610> know<00:04:44.910> is<00:04:45.480> M<00:04:45.720> well

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
the only thing we won't know is M well

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.690 
the only thing we won't know is M well
that<00:04:46.590> sounds<00:04:46.860> to<00:04:46.919> me<00:04:46.980> like<00:04:47.040> that's<00:04:47.340> gonna<00:04:47.520> be

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
that sounds to me like that's gonna be

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.520 
that sounds to me like that's gonna be
one<00:04:47.910> equation<00:04:48.270> and<00:04:48.540> one<00:04:48.750> unknown<00:04:48.780> so<00:04:49.320> let's

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
one equation and one unknown so let's

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.650 
one equation and one unknown so let's
let's<00:04:49.680> do<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:50.040> we'll<00:04:50.910> set<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.180> sum<00:04:51.450> of<00:04:51.480> the

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
let's do that we'll set the sum of the

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.460 
let's do that we'll set the sum of the
moments<00:04:51.870> about<00:04:52.650> now<00:04:53.130> it's<00:04:53.310> Point<00:04:53.640> C<00:04:54.470> equals

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
moments about now it's Point C equals

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.800 
moments about now it's Point C equals
zero<00:04:55.770> all<00:04:56.340> right<00:04:56.490> well<00:04:57.120> let's<00:04:57.300> let's<00:04:57.510> look<00:04:57.720> at

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
zero all right well let's let's look at

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.420 
zero all right well let's let's look at
it<00:04:57.930> here<00:04:57.960> I'm<00:04:58.680> sorry<00:04:58.950> about<00:04:59.040> to<00:04:59.220> see<00:04:59.310> about<00:04:59.370> a

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
it here I'm sorry about to see about a

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.250 
it here I'm sorry about to see about a
there<00:05:03.180> myself<00:05:03.390> out<00:05:03.750> but<00:05:03.930> there's<00:05:04.140> the

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
there myself out but there's the

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.870 
there myself out but there's the
right<00:05:04.410> right<00:05:04.710> answer<00:05:04.979> so<00:05:05.370> I<00:05:05.400> want<00:05:05.520> to<00:05:05.580> sum<00:05:05.760> the

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
right right answer so I want to sum the

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.500 
right right answer so I want to sum the
moments<00:05:05.940> about<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.450> here<00:05:06.900> okay<00:05:07.910> I've<00:05:08.910> only<00:05:09.120> got

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
moments about a here okay I've only got

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.420 
moments about a here okay I've only got
one<00:05:09.540> force<00:05:10.200> acting<00:05:10.620> at<00:05:10.740> a<00:05:10.800> distance<00:05:11.280> and

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
one force acting at a distance and

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.980 
one force acting at a distance and
that's<00:05:11.610> right<00:05:11.880> here<00:05:12.150> and<00:05:12.240> that's<00:05:12.360> acting<00:05:12.810> at<00:05:12.960> a

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
that's right here and that's acting at a

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.090 
that's right here and that's acting at a
half<00:05:13.229> a<00:05:13.380> meter<00:05:13.560> 500<00:05:14.250> millimeters<00:05:14.820> so<00:05:16.100> 0.5

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
half a meter 500 millimeters so 0.5

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.740 
half a meter 500 millimeters so 0.5
meters<00:05:17.910> times<00:05:18.590> 1,000<00:05:19.820> news<00:05:20.820> now<00:05:21.390> that<00:05:21.570> can<00:05:21.660> be

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
meters times 1,000 news now that can be

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.500 
meters times 1,000 news now that can be
positive<00:05:22.410> or<00:05:22.530> negative<00:05:22.950> well<00:05:23.310> let's<00:05:24.060> see<00:05:24.300> I've

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
positive or negative well let's see I've

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.020 
positive or negative well let's see I've
got<00:05:24.650> this<00:05:25.650> point<00:05:26.280> here<00:05:26.610> and<00:05:26.640> I've<00:05:26.760> got<00:05:26.910> the

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
got this point here and I've got the

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.880 
got this point here and I've got the
force<00:05:27.300> acting<00:05:27.720> about<00:05:27.960> it<00:05:28.050> so<00:05:28.200> the<00:05:28.380> force<00:05:28.710> is

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
force acting about it so the force is

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.640 
force acting about it so the force is
going<00:05:29.070> to<00:05:29.130> make<00:05:29.310> a<00:05:29.690> or<00:05:30.690> the<00:05:30.810> moment<00:05:31.410> it's<00:05:31.530> going

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
going to make a or the moment it's going

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.370 
going to make a or the moment it's going
to<00:05:31.710> make<00:05:31.860> the<00:05:31.979> beam<00:05:32.160> want<00:05:32.460> to<00:05:32.580> move<00:05:33.080> clockwise

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
to make the beam want to move clockwise

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.860 
to make the beam want to move clockwise
I've<00:05:34.979> got<00:05:35.190> counterclockwise<00:05:35.760> being<00:05:36.300> positive

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
I've got counterclockwise being positive

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.719 
I've got counterclockwise being positive
so<00:05:36.990> that<00:05:37.020> means<00:05:37.290> this<00:05:37.440> has<00:05:37.620> to<00:05:37.680> be<00:05:37.979> a<00:05:38.220> negative

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
so that means this has to be a negative

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.250 
so that means this has to be a negative
moment<00:05:38.910> that's<00:05:39.390> what<00:05:39.510> I'm<00:05:39.660> going<00:05:39.780> to<00:05:39.810> do<00:05:39.990> here

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
moment that's what I'm going to do here

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.770 
moment that's what I'm going to do here
now<00:05:40.729> right<00:05:41.729> here<00:05:41.940> what<00:05:42.120> do<00:05:42.180> I<00:05:42.270> do<00:05:42.479> about<00:05:42.510> that

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
now right here what do I do about that

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.600 
now right here what do I do about that
well<00:05:43.200> that's<00:05:43.530> just<00:05:43.770> a<00:05:43.950> moment<00:05:44.310> it's<00:05:44.430> not<00:05:44.490> a

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
well that's just a moment it's not a

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.159 
well that's just a moment it's not a
force<00:05:44.940> times<00:05:45.120> a<00:05:45.300> distance<00:05:45.330> it's<00:05:45.840> just<00:05:46.050> a

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
force times a distance it's just a

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.650 
force times a distance it's just a
moment<00:05:46.530> so<00:05:47.070> I<00:05:47.100> get<00:05:47.310> to<00:05:47.430> add<00:05:47.550> that<00:05:47.850> in<00:05:48.030> here<00:05:48.300> just

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
moment so I get to add that in here just

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.800 
moment so I get to add that in here just
like<00:05:48.810> this<00:05:49.460> right<00:05:50.460> it's<00:05:50.880> constant<00:05:51.450> about<00:05:51.660> the

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
like this right it's constant about the

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.390 
like this right it's constant about the
mean<00:05:51.990> along<00:05:52.290> the<00:05:52.440> beams<00:05:52.680> so<00:05:52.860> I<00:05:52.950> can<00:05:53.100> just<00:05:53.220> add

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
mean along the beams so I can just add

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.180 
mean along the beams so I can just add
that<00:05:53.610> in<00:05:53.669> then<00:05:54.479> has<00:05:54.720> to<00:05:54.870> be<00:05:54.990> zero<00:05:55.350> well<00:05:55.890> this<00:05:56.040> is

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
that in then has to be zero well this is

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.650 
that in then has to be zero well this is
particularly<00:05:56.669> easy<00:05:56.970> to<00:05:57.210> solve

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
particularly easy to solve

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.730 
particularly easy to solve
so<00:05:58.200> my<00:05:58.380> moment<00:05:58.800> has<00:05:58.950> to<00:05:58.979> be<00:05:59.250> 500<00:06:00.650> meters

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
so my moment has to be 500 meters

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.520 
so my moment has to be 500 meters
so<00:06:03.040> it<00:06:03.160> turns<00:06:03.430> out<00:06:03.810> that<00:06:04.810> if<00:06:04.960> I<00:06:05.080> applied<00:06:05.380> them

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
so it turns out that if I applied them

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.920 
so it turns out that if I applied them
together<00:06:05.650> your<00:06:05.950> way<00:06:06.070> here<00:06:06.280> if<00:06:06.970> I<00:06:07.240> apply<00:06:07.630> a

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
together your way here if I apply a

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.260 
together your way here if I apply a
moment<00:06:08.500> of<00:06:08.830> 500<00:06:09.370> Newton<00:06:09.670> meters<00:06:09.970> at<00:06:10.120> this

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
moment of 500 Newton meters at this

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.480 
moment of 500 Newton meters at this
right<00:06:10.510> end<00:06:10.720> this<00:06:10.870> beam<00:06:11.200> will<00:06:11.530> stay<00:06:11.830> horizontal

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
right end this beam will stay horizontal

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.550 
right end this beam will stay horizontal
now<00:06:13.060> although<00:06:13.360> I<00:06:13.570> didn't<00:06:13.960> solve<00:06:14.170> for<00:06:14.470> the

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
now although I didn't solve for the

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.410 
now although I didn't solve for the
vertical<00:06:15.010> force<00:06:15.280> if<00:06:15.730> I<00:06:15.910> want<00:06:16.090> to<00:06:16.150> get<00:06:16.270> and

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.420 
vertical force if I want to get and

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.940 
vertical force if I want to get and
solve<00:06:16.660> for<00:06:16.720> that<00:06:16.900> there's<00:06:17.080> only<00:06:17.230> two<00:06:17.500> vertical

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
solve for that there's only two vertical

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.980 
solve for that there's only two vertical
forces<00:06:18.280> so<00:06:18.580> a<00:06:18.760> Y<00:06:19.000> clearly<00:06:19.540> has<00:06:19.720> to<00:06:19.750> be<00:06:19.960> a

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
forces so a Y clearly has to be a

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.200 
forces so a Y clearly has to be a
thousand<00:06:20.500> Newtons<00:06:20.860> and<00:06:21.250> any<00:06:21.580> X<00:06:21.790> is<00:06:21.970> going<00:06:22.120> to

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
thousand Newtons and any X is going to

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.420 
thousand Newtons and any X is going to
be<00:06:22.270> zero<00:06:22.630> so<00:06:22.840> there<00:06:23.110> you<00:06:23.230> go<00:06:23.380> this<00:06:23.980> would<00:06:24.190> work

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
be zero so there you go this would work

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.200 
be zero so there you go this would work
my<00:06:25.360> subconscious<00:06:26.340> the<00:06:27.340> last<00:06:27.550> thing<00:06:27.850> I<00:06:27.940> need<00:06:28.090> to

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
my subconscious the last thing I need to

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.450 
my subconscious the last thing I need to
do<00:06:28.330> is<00:06:28.480> put<00:06:28.660> the<00:06:28.780> a<00:06:28.810> in<00:06:28.990> there<00:06:29.410> so<00:06:30.160> I'm<00:06:30.280> gonna

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
do is put the a in there so I'm gonna

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:36.710 
do is put the a in there so I'm gonna
City<00:06:30.820> answer<00:06:32.640> all<00:06:33.640> right<00:06:33.910> M<00:06:34.720> equals<00:06:35.640> 500

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
City answer all right M equals 500

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.670 
City answer all right M equals 500
Newton<00:06:37.720> meters<00:06:39.660> and<00:06:40.660> I'm<00:06:41.050> gonna<00:06:41.230> draw<00:06:41.410> a<00:06:41.440> box

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
Newton meters and I'm gonna draw a box

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.550 
Newton meters and I'm gonna draw a box
around<00:06:41.890> it<00:06:42.190> so<00:06:42.310> there<00:06:42.460> you<00:06:42.580> go<00:06:43.350> hope<00:06:44.350> this

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
around it so there you go hope this

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.240 
around it so there you go hope this
helps<00:06:44.950> and<00:06:45.520> I'll<00:06:45.640> see<00:06:45.790> you<00:06:45.880> next<00:06:45.910> time
