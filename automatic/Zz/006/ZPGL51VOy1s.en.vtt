00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 dear youtubers today I'm going to 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.440
 present one of my favorite tricks 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.440
 how to make a hollandaise sauce 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.670
 you know what is done with a good 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.070
 quality butter the first thing that 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.320
 we're going to do is melt this one 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.750
 form we clarify clarify 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.570
 means that butter deposits 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.279
 down all the impurities and we take 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.070
 only the part above the part 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.020
 that is cleaner and then once 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.880
 we have made the Dutch let's do 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.770
 a premium sauce sister of the Dutch 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.420
 that is called bearnesa for that we are going to 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.670
 add a little bit of vinegar in one 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.510
 pan and some tarragon we are going to 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.510
 emulsify the yolks 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.160
 look, we have it, we are going to see it 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.410
 let's leave here to the side we excited 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.090
 thus in cistas it is worth what we do now 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.190
 is to take a little butter 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.079
 Clarified we remove all part of 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.609
 the foam above 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.609
 you have to take it with this hand 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.540
 and adding fine threads a thin thread 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.540
 to mount 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.600
 and it's as simple as this to be riding 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.600
 the yolk with the butter 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.030
 and here this for example for a 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.310
 salmon for a hake this would be the 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.260
 basic traditional Dutch and now 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.990
 let's add a bit of tarragon 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.870
 and vinegar and let's make the premium 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.909
 sister who is a bearnese 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.890
 it goes 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.960
 to whiten a little bit for the vinegar 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.770
 which is a sauce a little lighter 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.219
 will carry a little more liquid 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.640
 easy to do simple and above all 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:06.420
 very rich I hope you liked the 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.420
 this week's trick 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.459
 and you
