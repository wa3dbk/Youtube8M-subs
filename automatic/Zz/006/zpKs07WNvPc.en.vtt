00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.960
 shared account link in description 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.360
 healthy little brothers homework places 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:15.389
 Rustam and today we have a review of the game 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.320
 slenderman outlast from exar all i 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.320
 accountant 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.769
 ok we booted it apparently forgot 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.920
 shut down 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:30.810
 we have a tutorial here and a start game 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.730
 tutor will not be suitable for there is nothing 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.410
 there is no interesting click start game 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:41.840
 and we have here three light modes 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:45.270
 medium and heavy for each mode 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.450
 There are many ways to say Easy Slender 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.969
 will appear 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.539
 less often on a medium he will appear 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.300
 average on hard he can say the most 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:02.129
 start you can kill 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:07.080
 I played and I know it will take go 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.990
 to see the game at all so that we have 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.080
 never killed this slender man at 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:19.290
 last che say I did not quite like 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:22.680
 all because I played a slender listing 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:28.070
 here's a sleeper resting he's much cooler 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:32.250
 firstly there are modes different modes 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:36.470
 different cards have and besides that 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.740
 different cards are still on the cards as possible 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:44.850
 choose for example how you will search 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:50.250
 notes there in a thunderstorm in the rain in the darkness there 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:53.119
 and still in my night view was not here 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.990
 we have no such choice and 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:02.700
 this is bad in this this and 1 minus 2 minus 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.829
 this is something that is worse all worked out here 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.720
 here he cannot run in this booth 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.820
 rman outlast 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:17.330
 he can't run slender man 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:22.260
 very well traced while 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.750
 slender rising he's perfectly traced 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.280
 there is an animation when he is near you he 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:37.340
 his tentacles are shorter from the skeleton 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:37.340
 stir this here is the second minus of this game 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.780
 the third is that the cards are here 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.750
 the only card here is that 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.880
 slender maine outlast here's the stadium if 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.620
 stand still so you can see how he 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:55.080
 approaching here I don't remember slender 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.010
 racing was such that he 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.900
 was approaching but here it is moving 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.730
 that is, stand still and look at 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:09.180
 him he will slowly approach 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:11.459
 You can now be able to be attributed to 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.000
 plus and I don't really remember if 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.019
 all listing or not well let's find 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.200
 this slenderman 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:26.070
 and see how he can finally scare us 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:29.310
 how is it sounds well in general if you want 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:33.180
 somehow stronger scare and have you 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.220
 there is a choice whether to take a resting slender 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.519
 or slanderman outlast clean 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.470
 slenderman rising because he is much 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.350
 cooler and worked by the way on him 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.650
 let 's go here work here and everything about us 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.650
 killed 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.880
 game on Pyaterochka from 10 to 5 points and 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.020
 here 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:01.070
 there is no need to put more than 5 points 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:06.860
 you for what I donâ€™t even know for but 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:11.810
 the fact that a little bit on the slider the fact that he 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:14.480
 Moves and easier sky notes but in 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.820
 everything else is even five points 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.450
 it's a pity to bet because well the game is not 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:24.080
 It is worth but here Sender Majestic is cool 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.600
 gun well, I hope you understand the principle 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.820
 general advise you not this game is not ripped off 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.780
 a layer of slender from mdf then 100 logies already 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:37.700
 doing the same thing I say well, in general 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:39.950
 I don't like this game everybody 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.230
