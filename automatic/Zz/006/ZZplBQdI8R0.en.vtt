00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 How many repetitions should I do in the 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.200
 exercises to gain muscle mass 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.070
 how many repetitions should I do in each 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.279
 series no matter what your 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.980
 favorite bodybuilding magazine the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.930
 best number of repetitions for 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.660
 develop muscle in people 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.070
 genetically normal natural and without 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.850
 drug is 3 to 8 repetitions and 9 to 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.239
 12 repetitions are recommended of course 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.300
 you can get good results 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:42.239
 doing series of 10 repetitions and what 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.079
 I recommend for some exercises but 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.079
 it's better to stick to fewer repetitions 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.449
 leaving aside those problems the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.570
 greater repetitions will no longer be 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.719
 effective to develop muscle yet 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.550
 well unless you're advanced and strong 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.909
 in this case you can do 20 repetitions 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.720
 because the load will be too light 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.060
 strong people 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.850
 can develop large legs 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.150
 doing several repetitions of 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.080
 squats the problem as I mentioned 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.270
 is that you will be very sore after 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.570
 a workout like this and any 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.230
 physical activity that you do the days 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:32.060
 following will be affected how much 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.980
 volume of repetitions is sufficient 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.630
 real evidence shows that a total 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:42.210
 from 50 to 100 repetitions a week per 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.810
 muscle group is enough to 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.990
 stimulate your growth that means 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.940
 that for your body you could do 5 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:57.810
 series of 5 repetitions in a day 25 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:01.940
 repeats in total and three sets of 8 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.759
 repetitions another day of that week 24 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:09.320
 repeats in total and 10 series of 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.750
 three repetitions another day of that week 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:16.500
 30 repetitions in total 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.410
 that equals 79 repetitions in total 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.380
 a week what would be enough to 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:26.430
 people who start to develop 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.459
 muscle for advanced people with more 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:34.440
 ability to recover could do 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:37.050
 150 to 200 repetitions in total per 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.950
 each muscle group a week if 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.930
 they have great ability to recover 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.530
 however, you should always start 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.350
 doing the least necessary and see how 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.300
 your body adapts before adding 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.300
 more volume of repetitions
