40<00:02:03.600> years<00:02:03.719> they<00:02:03.840> said<00:02:04.020> they<00:02:04.140> can't<00:02:04.200> believe

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
40 years they said they can't believe

40 years they said they can't believe
that<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:06.090> matter<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.420> four<00:02:06.659> days<00:02:06.869> our<00:02:07.259> house

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
that in a matter of four days our house

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.499 
that in a matter of four days our house
changed<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.220> dramatically<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.119> yet<00:02:09.479> look

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
changed so dramatically and yet look

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.690 
changed so dramatically and yet look
like<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.020> was<00:02:10.349> always<00:02:10.530> here<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.580> know

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
like it was always here that it you know

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.809 
like it was always here that it you know
belongs<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.300> neighborhood

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
belongs in the neighborhood

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.099 
belongs in the neighborhood
the<00:02:13.239> design<00:02:13.659> and<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.409> integration<00:02:15.310> is

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:16.109 
the design and the integration is

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.050 
the design and the integration is
incredible<00:02:17.109> so<00:02:17.379> even<00:02:18.219> now<00:02:18.340> people<00:02:18.370> say<00:02:18.819> gee<00:02:19.030> I

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
incredible so even now people say gee I

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.759 
incredible so even now people say gee I
can't<00:02:19.329> believe<00:02:19.480> that<00:02:19.629> you<00:02:19.900> never<00:02:20.079> you<00:02:20.680> know

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
can't believe that you never you know

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
like it was always there the advantage

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.220 
like it was always there the advantage
of<00:02:24.099> using<00:02:24.280> modular<00:02:24.639> renovation<00:02:25.540> technology

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
of using modular renovation technology

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.860 
of using modular renovation technology
is<00:02:26.469> in<00:02:26.920> its<00:02:27.069> flexibility<00:02:27.870> using
