the 90 watts I have outside right now so

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.060 
the 90 watts I have outside right now so
90<00:01:22.759> watts<00:01:22.940> coming<00:01:23.330> in<00:01:23.509> over<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.500> battery<00:01:24.800> bank

close-up on this kind of a cool little

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.210 
close-up on this kind of a cool little
inverter<00:01:38.210> it's<00:01:39.110> even<00:01:39.289> got<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.470> 5<00:01:39.770> volt<00:01:40.009> socket

on the edge familis inverter it's on
high<00:01:45.560> right<00:01:45.770> now<00:01:45.940> 60<00:01:46.940> watts<00:01:47.119> on<00:01:47.270> low<00:01:47.450> 90<00:01:47.810> on

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
high right now 60 watts on low 90 on

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.889 
high right now 60 watts on low 90 on
high<00:01:48.220> just<00:01:49.220> a<00:01:49.340> quick<00:01:49.520> note<00:01:49.550> about<00:01:49.759> cooking<00:01:50.750> on

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
high just a quick note about cooking on

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.080 
high just a quick note about cooking on
battery<00:01:51.259> banks<00:01:51.710> this<00:01:52.340> is<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.580> best<00:01:52.759> way<00:01:52.940> I've

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
battery banks this is the best way I've

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.669 
battery banks this is the best way I've
found<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.450> do<00:01:53.600> it<00:01:53.750> because<00:01:53.899> it<00:01:54.170> doesn't<00:01:54.380> pull

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
found to do it because it doesn't pull

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.980 
found to do it because it doesn't pull
that<00:01:55.100> many<00:01:55.340> watts<00:01:55.550> per<00:01:55.820> hour<00:01:55.970> on<00:01:56.270> low<00:01:56.780> it's

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
that many watts per hour on low it's

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.830 
that many watts per hour on low it's
like<00:01:57.170> 60<00:01:57.530> watts<00:01:57.740> high<00:01:57.950> 90<00:01:58.520> so<00:01:59.210> two<00:01:59.509> batteries

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
like 60 watts high 90 so two batteries

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.630 
like 60 watts high 90 so two batteries
can<00:02:00.020> easily<00:02:00.320> handle<00:02:00.470> 90<00:02:00.920> that's<00:02:01.040> like<00:02:01.220> 45

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
can easily handle 90 that's like 45

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.550 
can easily handle 90 that's like 45
watts<00:02:01.909> of<00:02:02.030> battery<00:02:02.330> that's<00:02:03.110> not<00:02:03.350> bad

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
watts of battery that's not bad

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.840 
watts of battery that's not bad
especially<00:02:03.799> when<00:02:04.189> you<00:02:04.250> get<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.400> 90<00:02:04.670> watts

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
especially when you get the 90 watts

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:13.720 
especially when you get the 90 watts
coming<00:02:05.210> in<00:02:06.159> here's<00:02:07.159> a<00:02:07.280> close-up<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:13.190> got<00:02:13.610> all

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
coming in here's a close-up and got all

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.410 
coming in here's a close-up and got all
foggy<00:02:15.400> okay<00:02:16.400> there<00:02:16.579> it<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:16.730> guys<00:02:16.940> it's<00:02:17.299> all
