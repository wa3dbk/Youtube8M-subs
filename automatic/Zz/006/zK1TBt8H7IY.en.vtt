00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.890 
big the big bully type guys and uh I
will<00:02:48.790> say<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.090> game<00:02:49.239> feels<00:02:49.450> like<00:02:49.569> it<00:02:49.629> has<00:02:49.720> much

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
will say the game feels like it has much

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.300 
will say the game feels like it has much
more<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:50.200> much<00:02:50.349> more<00:02:50.500> of<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.620> punch<00:02:50.859> like<00:02:51.159> the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
more of much more of a punch like the

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.789 
more of much more of a punch like the
the<00:02:51.609> combat<00:02:51.970> feels<00:02:52.209> less<00:02:52.659> like<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.959> kind<00:02:53.739> of

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
the combat feels less like a kind of

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.099 
the combat feels less like a kind of
grindy<00:02:54.220> bullet<00:02:54.519> sponge<00:02:54.819> RPG<00:02:55.510> approach<00:02:55.840> and

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
grindy bullet sponge RPG approach and

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.619 
grindy bullet sponge RPG approach and
much<00:02:56.500> more<00:02:56.739> like<00:02:56.950> it's<00:02:57.159> a<00:02:57.340> kind<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.299> physics

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
much more like it's a kind of a physics

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:59.910 
much more like it's a kind of a physics
based<00:02:58.780> thing<00:02:59.079> you<00:02:59.230> still<00:02:59.440> got<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.650> numbers

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
based thing you still got the numbers

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.920 
based thing you still got the numbers
popping<00:03:00.280> up<00:03:00.370> when<00:03:00.549> you<00:03:00.639> hit<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.879> bad<00:03:01.030> guys<00:03:01.239> but

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
popping up when you hit the bad guys but

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.869 
popping up when you hit the bad guys but
in<00:03:02.109> this<00:03:02.230> case<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:03.040> know<00:03:03.159> you<00:03:03.220> hit<00:03:03.489> a<00:03:03.519> zombie

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
in this case you know you hit a zombie

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.089 
in this case you know you hit a zombie
with<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.030> sledgehammer<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:04.659> he<00:03:04.959> flies<00:03:05.230> 30<00:03:05.859> feet

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
with a sledgehammer and he flies 30 feet

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.099 
with a sledgehammer and he flies 30 feet
in<00:03:06.159> the<00:03:06.190> air<00:03:06.250> which<00:03:06.519> I'll<00:03:07.239> admit<00:03:07.569> that's<00:03:07.840> fun

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
in the air which I'll admit that's fun

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:09.930 
in the air which I'll admit that's fun
as<00:03:08.470> for<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.769> guns<00:03:08.950> they<00:03:09.190> actually<00:03:09.549> have<00:03:09.819> an

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
as for the guns they actually have an

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.430 
as for the guns they actually have an
impact<00:03:10.329> it<00:03:10.540> doesn't<00:03:10.750> just<00:03:10.870> feel<00:03:11.019> like<00:03:11.170> you're

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
impact it doesn't just feel like you're

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.559 
impact it doesn't just feel like you're
kind<00:03:11.739> of<00:03:11.829> chipping<00:03:12.609> away<00:03:12.700> at<00:03:12.909> them<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.359> guns

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
kind of chipping away at them the guns

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.300 
kind of chipping away at them the guns
in<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.750> first<00:03:13.989> Dead<00:03:14.170> Island<00:03:14.319> they<00:03:14.829> sucked<00:03:15.099> ass

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
in the first Dead Island they sucked ass

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.460 
in the first Dead Island they sucked ass
I'm<00:03:15.790> just<00:03:15.970> gonna<00:03:16.060> say<00:03:16.299> that<00:03:16.480> they<00:03:16.660> were<00:03:16.750> stupid

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
I'm just gonna say that they were stupid

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.020 
I'm just gonna say that they were stupid
there<00:03:17.829> was<00:03:17.919> like<00:03:18.040> no<00:03:18.069> point<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.579> have<00:03:18.669> guns<00:03:18.879> in

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
there was like no point to have guns in

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.729 
there was like no point to have guns in
that<00:03:19.120> game<00:03:19.329> but<00:03:19.840> they<00:03:19.959> did<00:03:20.109> it<00:03:20.230> anyway<00:03:20.319> they're

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
that game but they did it anyway they're

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.800 
that game but they did it anyway they're
like<00:03:20.889> you<00:03:20.980> need<00:03:21.099> to<00:03:21.220> conserve<00:03:21.609> ammo<00:03:22.000> because

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
like you need to conserve ammo because

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.210 
like you need to conserve ammo because
the<00:03:22.900> ammo<00:03:23.079> doesn't<00:03:23.199> do<00:03:23.349> anything<00:03:23.650> anyway<00:03:23.859> it's

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
the ammo doesn't do anything anyway it's

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.849 
the ammo doesn't do anything anyway it's
hard<00:03:24.370> to<00:03:24.459> find<00:03:24.639> so<00:03:25.030> screw<00:03:25.720> that<00:03:25.870> yeah<00:03:26.709> I<00:03:26.739> think

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
hard to find so screw that yeah I think

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.860 
hard to find so screw that yeah I think
I<00:03:27.099> think<00:03:27.129> that<00:03:27.370> Yeager's<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:28.209> know<00:03:28.329> doing

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
I think that Yeager's you know doing

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.110 
I think that Yeager's you know doing
some<00:03:28.989> cool<00:03:29.109> stuff<00:03:29.169> with<00:03:29.470> this<00:03:29.940> kind<00:03:30.940> of<00:03:31.000> hard

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
some cool stuff with this kind of hard

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.909 
some cool stuff with this kind of hard
to<00:03:31.209> say<00:03:31.389> I<00:03:31.690> had<00:03:31.810> you<00:03:31.989> know<00:03:32.079> a<00:03:32.109> few<00:03:32.169> little<00:03:32.440> bugs

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:32.919 
to say I had you know a few little bugs

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.140 
to say I had you know a few little bugs
and<00:03:33.129> glitches<00:03:33.190> but<00:03:33.549> like<00:03:33.699> I<00:03:33.790> said<00:03:33.970> it's<00:03:34.090> a

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
and glitches but like I said it's a

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.939 
and glitches but like I said it's a
pre-alpha<00:03:34.480> build<00:03:34.750> so<00:03:34.989> you<00:03:35.079> can't<00:03:35.260> really<00:03:35.440> pass

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:35.949 
pre-alpha build so you can't really pass

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.289 
pre-alpha build so you can't really pass
any<00:03:36.220> judgment<00:03:36.250> based<00:03:36.730> on<00:03:36.879> that<00:03:36.940> but<00:03:37.180> they

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
any judgment based on that but they

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.849 
any judgment based on that but they
seemed<00:03:37.480> confident<00:03:37.930> enough<00:03:38.169> in<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.440> that<00:03:38.769> they

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
seemed confident enough in it that they

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.390 
seemed confident enough in it that they
are<00:03:38.889> letting<00:03:40.379> filthy<00:03:41.379> plebeian<00:03:41.949> peasant

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
are letting filthy plebeian peasant

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.059 
are letting filthy plebeian peasant
gamers<00:03:42.879> play<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.269> on<00:03:43.449> the<00:03:43.510> show<00:03:43.930> floor<00:03:44.230> but

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
gamers play it on the show floor but

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.349 
gamers play it on the show floor but
that's<00:03:45.190> cool<00:03:45.340> so<00:03:45.639> you<00:03:45.699> know<00:03:45.879> people<00:03:46.060> get<00:03:46.239> to

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
that's cool so you know people get to

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.750 
that's cool so you know people get to
kind<00:03:46.540> of<00:03:46.599> get<00:03:47.560> their<00:03:47.709> own<00:03:47.799> feel<00:03:48.010> for<00:03:48.280> it<00:03:48.400> I

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
kind of get their own feel for it I

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.280 
kind of get their own feel for it I
don't<00:03:49.299> know<00:03:49.359> if<00:03:49.510> I'm<00:03:49.599> actually<00:03:49.750> going<00:03:50.049> to<00:03:50.139> ever

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
don't know if I'm actually going to ever

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.050 
don't know if I'm actually going to ever
play<00:03:50.530> it<00:03:50.739> because<00:03:51.010> I'm<00:03:51.280> kind<00:03:51.579> of<00:03:51.639> tired<00:03:51.879> of

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
play it because I'm kind of tired of

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.960 
play it because I'm kind of tired of
zombies<00:03:52.449> you<00:03:53.199> know<00:03:53.319> I'll<00:03:53.650> be<00:03:53.769> honest<00:03:54.099> but<00:03:54.579> it

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
zombies you know I'll be honest but it

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.490 
zombies you know I'll be honest but it
definitely<00:03:55.120> looks<00:03:55.359> like<00:03:55.510> a<00:03:55.599> much<00:03:55.810> more<00:03:55.840> worthy

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
definitely looks like a much more worthy

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.430 
definitely looks like a much more worthy
effort<00:03:56.769> than<00:03:57.159> the<00:03:57.220> last<00:03:57.400> one<00:03:58.049> as<00:03:59.049> for<00:03:59.379> that
