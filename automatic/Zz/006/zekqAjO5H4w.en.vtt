00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.209 

this<00:00:11.849> game<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.420> played<00:00:12.780> in<00:00:13.049> landscape<00:00:14.009> but

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
this game is played in landscape but

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:14.800 
this game is played in landscape but
you're<00:00:14.370> going<00:00:14.519> to

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:14.810 
you're going to

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.990 
you're going to
play<00:00:15.080> it<00:00:15.260> with<00:00:15.980> the<00:00:16.040> phone<00:00:16.310> facing<00:00:16.880> up<00:00:16.970> the

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
play it with the phone facing up the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.350 
play it with the phone facing up the
comp<00:00:17.240> laid<00:00:17.390> flat<00:00:17.870> on<00:00:18.080> the<00:00:18.140> ground<00:00:19.150> because<00:00:20.150> it

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
comp laid flat on the ground because it

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.360 
comp laid flat on the ground because it
uses<00:00:20.570> the<00:00:20.750> accelerometer<00:00:21.020> as<00:00:21.650> you<00:00:21.800> can<00:00:21.920> see<00:00:22.130> in

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.370 
uses the accelerometer as you can see in

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.750 
uses the accelerometer as you can see in
the<00:00:22.520> controls<00:00:22.910> to<00:00:23.920> change<00:00:24.920> the<00:00:25.070> viewing<00:00:25.279> angle

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
the controls to change the viewing angle

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.830 
the controls to change the viewing angle
so<00:00:27.279> let's<00:00:28.279> see<00:00:28.430> if<00:00:28.520> we<00:00:28.640> can<00:00:28.760> get<00:00:28.880> this<00:00:29.029> in<00:00:29.240> focus

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
so let's see if we can get this in focus

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.500 
so let's see if we can get this in focus
for<00:00:30.230> the<00:00:30.700> camera<00:00:31.700> I<00:00:34.000> can't<00:00:35.000> actually<00:00:35.120> see<00:00:35.420> your

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
for the camera I can't actually see your

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.360 
for the camera I can't actually see your
screen<00:00:35.750> at<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:35.930> moment<00:00:36.200> so<00:00:36.230> as<00:00:36.560> you're

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
screen at the moment so as you're

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.140 
screen at the moment so as you're
rotating<00:00:37.579> the<00:00:38.060> phone<00:00:40.690> you'll<00:00:41.690> see<00:00:42.050> that

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
rotating the phone you'll see that

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.710 
rotating the phone you'll see that
changing<00:00:44.150> the<00:00:44.270> view<00:00:46.060> whoops<00:00:47.060> let's<00:00:47.480> get<00:00:47.600> my

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
changing the view whoops let's get my

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:56.060 
changing the view whoops let's get my
hand<00:00:47.930> out<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:48.170> way

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.610 

and<00:00:56.610> then<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.910> point<00:00:57.060> is<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.480> course<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.930> get

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
and then the point is of course to get

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.790 
and then the point is of course to get
the<00:00:58.680> paper<00:00:59.960> into<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:00.989> waste<00:01:01.350> bin<00:01:03.650> okay<00:01:04.650> that
