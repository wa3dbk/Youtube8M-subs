00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
here I would along what I imagine is our

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.830 
here I would along what I imagine is our
path<00:00:35.040> also<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.760> can<00:00:35.969> be<00:00:36.000> like<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> Hansel<00:00:36.690> and

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
path also it can be like a Hansel and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.690 
path also it can be like a Hansel and
Gretel<00:00:37.140> trail<00:00:37.380> leading<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.190> back<00:00:38.219> here
