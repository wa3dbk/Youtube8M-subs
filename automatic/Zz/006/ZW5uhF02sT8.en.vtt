 especially a different video than usual 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:17.550

 about the konami guys i will say 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.450
 the most important things that have happened 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.550
 in these last periods the first thing 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.739
 important that happened and that the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.510
 konami has definitely left the 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.360
 new york kids bag for a company 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.489
 get out of a new york stock market 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.190
 let's say it's a little bit like losing one 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.160
 card game where the house is played 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.590
 for instance boys the bag of 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.420
 Big Apple is one of the most bags 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.610
 important to say the least 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.550
 important to the world and the konami we say 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.020
 it is not 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.630
 since I no longer exist in it I don't believe that 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.990
 I don't think it's a good omen 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.240
 here is this news 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.630
 the second news guys on the mouth 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.560
 of all and that but left from 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.410
 a konami 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.650
 so let's say for anyone who chewed 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.430
 something about gaming put solid gear there 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.250
 says something 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.740
 here is the right news guys is one 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.260
 news of but I do not know if it is true 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.450
 there are rumors that say that 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.790
 the konami has increased its own 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.430
 profits of a very high percentage 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.760
 this frankly I don't know why not 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.650
 I can understand if it is a source 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.520
 reliable source from which the 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.880
 glen 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.620
 or there is an unreliable source that 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.750
 they write hoax every three by two 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.350
 the question of this video that I give you 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:12.100
 I want to ask is the following 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.440
 according to you yu gi oh will come to the 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.310
 terminus 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.410
 according to you yu gi oh will come to an end 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.650
 in the end that is according to you yu gi oh 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.390
 will end up existing because we have seen 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.560
 that this company no longer comes 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.720
 of from the waters 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.630
 we noticed all the guys and it is 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:37.120
 useless hiding behind behind 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.080
 let's say shit 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.830
 we all noticed that from konami 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.090
 lately he's doing a bit of 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.250
 moves not so beautiful 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.900
 financial year and market level 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.819
 we all noticed it 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.300
 enough as I said in his video is enough 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.879
 read a little bit on the sites of 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.879
 online news 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:04.160
 and we know that the konami say 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.879
 lately no ships that you most from 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.540
 waters 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:10.549
 but my question is do you think yu gi oh 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.640
 will continue to exist if the konami 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.970
 will fail according to you July will go ahead 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:21.290
 or it will come to an end 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.099
