hi YouTube this is my race car that I
made<00:00:04.380> some<00:00:04.620> instructions<00:00:05.279> off<00:00:05.490> of<00:00:05.640> the

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
made some instructions off of the

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.120 
made some instructions off of the
website<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:06.569> I<00:00:06.839> will<00:00:07.710> post<00:00:07.950> the

website that I will post the
instructions<00:00:08.760> in<00:00:08.910> programming<00:00:09.480> in<00:00:09.630> the

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
instructions in programming in the

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.160 
instructions in programming in the
description<00:00:10.380> box<00:00:10.639> and<00:00:14.420> it<00:00:15.420> has<00:00:15.660> the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
description box and it has the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.220 
description box and it has the
controller<00:00:16.890> as<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.310> can<00:00:17.490> see<00:00:18.529> and<00:00:21.230> pretty

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
controller as you can see and pretty

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.570 
controller as you can see and pretty
nice<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.980> way<00:00:23.130> they<00:00:23.460> made<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:25.250> gears<00:00:26.250> as

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
nice the way they made it the gears as

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.589 
nice the way they made it the gears as
you<00:00:26.730> can<00:00:26.939> see<00:00:27.180> here<00:00:27.449> figure<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:29.480> motor<00:00:30.480> and

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
you can see here figure on the motor and

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.780 
you can see here figure on the motor and
this<00:00:30.929> one<00:00:31.170> here<00:00:31.410> I'm<00:00:31.590> there<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.399> really

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
this one here I'm there and it's really

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.750 
this one here I'm there and it's really
stable<00:00:33.000> no<00:00:33.420> skipping<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.110> yours<00:00:34.550> and<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
stable no skipping of yours and the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.740 
stable no skipping of yours and the
steering's<00:00:37.190> this<00:00:38.190> gear<00:00:38.550> makes<00:00:39.210> contact<00:00:39.540> with

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
steering's this gear makes contact with

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.229 
steering's this gear makes contact with
this<00:00:39.870> gear<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.710> makes<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> wheels<00:00:41.309> turn

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.680

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
so when you press both of them I look

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.040 
so when you press both of them I look
forward<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:50.670> if<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.360> press<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:51.899> and

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
forward and if you press this one and

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.729 
forward and if you press this one and
close<00:00:52.170> sideways<00:00:52.980> part<00:00:53.789> turns<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:56.760> if<00:00:57.000> you

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
close sideways part turns and if you

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:04.359 
close sideways part turns and if you
press<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.010> other<00:00:59.100> one<00:00:59.399> goes<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.969> way<00:01:02.809> and

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
press the other one goes that way and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.770 
press the other one goes that way and
you<00:01:05.369> can<00:01:05.400> notice<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.909> goes<00:01:06.000> pretty<00:01:06.390> slow<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
you can notice it goes pretty slow and

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.960 
you can notice it goes pretty slow and
it<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.020> go<00:01:07.140> slower<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:08.490> hit<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.820> button

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.820 

now<00:01:11.970> go<00:01:12.180> really<00:01:12.510> slow<00:01:13.909> now<00:01:14.909> if<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.619> put<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.710> up

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
now go really slow now if I put it up

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.660 
now go really slow now if I put it up
again<00:01:17.659> close<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> bit<00:01:18.900> faster<00:01:19.430> push<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.549> up

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
again close a bit faster push it up

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.109 
again close a bit faster push it up
again<00:01:22.250> it's<00:01:23.250> faster<00:01:23.750> and<00:01:24.750> then<00:01:24.900> full<00:01:25.290> speed<00:01:25.560> is

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
again it's faster and then full speed is

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:34.789 
again it's faster and then full speed is
pretty<00:01:27.119> fast<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:32.810> like<00:01:33.810> they<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.470> have

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
pretty fast and it's like they do have

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.429 
pretty fast and it's like they do have
another<00:01:35.460> project<00:01:35.970> where<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.689> can<00:01:36.750> actually

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
another project where you can actually

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.240 
another project where you can actually
do<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.829> with<00:01:38.009> another<00:01:38.040> NXT<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:40.770> you

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
do this with another NXT and so it's you

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
do this with another NXT and so it's you
don't<00:01:41.400> have<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.850> hunched<00:01:42.150> over

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
don't have to be hunched over

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.990 
don't have to be hunched over
controlling<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.280> but<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.490> don't<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.790> another

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
controlling it but I don't have another

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.289 
controlling it but I don't have another
next<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.630> right<00:01:45.750> now<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:47.000> as<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.149> can

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
next to you right now so and as you can

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.760 
next to you right now so and as you can
see<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.780> bottom<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.170> has<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.530> color

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
see on the bottom it has the color

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.749 
see on the bottom it has the color
sensor<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.700> color<00:01:51.060> racing<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:53.189> program

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
sensor for color racing and the program

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.139 
sensor for color racing and the program
that<00:01:53.790> they<00:01:54.240> give<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.600> kind<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.140> stinks<00:01:55.790> so<00:01:56.790> I'm

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
that they give you kind of stinks so I'm

that they give you kind of stinks so I'm
going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.659> try<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.170> make<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> new<00:01:59.659> program<00:02:00.659> for

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
going to try and make a new program for

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.600 
going to try and make a new program for
the<00:02:01.799> color<00:02:02.130> racing<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:04.189> so<00:02:05.189> if<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.369> want<00:02:05.549> to

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
the color racing and so if you want to

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.630 
the color racing and so if you want to
build<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:05.909> up<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.079> description<00:02:07.290> box

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
build this up in the description box

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.770 
build this up in the description box
sorry<00:02:10.390> but<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:12.340> color<00:02:13.270> since<00:02:13.510> they're<00:02:13.720> on

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
sorry but I this color since they're on

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.030 
sorry but I this color since they're on
the<00:02:13.870> bottom<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.470> just<00:02:15.130> guess<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.120> lighting<00:02:16.600> or

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
the bottom I just guess the lighting or

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.070 
the bottom I just guess the lighting or
some<00:02:18.040> factor<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:18.940> making<00:02:19.330> it<00:02:19.450> not<00:02:19.630> working

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
some factor is making it not working

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.640 
some factor is making it not working
properly<00:02:20.260> right<00:02:20.890> now<00:02:21.270> so<00:02:22.270> I'm<00:02:22.810> going<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.470> just

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
properly right now so I'm going to just

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.890 
properly right now so I'm going to just
give<00:02:26.650> up<00:02:26.830> pretty<00:02:27.100> much<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.730> make<00:02:28.510> something
