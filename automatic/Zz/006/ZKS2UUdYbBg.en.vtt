00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
yeah that's probably one of my options

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.890 
yeah that's probably one of my options
the<00:04:07.049> other<00:04:07.170> one<00:04:07.410> is<00:04:07.620> just<00:04:07.890> to<00:04:08.040> ignore<00:04:08.190> it<00:04:08.579> and

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900
