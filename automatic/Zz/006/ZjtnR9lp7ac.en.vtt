to check-in we're firing the jet gun at
the<00:00:25.920> clock<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.280> the<00:00:26.370> diner<00:00:26.520> oh<00:00:26.640> my<00:00:26.850> God<00:00:27.090> look<00:00:27.300> at

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the clock in the diner oh my God look at

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.450 
the clock in the diner oh my God look at
this<00:00:27.510> look<00:00:28.020> at<00:00:28.110> the<00:00:28.200> electrical<00:00:28.620> effects<00:00:29.040> it's

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
this look at the electrical effects it's

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.830 
this look at the electrical effects it's
impacting<00:00:30.030> the<00:00:30.180> the<00:00:30.390> clock

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
impacting the the clock

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.080 
impacting the the clock
we<00:00:30.900> got<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.230> fire<00:00:31.500> four<00:00:32.250> chickens<00:00:32.730> at<00:00:32.910> four

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
we got to fire four chickens at four

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.060 
we got to fire four chickens at four
different<00:00:33.180> clocks<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.899> think<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.980> I'll

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
different clocks I think and that I'll

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.069 
different clocks I think and that I'll
turn<00:00:35.250> back<00:00:35.309> time<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.059> that'll<00:00:36.270> continue<00:00:36.539> our

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
turn back time and that'll continue our

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.049 
turn back time and that'll continue our

lighting you want to know how I know
this<00:01:10.190> well<00:01:11.190> let's<00:01:11.370> check<00:01:11.550> it<00:01:11.730> out<00:01:11.850> we're<00:01:12.300> gonna

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
this well let's check it out we're gonna

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.160 
this well let's check it out we're gonna
go<00:01:12.600> back<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.980> bus<00:01:14.160> depot<00:01:14.930> alright<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.050> we

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
go back to the bus depot alright so we

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.540 
go back to the bus depot alright so we
went<00:01:16.320> back<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.650> bus<00:01:16.800> depot<00:01:16.980> and<00:01:17.220> check<00:01:17.430> it

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
went back to the bus depot and check it

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.550 
went back to the bus depot and check it
out<00:01:17.700> see<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.210> neon<00:01:18.360> lighting<00:01:18.690> it's<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> exact

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
out see the neon lighting it's the exact

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.830 
out see the neon lighting it's the exact
same<00:01:19.590> neon<00:01:20.190> lighting<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.360> had<00:01:21.570> at<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
same neon lighting that we had at the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.630 
same neon lighting that we had at the
diner<00:01:22.080> I'm<00:01:22.350> just<00:01:22.530> gonna<00:01:22.650> try<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:22.980> at<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
diner I'm just gonna try this at the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.580 
diner I'm just gonna try this at the
check-in<00:01:24.030> out<00:01:24.300> on<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.660> lamppost<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.260> you<00:01:25.410> can

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
check-in out on the lamppost and you can

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.340 
check-in out on the lamppost and you can
see<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.000> sort<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.330> lighting<00:01:27.690> effects<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
see the the sort of lighting effects the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.260 
see the the sort of lighting effects the
particle<00:01:28.800> effects<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.550> jet<00:01:29.790> gun<00:01:29.970> you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
particle effects that the jet gun you

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
particle effects that the jet gun you
know<00:01:30.390> has<00:01:30.870> or<00:01:31.410> creates<00:01:32.400> around<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.690> light<00:01:33.930> on

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
know has or creates around the light on

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.290 
know has or creates around the light on
the<00:01:34.950> lamppost<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.550> we're<00:01:35.670> gonna<00:01:35.760> do<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.060> same

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
the lamppost so we're gonna do the same

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.780 
the lamppost so we're gonna do the same
thing<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.530> neon<00:01:37.710> lighting<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.550> at<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
thing to the neon lighting here at the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.090 
thing to the neon lighting here at the
bus<00:01:38.970> stop<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:40.320> know<00:01:40.440> guys<00:01:40.650> don't<00:01:40.830> get<00:01:40.950> me

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
bus stop and you know guys don't get me

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.610 
bus stop and you know guys don't get me
wrong<00:01:41.220> I'm<00:01:41.730> not<00:01:41.910> trying<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> belittle

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
wrong I'm not trying to belittle

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.930 
wrong I'm not trying to belittle
anything<00:01:43.620> that's<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.370> other<00:01:44.610> people<00:01:44.850> have

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
anything that's that other people have

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.650 
anything that's that other people have
done<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.300> thinking<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.670> know<00:01:47.760> something

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
done in thinking of you know something

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.270 
done in thinking of you know something
that<00:01:48.780> they've<00:01:48.900> done<00:01:49.080> is<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.650> a<00:01:49.680> continuation

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
that they've done is is a continuation

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.810 
that they've done is is a continuation
or<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:51.450> sign<00:01:52.050> of<00:01:52.290> something<00:01:52.560> because<00:01:52.980> hey<00:01:53.340> man<00:01:53.610> I

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
it's just an effect the jet gun has I

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.059 
it's just an effect the jet gun has I
mean<00:02:36.659> you<00:02:36.959> could<00:02:37.079> fire<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.319> at<00:02:37.560> nearly<00:02:37.769> any

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
mean you could fire it at nearly any

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.610 
mean you could fire it at nearly any
sort<00:02:38.849> of<00:02:38.909> neon<00:02:39.209> lighting<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:40.049> you'll<00:02:40.440> have
