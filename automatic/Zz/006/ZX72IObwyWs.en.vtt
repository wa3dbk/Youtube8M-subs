00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.519
 made video and I sincerely apologize 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.960
 so I 'll talk to you a little bit 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.289
 in these videos why I do not have 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.930
 done video and so on and also you 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.359
 thank everyone for the 26 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.619
 thousand subscribers so exactly right when 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.789
 I was not doing video when I did 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.949
 a little break we went up to 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.320
 26 thousand subscribers it's really some 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.689
 huge thing so thank you all it's 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.769
 really, that's it's exceptional we're going 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.780
 say that like that because there is no 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.690
 other words I think use for 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.730
 describe that so here is this video 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.129
 I will talk a little bit about everything and 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.129
 nothing of what will happen in the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.260
 future and that's maybe we'll see so 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.430
 that's good then this gameplay is the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.719
 last gameplay that I had left in 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.329
 reserve on my pc 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.739
 yesterday the facts 1 where we were doing 77 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.530
 lille for three dead as by chance 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.870
 I remove them when story time 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.399
 so here I have no other 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.539
 gameplay it will not be a 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.790
 exceptional gameplay but it's a 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.439
 gameplay that I think he can still 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.119
 to please you even if it will not be 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.920
 more important in this video it will be 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.990
 really the comments harry who will be the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.409
 more important in this video everything 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.060
 simply 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.340
 so here you have to know that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.290
 this is the third time I do this again 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.729
 comment is then why so the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.229
 first time I was in conversation 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.680
 skype and I see that there have been small 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.540
 mention down in bad skai so 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.579
 here you have an interaction then 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.710
 it made me lose the thread of my 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.750
 ideas so I started my 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.340
 comment and then after 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.690
 I was still in the hollow but in 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.850
 did anyone who was talking 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.770
 I did not think about removing the sound from the 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.690
 conversation there is a person in 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.850
 particular that has encrusted etc etc to 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.300
 start by giving to tell his life and 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.570
 plays I'm saving what she said because 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.100
 do not want you to be 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.880
 informed that simply not to 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.490
 you talk about it 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.869
 forget it just better 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.030
 for you and for me also to 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.100
 page hurts me so here you go 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.590
 so good why I have not been 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.670
 present during these two weeks all 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.679
 just because I was in 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.590
 skype conversation with lots of 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.880
 people I love and who I typed 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.610
 good delusions if we can put it that 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.970
 so that I quoted the names for those who 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.410
 do not know like that so it's okay 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.400
 a little bit and that throw sfr all 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.500
 just good man so I was with 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.090
 ronan gotha's brother pledge for that 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.370
 I knew everything in our name too 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.860
 which is carbon so here I was 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.980
 still regularly with him said of there 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.420
 go to uci and rose and also time 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.909
 in time king my friend that I know 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.659
 for four years now 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.220
 here I think that knew him too 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.810
 just so here I was in 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.489
 course with these people there was typing of 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.500
 good times we laughed a lot was 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.909
 watched as the flour was 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.700
 supported renan who was precisely 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.730
 seek to end forgiveness if I do not 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.340
 do not deceive a top 5 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.480
 yeah that's it top-5 autopsy breast 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.319
 206 short here you've seen a little the 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.700
 delirium 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.859
 and so here we have looked at the shape a 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.209
 together on sky to keep a small 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.019
 little streaming that was available 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.319
 on Youtube 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.329
 and after that we do not have to mess with 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.989
 skype conversation et cetera et cetera 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.730
 so the rate went fast and I had 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.370
 no longer want to play call of so more 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.930
 want to make videos etc and I 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.290
 had a good time on Skype at the 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.730
 square 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.750
 and besides, it does not bother me at all 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.170
 if it was again I would do it again without 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.220
 worry so that's all the same then I 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.389
 make a small dedication to all 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.010
 people who were in the con so 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.060
 there was pink he told me yes 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.150
 king 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.799
 ronan and lÃ©a the elected if i think i have 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.239
 also says but I'm patient brief no 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.500
 dedication to all these people there because 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.150
 that I was typed good delirium all 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.439
 simply and that they also asked 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.120
 even if I were going to do it are 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:46.000
 currently still just that's it 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.349
 so I also wanted you all 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.400
 thank for and 25 and then the 26 thousand 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.859
 subscribers but especially for something else 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.959
 who are we going to say a little bit my purpose 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.840
 on youtube that came true what is it 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.609
 and well in fact it is that my trip age 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.129
 that I did in the company of rituals and 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.629
 impact has exceeded 20 thousand views on my 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.489
 chain now so if you 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.609
 do not know abdicated at the top right 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.949
 simply and so that's it's a 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:11.169
 18-minute montage where we put our 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:12.850
 best triple quad clips and so on 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:15.760
 with the sniper and 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.310
 the weapons simply it's really 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.450
 ripped prostreet age and that's actually 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.400
 when i started youtube 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.890
 I watched disassembly and I started 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.480
 thanks to a montage that is gla one that has 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.000
 been made by patou so I think that 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.350
 maybe you know and everything 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.460
 I just thought one day 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.770
 I want to make a montage and who 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.630
 be you - as it should be and after that 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.430
 I have passed my goal on youtube and 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.500
 so that's my goal for me on youtube 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.690
 and arrived there so I 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.710
 succeeded finally that I had it did he 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.820
 will actually begin youtube 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.960
 So here it is for me it's a big thing 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.070
 you are too much for some people 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.540
 at all because I know that 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.990
 montages that according to him 600 thousand times 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.030
 etc. 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.980
 but for me this is twenty thousand seen it's 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.600
 still huge for me all 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.900
 simply 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.010
 so here is a big thank you to all of you and 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.800
 here I am counting maybe doing a 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.690
 editing soon in the company of 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.180
 reto 6,2 euros indus attach surely 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.180
 so we'll see that simply 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.070
 so what can I tell you 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.130
 press to talk we'll talk about 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.600
 gameplay all at once great so that's it 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.330
 I talked about the flour that I go to 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.890
 streaming etc and so watching 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.620
 streaming it really made me want 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.390
 to get into the dice some because 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.790
 that here you look so see me 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.690
 you 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.190
 fucking the atmosphere is crazy and everything so 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.350
 we really want to go and 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.650
 honestly I really throw myself 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.240
 in castles thoroughly I'm going to put 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.890
 really all the chances on my side 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.330
 so be on adour a week without 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.990
 video I do not think so but I will try 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.150
 to make a video a week but 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.250
 I'm really trying to train with 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.500
 already two players who sports that will 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.510
 ex officio in my team who plays yen 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.550
 that here you must know him 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.130
 it's been four years since I know him and 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.680
 pepper who can as I call where we 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.150
 is already three in the team super that 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.560
 like that we know is good assistant 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.750
 decerto together we've already played against 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.100
 top fr etc 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:10.970
 good it was on ps3 by cons we have 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.500
 played so short I accelerate a little bit 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.850
 because I do not think it's super 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.470
 interesting especially that it's not 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.990
 a lot he just with so 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.210
 Here then we have played against top en 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.950
 and so here I think we lost 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.120
 but we won some maps and everything 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.950
 So I find it still had to be 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:29.330
 maybe a potential to maybe 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.340
 exploit so we will really try 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.180
 do the maximum and give it all 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.400
 the possible chances 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.990
 we may go far on a day that 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.320
 know but that's still in very 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.060
 long time 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.500
 but if that does not mean a lot 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.750
 in a very long time but in a long time 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.550
 maybe there will be something on 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:47.240
 do not know we'll see well and so I 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:50.870
 would stay tuned to see how 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:53.660
 it's happening and so it's happening 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.460
 although activate it grows well of 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.080
 this miser because we are served in 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.760
 dessert toppan we will see excuse me 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.830

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.270
 it's 4 4 it's in different 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.490
 modes of games that are there so it was 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.170
 the quest for flags the strategic pro 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.600
 and the search and destruction 

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.950
 so if and frankly we get to have 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.500
 a good team and that we are 30 well 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.210
