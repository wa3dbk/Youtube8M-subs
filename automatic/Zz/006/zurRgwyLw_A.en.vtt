00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.710 
like I saved it to where my documents
and<00:02:08.660> it<00:02:09.660> should<00:02:10.050> be<00:02:10.229> really<00:02:10.590> far<00:02:10.979> down<00:02:11.009> here

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
and it should be really far down here

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.940 
and it should be really far down here
like<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:13.440> wouldn't<00:02:13.770> be<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.670> way<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.360> WMV<00:02:16.080> but

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
like it wouldn't be in a way a WMV but

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.680 
like it wouldn't be in a way a WMV but
like<00:02:17.640> I'm<00:02:17.850> just<00:02:17.970> going<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.240> use<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.420> as<00:02:18.570> an

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
like I'm just going to use this as an

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.720 
like I'm just going to use this as an
example<00:02:18.780> like<00:02:19.320> just<00:02:19.590> pretend<00:02:19.920> like<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.550> is

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
example like just pretend like this is

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.810 
example like just pretend like this is
an<00:02:20.910> MPEG<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.470> when<00:02:23.250> it's<00:02:23.400> done<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.790> will

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
an MPEG so when it's done it will

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.360 
an MPEG so when it's done it will
convert<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:25.410> put<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.920> output

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
convert it to and put it in the output

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.920 
convert it to and put it in the output
file<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:26.880> put<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.270> it<00:02:27.750> would<00:02:27.870> be

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
file that you put it in it would be

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.490 
file that you put it in it would be
under<00:02:28.140> MPEG<00:02:28.920> all<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.700> have<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.880> do<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.120> click

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
under MPEG all you have to do is click

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.870 
under MPEG all you have to do is click
obviously<00:02:31.500> what<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.430> have<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.700> have<00:02:32.790> your

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
obviously what you have to have your

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
have raw box and saw it's the same thing

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.330 
have raw box and saw it's the same thing
you<00:02:57.930> just<00:02:57.959> open<00:02:58.470> up<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:58.860> have<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.160> make<00:02:59.310> a

you just open up and you have to make a

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.479 
you just open up and you have to make a
videos<00:02:59.880> file<00:03:00.270> which<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:00.870> mines<00:03:01.530> right<00:03:01.709> here<00:03:01.980> it

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
videos file which is mines right here it

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:03.920 
videos file which is mines right here it
doesn't<00:03:02.820> matter<00:03:02.970> where<00:03:03.239> it<00:03:03.330> is<00:03:03.390> because<00:03:03.630> when

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
doesn't matter where it is because when

doesn't matter where it is because when
you<00:03:04.050> open<00:03:04.320> up<00:03:04.380> rockbox<00:03:04.890> still<00:03:05.130> have<00:03:05.340> video

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
you open up rockbox still have video

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.009 
you open up rockbox still have video
files<00:03:05.940> um<00:03:07.040> these<00:03:08.040> are<00:03:08.220> all<00:03:08.250> mpegs<00:03:09.239> which<00:03:09.720> can

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
files um these are all mpegs which can

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.020 
files um these are all mpegs which can
play<00:03:10.230> on<00:03:10.290> your<00:03:10.410> nano<00:03:10.680> once<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.459> have<00:03:11.550> rockbox

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
play on your nano once you have rockbox

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.080 
play on your nano once you have rockbox
down<00:03:12.269> um<00:03:12.890> then<00:03:13.890> all<00:03:14.130> you<00:03:14.160> have<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.519> do<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:14.850> like

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
down um then all you have to do is like

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.229 
down um then all you have to do is like
let's<00:03:15.720> just<00:03:15.989> say<00:03:16.110> this<00:03:16.320> was<00:03:16.530> an<00:03:16.709> MPEG<00:03:17.459> all<00:03:18.120> you

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
let's just say this was an MPEG all you

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.610 
let's just say this was an MPEG all you
have<00:03:18.360> to<00:03:18.510> do<00:03:18.660> is<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:19.050> get<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.410> off<00:03:19.590> your

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
have to do is you get it off your

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.190 
have to do is you get it off your
desktop<00:03:20.220> or<00:03:20.430> my<00:03:20.880> in<00:03:21.180> case<00:03:21.450> in<00:03:21.690> this<00:03:21.810> case<00:03:22.019> my

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
desktop or my in case in this case my

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.259 
desktop or my in case in this case my
documents<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:23.340> would<00:03:23.489> let<00:03:23.670> go<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.060> drag

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
documents and you would let go and drag

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.170 
documents and you would let go and drag
it<00:03:24.420> here<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.870> then<00:03:25.830> it<00:03:26.130> would<00:03:26.340> start<00:03:26.610> like

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
it here and then it would start like

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.350 
it here and then it would start like
here<00:03:27.630> I'll<00:03:27.900> do<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.320> but<00:03:28.500> I<00:03:28.560> won't<00:03:28.769> do<00:03:28.920> anything

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
when you do it it will start like

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.300 
when you do it it will start like
