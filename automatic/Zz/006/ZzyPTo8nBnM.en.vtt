that<00:00:58.679> I<00:00:58.829> could<00:00:59.190> noticeably<00:00:59.699> tell<00:00:59.969> what<00:01:00.239> I

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
that I could noticeably tell what I

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.539 
that I could noticeably tell what I
think<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.749> happening<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:01.469> got<00:01:01.679> to<00:01:01.769> be<00:01:01.859> timing

condenser<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.869> believe<00:01:13.289> is<00:01:13.530> good<00:01:13.799> we're

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
condenser I believe is good we're

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.389 
condenser I believe is good we're
getting<00:01:14.100> strong<00:01:14.520> spark<00:01:14.969> on<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:17.070> point

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
getting strong spark on it the point

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:24.380 
getting strong spark on it the point
here<00:01:20.359> you<00:01:21.359> see<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.469> rod<00:01:22.649> comes<00:01:23.130> out<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.329> I

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
here you see the rod comes out so I

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.859 
here you see the rod comes out so I
believe<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.649> writing<00:01:26.579> it's<00:01:26.850> off<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.630> cam

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
believe this is writing it's off the cam

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.090 
believe this is writing it's off the cam
for<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> timing<00:01:33.109> some<00:01:34.109> of<00:01:34.259> these<00:01:34.380> units<00:01:34.950> in

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
for the timing some of these units in

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.669 
for the timing some of these units in
this<00:01:35.219> era<00:01:35.609> had<00:01:36.030> multiple<00:01:36.600> mounting<00:01:36.810> points

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
this era had multiple mounting points

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.639 
this era had multiple mounting points
for<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.100> coil<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.600> adjust<00:01:39.960> timing<00:01:40.409> if<00:01:40.530> you

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
for the coil to adjust timing if you

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.980 
for the coil to adjust timing if you
were<00:01:40.770> running<00:01:41.070> them<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.310> propane<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.210> don't

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
were running them on propane I don't

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.880 
were running them on propane I don't
think<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:44.130> does<00:01:45.259> looking<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.439> there<00:01:46.679> I

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
think this one does looking in there I

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.289 
think this one does looking in there I
don't<00:01:47.039> think<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.729> does<00:01:48.170> looking<00:01:49.170> down<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:50.299> here

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
don't think it does looking down in here

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.830 
don't think it does looking down in here
I<00:01:51.659> haven't<00:01:52.109> seen<00:01:52.289> one<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.310> did<00:01:53.579> have<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.030> to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
I haven't seen one that did have it to

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.039 
I haven't seen one that did have it to
compare<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.619> guess<00:01:56.039> but<00:01:56.600> from<00:01:57.600> what<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.749> can<00:01:57.869> tell

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
compare I guess but from what I can tell

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.190 
compare I guess but from what I can tell
no<00:01:58.679> it's<00:01:59.719> not<00:02:00.719> set<00:02:01.140> up<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.590> that

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
no it's not set up like that

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.999 
no it's not set up like that
hmm<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:05.480> next<00:02:06.480> thing<00:02:06.690> there<00:02:07.080> like<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.680> said<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
hmm so next thing there like I said the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.460 
hmm so next thing there like I said the
timing<00:02:08.250> marks<00:02:08.670> there's<00:02:08.850> a<00:02:08.910> arrow<00:02:09.450> if<00:02:10.140> we<00:02:10.290> can

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
timing marks there's a arrow if we can

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.550 
timing marks there's a arrow if we can
see<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.890> right<00:02:11.190> here<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:12.090> my<00:02:12.150> finger<00:02:13.140> there<00:02:13.380> on

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
see it right here in my finger there on

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.750 
see it right here in my finger there on
the<00:02:13.950> bracket<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.460> holds<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:15.030> coil<00:02:15.680> just

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
the bracket that holds the coil just

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.670 
the bracket that holds the coil just
timing<00:02:17.760> there<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.480> then<00:02:18.630> obviously<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:19.440> one

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
timing there and then obviously this one

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.680 
timing there and then obviously this one
here<00:02:19.950> right<00:02:19.980> on<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.790> magnet<00:02:21.240> on<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.390> flat

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
here right on the magnet on the flat

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.890 
here right on the magnet on the flat
wheel<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:22.200> go<00:02:22.830> up<00:02:22.950> on<00:02:23.160> top<00:02:23.460> here<00:02:25.010> looking<00:02:26.010> across

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
wheel I go up on top here looking across

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.040 
wheel I go up on top here looking across
go<00:02:27.900> backwards<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.770> can<00:02:28.950> see<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:30.050> intake

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
go backwards you can see the intake

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.000 
go backwards you can see the intake
intakes<00:02:32.040> opening<00:02:32.870> okay<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.260> go<00:02:34.440> clockwise

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
intakes opening okay and I go clockwise

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.510 
intakes opening okay and I go clockwise
the<00:02:35.670> way<00:02:35.820> it<00:02:35.970> normally<00:02:36.150> runs<00:02:37.220> Pistons<00:02:38.220> top

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520

right<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:43.170> center<00:02:43.770> there<00:02:44.450> right<00:02:45.450> where

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
right in the center there right where

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.820 
right in the center there right where
they're<00:02:46.160> right<00:02:47.160> about<00:02:48.170> even<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.350> think<00:02:49.590> is

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
they're right about even I think is

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.790 
they're right about even I think is
there<00:02:50.450> which<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.480> interesting<00:02:52.320> because<00:02:52.470> it

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
there which is interesting because it

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.460 
there which is interesting because it
looks<00:02:53.130> like<00:02:53.490> they're<00:02:54.120> both<00:02:54.150> open<00:02:55.140> for<00:02:55.440> a

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
looks like they're both open for a

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.240 
looks like they're both open for a
fraction<00:02:55.709> of<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.280> second<00:02:57.080> looking<00:02:58.080> over<00:02:58.410> here

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:12.250 

no<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.280> can<00:03:02.959> get<00:03:03.959> this<00:03:04.290> or<00:03:04.590> not<00:03:05.209> but

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.030 

trying<00:03:13.099> to<00:03:13.310> get<00:03:13.520> right<00:03:13.790> where<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:15.040> right

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
trying to get right where the right

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.890 
trying to get right where the right
there<00:03:16.340> right<00:03:16.790> there's<00:03:17.090> where<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.390> points

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
there right there's where the points

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.740 
there right there's where the points
close<00:03:18.760> I'm<00:03:19.760> going<00:03:20.030> clockwise<00:03:20.629> it<00:03:21.230> closes

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
close I'm going clockwise it closes

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.960 
close I'm going clockwise it closes
right<00:03:23.750> there<00:03:24.019> it's<00:03:24.170> opening<00:03:24.709> right<00:03:25.280> there

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
right there it's opening right there

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:34.860 
right there it's opening right there
okay<00:03:26.780> so<00:03:29.440> if<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:30.560> look<00:03:30.830> it<00:03:31.099> up<00:03:31.370> here

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.229 

timing<00:03:35.870> mark<00:03:36.110> is<00:03:36.319> on

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
timing mark is on

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.610 
timing mark is on
they're<00:03:38.239> both<00:03:38.450> closed<00:03:41.019> but<00:03:42.019> I<00:03:42.080> think<00:03:42.349> it's<00:03:42.530> a

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
they're both closed but I think it's a

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.940 
they're both closed but I think it's a
hundred<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.099> eighty<00:03:43.220> off<00:03:44.260> right<00:03:45.700> see<00:03:47.950> we're

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
hundred and eighty off right see we're

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.280 
hundred and eighty off right see we're
not<00:03:49.099> opening<00:03:49.580> and<00:03:49.790> closing<00:03:50.360> around<00:03:50.630> there

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
not opening and closing around there

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:58.089 
not opening and closing around there
I<00:03:51.319> think<00:03:51.950> it's<00:03:52.099> 180<00:03:52.670> off<00:03:55.480> it<00:03:56.480> should<00:03:56.780> be<00:03:57.099> all

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
I think it's 180 off it should be all

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:05.890 
I think it's 180 off it should be all
the<00:03:58.160> way<00:03:58.610> around<00:03:59.120> and<00:04:00.519> then<00:04:03.069> right<00:04:04.069> here<00:04:04.900> is

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
the way around and then right here is

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.520 
the way around and then right here is
where<00:04:06.140> it<00:04:06.230> should<00:04:06.470> be<00:04:06.590> opening<00:04:07.040> and<00:04:07.250> closing

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
where it should be opening and closing

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.110 
where it should be opening and closing
okay<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:11.769> there's<00:04:12.769> no<00:04:13.010> opening<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:13.640> closing

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
okay and there's no opening and closing

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.170 
okay and there's no opening and closing
going<00:04:14.450> on<00:04:14.709> on<00:04:15.709> our<00:04:15.769> point<00:04:16.690> okay<00:04:17.859> so<00:04:18.859> I<00:04:19.190> believe

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
going on on our point okay so I believe

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.070 
going on on our point okay so I believe
our<00:04:20.510> timings<00:04:20.989> 180<00:04:21.769> off
