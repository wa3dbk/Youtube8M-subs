 If so, you want to become a game designer 

00:00:09.026 --> 00:00:10.120
 If so, you want to become a game designer 

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:13.800
 Every week they ask us 

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:17.012
 What skills do I need to become a game designer? This is a very complex question 

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:19.087
 Question James had to wrestle him professionally and educationally 

00:00:19.088 --> 00:00:23.002
 Question James had to wrestle him professionally and educationally 

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.048
 But this week we will try to give you the best answer we thought 

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:25.951
 if 

00:00:26.051 --> 00:00:30.074
 What should you learn to become a game designer? are you ready? 

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:33.147
 Everything. Oh really. Game design is an art-making experiment 

00:00:34.047 --> 00:00:37.068
 You will find yourself using everything you have 

00:00:37.068 --> 00:00:39.154
 For a great game designer, there is no useless knowledge. 

00:00:39.254 --> 00:00:42.588
 But not all of us have the time to learn all that has been and will be 

00:00:42.688 --> 00:00:44.309
 Before you begin experiment design, then 

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:47.108
 What should we focus on? 

00:00:47.508 --> 00:00:49.055
 First, you can start with the most skillful game designers 

00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:52.133
 Art of Communication. As you begin to build games 

00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:54.111
 Most of you will see that he needs to deal with teams of different disciplines 

00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:58.028
 Teams of people with very different skills and backgrounds about you. 

00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:02.000
 If you are working on electronic games, you must work with: artists, programmers, designers you 

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:05.850
 Directors, sound specialists, marketers and businessmen. 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.005
 If you can not tell the experience you are trying to design for each of these groups, 

00:01:09.093 --> 00:01:11.182
 The quality of your ideas will not matter, because these are the people who 

00:01:12.082 --> 00:01:14.160
 They translate these ideas to reach the world. 

00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:18.041
 The hard thing here is that these people differ greatly from each other! 

00:01:18.095 --> 00:01:20.096
 I know this is a terrible generalization, but I will say it anyway: 

00:01:20.096 --> 00:01:24.096
 Artists and programmers have completely contradictory ways to solve problems. 

00:01:25.088 --> 00:01:28.090
 It is your job to make both these people share the same vision. 

00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:32.009
 Which brings us to the next point, this is very important: 

00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:36.070
 The game designer is not like a director, your job is not to be a dictator 

00:01:36.072 --> 00:01:39.077
 People are forced to apply your genius ideas. 

00:01:40.022 --> 00:01:41.069
 Everyone who touches the game affects their design, 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.124
 Even if you do not plan them. When your programmer writes a physics system, 

00:01:45.024 --> 00:01:48.065
 The decisions they make will affect the design of the game. 

00:01:48.065 --> 00:01:51.071
 Anyone who thinks that the game designer is the one who decides what the game will be 

00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:54.115
 He must be free of this illusion before he can excel in this work 

00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:58.018
 For misconceptions, here is an important tip 

00:01:58.036 --> 00:02:01.007
 Designing games is not about creating wonderful stories 

00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:04.026
 Or thinking of new ideas for games. Because ideas are cheap. 

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:08.298
 Even the novice designers of you probably can think of five or six ideas now 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.030
 Even if you do not want to enter the game design, 

00:02:10.053 --> 00:02:13.036
 Probably thought about an idea or two over the years. 

00:02:13.036 --> 00:02:16.092
 I know, I'll be a terrible designer, but even I can think of two or three thoughts. 

00:02:16.092 --> 00:02:19.097
 Not only are our games ideas cheap but also meaningless. 

00:02:20.042 --> 00:02:23.008
 At the end of the day the most sold game is a game about 

00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:24.906
 Italian style refined and hallucinogenic materials. 

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:28.084
 One of the most rewarding gaming ideas in recent years is 

00:02:28.084 --> 00:02:33.118
 Straighten the perspective of the first person, Ann Rand, underwater, and go! 

00:02:34.018 --> 00:02:37.157
 Real gaming design work very tired. Development of systems, standards and levels. 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.041
 Thoughts are good but if that's what you want to do, if it's better for you to find another room. 

00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:44.106
 There is no place in the studio for a professional "ideas" man. 

00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:49.405
 Every studio is full of people with ideas. Everyone who works there has a lot of ideas. 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.070
 Great ideas of course! What studios are looking for are people who can turn these ideas into reality. 

00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:56.136
 Another important thing that every game designer must learn at some point 

00:02:57.036 --> 00:03:01.038
 You are the worst referee on your game, especially at the beginning when 

00:03:01.038 --> 00:03:04.079
 You can justify defects. It's easy to fall into the trap that says 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.148
 People do not understand the game just because they did not see the final product. 

00:03:07.048 --> 00:03:11.387
 This is often not true. Introspection and ability to take criticism 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.883
 Important skills for game designers. Do not touch your thoughts too much. 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.095
 Because you will always be wrong. There was never a great game 

00:03:18.095 --> 00:03:22.097
 I came out of the game designer's head and it's complete. Games need players. 

00:03:22.097 --> 00:03:25.726
 The players themselves are designing half of their experience. 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.016
 The ability to admit that your idea did not work 

00:03:28.016 --> 00:03:31.005
 And give up the idea that you love too much because it does not work 

00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:35.044
 Trying to do something else is the most important feature of a great gaming designer. 

00:03:35.075 --> 00:03:39.594
 After that, the design of the games needs a lot of training. Just because you played a lot of games 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.087
 Or a lot of specific game, does not mean you are ready to design games. 

00:03:43.087 --> 00:03:47.093
 At times designers do not play games, but study and analyze them. 

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:51.094
 They deconstruct their systems and test their critical points to discover the designer 

00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:53.064
 Where all the excitement exists 

00:03:53.064 --> 00:03:56.493
 And tries to find out why. Reverse geometry will be used in the mathematics behind the important systems. 

00:03:57.092 --> 00:04:00.123
 Designers are interested in what makes the game boring and enjoyable. 

00:04:01.023 --> 00:04:06.032
 Also, the designer must understand the cost behind the decisions he makes. 

00:04:06.055 --> 00:04:08.824
 Whenever you decide something as a designer, what you really do, 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.054
 Is that you ask people to do. 

00:04:10.054 --> 00:04:14.928
 This work represents time and money, and you have a certain amount of it for your project. 

00:04:15.053 --> 00:04:18.056
 Your job as a designer is to ensure the most benefit for your money. 

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:22.028
 I know this does not seem important but trust me, 

00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:24.917
 This is the main reason for the failure of the games. 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.044
 From the giants of the AAA to the little amateur. 

00:04:28.044 --> 00:04:31.083
 Games fail because the team can not achieve them 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.009
 More than any other reason. 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.023
 As a related point, there is no game that has ever been completed. 

00:04:36.023 --> 00:04:39.034
 During the process of collecting your game, 

00:04:39.034 --> 00:04:41.119
 I assure you that you will find things that you have to do in a different way. 

00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:44.021
 And you discover many amazing things you can do. 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.043
 Store these ideas away, 

00:04:47.045 --> 00:04:48.052
 Or at least understand how expensive it is 

00:04:49.033 --> 00:04:51.112
 Increase the scope of your game in the middle. 

00:04:51.512 --> 00:04:56.075
 Remember that you have to launch the game at some point. You can not work on the game forever, and you have not made a game 

00:04:56.075 --> 00:04:57.081
 Unless there are people playing it. 

00:04:57.081 --> 00:05:00.154
 Above all these things, here is a list of practical skills you will need 

00:05:01.054 --> 00:05:02.057
 As a game designer. 

00:05:02.057 --> 00:05:06.096
 First, high ability in technical writing. Writing technique, not creative. 

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:12.000
 I am talking about expressions, spelling and punctuation. I'm sure this is not a problem for most of you, but ... 

00:05:12.088 --> 00:05:15.102
 As I said we read your e-mails. 

00:05:15.502 --> 00:05:19.086
 Second, basic knowledge in logic. Third, some of the rules of psychology. 

00:05:19.086 --> 00:05:22.172
 Fourth, understand the environment in which you work. 

00:05:22.272 --> 00:05:27.121
 I will build electronic games. So learning the basics of computer work is a good idea. 

00:05:28.021 --> 00:05:31.118
 Fifth, an excellent understanding of mathematics or at least advanced algebra. 

00:05:31.218 --> 00:05:33.024
 These skills will prepare you to become a good game designer. 

00:05:33.078 --> 00:05:36.131
 Now if you want to become an excellent game designer, you will also need to: 

00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:40.035
 First, comprehensive knowledge of literature, philosophy and mythology. 

00:05:40.071 --> 00:05:43.146
 Second, understanding the world's religions. 

00:05:44.046 --> 00:05:47.068
 Thirdly, an initial programming capability. 

00:05:47.068 --> 00:05:50.074
 Fourth, understanding the principles of art. You do not need to be a great artist though 

00:05:51.028 --> 00:05:52.065
 You need to understand art. 

00:05:52.065 --> 00:05:55.089
 If you can paint or work a plastic art in Photoshop this is better. 

00:05:56.049 --> 00:06:00.091
 Fifth, understanding the fundamentals of sound design and the principles of music. 

00:06:00.091 --> 00:06:03.350
 If you have not done yet, learn about a musical instrument, it is useful for the soul anyway. 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.029
 Sixth, practical knowledge of graphic design. 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:10.106
 Seventh, a complete library of games for reference. 

00:06:11.006 --> 00:06:14.032
 Here playing a lot of games will help you. The more games and modes of play you have tested 

00:06:14.032 --> 00:06:16.056
 The more you can take it. 

00:06:16.056 --> 00:06:20.155
 But the most thing you will need is life experiences. As a designer you create experiences. 

00:06:21.064 --> 00:06:25.098
 You can not do this without having some of them. Find out all about games and anime 

00:06:25.098 --> 00:06:28.156
 The Star Wars will not work. Go and live. 

00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:32.065
 A well thought out and balanced life will make you a great designer. 

00:06:33.046 --> 00:06:36.059
 Another and clearest things: make games! 

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:39.090
 If you're not sure where to start, you can start playing cards. 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.100
 Or objects you can make using pieces. 

00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:46.074
 Or if you insist on starting with an online game, we recommend Game Maker for Windows owners 

00:06:47.003 --> 00:06:49.642
 Or Game Salad. 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.681
 Both are free and you can start with them easily. And computer logic also teaches you. 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:55.858
 It is expected that you have an advance background in programming. 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:01.000
 be brave. Be bold. Make. 

00:07:01.012 --> 00:07:05.000
 He brought us new experiences and helped expand the language of the games. Good luck! And see you next week.
