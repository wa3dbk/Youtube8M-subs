gonna<00:00:37.320> first<00:00:37.620> start<00:00:37.680> with<00:00:37.890> solution<00:00:38.309> one

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
gonna first start with solution one

gonna first start with solution one
we're<00:00:38.640> gonna<00:00:38.699> put<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.089> on<00:00:39.150> one<00:00:39.480> spot<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
we're gonna put it on one spot in the

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.900 
we're gonna put it on one spot in the
pool<00:00:40.290> I'm<00:00:40.830> gonna<00:00:41.010> put<00:00:41.160> half<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.339> packet<00:00:41.850> of

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
pool I'm gonna put half the packet of

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.060 
pool I'm gonna put half the packet of
this<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.300> one<00:00:42.449> spot<00:00:42.750> let<00:00:43.080> it<00:00:43.199> set<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:43.500> 30<00:00:43.530> or<00:00:43.800> 45

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
after we do the first one we're gonna

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.950 
after we do the first one we're gonna
use<00:00:49.710> one-third<00:00:50.159> of<00:00:50.400> the<00:00:50.670> solution<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.869> a

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
use one-third of the solution to on a

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.600 
use one-third of the solution to on a
spot<00:00:52.260> then<00:00:52.920> we're<00:00:53.010> gonna<00:00:53.100> brush<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.369> away

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
spot then we're gonna brush it away

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.149 
spot then we're gonna brush it away
we're<00:00:54.510> gonna<00:00:54.629> use<00:00:54.869> the<00:00:55.019> third<00:00:55.199> spot<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.070> we're

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
we're gonna use the third spot and we're

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:58.100 
we're gonna use the third spot and we're
gonna<00:00:56.250> use<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.610> o2<00:00:56.790> safe<00:00:57.360> shock<00:00:57.659> on<00:00:57.930> it

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
gonna use the o2 safe shock on it

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
top of that spot where you had put the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.039 
top of that spot where you had put the
o2<00:01:08.070> shock<00:01:08.520> leave<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.479> there<00:01:09.659> for<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> few

seconds<00:01:10.439> let's<00:01:10.560> see<00:01:10.650> if<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:11.100> removes<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
seconds let's see if it removes the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.810 
seconds let's see if it removes the

brush it away after 30 or 45 seconds and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.960 
brush it away after 30 or 45 seconds and
then<00:01:19.650> you're<00:01:19.770> gonna<00:01:19.890> pour<00:01:20.130> solution<00:01:20.640> 1<00:01:20.759> right

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
then you're gonna pour solution 1 right

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.510 
then you're gonna pour solution 1 right
over<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.420> but<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.050> set<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.440> 30<00:01:22.560> or<00:01:22.710> 45<00:01:22.950> seconds

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
over it but I set for 30 or 45 seconds

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.980 
over it but I set for 30 or 45 seconds
brush<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.940> away<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.360> see<00:01:24.510> how<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.690> stain

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
brush that away and see how the stain

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.170 
brush that away and see how the stain
looks<00:01:25.200> after<00:01:25.410> that<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.370> also<00:01:26.580> enhanced<00:01:27.060> your

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
looks after that it also enhanced your

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.940 
looks after that it also enhanced your
test<00:01:27.450> results<00:01:27.870> by<00:01:28.050> pouring<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.410> few<00:01:28.560> ounces<00:01:28.680> of

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
want to go ahead and pour 1/3 of the

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.100 
want to go ahead and pour 1/3 of the
packet<00:03:59.920> of<00:04:00.010> solution<00:04:00.520> to<00:04:00.550> over<00:04:01.000> that<00:04:01.150> spot<00:04:01.450> see

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
packet of solution to over that spot see

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.800 
packet of solution to over that spot see
if<00:04:02.200> it<00:04:02.260> has<00:04:02.350> any<00:04:02.530> effect<00:04:02.620> on<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.100> stain<00:04:03.810> right

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
if it has any effect on the stain right

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.080 
if it has any effect on the stain right
away

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.920 

definitely<00:04:12.090> doing<00:04:12.269> something<00:04:12.480> here<00:04:12.840> it's

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
definitely doing something here it's

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:20.449 
definitely doing something here it's
like<00:04:13.110> it's<00:04:13.290> bubbling<00:04:14.160> or<00:04:14.370> fizzing

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.069 

okay<00:04:21.060> in<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.180> last<00:04:21.209> test<00:04:21.630> we're<00:04:21.750> gonna<00:04:21.810> do<00:04:21.989> is

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
okay in the last test we're gonna do is

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.780 
okay in the last test we're gonna do is
we're<00:04:22.169> gonna<00:04:22.229> test<00:04:22.590> solution<00:04:23.070> one<00:04:23.280> and<00:04:23.550> two

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
we're gonna test solution one and two

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.360 
we're gonna test solution one and two
together<00:04:23.940> on<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.360> same<00:04:24.540> exact<00:04:25.110> spot<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.710> have<00:04:26.340> a

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
together on the same exact spot I have a

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.830 
together on the same exact spot I have a
spot<00:04:26.669> right<00:04:26.910> here<00:04:26.970> I'm<00:04:27.360> gonna<00:04:27.479> go<00:04:27.600> ahead<00:04:27.660> and

go through the spot here and I'm gonna
go<00:04:30.000> ahead<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.150> pour<00:04:30.360> solution<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:31.020> there<00:04:31.280> I'm

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
go ahead and pour solution to there I'm

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.980 
go ahead and pour solution to there I'm
gonna<00:04:32.400> step<00:04:32.669> there<00:04:32.850> again<00:04:33.120> then<00:04:33.630> after<00:04:33.870> that's

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
gonna step there again then after that's

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.090 
gonna step there again then after that's
then<00:04:34.199> I'm<00:04:34.289> gonna<00:04:34.380> go<00:04:34.530> ahead<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:34.740> brush<00:04:34.860> that

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
then I'm gonna go ahead and brush that

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.260 
then I'm gonna go ahead and brush that

away and I'm gonna go ahead and pour

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.909 
away and I'm gonna go ahead and pour
solution<00:04:36.690> one<00:04:36.840> right<00:04:36.990> on<00:04:37.110> that<00:04:37.259> spot<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:37.830> see

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
solution one right on that spot and see

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.159 
solution one right on that spot and see
which<00:04:38.039> one<00:04:38.220> work<00:04:38.370> better<00:04:41.900> tell<00:04:42.900> you<00:04:42.960> right<00:04:43.110> now

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
which one work better tell you right now

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.930 
which one work better tell you right now
just<00:04:43.500> by<00:04:43.590> looking<00:04:43.919> at<00:04:44.009> the<00:04:44.160> stain<00:04:44.430> that<00:04:44.759> some

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
just by looking at the stain that some

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.730 
just by looking at the stain that some
of<00:04:45.060> it<00:04:45.180> was<00:04:45.210> lifted<00:04:45.660> by<00:04:45.780> that<00:04:45.990> one<00:04:46.199> I'll<00:04:46.590> go

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
of it was lifted by that one I'll go

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.110 
of it was lifted by that one I'll go
ahead<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:46.979> finish<00:04:47.220> off<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.550> tip<00:04:49.850> so<00:04:50.850> solution

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
ahead and finish off the tip so solution

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.120 
ahead and finish off the tip so solution
one<00:04:51.419> the<00:04:51.509> iron<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:51.900> cobalt<00:04:52.080> spotting<00:04:52.919> stuff

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
one the iron and cobalt spotting stuff

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.370 
one the iron and cobalt spotting stuff
didn't<00:04:53.430> do<00:04:53.520> much<00:04:53.669> with<00:04:53.729> the<00:04:54.030> stain<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:55.080> copper

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
didn't do much with the stain the copper

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.689 
didn't do much with the stain the copper
and<00:04:55.500> scale<00:04:55.740> stuff<00:04:55.979> actually<00:04:56.340> took<00:04:56.460> a<00:04:56.550> lot<00:04:56.669> of

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
and scale stuff actually took a lot of

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.969 
and scale stuff actually took a lot of
the<00:04:56.850> staining<00:04:57.090> off<00:04:57.360> here<00:04:57.810> in<00:04:58.380> this<00:04:58.530> area<00:04:58.770> and

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
the staining off here in this area and

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.890 
the staining off here in this area and
actually<00:04:59.490> where<00:04:59.610> I<00:04:59.639> poured<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.270> initial

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
actually where I poured the initial

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.350 
actually where I poured the initial
sample<00:05:01.289> number<00:05:01.530> two<00:05:01.770> took<00:05:02.669> the<00:05:02.789> whole<00:05:02.940> spot

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
sample number two took the whole spot

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.050 
sample number two took the whole spot
off<00:05:03.539> right<00:05:03.810> there
