and<00:03:56.290> i<00:03:57.290> know<00:03:57.350> i'm<00:03:57.560> chelsea<00:03:58.190> gone<00:03:58.520> action<00:03:58.820> has<00:03:59.150> a

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
and i know i'm chelsea gone action has a

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.449 
and i know i'm chelsea gone action has a
V<00:03:59.420> on<00:03:59.510> how<00:03:59.630> to<00:03:59.690> tease<00:04:00.230> her<00:04:00.350> hair<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:00.800> she

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
V on how to tease her hair and she

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.820 
V on how to tease her hair and she
described<00:04:01.880> it<00:04:01.970> as<00:04:02.120> like<00:04:02.360> making<00:04:02.930> a<00:04:03.020> nest<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:03.590> I

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
described it as like making a nest and I

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.350 
described it as like making a nest and I
think<00:04:04.160> I<00:04:04.310> completely<00:04:04.790> agree<00:04:04.970> with<00:04:05.209> her

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
think I completely agree with her

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.640 
think I completely agree with her
because<00:04:05.510> it's<00:04:05.900> getting<00:04:06.200> really<00:04:06.350> tangled

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
because it's getting really tangled

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.710 
because it's getting really tangled
that's<00:04:07.490> like<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:07.940> whole<00:04:08.060> point<00:04:08.270> because<00:04:08.600> it

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
that's like the whole point because it

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.800 
that's like the whole point because it
makes<00:04:08.870> it<00:04:09.110> your<00:04:09.740> hair<00:04:09.950> vague<00:04:10.940> and<00:04:11.420> you're

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
makes it your hair vague and you're

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.100 
makes it your hair vague and you're
going<00:04:11.959> to<00:04:12.050> keep<00:04:12.200> going<00:04:12.410> up<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:12.830> down<00:04:13.930> from<00:04:14.930> the

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
going to keep going up and down from the

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.720 
going to keep going up and down from the
top<00:04:15.290> and<00:04:15.350> then<00:04:15.709> towards<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.130> bottom<00:04:16.370> it's

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730
