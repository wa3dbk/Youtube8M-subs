00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.770 
its toe issue it's only wednesday I
think<00:04:34.919> it's<00:04:35.010> asking<00:04:35.190> a<00:04:35.490> little<00:04:35.610> much<00:04:35.940> of<00:04:36.510> me<00:04:36.660> to

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
think it's asking a little much of me to

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.010 
think it's asking a little much of me to
make<00:04:36.960> a<00:04:36.990> bet<00:04:37.290> on<00:04:37.320> an<00:04:37.590> injured<00:04:37.950> guy<00:04:38.000> but<00:04:39.020> Starks

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
make a bet on an injured guy but Starks

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.930 
make a bet on an injured guy but Starks
he's<00:04:40.470> been<00:04:40.680> there<00:04:40.950> for<00:04:40.979> him<00:04:41.340> before<00:04:41.460> he<00:04:41.850> was

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
he's been there for him before he was

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.030 
he's been there for him before he was
decent<00:04:42.240> last<00:04:42.720> year<00:04:43.139> all<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.500> preseason

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
decent last year all the preseason

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.520 
decent last year all the preseason
reports<00:04:44.550> before<00:04:44.729> Starks<00:04:45.389> got<00:04:45.960> hurt<00:04:46.320> and

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
reports before Starks got hurt and

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.170 
reports before Starks got hurt and
before<00:04:46.860> Benson<00:04:47.070> Kingman<00:04:47.580> were<00:04:47.700> actually

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
before Benson Kingman were actually

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.540 
before Benson Kingman were actually
really<00:04:48.510> high<00:04:48.690> and<00:04:48.930> I<00:04:49.350> think<00:04:49.680> stark<00:04:50.070> spits<00:04:50.370> that

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
really high and I think stark spits that

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.219 
really high and I think stark spits that
offense<00:04:50.970> better<00:04:51.180> he's<00:04:51.510> not<00:04:51.750> a<00:04:51.780> boom-or-bust

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
offense better he's not a boom-or-bust

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.650 
offense better he's not a boom-or-bust
type<00:04:52.740> guy<00:04:53.010> he<00:04:53.550> can<00:04:53.729> be<00:04:53.820> a<00:04:53.850> steady<00:04:54.210> Eddie<00:04:54.419> guy<00:04:54.630> I

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
type guy he can be a steady Eddie guy I

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.640 
type guy he can be a steady Eddie guy I
don't<00:04:54.870> think<00:04:55.050> he's<00:04:55.139> gonna<00:04:55.260> do<00:04:55.410> anything

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
don't think he's gonna do anything

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.379 
don't think he's gonna do anything
amazing<00:04:56.040> but<00:04:56.430> I<00:04:56.490> think<00:04:56.729> he's<00:04:56.880> gonna<00:04:57.030> you<00:04:57.300> know

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
amazing but I think he's gonna you know

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:58.940 
amazing but I think he's gonna you know
averaged<00:04:57.720> over<00:04:57.870> three<00:04:58.139> yards<00:04:58.380> a<00:04:58.470> carry<00:04:58.620> he<00:04:58.830> can

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
averaged over three yards a carry he can

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.230 
averaged over three yards a carry he can
still<00:04:59.190> get<00:04:59.340> involved<00:04:59.669> in<00:04:59.729> the<00:04:59.790> passing<00:05:00.210> game

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
still get involved in the passing game

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.870 
still get involved in the passing game
some<00:05:00.630> Alex<00:05:01.530> Green<00:05:01.800> i<00:05:01.830> think<00:05:02.130> is<00:05:02.250> more<00:05:02.430> boom<00:05:02.700> or

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
some Alex Green i think is more boom or

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.700 
some Alex Green i think is more boom or
bust<00:05:03.030> i<00:05:03.240> think<00:05:03.389> he's<00:05:03.479> gonna<00:05:03.630> average<00:05:03.930> two

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
bust i think he's gonna average two

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.080 
bust i think he's gonna average two
yards<00:05:05.010> of<00:05:05.070> carrying<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:05.520> eventually<00:05:05.880> break

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
yards of carrying and eventually break

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.300 
yards of carrying and eventually break
one<00:05:06.300> like<00:05:06.510> you<00:05:06.630> did<00:05:06.810> last<00:05:06.840> week<00:05:07.380> I<00:05:07.620> think<00:05:08.160> he's

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
one like you did last week I think he's

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.279 
one like you did last week I think he's
too<00:05:08.490> little<00:05:08.669> back<00:05:09.000> to<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.389> point<00:05:09.750> he's

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
too little back to the point he's

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.379 
too little back to the point he's
probably<00:05:10.500> gonna<00:05:10.770> break<00:05:11.100> one<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.490> Packers<00:05:12.090> use

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
probably gonna break one the Packers use

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.020 
probably gonna break one the Packers use
the<00:05:12.630> run<00:05:12.870> to<00:05:13.500> set<00:05:13.710> up<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:13.950> past<00:05:14.190> so<00:05:14.729> they<00:05:14.880> get

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
the run to set up the past so they get

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.700 
the run to set up the past so they get
limited<00:05:15.389> touches<00:05:15.840> anyway<00:05:16.169> so<00:05:16.229> you're<00:05:16.590> gonna

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
limited touches anyway so you're gonna

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.159 
limited touches anyway so you're gonna
want<00:05:17.010> a<00:05:17.100> boom-or-bust<00:05:17.520> kind<00:05:18.030> of<00:05:18.180> guy<00:05:18.330> sure<00:05:18.990> I

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
want a boom-or-bust kind of guy sure I

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:20.600 
want a boom-or-bust kind of guy sure I
don't<00:05:19.350> think<00:05:19.410> starch<00:05:19.830> is<00:05:19.979> gonna<00:05:20.190> make<00:05:20.370> any

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
don't think starch is gonna make any

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.980 
don't think starch is gonna make any
huge<00:05:20.789> runs<00:05:21.090> he's<00:05:21.240> gonna<00:05:21.389> play<00:05:21.600> he's<00:05:21.780> not<00:05:21.840> gonna

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
huge runs he's gonna play he's not gonna

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.779 
huge runs he's gonna play he's not gonna

as<00:05:28.919> a<00:05:28.950> really<00:05:29.250> really<00:05:29.430> really<00:05:29.639> deep<00:05:29.970> sleeper

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
as a really really really deep sleeper

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.120 
as a really really really deep sleeper
coming<00:05:30.660> into<00:05:30.840> the<00:05:30.930> year<00:05:31.080> I<00:05:31.289> think<00:05:31.680> this<00:05:31.800> is<00:05:31.979> his

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
coming into the year I think this is his

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.740 
coming into the year I think this is his
opportunity<00:05:32.250> I<00:05:32.820> like<00:05:33.150> her<00:05:33.240> in<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:33.389> passing

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
opportunity I like her in the passing

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.600 
opportunity I like her in the passing
game<00:05:33.780> and<00:05:34.080> I<00:05:34.139> do<00:05:34.200> like<00:05:34.530> that<00:05:34.560> boom<00:05:34.889> or<00:05:35.070> bust<00:05:35.190> and

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
game and I do like that boom or bust and

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.710 
game and I do like that boom or bust and
I<00:05:35.669> think<00:05:35.850> that's<00:05:36.000> what<00:05:36.120> they<00:05:36.210> need<00:05:36.389> to<00:05:36.510> kind<00:05:36.690> of

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
I think that's what they need to kind of

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.010 
I think that's what they need to kind of
put<00:05:36.870> a<00:05:36.900> spark<00:05:37.260> to<00:05:37.289> that<00:05:37.470> offense<00:05:37.860> I<00:05:38.100> guess

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
put a spark to that offense I guess

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.379 
put a spark to that offense I guess
greens<00:05:40.020> gonna<00:05:40.139> win<00:05:40.410> a<00:05:40.650> lock<00:05:41.070> we'll<00:05:41.610> see<00:05:41.970> all
