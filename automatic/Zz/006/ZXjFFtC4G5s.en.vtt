because I think is here's a lot in here

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.020 
because I think is here's a lot in here
degrades<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.829> aside<00:00:44.100> loads<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> end<00:00:44.670> and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
degrades it aside loads in the end and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.639 
degrades it aside loads in the end and
so<00:00:45.210> with<00:00:45.450> wonton<00:00:45.870> skins<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.350> really<00:00:46.559> good
