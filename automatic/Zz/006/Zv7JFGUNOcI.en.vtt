00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
yeah I'm gonna make a real quick video

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.210 
yeah I'm gonna make a real quick video
here<00:00:02.360> somebody<00:00:03.500> had<00:00:04.500> some<00:00:04.770> concerns<00:00:05.250> over<00:00:07.220> the

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
here somebody had some concerns over the

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.150 
here somebody had some concerns over the
head<00:00:08.400> gasket<00:00:08.970> on<00:00:09.450> Volkswagen<00:00:10.230> on<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.620> type<00:00:10.920> 1

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
head gasket on Volkswagen on a type 1

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.209 
head gasket on Volkswagen on a type 1
there<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.550> not<00:00:11.820> one<00:00:12.170> there<00:00:13.170> isn't<00:00:13.530> one<00:00:13.650> that's

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
there is not one there isn't one that's

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.880 
there is not one there isn't one that's
better<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.719> head<00:00:15.900> that's<00:00:16.080> cut<00:00:16.260> for<00:00:16.440> 94

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
better this is a head that's cut for 94

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.060 
better this is a head that's cut for 94
as<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.160> can<00:00:17.279> see<00:00:17.400> it's<00:00:17.550> got<00:00:17.760> right<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
as you can see it's got right to you the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.960 
as you can see it's got right to you the
right<00:00:20.070> into<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.460> stud<00:00:20.699> holes<00:00:20.970> basically<00:00:22.970> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
right into the stud holes basically the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.580 
right into the stud holes basically the
head<00:00:24.150> seals<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.810> flat<00:00:24.990> part<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.410> head

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
head seals on the flat part of the head

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.320 
head seals on the flat part of the head
you<00:00:25.830> know<00:00:25.920> not<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.279> side<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.180> our

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
you know not the side so this is our

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.150 
you know not the side so this is our
sealing<00:00:27.689> surface<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.289> flat<00:00:28.500> surface<00:00:28.980> these

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
sealing surface the flat surface these

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.769 
sealing surface the flat surface these
have<00:00:29.310> been<00:00:29.429> machined<00:00:29.580> obviously<00:00:30.449> when<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
have been machined obviously when the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.540 
have been machined obviously when the
cylinder<00:00:31.019> when<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.859> was<00:00:31.949> machined<00:00:32.309> for<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
cylinder when it was machined for the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.240 
cylinder when it was machined for the
bigger<00:00:32.759> cylinder<00:00:33.239> they<00:00:33.390> cut<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.719> flat<00:00:33.989> also<00:00:34.260> on

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
bigger cylinder they cut it flat also on

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.200 
bigger cylinder they cut it flat also on
a<00:00:35.309> stock<00:00:35.760> head<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.180> would<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.980> Ledge<00:00:37.980> here

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
a stock head it would have a Ledge here

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.410 
a stock head it would have a Ledge here
step<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.559> can<00:00:40.559> show<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.100> more<00:00:41.850> more

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
step I can show you that more more

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.319 
step I can show you that more more
detailed<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.110> some<00:00:43.320> different<00:00:43.649> heads<00:00:44.329> but

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
detailed on some different heads but

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.090 
detailed on some different heads but
basically<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.960> metal<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.350> metal<00:00:46.500> surface

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
basically it's a metal to metal surface

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.010 
basically it's a metal to metal surface
and<00:00:47.280> that's<00:00:47.910> why<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.210> was<00:00:48.450> saying<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:48.840> so

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
and that's why I was saying it's so

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.479 
and that's why I was saying it's so
important<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.710> these<00:00:51.710> not<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.920> use<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.309> paper

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
important on these not to use the paper

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.600 
important on these not to use the paper
gasket<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.660> side<00:00:54.960> here<00:00:55.289> from<00:00:55.860> case<00:00:56.280> and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
gasket on this side here from case and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.220 
gasket on this side here from case and
cylinder<00:00:57.120> because<00:00:57.390> what<00:00:57.510> happens<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.020> that

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
cylinder because what happens is that

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.979 
cylinder because what happens is that
the<00:00:58.620> paper<00:00:59.190> gasket<00:00:59.460> gets<00:00:59.969> compromised<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
the paper gasket gets compromised and

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.349 
the paper gasket gets compromised and
even<00:01:01.980> being<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.250> half<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.640> thousands<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.329> know

even being a half a thousands you know

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.270 
even being a half a thousands you know
once<00:01:03.719> it's<00:01:03.930> gone<00:01:04.140> there's<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.920> space<00:01:05.250> between

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
once it's gone there's a space between

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.149 
once it's gone there's a space between
the<00:01:05.880> deck<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> cylinder<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.950> lets

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
the deck and the cylinder and it lets

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.149 
the deck and the cylinder and it lets
cylinder<00:01:08.670> start<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.060> pound<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:10.159> this

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
cylinder start to pound and this

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.070 
cylinder start to pound and this
cylinder<00:01:11.520> then<00:01:11.939> pounding<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.570> don't<00:01:12.750> know<00:01:12.900> if<00:01:12.990> I

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
cylinder then pounding I don't know if I

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.750 
cylinder then pounding I don't know if I
can<00:01:13.140> zoom<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.770> good<00:01:13.950> enough<00:01:14.070> for<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.580> see

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
can zoom in good enough for you to see

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.280 
can zoom in good enough for you to see
the<00:01:14.939> fatigue<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.570> metal<00:01:15.869> from<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> heat

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
the fatigue in the metal from the heat

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.249 
the fatigue in the metal from the heat
passing<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.159> if<00:01:18.119> we<00:01:18.299> look<00:01:18.479> right<00:01:18.659> here<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:19.080> can

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
passing but if we look right here we can

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.399 
passing but if we look right here we can
almost<00:01:19.409> see<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.630> machine<00:01:21.630> marks<00:01:21.900> are<00:01:22.170> still

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
almost see the machine marks are still

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.530 
almost see the machine marks are still
in<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.860> surface<00:01:23.580> at<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> top<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> barrel

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.120 
in the surface at the top of the barrel
and<00:01:24.750> as<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.990> get<00:01:25.140> over<00:01:25.350> here<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.890> see

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
and as you get over here you can see

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.190 
and as you get over here you can see
where<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.930> see<00:01:28.080> will<00:01:28.290> focus

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.130

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
it's not going to focus but you can see

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.899 
it's not going to focus but you can see
this<00:01:39.290> metals<00:01:39.650> been<00:01:39.830> compromised<00:01:40.400> it's<00:01:40.670> sort

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
this metals been compromised it's sort

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.060 
this metals been compromised it's sort
of<00:01:41.030> pitted<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:43.450> we<00:01:44.450> had<00:01:44.600> a<00:01:44.630> leak<00:01:44.900> here<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.409> it

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
of pitted and we had a leak here and it

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.530 
of pitted and we had a leak here and it
was<00:01:46.159> leaking<00:01:46.460> compression<00:01:47.000> over<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.300> top<00:01:47.510> of

was leaking compression over the top of
this<00:01:48.010> required<00:01:49.010> washing<00:01:49.369> that's<00:01:49.940> really

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
this required washing that's really

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.630 
this required washing that's really
common<00:01:50.479> on<00:01:50.690> a<00:01:50.720> Volkswagen<00:01:51.440> there's<00:01:52.250> a<00:01:52.400> couple

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
common on a Volkswagen there's a couple

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.100 
common on a Volkswagen there's a couple
things<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:53.060> can<00:01:53.090> do<00:01:53.330> with<00:01:53.479> these<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:53.840> know<00:01:53.960> we

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
things you can do with these you know we

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.800 
things you can do with these you know we
usually<00:01:54.560> when<00:01:55.160> we<00:01:55.280> talk<00:01:55.490> about<00:01:55.520> spacers<00:01:56.300> we're

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
usually when we talk about spacers we're

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.649 
usually when we talk about spacers we're
running<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.259> spacer<00:01:58.090> under<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.180> bottom<00:01:59.509> of

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
running the spacer under the bottom of

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.850 
running the spacer under the bottom of
the<00:01:59.750> cylinder<00:02:00.110> or<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.530> jug<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:02.860> these

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
the cylinder or the jug and these

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
cylinder upside down and these would go

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.660 
cylinder upside down and these would go
right<00:02:08.479> there<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:09.130> they<00:02:10.130> would<00:02:10.310> sit<00:02:10.520> on<00:02:10.550> the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
right there and they would sit on the

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.430 
right there and they would sit on the
the<00:02:11.209> deck<00:02:11.420> of<00:02:11.570> the<00:02:11.660> cylinder<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.230> hit<00:02:12.350> the

the deck of the cylinder and hit the
deck<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:12.860> case<00:02:13.070> and<00:02:13.430> this<00:02:14.269> would<00:02:14.450> move<00:02:14.900> the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
deck of the case and this would move the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.840 
deck of the case and this would move the
cylinder<00:02:15.440> out<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.769> give<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.040> your<00:02:16.610> deck

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
cylinder out and give you your deck

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.680 
cylinder out and give you your deck
height<00:02:17.739> now<00:02:18.739> they<00:02:18.980> do<00:02:19.040> have<00:02:19.250> copper<00:02:20.180> gaskets

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
height now they do have copper gaskets

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.949 
height now they do have copper gaskets
that<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.410> can<00:02:21.560> install<00:02:21.920> in<00:02:22.160> here<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.959> use

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
that you can install in here and use

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.690 
that you can install in here and use
them<00:02:24.200> on<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.410> racecars<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.310> super<00:02:25.580> high

compression race motors only because

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.090 
compression race motors only because
what<00:02:29.390> they<00:02:29.510> do<00:02:29.570> is<00:02:29.900> they<00:02:30.110> sort<00:02:30.290> of<00:02:30.470> make<00:02:31.070> a

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
what they do is they sort of make a

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.860 
what they do is they sort of make a
barrier<00:02:31.610> between<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:32.090> cylinder<00:02:32.480> head<00:02:32.690> and

barrier between the cylinder head and
the<00:02:32.930> barrel<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:33.590> when<00:02:33.800> you<00:02:33.890> do<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.430> dragon

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
the barrel so when you do the dragon

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.610 
the barrel so when you do the dragon
gets<00:02:35.120> loose<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.600> burns<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.080> copper<00:02:36.470> gasket

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
gets loose it burns the copper gasket

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.550 
gets loose it burns the copper gasket
and<00:02:37.070> not<00:02:37.220> your<00:02:37.370> part<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.900> only<00:02:38.930> problem<00:02:39.470> with

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
and not your part the only problem with

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.259 
and not your part the only problem with
running<00:02:39.829> the<00:02:39.860> copper<00:02:40.220> gasket<00:02:40.400> on<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.910> street

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
running the copper gasket on the street

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.430 
running the copper gasket on the street
is<00:02:41.480> is<00:02:41.780> that<00:02:41.989> it<00:02:42.110> requires<00:02:42.560> multiple<00:02:43.459> torquing

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
is is that it requires multiple torquing

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.400 
is is that it requires multiple torquing
the<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.890> copper<00:02:46.459> has<00:02:46.690> more<00:02:47.690> yield<00:02:47.989> than<00:02:48.260> the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
the the copper has more yield than the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.319 
the the copper has more yield than the
aluminum<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.190> steel<00:02:49.430> therefore<00:02:50.209> you

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
aluminum and the steel therefore you

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.860 
aluminum and the steel therefore you
have<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.570> constantly<00:02:50.989> retorque<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.769> head<00:02:52.870> on

have to constantly retorque the head on
a<00:02:53.930> racecar<00:02:54.620> that's<00:02:55.100> not<00:02:55.310> an<00:02:55.430> issue<00:02:55.549> because

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
a racecar that's not an issue because

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.410 
a racecar that's not an issue because
you<00:02:56.120> can<00:02:56.450> get<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.810> all<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.290> bolt<00:02:58.160> holes<00:02:58.459> but

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
you can get to all the bolt holes but

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.080 
you can get to all the bolt holes but

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
Clarke as two manufacturers there so

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.290 
Clarke as two manufacturers there so
they<00:04:05.510> use<00:04:05.690> that<00:04:05.930> material<00:04:06.100> and<00:04:07.300> they

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
they use that material and they

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.090 
they use that material and they
manufacture<00:04:08.930> all<00:04:09.080> the<00:04:09.200> head<00:04:09.350> gaskets<00:04:09.860> for<00:04:10.010> the

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
top fuel and alcohol cars so I hope that

and<00:04:16.330> our<00:04:17.330> 1600<00:04:18.230> we<00:04:18.350> actually<00:04:18.680> did<00:04:18.830> put<00:04:19.010> a<00:04:19.070> shim

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
and our 1600 we actually did put a shim

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.780 
and our 1600 we actually did put a shim
in<00:04:19.459> there<00:04:19.609> we<00:04:19.760> have<00:04:19.880> a<00:04:19.910> steel<00:04:20.209> shim<00:04:20.540> and<00:04:21.790> this

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
in there we have a steel shim and this

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.790 
in there we have a steel shim and this

called<00:04:25.010> a<00:04:25.070> decompression<00:04:25.610> shim<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.240> it's<00:04:26.510> 60

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
called a decompression shim and it's 60

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
thousandths thick on the 1600 so we have

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.770 
thousandths thick on the 1600 so we have
a<00:04:30.950> steel<00:04:31.190> shim<00:04:31.490> but<00:04:31.730> it's<00:04:31.880> not<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.090> per<00:04:32.540> se

very closely and make sure you know how

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.110 
very closely and make sure you know how
many<00:04:54.410> cracks<00:04:54.710> or<00:04:55.040> where<00:04:55.610> it's<00:04:55.760> been<00:04:55.910> leaking

and anytime you got air you know and
there's<00:05:05.120> sparking<00:05:05.570> fire<00:05:05.780> involved<00:05:06.410> you<00:05:06.500> know

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
there's sparking fire involved you know

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.170 
there's sparking fire involved you know
that's<00:05:06.890> going<00:05:07.040> to<00:05:07.130> be<00:05:07.220> a<00:05:07.250> hot<00:05:07.490> spot<00:05:07.790> so<00:05:08.000> you

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
that's going to be a hot spot so you

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.670 
that's going to be a hot spot so you
really<00:05:08.540> want<00:05:08.750> to<00:05:08.840> make<00:05:08.960> sure<00:05:08.990> the<00:05:09.200> cylinder<00:05:09.620> is

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
really want to make sure the cylinder is

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.620 
really want to make sure the cylinder is
not<00:05:09.860> discolored<00:05:10.460> or<00:05:10.669> the<00:05:11.180> you<00:05:11.419> know<00:05:11.540> the

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
not discolored or the you know the

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.210 
not discolored or the you know the
metals<00:05:11.930> not<00:05:11.990> cracked<00:05:12.440> or<00:05:12.650> on<00:05:12.800> its<00:05:12.980> way<00:05:13.160> to

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
metals not cracked or on its way to

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.380 
metals not cracked or on its way to
cracking<00:05:13.870> so<00:05:15.610> hopefully<00:05:16.610> I'd<00:05:16.880> answered<00:05:17.240> that

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
cracking so hopefully I'd answered that

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.700 
cracking so hopefully I'd answered that
question<00:05:17.540> and<00:05:18.340> thanks<00:05:19.340> for<00:05:19.460> the<00:05:19.550> comment<00:05:19.970> and

question and thanks for the comment and

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.580 
question and thanks for the comment and
if<00:05:22.330> you<00:05:23.330> don't<00:05:23.510> understand<00:05:24.020> it<00:05:24.169> just<00:05:24.200> let<00:05:24.500> me

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
if you don't understand it just let me

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.900 
if you don't understand it just let me
know<00:05:24.620> and<00:05:24.950> I'll<00:05:25.040> try<00:05:25.070> to<00:05:25.280> explain<00:05:25.610> a<00:05:25.669> little

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
know and I'll try to explain a little

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.710 
know and I'll try to explain a little
better<00:05:27.160> it's<00:05:28.160> pretty<00:05:28.430> much<00:05:28.580> it<00:05:28.820> so<00:05:29.000> it<00:05:29.419> kind<00:05:29.660> of

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
better it's pretty much it so it kind of

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.950 
better it's pretty much it so it kind of
goes<00:05:29.930> right<00:05:30.260> there<00:05:30.850> you<00:05:31.850> know<00:05:32.030> this<00:05:32.210> is<00:05:32.360> a<00:05:32.390> 92

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
goes right there you know this is a 92

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.770 
goes right there you know this is a 92
in<00:05:33.200> a<00:05:33.260> 94<00:05:33.560> hole<00:05:33.950> but<00:05:34.610> that's<00:05:35.210> basically<00:05:35.479> how

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
in a 94 hole but that's basically how

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.580 
in a 94 hole but that's basically how
the<00:05:35.810> cylinder<00:05:36.320> would<00:05:36.440> sit<00:05:36.680> down<00:05:36.710> in<00:05:37.100> there<00:05:37.310> and

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
the cylinder would sit down in there and

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.770 
the cylinder would sit down in there and
this<00:05:39.590> has<00:05:39.800> to<00:05:39.950> be<00:05:39.979> has<00:05:40.700> to<00:05:40.850> be<00:05:40.970> really<00:05:41.270> flat<00:05:41.510> you

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
this has to be has to be really flat you

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.409 
this has to be has to be really flat you
know<00:05:42.370> but<00:05:43.370> that's<00:05:43.520> how<00:05:43.729> it<00:05:43.850> is<00:05:43.970> there's<00:05:44.210> never

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
know but that's how it is there's never

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.480 
know but that's how it is there's never
a<00:05:44.570> gasket<00:05:45.050> there<00:05:45.229> and<00:05:46.419> it's<00:05:47.419> sort<00:05:47.720> of<00:05:48.490> amazing

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
a gasket there and it's sort of amazing

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.760 
a gasket there and it's sort of amazing
that<00:05:49.880> it<00:05:50.000> seals<00:05:50.270> that<00:05:50.510> way<00:05:50.810> but<00:05:51.260> that's<00:05:51.440> how<00:05:51.590> it

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
that it seals that way but that's how it

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.160 
that it seals that way but that's how it
does<00:05:51.979> it
