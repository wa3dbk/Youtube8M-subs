00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
don't know why I brought it to his

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.660 
don't know why I brought it to his
battle<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.559> he<00:00:49.920> had<00:00:50.010> moved<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.309> called<00:00:50.520> that

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
battle but he had moved is called that

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.950 
battle but he had moved is called that
doesn't<00:00:50.879> do<00:00:50.940> anything<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.629> tells<00:00:51.809> me

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
doesn't do anything so this tells me

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.180 
doesn't do anything so this tells me
he's<00:00:52.050> probably<00:00:52.289> gonna<00:00:52.440> want<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.800> switch<00:00:52.949> out

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
he's probably gonna want to switch out

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.330 
he's probably gonna want to switch out
so<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.550> predict<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.000> go<00:00:54.360> for<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.690> heat<00:00:55.050> wave

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
so I predict that go for the heat wave

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
so I predict that go for the heat wave
hoping<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.489> he<00:00:56.550> brings<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.879> Reggie<00:00:57.090> steel

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
hoping that he brings in Reggie steel

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.319 
hoping that he brings in Reggie steel
but<00:00:57.660> no<00:00:57.780> he<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:57.930> brings<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:59.000> vlog<00:01:00.000> on

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
but no he just brings in the vlog on

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.500 
but no he just brings in the vlog on
which<00:01:00.570> isn't<00:01:01.199> too<00:01:01.460> bad<00:01:02.460> for<00:01:02.760> him<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.329> I'm<00:01:03.420> gonna

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
which isn't too bad for him so I'm gonna

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.359 
which isn't too bad for him so I'm gonna
have<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.809> switch<00:01:04.049> out<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.439> here<00:01:04.739> after<00:01:05.159> i<00:01:05.189> get

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
have to switch out of here after i get

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.170 
much is like nothing happened so I'm
just<00:01:41.070> gonna<00:01:41.159> switch<00:01:41.430> into<00:01:41.700> blink<00:01:41.939> blink

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
just gonna switch into blink blink

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.789 
just gonna switch into blink blink
because<00:01:42.390> if<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.720> want<00:01:42.899> anything<00:01:43.140> burned<00:01:43.560> I

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
because if I want anything burned I

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.109 
because if I want anything burned I
guess<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.159> would<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.520> be<00:01:44.549> blink<00:01:44.850> blink

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
guess it would have to be blink blink

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.210 
guess it would have to be blink blink
but<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.390> later<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:45.869> realized<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.740> blink<00:01:47.009> blink

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
but I later on realized that blink blink

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.789 
but I later on realized that blink blink
could<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.490> helped<00:01:47.700> me<00:01:47.790> out<00:01:47.820> but<00:01:48.649> yeah<00:01:49.649> that

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
could have helped me out but yeah that

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.109 
could have helped me out but yeah that
was<00:01:49.890> my<00:01:50.040> first<00:01:50.220> mistake<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.790> what<00:01:51.000> this

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
he missed like twice in a row which is

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.700 
he missed like twice in a row which is
kind<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.000> funny<00:02:03.060> still<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.020> feel<00:02:04.530> bad<00:02:04.680> for

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
kind of funny still but I feel bad for

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.499 
kind of funny still but I feel bad for
him<00:02:05.040> but<00:02:05.340> he<00:02:05.700> tastes<00:02:05.880> with<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.090> t-bolt<00:02:06.420> that

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
him but he tastes with the t-bolt that

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.660 
him but he tastes with the t-bolt that
doesn't<00:02:06.719> do<00:02:06.780> anything<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.860> that's<00:02:08.039> good<00:02:08.160> and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
doesn't do anything so that's good and

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.230 
doesn't do anything so that's good and
he's<00:02:08.940> probably<00:02:09.300> going<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.629> have<00:02:09.750> to

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
he's probably going to have to

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.880 
he's probably going to have to
go<00:02:10.540> for<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.720> overheat<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.350> won't<00:02:11.590> even<00:02:11.740> do

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
go for the overheat that won't even do

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.250 
go for the overheat that won't even do
anything<00:02:12.100> at<00:02:12.310> all<00:02:12.400> because<00:02:13.390> blink<00:02:13.720> blink<00:02:13.990> is<00:02:14.200> a

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
anything at all because blink blink is a

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.990 
anything at all because blink blink is a
boss<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:15.100> he<00:02:15.220> gets<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.490> special<00:02:15.640> attack

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
boss and he gets a special attack

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.340 
boss and he gets a special attack
harshly<00:02:16.330> fallen<00:02:16.690> which<00:02:16.810> tells<00:02:17.020> me<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.170> can

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
harshly fallen which tells me I can

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.660 
harshly fallen which tells me I can
roost<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.740> he's<00:02:17.950> gonna<00:02:18.040> have<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.250> switch<00:02:18.490> out

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
roost and he's gonna have to switch out

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.910 
roost and he's gonna have to switch out
because<00:02:18.940> he<00:02:19.030> has<00:02:19.150> no<00:02:19.330> special<00:02:19.600> attack<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.710> save

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
because he has no special attack to save

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.210 
because he has no special attack to save

bandaged<00:04:38.580> so<00:04:38.789> I<00:04:38.819> figured<00:04:39.240> it<00:04:39.360> probably<00:04:39.389> will

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
bandaged so I figured it probably will

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.420 
bandaged so I figured it probably will
do<00:04:40.139> enough<00:04:40.349> to<00:04:40.470> kill<00:04:40.650> it<00:04:40.770> but<00:04:40.949> of<00:04:41.069> course<00:04:41.250> it

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
do enough to kill it but of course it

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.850 
do enough to kill it but of course it
lives<00:04:41.639> with<00:04:41.819> like<00:04:42.030> negative<00:04:42.419> 2<00:04:42.599> HP<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.349> then

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
lives with like negative 2 HP and then

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.290 
lives with like negative 2 HP and then
he<00:04:43.949> will<00:04:44.099> ask<00:04:44.310> me<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:44.639> that<00:04:44.729> kind<00:04:44.970> of<00:04:45.030> sucks

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
he will ask me and that kind of sucks

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.999 
he will ask me and that kind of sucks
because<00:04:45.449> now<00:04:45.629> there's<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:46.169> pretty<00:04:46.860> much

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
because now there's it pretty much

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.129 
because now there's it pretty much
renders<00:04:47.400> my<00:04:47.550> weavile<00:04:47.970> useless<00:04:48.509> because<00:04:48.720> I

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
renders my weavile useless because I

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.809 
renders my weavile useless because I

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
mean it's a weave uh what are you gonna

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.839 
mean it's a weave uh what are you gonna
do<00:04:51.000> with<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.150> burnt<00:04:51.449> ice<00:04:51.750> type<00:04:52.220> Weavile<00:04:53.220> guy<00:04:53.490> but

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
do with a burnt ice type Weavile guy but

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.480 
do with a burnt ice type Weavile guy but
he<00:04:53.970> goes<00:04:54.090> into<00:04:54.240> boss<00:04:54.479> and<00:04:55.039> I'm<00:04:56.039> choice<00:04:56.250> banded
