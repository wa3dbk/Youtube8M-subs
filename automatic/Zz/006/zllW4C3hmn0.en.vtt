00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.629 

here's<00:00:00.269> the<00:00:00.390> deal<00:00:00.860> it's<00:00:01.860> nighttime<00:00:02.100> it's

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
here's the deal it's nighttime it's

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:03.670 
here's the deal it's nighttime it's
still<00:00:02.850> snowing

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:03.680 
still snowing

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.490 
still snowing
everything<00:00:04.680> is<00:00:04.799> completely<00:00:05.390> buried<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:06.930> I'm

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
everything is completely buried and I'm

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:26.200 
everything is completely buried and I'm
going<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.680> make<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.799> craft

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.389 

and<00:00:27.210> then<00:00:27.329> this<00:00:27.480> just<00:00:27.750> slips<00:00:28.050> right<00:00:28.320> in<00:00:29.279> there

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:29.399 
and then this just slips right in there

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:31.819 
and then this just slips right in there
like<00:00:29.430> that<00:00:29.609> at<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.090> same<00:00:30.239> angle<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.899> then<00:00:31.109> you

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:31.829 
like that at the same angle and then you

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.590 
like that at the same angle and then you
know<00:00:31.919> a<00:00:31.949> back<00:00:32.189> color<00:00:32.430> goes<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.790> back<00:00:32.970> so<00:00:33.570> I

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
know a back color goes on the back so I

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.049 
know a back color goes on the back so I
threw<00:00:34.019> the<00:00:34.110> CVI<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.680> ignition<00:00:35.070> sort<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.820> there

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
threw the CVI and ignition sort of there

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.000 
threw the CVI and ignition sort of there
I<00:00:36.269> don't<00:00:36.420> really<00:00:36.540> want<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.720> make<00:00:36.870> tracks<00:00:37.140> I'm

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
I don't really want to make tracks I'm

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.680 
I don't really want to make tracks I'm
just<00:00:38.280> gonna<00:00:38.400> make<00:00:38.579> some<00:00:38.640> wheels<00:00:39.030> but<00:00:39.480> what<00:00:39.629> I

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
just gonna make some wheels but what I

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.970 
just gonna make some wheels but what I
tried<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.960> do<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.230> tried<00:00:40.409> to<00:00:40.500> knock<00:00:40.650> this<00:00:40.800> off

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
tried to do is I tried to knock this off

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.579 
tried to do is I tried to knock this off
and<00:00:41.339> unscrew<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.269> and<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.839> just<00:00:43.199> can't<00:00:43.350> get<00:00:43.470> it

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
and unscrew it and I just can't get it

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.939 
and unscrew it and I just can't get it
unscrewed<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.940> drilled<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> hole<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.409> what

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
unscrewed so I drilled the hole so what

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.680 
unscrewed so I drilled the hole so what
I<00:00:46.979> go<00:00:47.159> to<00:00:47.190> plasma<00:00:47.640> cut<00:00:47.850> they'll<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.449> maybe

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
I go to plasma cut they'll just be maybe

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.570 
I go to plasma cut they'll just be maybe
a<00:00:48.809> little<00:00:48.989> bit<00:00:49.199> of<00:00:49.290> residual<00:00:49.620> gas<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.070> there

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:03.250 

yes<00:00:57.580> propane<00:00:58.150> in<00:00:58.330> there

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.500 

most<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.410> the<00:01:04.470> brass<00:01:04.710> out<00:01:05.090> better<00:01:06.090> part<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.420> it

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
most of the brass out better part of it

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.970 
most of the brass out better part of it
at<00:01:06.600> least<00:01:06.630> those<00:01:07.170> threads<00:01:07.440> weren't<00:01:07.650> coming

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
at least those threads weren't coming

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.000 
at least those threads weren't coming
there<00:01:08.220> they<00:01:08.580> are<00:01:09.650> now

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
there they are now

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.430 
there they are now
we've<00:01:11.340> got<00:01:11.550> to<00:01:11.640> take<00:01:11.790> them<00:01:11.970> over<00:01:12.260> load<00:01:13.260> them

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
we've got to take them over load them

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.830 
we've got to take them over load them
onto<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:17.970> now<00:01:18.090> I'm<00:01:18.150> welding<00:01:18.450> these<00:01:18.540> on

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
onto this so now I'm welding these on

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.750 
onto this so now I'm welding these on
they're<00:01:19.229> not<00:01:19.260> perfectly<00:01:19.920> true<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:20.550> they're

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
they're not perfectly true but they're

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.730 
they're not perfectly true but they're
honestly<00:01:21.270> not<00:01:21.510> that<00:01:21.750> bad<00:01:21.960> all<00:01:22.350> right<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.619> what

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
honestly not that bad all right so what

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.170 
honestly not that bad all right so what
I've<00:01:22.860> done<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.100> I've<00:01:23.310> taken<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.760> big<00:01:23.970> garage

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
I've done is I've taken this big garage

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.150 
I've done is I've taken this big garage
door<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.869> I've<00:01:25.020> cut<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> bunch<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.770> strips<00:01:25.979> out

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
door and I've cut a bunch of strips out

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.859 
door and I've cut a bunch of strips out
of<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.460> I'd<00:01:26.580> actually<00:01:26.940> find<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.479> thing<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
of it I'd actually find this thing and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.150 
of it I'd actually find this thing and
dig<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.110> out<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.410> snow<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.830> was<00:01:28.920> really

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
dig it out of the snow it was really

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:36.260 
dig it out of the snow it was really
hard<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> find<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:35.460> what<00:01:35.759> I'm<00:01:35.850> gonna<00:01:35.940> do<00:01:36.149> is

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
hard to find so what I'm gonna do is

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.150 
hard to find so what I'm gonna do is
just<00:01:36.330> cut<00:01:36.540> them<00:01:36.630> all<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:36.750> half<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.290> then<00:01:37.410> twice

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
just cut them all in half and then twice

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:49.790 
just cut them all in half and then twice
as<00:01:38.280> many<00:01:38.399> two<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.869> each<00:01:40.020> one<00:01:48.350> this<00:01:49.350> thing<00:01:49.590> looks

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
as many two on each one this thing looks

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.890 
as many two on each one this thing looks
pretty<00:01:49.890> freakin<00:01:50.610> cool<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.090> thermal

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.270 

it's<00:01:54.260> crazy<00:01:54.620> I<00:01:54.890> added<00:01:55.340> a<00:01:55.430> shifter<00:01:56.980> here<00:01:57.980> an

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
it's crazy I added a shifter here an

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:11.260 
it's crazy I added a shifter here an
extra<00:01:58.550> thing<00:01:58.820> so<00:01:59.090> I<00:01:59.120> can<00:01:59.210> start<00:01:59.630> it<00:02:09.880> tracks

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
extra thing so I can start it tracks

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.780 
extra thing so I can start it tracks
I<00:02:11.300> took<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.350> thing<00:02:12.890> off<00:02:13.070> so<00:02:13.370> I'm<00:02:13.580> going<00:02:13.730> to

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
I took the thing off so I'm going to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.090 
I took the thing off so I'm going to
weld<00:02:13.970> that<00:02:14.030> on<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.990> some<00:02:15.440> other<00:02:15.500> boards<00:02:15.890> well

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
weld that on to some other boards well

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.280 
weld that on to some other boards well
screw<00:02:16.550> those<00:02:16.670> boards<00:02:17.030> into<00:02:17.240> this<00:02:17.360> beautiful

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
screw those boards into this beautiful

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:42.310 
screw those boards into this beautiful
sled<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.910> there's<00:02:41.180> like<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.780> 10<00:02:42.020> degree<00:02:42.170> angle

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
sled is there's like a 10 degree angle

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.370 
sled is there's like a 10 degree angle
on<00:02:42.830> that<00:02:43.160> pivot<00:02:43.400> back<00:02:43.670> there<00:02:43.940> so<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.810> allows<00:02:45.080> it

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
on that pivot back there so it allows it

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.100 
on that pivot back there so it allows it
to<00:02:45.620> as<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.430> rotates<00:02:46.640> I<00:02:47.240> don't<00:02:47.840> know<00:02:47.900> if<00:02:47.960> you<00:02:48.020> can

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
to as it rotates I don't know if you can

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.960 
to as it rotates I don't know if you can
see<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:48.440> but<00:02:48.560> if<00:02:48.650> this<00:02:48.770> toll<00:02:49.220> sled<00:02:49.550> is<00:02:49.640> actually

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
see it but if this toll sled is actually

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.600 
see it but if this toll sled is actually
tilted<00:02:50.630> in<00:02:51.230> relation<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.680> that<00:02:51.770> miss<00:02:52.010> note<00:02:52.250> you

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
tilted in relation to that miss note you

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.190 
tilted in relation to that miss note you
really<00:02:52.790> need<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:53.000> tank<00:02:53.210> treads<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:53.750> need<00:02:53.960> you

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
really need to tank treads you need you

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.410 
really need to tank treads you need you
need<00:02:54.350> tracks<00:02:54.680> I<00:02:55.430> mean<00:02:55.820> if<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.060> look<00:02:56.240> at<00:02:56.330> the

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
need tracks I mean if you look at the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.060 
need tracks I mean if you look at the
