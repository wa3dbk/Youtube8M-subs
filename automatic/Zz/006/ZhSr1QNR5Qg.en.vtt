do is we wanted our outsides getting
better<00:00:10.730> at<00:00:11.950> terminating<00:00:12.950> sets<00:00:13.429> that<00:00:13.790> are

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
better at terminating sets that are

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.820 
better at terminating sets that are
given<00:00:14.240> to<00:00:14.269> them<00:00:14.450> from<00:00:15.019> an<00:00:15.200> auto<00:00:15.380> system

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
given to them from an auto system

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.519 
given to them from an auto system
situation<00:00:16.490> also<00:00:17.420> in<00:00:17.900> relation<00:00:18.260> to<00:00:18.289> that

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
situation also in relation to that

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.650 
situation also in relation to that
having<00:00:18.770> a<00:00:19.010> side<00:00:19.850> on<00:00:19.970> the<00:00:20.060> other<00:00:20.180> side<00:00:20.390> waiting

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
having a side on the other side waiting

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.900 
having a side on the other side waiting
for<00:00:20.990> that<00:00:21.050> attacker<00:00:21.410> a<00:00:21.710> six<00:00:22.250> side<00:00:22.430> with<00:00:22.640> a<00:00:22.670> well

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
for that attacker a six side with a well

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.150 
for that attacker a six side with a well
formed<00:00:23.300> block<00:00:23.510> and<00:00:23.779> able<00:00:24.289> to<00:00:24.320> transition<00:00:24.890> out

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
formed block and able to transition out

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.679 
formed block and able to transition out
of<00:00:25.279> that<00:00:25.400> and<00:00:25.609> so<00:00:26.119> what<00:00:26.300> we're<00:00:26.390> going<00:00:26.480> to<00:00:26.539> do

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
of that and so what we're going to do

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:27.910 
of that and so what we're going to do
here<00:00:26.900> is<00:00:26.990> we're<00:00:27.109> set<00:00:27.260> up<00:00:27.380> an<00:00:27.500> outside<00:00:27.800> hitter

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
here is we're set up an outside hitter

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.339 
here is we're set up an outside hitter
challenge<00:00:28.460> drill<00:00:28.699> okay<00:00:29.269> that<00:00:29.660> requires<00:00:30.019> a

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
challenge drill okay that requires a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.619 
challenge drill okay that requires a
setter<00:00:30.740> on<00:00:30.800> this<00:00:31.070> side<00:00:31.310> a<00:00:31.609> line<00:00:32.150> of<00:00:32.300> outside

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
setter on this side a line of outside

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.440 
setter on this side a line of outside
hitters<00:00:32.989> and<00:00:33.340> then<00:00:34.340> a<00:00:34.370> full<00:00:34.610> six<00:00:34.910> defense<00:00:35.300> on

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
hitters and then a full six defense on

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.870 
hitters and then a full six defense on
that<00:00:35.630> side<00:00:35.870> so<00:00:36.559> give<00:00:36.739> me<00:00:36.860> dummy<00:00:37.219> start<00:00:37.520> setting

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
that side so give me dummy start setting

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.080 
that side so give me dummy start setting
Garen<00:00:38.780> good<00:00:39.050> right<00:00:39.290> back<00:00:39.500> great<00:00:40.010> I<00:00:40.190> need<00:00:40.370> let's

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
Garen good right back great I need let's

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.760 
Garen good right back great I need let's
go<00:00:41.239> likes<00:00:41.629> left<00:00:41.870> back<00:00:42.110> so<00:00:42.290> I<00:00:42.320> got<00:00:42.530> three

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
go likes left back so I got three

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.920 
go likes left back so I got three
attackers<00:00:43.070> here<00:00:43.489> it's<00:00:43.670> these<00:00:44.600> three

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
attackers here it's these three

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.190 
attackers here it's these three
attackers<00:00:45.379> against<00:00:46.309> each<00:00:46.700> other<00:00:47.030> okay<00:00:47.989> these

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
attackers against each other okay these

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.840 
attackers against each other okay these
three<00:00:48.410> attackers<00:00:48.770> against<00:00:49.190> each<00:00:49.370> other<00:00:49.579> and

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
three attackers against each other and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.119 
three attackers against each other and
so<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:50.510> idea<00:00:50.840> here<00:00:50.930> is<00:00:51.230> is<00:00:51.649> that<00:00:51.920> they're

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
so the idea here is is that they're

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.000 
so the idea here is is that they're
looking<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.550> terminate<00:00:53.120> on<00:00:53.239> that<00:00:53.420> first<00:00:53.629> swing

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
looking to terminate on that first swing

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.920 
looking to terminate on that first swing
it<00:00:55.010> will<00:00:55.430> play<00:00:55.610> will<00:00:56.000> just<00:00:56.180> play<00:00:56.329> right<00:00:56.600> up<00:00:56.750> to

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
it will play will just play right up to

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.080 
it will play will just play right up to
Alice's<00:00:57.800> we'll<00:00:58.070> play<00:00:58.219> up<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:58.489> three<00:00:58.820> kills

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
Alice's we'll play up to three kills

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.580 
Alice's we'll play up to three kills
right<00:00:59.300> now<00:00:59.449> or<00:00:59.660> play<00:00:59.809> to<00:00:59.870> five<00:01:00.109> kills<00:01:00.410> right

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
right now or play to five kills right

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.790 
right now or play to five kills right
now<00:01:00.770> okay<00:01:01.460> if<00:01:01.760> they<00:01:02.539> take<00:01:02.870> a<00:01:03.109> first<00:01:03.350> swing<00:01:03.649> and

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
now okay if they take a first swing and

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.760 
now okay if they take a first swing and
they<00:01:03.859> terminate<00:01:04.430> okay<00:01:05.270> they<00:01:05.690> get<00:01:05.990> immediately

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
they terminate okay they get immediately

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.530 
they terminate okay they get immediately
another<00:01:06.979> opportunity<00:01:07.729> if<00:01:07.880> they<00:01:07.909> continue<00:01:08.450> to

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
another opportunity if they continue to

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.450 
another opportunity if they continue to
terminate<00:01:09.020> they<00:01:09.470> continue<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:10.100> go<00:01:10.220> and<00:01:10.340> get

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
terminate they continue to go and get

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.219 
terminate they continue to go and get
another<00:01:10.520> opportunity<00:01:10.939> and<00:01:11.479> so<00:01:11.930> again<00:01:12.200> I

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
another opportunity and so again I

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.899 
another opportunity and so again I
talked<00:01:12.530> yesterday<00:01:12.770> about<00:01:13.010> having<00:01:13.369> a<00:01:13.610> rhythm

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
talked yesterday about having a rhythm

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:14.469 
talked yesterday about having a rhythm
and<00:01:14.060> volleyball

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
and volleyball

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.630 
and volleyball
I<00:01:14.810> think<00:01:15.110> volleyball<00:01:15.439> is<00:01:15.590> about<00:01:15.860> rhythm<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:16.400> if

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
I think volleyball is about rhythm so if

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.820 
I think volleyball is about rhythm so if
I<00:01:17.000> have<00:01:17.210> a<00:01:17.240> hitter<00:01:17.509> who<00:01:17.720> is<00:01:17.840> getting<00:01:18.140> hot<00:01:18.530> and

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
I have a hitter who is getting hot and

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.100 
I have a hitter who is getting hot and
she<00:01:19.430> puts<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:19.759> ball<00:01:19.970> away<00:01:20.270> I<00:01:20.479> want<00:01:20.900> her<00:01:21.020> to

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
she puts a ball away I want her to

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.990 
she puts a ball away I want her to
receive<00:01:21.350> another<00:01:21.650> ball<00:01:21.920> so<00:01:22.460> she<00:01:22.520> can<00:01:22.790> come

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
receive another ball so she can come

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.480 
receive another ball so she can come
back<00:01:23.150> with<00:01:23.330> another<00:01:23.390> swing<00:01:24.020> it's<00:01:24.560> also<00:01:24.799> a<00:01:24.979> lot

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
back with another swing it's also a lot

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.940 
back with another swing it's also a lot
of<00:01:25.520> mini<00:01:25.909> chess<00:01:26.240> games<00:01:26.570> within<00:01:26.869> a<00:01:27.290> lot<00:01:27.650> of<00:01:27.799> a

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
short amount of time so it's a little

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.569 
short amount of time so it's a little
quite<00:01:29.750> a<00:01:29.780> few<00:01:30.020> opportunities<00:01:30.680> in<00:01:30.829> there<00:01:31.009> okay
