00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.670
 hello welcome to the field today we are going to 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.370
 play the rumba with arpegios we're going to 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.260
 use for the slowest rumbas and 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.530
 It usually looks very nice 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.290
 consists of the following parts in the 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.390
 thumb that will give the fourth to the 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.880
 fifth to the sixth even the third 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.890
 as appropriate and then these two fingers 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.080
 that the index will be in the second 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.020
 and the medium in the first one that are not going to 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.199
 then move your thumb for example if 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.290
 start from the fifth we will do fifth 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:41.070
 second first fourth second first 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.380
 third second this time we do not give to the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.680
 first 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:49.780
 thumb index finger thumb index and 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:55.040
 half thumb index and we would count 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:59.390
 points 3 1 2 3 points we give you a 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:04.309
 little bit more about rhythm points 3 1 2 3 1 2 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:07.490
 points 3 1 2 3 1 points 3 1 2 3 points 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.410
 the thumb will always go down if 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.640
 we started in the sixth we would stay in 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:19.100
 the fourth sixth fifth fifth fourth 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.290
 fifth fourth sixth fifth fifth and yes 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.500
 we started in the fourth we will have to 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:29.210
 repeat any of the fourth strings 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:33.140
 third fourth fourth fourth 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.890
 It's worth if I make a wheel with the solfa to me 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.890
 for example 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.320
 Sun 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.160
 well it was not like that it does not seem like a rumba 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.160
 let's find some 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:13.370
 superior to me what brings me 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:16.760
 before the life that the only thing that tells me 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.480
 in the time that happens this came out for me 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.480
 this street 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.050
 and there we would change the rhythm that already 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.420
 we will see it in another story 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.870
 for example if we go to one more rumba 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.870
 ancient 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.980
 we arrive at the sea 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.459
 I am 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.050
 Y 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.050
 Y 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.830
 Y 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.120
 Look 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.519
 I'm alive 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.220
 and they would continue if we go to a great 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:16.370
 story for example we will do 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:18.370
 and if it were not for these kitchens if not 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.070
 out for this 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:29.680
 what would be the meaning of life so 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:29.680
 We have been of the feelings that it is worth
