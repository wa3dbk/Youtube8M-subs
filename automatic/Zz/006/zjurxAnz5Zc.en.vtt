footprints age-old question why do I
need<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.320> footprint<00:00:13.799> do<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.219> need<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.490> footprint

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
need a footprint do I need a footprint

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.880 
need a footprint do I need a footprint
should<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.240> use<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.450> footprint<00:00:15.929> what<00:00:16.740> does<00:00:16.859> a

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
should I use a footprint what does a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.400 
should I use a footprint what does a
footprint<00:00:17.340> do<00:00:17.580> really<00:00:18.119> simple<00:00:18.510> footprint<00:00:19.230> is

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
footprint do really simple footprint is

super<00:00:33.570> strong<00:00:33.870> they're<00:00:34.710> all<00:00:34.890> waterproof<00:00:35.280> but

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
super strong they're all waterproof but

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.340 
super strong they're all waterproof but
what<00:00:36.120> happens<00:00:36.390> over<00:00:36.510> time<00:00:36.690> when<00:00:37.230> you're

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
what happens over time when you're

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.770 
what happens over time when you're
moving<00:00:37.469> around<00:00:37.770> inside<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.100> tent<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.790> you

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
moving around inside that tent is you

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.840 
moving around inside that tent is you
cause<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.680> bottom<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> tent<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.610> rub

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
cause the bottom of the tent to rub

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.069 
cause the bottom of the tent to rub
against<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.210> ground<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.660> when<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.899> rubs

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
against the ground and when it rubs

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.229 
against the ground and when it rubs
against<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> ground<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.950> starts<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.399> wear<00:00:44.610> and

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
against the ground it starts to wear and

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.580 
against the ground it starts to wear and
one<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> things<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.020> wears<00:00:46.200> first

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
one of the things that wears first

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.040 
one of the things that wears first
before<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.160> fabric<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.180> waterproofing

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
before the fabric is the waterproofing

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.130 
before the fabric is the waterproofing
element<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.129> floor<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:51.300> how<00:00:51.960> do<00:00:52.020> you

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
element of that floor so how do you

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.110 
element of that floor so how do you
protect<00:00:52.350> against<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.370> use<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> footprint

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
protect against that you use a footprint

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.810 
protect against that you use a footprint
number<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:54.809> reason<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.260> footprint

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
number one reason is a footprint

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.990 
number one reason is a footprint
increase<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.360> lifespan<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.899> your<00:00:58.199> tent

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
increase the lifespan of your tent

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.639 
increase the lifespan of your tent
number<00:01:00.000> two<00:01:00.180> reason<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.930> use<00:01:01.050> your<00:01:01.230> footprint

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
number two reason to use your footprint

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.119 
number two reason to use your footprint
is<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.250> gives<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.110> clean<00:01:04.110> area<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.830> set<00:01:05.010> your

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
is it gives you a clean area to set your

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.500 
is it gives you a clean area to set your
tent<00:01:05.339> up<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.670> which<00:01:05.939> means<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.330> when<00:01:06.420> you

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
tent up on which means that when you

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.330 
tent up on which means that when you
take<00:01:06.659> your<00:01:06.720> tent<00:01:07.049> down<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.979> have<00:01:08.159> less

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
take your tent down you have less

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.179 
take your tent down you have less
cleaning<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.939> do<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:10.049> front<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.500> me<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.890> two

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
cleaning to do in front of me I have two

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.770 
cleaning to do in front of me I have two
different<00:01:11.400> versions<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.180> what<00:01:12.390> might<00:01:12.630> be

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
different versions of what might be

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.630 
different versions of what might be
called<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.110> footprint<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> floor<00:01:14.310> saver

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
called a footprint I have a floor saver

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.570 
called a footprint I have a floor saver

this happens to come from Eureka and I

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.090 
this happens to come from Eureka and I
have<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> lightning<00:01:18.270> -<00:01:19.110> footprint<00:01:19.860> which

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
have a lightning - footprint which

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.789 
have a lightning - footprint which
matches<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.880> lightning<00:01:21.270> -<00:01:21.450> tent<00:01:21.799> biggest

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
matches the lightning - tent biggest

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.700 
matches the lightning - tent biggest
difference<00:01:23.189> floor<00:01:23.790> savers<00:01:24.299> are<00:01:24.680> really<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
waterproof designed to be super durable

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.840 
waterproof designed to be super durable
but<00:01:30.240> not<00:01:30.450> designed<00:01:30.869> for<00:01:30.960> any<00:01:31.549> specific<00:01:32.549> tent

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
but not designed for any specific tent

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.789 
but not designed for any specific tent
can<00:01:33.450> be<00:01:33.570> used<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:33.900> any<00:01:33.990> tent<00:01:34.320> they<00:01:34.439> come<00:01:34.650> in

the day the one thing you don't want is

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.080 
the day the one thing you don't want is
a<00:01:48.420> footprint<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.140> extends<00:01:49.860> beyond<00:01:50.790> the
