00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.130
 I really wanted to record them and it's from 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.750

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.300

 the products and I'm telling you how 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.250
 they worked for me if I would buy it again 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.320
 If I found a better option, that's the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.750
 objective then of this video that 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.000

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.340
 ok I tell you that moisturizer ends 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.640
 this is from the brand's natural not from the 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.940
 natural brand of the line all day and this 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.830
 is the one of blackberry and almonds I think that 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.700
 It was a special edition because 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.630
 has 1st 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:55.190
 is 400 ml I bought it or I bought it 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.900
 They were given in the summer and used and 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.650
 exquisite the smell is like yogurt 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.610
 dwells as that goes enjoyment dwells that 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.610

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.250
 comes moisturizing to see not a 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.350
 medium hydration not high but it 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.870
 it absorbs very fast then clear to 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.400
 summer is a rich cream in winter the 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.250
 use very fast really because 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.790
 I needed more quantity to go applying 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.890

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.520
 the famous golden cane that is a 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.670
 cleanser for face on the basis of 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.940
 clay is very soft it has minerals 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.730
 active and is a natural cleaner of the 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.550
 skin based on clays and oils 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.380
 Vegetables do not strain the skin does not have 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.440
 soap is wonderful and I know 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.700
 I recommend to all this is the version of 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.590
 40 grams of academy line that from 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.450
 care for the care treatment 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.100
 of the hair is not my favorites but 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.710
 I finish it is healing 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.390
 and that which is a therapeutic oil that 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.780
 ibeas a mixture of several oils 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.670
 good for the hair and what then 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.740
 healing says it's one line 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.650
 professional care product 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.230
 hair cost me carito or something like that 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.440
 the 8,000 or 9,000 pesos seems to me for 30 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.790
 ml and has a very heavy smell has a 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.280
 smell as well as men's perfume well 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.550
 as the mix as a thing form 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.420
 it's culina I do not know why so intense the 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:30.740
 topic and not put I do not want to have that 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.200
 smell is my hair or my skin no no no no 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.610
 I do not like the independent scent of what 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.250
 what do I do with my hair if it is 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.490
 relatively good it works does what 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.960
 It promises at least that it is to take care of your hair 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.960
 Take away the frizz and all that stuff 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.480
 but because it smells like man has a 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.940
 product woman in or badly bad all bad there 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.900
 I'm not interested in using, even though it's good 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.900
 I want to use it because the smell is bad 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.700
 of the mark level end this is the 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.930
 collagen that is an eye contour is 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.250
 hypoallergenic this armed state 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.610
 logically also we telmo 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:13.290
 logically tested and clinically 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:14.970
 tested and is formulated in france is a 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.250
 eye contour treatment but 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.109
 also lip contour and says that 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.570
 has a filling effect product of 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.949
 collagen what it does basically is that 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.330
 has components that stimulate 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:28.229
 collagen production from your own 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:30.600
 body are 15 ml was a gift yes that 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.400
 I do not know how much it cost and I liked it 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.380
 enough and yes I think I'm going to repeat it 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.770
 but I'm finishing another outline of 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.889
 eyes now of the brook pose of the line 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.289
 my is the one who finishes this this ends 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:47.340
 These cleansing refreshing wipes 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:51.560
 that remove lime makeup and 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.560
 cucumber that are from the line d 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.600
 are from the line of this moisturizer 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.300
 I like this, this is a super aggressor 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.130
 is super aggressive to the skin or so 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.470
 less for mine that is a mixed skin 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.620
 that is to say this zone I fat zones and 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.889
 the rest is normal skin 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.930
 it irritates me full and I finished these 25 are 25 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:15.470
 if you are 25 wipes every time the 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:18.229
 use with a bearable burn but 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.900
 burning in my skin then I finished 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:24.080
 using it to clean the swat and 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:28.520
 those things was not expensive and I think something 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.710
 well of 2,500 pesos 2 thousand 990 pesos something 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.560
 so I found them in a doctor and I'm not going 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.970
 to repeat and in truth the towels are 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.530
 that remove makeup are not a 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.940
 vanity for my skin could never 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.260
 find one that does not challenge me all 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.260
 irritate even a little irritate me 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:50.260
 I was complaining I ended these are the 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.750
 ones the feisal cotton pads of the 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.810
 content of 130 pieces the squares no 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:59.620
 the rounds that happened was super good 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.780
 are now dilate is as thin 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.760
 they went well and lowered quality 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.170
 of the product I do not know what happened here but 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.480
 It is not the same product as me 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:12.010
 I liked it, I'm not going to buy it again and 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:14.620
 already look for an option to this and almost already 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.000
 as a ritual every time I make a 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.060
 product a product video 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.720
 finished finish this mask that is 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:27.220
 the mask of the brand las and is a 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.870
 Vegan product is purely is 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.670
 how to see if they invent the skin 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.530
 exquisite the product whatever a 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.740
 bit expensive a little bit more of the 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.750
 ten thousand pesos but it's great so 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.550
 I recommend them is the packaging 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.870
 125 grams 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.390
 before ending with this video 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.670
 I'm inviting you to 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.730
 inform themselves within their communes of the 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:51.180
 recycling plans that they have so that 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:54.270
 all these products and all these 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.190
 they do not want anywhere out there 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.199
 but you can actually go to 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:01.050
 recycling, let's not contaminate our 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:02.220
 world that already has a lot of that good 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.360
 I see them in a next video a kiss 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.360
 big bye
