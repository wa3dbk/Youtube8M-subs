 the tightrope man the swedish pitt gilou 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.580
 Mark then gave us 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.839
 chills in the bruno helicopter you 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.490
 imagine you opening the track 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.019
 like that it seems unthinkable without 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.790
 really acrobats but especially good 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.410
 to do acrobatics on a race of 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.009
 weekend ok but especially to dakar it's 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.389
 phenomenal 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.080
 good in quotation marks he lit a little 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.600
 he finishes 15th of the day it's an electron 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.340
 free pizzi mark 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.490
 alas alas look at his spectacular 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.930
 that he does not unanimously his 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.910
 behavior tends to disturb 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.890
 look in between with common he makes him 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.850
 sign about security the good 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.430
 walking of the leading men 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.540
 always wants him doubled and the doubled does not 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.329
 must be ahead but of reims more 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.440
 so you have to double them and then 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.350
 after once he's behind he's going 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.810
 still go ahead and no but that's 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.340
 it's not very 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.200
 it's not very fair play 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.470
 fun so we put it 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.200
 a lot we go to the km fueling 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.700
 145 concern of fabrizio meoni problem on 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.300
 a hose of gas the toast in 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:04.410
 Burgundy 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:06.240
 listen to the passage they inform kinigat 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:13.440
 the mayors his manager impossible to 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:15.450
 escape on this 12th stage of 341 km 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.370
 special navigation at the cap little or no 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.320
 of traces each remains on his guard 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.960
 on a false rhythm at the third control 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.000
 grouping meoni 5 loans like to 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.000
 loon mark in a sea of â€‹â€‹sand 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.420
 km 2 134 from waiting for the tanks 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.330
 bags too much but an error falls without 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.840
 severity 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.550
 it's a reminder 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.540
 like what to stay focused 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.070
 and then one kilometer 260 but hated 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.820
 makes trapped the tiredness starts to get 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.350
 make feel with the weight of the two-cylinder 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.030
 winner of the day giovanni sala despite 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.890
 a big cold the italian was content 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.470
 to follow the gas traces in front of 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.790
 the Norwegian ullevalseter to the general 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.920
 Cyril despres is second at 10 minutes 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.110
 48 but we lose time third to 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.090
 half an hour jean brucy is fourth 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.840
 little bruno question today 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.580
 richard 5/11 fabrizio meoni 16th and there is 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.020
 a certain Alain duclos number 102 whose 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.700
 we're talking really often right now 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.410
 5th but here if I think it's a 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.210
 unique opportunity for him to 2,2 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.620
 to draw attention to the factories 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.170
 I believe these boys here today 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.820
 have allowed to express in potential 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.680
 even though there have been incidents even though 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.720
 have benefited from a navigation that 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.070
 helped somewhere because so phenomenal 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.660
 especially since we know that their bike would be 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.870
 less efficient than those of sinn I 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.870
 I believe that
