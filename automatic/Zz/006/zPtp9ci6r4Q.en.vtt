wedge in his iron set and then he had

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.350 
wedge in his iron set and then he had
lofts<00:00:12.240> of<00:00:12.360> 52<00:00:12.810> 56<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.710> 60<00:00:14.100> which<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.460> fairly

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
lofts of 52 56 and 60 which is fairly

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.590 
lofts of 52 56 and 60 which is fairly
sensible<00:00:15.900> gapping<00:00:16.769> the<00:00:17.670> reality<00:00:18.150> was<00:00:18.330> when

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
sensible gapping the reality was when

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.120 
sensible gapping the reality was when
when<00:00:18.869> Adam<00:00:19.110> actually<00:00:19.260> chose<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.680> hit<00:00:19.920> full

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
when Adam actually chose to hit full

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.760 
when Adam actually chose to hit full
shots<00:00:20.490> with<00:00:20.670> each<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:21.030> those<00:00:21.090> wedges<00:00:21.600> was<00:00:22.530> that

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
shots with each of those wedges was that

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.279 
shots with each of those wedges was that
the<00:00:23.190> distance<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:24.030> bunched<00:00:24.510> quite

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
the distance is bunched quite

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.950 
the distance is bunched quite
considerably<00:00:25.860> and<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.210> what<00:00:27.420> we<00:00:27.539> were<00:00:27.660> able<00:00:27.690> to

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
considerably and so what we were able to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.550 
considerably and so what we were able to
do<00:00:28.230> in<00:00:28.920> Adams<00:00:29.430> case<00:00:29.699> was<00:00:29.970> actually<00:00:30.410> reduce<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
do in Adams case was actually reduce the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.439 
do in Adams case was actually reduce the
number<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.830> wedges<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.279> he<00:00:32.550> carried<00:00:32.969> giving

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449 
number of wedges that he carried giving

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.200 
number of wedges that he carried giving
a<00:00:33.920> kind<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:34.949> justifiable<00:00:35.579> distance<00:00:35.999> gap

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
a kind of justifiable distance gap

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.880 
a kind of justifiable distance gap
between<00:00:36.420> those<00:00:36.780> clubs<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.319> actually<00:00:37.559> making

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
between those clubs and actually making

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.009 
between those clubs and actually making
space<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.429> the<00:00:38.519> bag<00:00:38.699> for<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.030> long<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.839> club

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
space in the bag for a long the club

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.369 
space in the bag for a long the club

like a fairway wood or hybrid Adam was a

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.860 
like a fairway wood or hybrid Adam was a
