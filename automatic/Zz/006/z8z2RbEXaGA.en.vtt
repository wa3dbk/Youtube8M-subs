00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
it right after this before I go over the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.119 
it right after this before I go over the
ingredients<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.930> just<00:00:46.110> want<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.379> mention<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
ingredients I just want to mention the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.619 
ingredients I just want to mention the
number<00:00:47.280> one<00:00:47.550> question<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.239> get<00:00:48.300> from

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
number one question that I get from

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.729 
number one question that I get from
family<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.410> friends<00:00:49.530> as<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.100> why<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.820> juice<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
family and friends as to why I juice and

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.959 
family and friends as to why I juice and
what<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> difference<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.370> or<00:00:53.520> why<00:00:53.699> would<00:00:53.940> I

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
what the difference is or why would I

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.080 
what the difference is or why would I
juice<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.809> throw<00:00:55.590> away<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> fiber<00:00:56.160> instead

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
juice and throw away the fiber instead

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.369 
juice and throw away the fiber instead
of<00:00:57.300> blending<00:00:57.510> let's<00:00:57.870> say<00:00:57.989> where<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.199> get<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
of blending let's say where you get the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.599 
of blending let's say where you get the
fiber<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.770> there<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.039> that's<00:00:59.100> all<00:00:59.280> good<00:00:59.460> for

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
fiber in there and that's all good for

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.760 
fiber in there and that's all good for
you<00:00:59.670> right<00:00:59.879> well<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.960> reason<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.559> to

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
you right well the reason I like to

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.860 
you right well the reason I like to
juice<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.309> because<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.090> concentrated

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
juice is because it's concentrated

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.020 
juice is because it's concentrated
nutrition<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.559> takes<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.339> fair<00:01:05.580> amount<00:01:05.700> of

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
nutrition it takes a fair amount of

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.080 
nutrition it takes a fair amount of
leafy<00:01:06.570> greens<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.229> juice<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:08.400> order<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.939> get<00:01:09.060> a

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
leafy greens to juice in order to get a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.969 
leafy greens to juice in order to get a
glass<00:01:09.360> full<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:09.960> really<00:01:10.170> concentrated

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
glass full so it's really concentrated

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.429 
glass full so it's really concentrated
and<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.970> gets<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.570> requires<00:01:12.960> very<00:01:13.290> little

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
and it gets it requires very little

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.410 
and it gets it requires very little
digestion<00:01:13.950> because<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.700> fiber<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.119> not<00:01:15.270> in

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
digestion because the fiber is not in

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.749 
digestion because the fiber is not in
there<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:16.560> get<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.740> nutrition<00:01:17.340> right

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
there and you get that nutrition right

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.539 
there and you get that nutrition right
away<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:19.259> get<00:01:19.409> hydrated<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.400> get<00:01:20.520> a

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
away and you get hydrated and you get a

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.910 
away and you get hydrated and you get a
lot<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.729> energy<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:21.900> why<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.170> juice<00:01:22.619> and

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
lot of energy so that's why I juice and

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.920 
lot of energy so that's why I juice and
I<00:01:23.340> also<00:01:23.490> blend<00:01:23.939> as<00:01:24.119> well<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
I also blend as well because I like to

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.840 
I also blend as well because I like to
do<00:01:25.020> both<00:01:25.229> both<00:01:25.619> have<00:01:25.860> their<00:01:26.070> advantages<00:01:26.220> and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
do both both have their advantages and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.870 
do both both have their advantages and
they're<00:01:27.540> good<00:01:27.840> points<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.680> them<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.100> all<00:01:29.700> right

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
they're good points to them so all right

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.910 
they're good points to them so all right
so<00:01:30.090> let's<00:01:30.329> go<00:01:30.630> over<00:01:30.659> our<00:01:31.049> ingredients<00:01:31.380> and

let's<00:02:16.390> talk<00:02:16.659> about<00:02:16.900> just<00:02:17.709> two<00:02:17.950> different

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
let's talk about just two different

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.830 
let's talk about just two different
kinds<00:02:18.549> of<00:02:18.610> juicers<00:02:18.790> because<00:02:19.120> I've<00:02:19.390> had<00:02:19.569> two

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
kinds of juicers because I've had two

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.440 
kinds of juicers because I've had two
different<00:02:20.019> ones<00:02:20.319> and<00:02:21.120> originally<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.150> had<00:02:22.420> a

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
different ones and originally I had a

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.089 
different ones and originally I had a
centrifugal<00:02:22.930> juicer<00:02:23.379> that's<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.739> kind<00:02:23.950> that

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
centrifugal juicer that's the kind that

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.809 
centrifugal juicer that's the kind that
spins<00:02:24.459> at<00:02:24.790> very<00:02:25.450> high<00:02:25.480> speeds<00:02:26.019> rpms<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:26.950> you

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
spins at very high speeds rpms and you

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.130 
spins at very high speeds rpms and you
know<00:02:27.939> you<00:02:28.000> have<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.209> blade<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.629> spins<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.079> you

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
know you have a blade that spins and you

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.990 
know you have a blade that spins and you
put<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.379> fruit<00:02:29.590> or<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.829> vegetables<00:02:30.640> in<00:02:30.790> there

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
put the fruit or the vegetables in there

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.240 
put the fruit or the vegetables in there
and<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.599> cuts<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.930> up<00:02:32.049> and<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.500> separates<00:02:32.980> the

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
and it cuts it up and it separates the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.530 
and it cuts it up and it separates the
pulp<00:02:33.489> from<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:34.360> juice<00:02:34.510> it's<00:02:35.049> very<00:02:35.290> loud<00:02:35.530> and

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
pulp from the juice it's very loud and

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.780 
pulp from the juice it's very loud and
it<00:02:37.540> doesn't<00:02:38.110> do<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.230> very<00:02:38.500> good<00:02:38.590> job<00:02:38.739> with<00:02:39.430> leafy

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
it doesn't do a very good job with leafy

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.199 
it doesn't do a very good job with leafy
greens<00:02:40.060> so<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:40.810> opted<00:02:41.739> to<00:02:41.799> go<00:02:41.950> for<00:02:42.099> what<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.000> have

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
greens so I opted to go for what I have

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.740 
greens so I opted to go for what I have
here<00:02:43.689> which<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.230> my<00:02:44.909> masticating<00:02:45.909> juicer<00:02:46.540> and

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
here which is my masticating juicer and

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.360 
here which is my masticating juicer and
I<00:02:47.230> wanted<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.530> just<00:02:47.680> show<00:02:47.829> you<00:02:47.859> real<00:02:48.099> quick

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
I wanted to just show you real quick

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.129 
I wanted to just show you real quick
here<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:50.230> this<00:02:50.440> blade<00:02:50.859> and<00:02:51.389> how<00:02:52.389> it<00:02:52.540> works<00:02:52.810> it

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
here that this blade and how it works it

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.629 
here that this blade and how it works it
was<00:02:53.290> different<00:02:53.560> than<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:53.889> centripetal<00:02:54.280> one

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
was different than the centripetal one

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.619 
was different than the centripetal one
is<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:55.000> it<00:02:55.480> has<00:02:55.629> a<00:02:55.659> little<00:02:55.840> auger<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:57.629> this

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
is that it has a little auger and this

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.920 
is that it has a little auger and this
auger<00:02:59.310> just<00:03:00.310> turns<00:03:00.639> and<00:03:01.000> squeezes<00:03:01.780> and

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
auger just turns and squeezes and

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.229 
auger just turns and squeezes and
masticates<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:03.250> leafy<00:03:03.549> greens<00:03:03.819> and<00:03:04.030> it<00:03:04.090> does

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
masticates the leafy greens and it does

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.759 
masticates the leafy greens and it does
a<00:03:04.269> much<00:03:04.329> better<00:03:04.629> job<00:03:04.780> getting<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.379> juice<00:03:05.590> out

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
a much better job getting the juice out

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.619 
a much better job getting the juice out
of<00:03:05.980> those<00:03:06.129> so<00:03:06.370> that's<00:03:06.400> why<00:03:06.700> I<00:03:06.730> chose<00:03:07.090> this<00:03:07.359> one

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
of those so that's why I chose this one

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.819 
of those so that's why I chose this one
and<00:03:07.959> it's<00:03:08.920> quieter<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:10.510> here's<00:03:11.109> the<00:03:11.620> main

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
and it's quieter and here's the main

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.319 
and it's quieter and here's the main
thing<00:03:11.889> you're<00:03:12.310> going<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.519> look<00:03:12.639> for<00:03:12.940> in<00:03:13.180> a

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
thing you're going to look for in a

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.339 
thing you're going to look for in a
juicer<00:03:13.690> that<00:03:13.950> it's<00:03:14.950> easy<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.459> clean<00:03:16.139> if<00:03:17.139> it's

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
juicer that it's easy to clean if it's

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.339 
juicer that it's easy to clean if it's
not<00:03:17.590> easy<00:03:17.799> to<00:03:17.980> clean<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:18.579> won't<00:03:18.849> use<00:03:19.120> it<00:03:19.349> so

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
not easy to clean you won't use it so

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.800 
not easy to clean you won't use it so
let's<00:03:20.530> get<00:03:20.680> started<00:03:21.099> and<00:03:21.430> start<00:03:21.940> our<00:03:22.299> juicing

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
let's get started and start our juicing

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.020 
let's get started and start our juicing
so<00:03:22.989> I'm<00:03:23.139> going<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:23.319> cut<00:03:23.590> just<00:03:23.949> a<00:03:24.099> section<00:03:24.549> of<00:03:24.760> my

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
so I'm going to cut just a section of my

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.280 
so I'm going to cut just a section of my
wheatgrass<00:03:25.959> here<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:27.629> guys<00:03:28.629> remember<00:03:28.660> you

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
wheatgrass here and guys remember you

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.460
