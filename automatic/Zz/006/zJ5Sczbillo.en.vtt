I

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.930 

okay<00:00:14.469> so<00:00:14.530> we're<00:00:14.830> here<00:00:15.009> in<00:00:15.129> the<00:00:15.160> studio<00:00:15.429> to<00:00:15.700> have

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
okay so we're here in the studio to have

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.790 
okay so we're here in the studio to have
a<00:00:15.969> first<00:00:16.359> little<00:00:16.660> look<00:00:16.810> at<00:00:16.900> the<00:00:17.050> alpinestars

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
a first little look at the alpinestars

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.130 
a first little look at the alpinestars
bionic<00:00:18.400> neck<00:00:18.640> support<00:00:19.150> now<00:00:19.660> this<00:00:19.869> one<00:00:20.109> is

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
bionic neck support now this one is

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.260 
bionic neck support now this one is
called<00:00:20.470> the<00:00:20.619> SB<00:00:21.130> which<00:00:21.310> I<00:00:21.490> believe<00:00:21.700> stands<00:00:22.029> for

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
called the SB which I believe stands for

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.659 
called the SB which I believe stands for
special<00:00:22.660> blend<00:00:22.930> or<00:00:23.860> something<00:00:24.189> crazy<00:00:24.369> like

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:24.669 
special blend or something crazy like

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:26.310 
special blend or something crazy like
that<00:00:24.820> but<00:00:25.210> basically<00:00:25.660> it's<00:00:25.900> the<00:00:26.050> plastic

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
that but basically it's the plastic

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.240 
that but basically it's the plastic
frame<00:00:27.310> as<00:00:27.579> opposed<00:00:28.329> to<00:00:28.750> the<00:00:29.289> carbon<00:00:29.920> fiber

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
frame as opposed to the carbon fiber

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.700 
frame as opposed to the carbon fiber
frame<00:00:30.759> I'm<00:00:31.029> sure<00:00:31.509> it's<00:00:31.660> some<00:00:31.900> fancy<00:00:32.140> sort<00:00:32.650> of

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
frame I'm sure it's some fancy sort of

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.229 
frame I'm sure it's some fancy sort of
plastic<00:00:33.190> or<00:00:33.309> something<00:00:33.489> like<00:00:33.850> that<00:00:33.910> but

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
plastic or something like that but

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.689 
plastic or something like that but
that's<00:00:34.390> what<00:00:34.600> it<00:00:34.629> boils<00:00:34.720> down<00:00:35.019> to<00:00:35.440> now<00:00:36.250> having

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
that's what it boils down to now having

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.000 
that's what it boils down to now having
a<00:00:36.850> look<00:00:37.210> at<00:00:37.360> it<00:00:37.390> very<00:00:37.750> quickly<00:00:38.110> we<00:00:38.620> can<00:00:38.650> see

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
a look at it very quickly we can see

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.420 
a look at it very quickly we can see
here<00:00:39.250> that<00:00:39.280> this<00:00:39.489> foam<00:00:39.940> is<00:00:41.040> surrounds<00:00:42.040> all<00:00:42.220> of

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
Stickland points it's not that comfy

after wearing the brace for a couple of
days<00:00:51.609> you<00:00:51.850> do<00:00:52.000> really<00:00:52.239> notice<00:00:52.719> that<00:00:53.039> some<00:00:54.039> of

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
days you do really notice that some of

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.400 
days you do really notice that some of
the<00:00:54.219> competition<00:00:54.609> their<00:00:55.300> phones<00:00:56.079> are<00:00:56.379> a

the competition their phones are a

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.500 
the competition their phones are a
little<00:00:56.559> bit<00:00:56.770> more<00:00:56.980> comfortable<00:00:57.430> our<00:00:58.239> other

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
first initial response when looking at

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.889 
first initial response when looking at
it<00:01:01.570> was<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.170> lacs<00:01:02.620> adjustability<00:01:03.460> you<00:01:04.300> cannot

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
it was the lacs adjustability you cannot

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.080 
it was the lacs adjustability you cannot
adjust<00:01:05.320> too<00:01:05.679> much<00:01:05.950> of<00:01:06.160> it<00:01:06.190> out<00:01:06.460> of<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.820> box

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
adjust too much of it out of the box

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.510 
adjust too much of it out of the box
this<00:01:07.810> here<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:08.229> one<00:01:08.500> of<00:01:08.590> those<00:01:08.679> big<00:01:08.920> adjusting

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
this here is one of those big adjusting

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.040 
this here is one of those big adjusting
features<00:01:10.060> is<00:01:10.270> that<00:01:10.300> you<00:01:10.539> can<00:01:10.720> make<00:01:10.899> the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
features is that you can make the

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.310 
features is that you can make the
shoulder<00:01:11.470> pad<00:01:11.679> set<00:01:12.100> lower<00:01:12.899> but<00:01:13.899> you<00:01:14.020> cannot

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
shoulder pad set lower but you cannot

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.770 
shoulder pad set lower but you cannot
adjust<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:15.070> depth<00:01:15.310> this<00:01:15.910> part<00:01:16.270> here<00:01:16.539> does

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
adjust the depth this part here does

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.839 
adjust the depth this part here does
naturally<00:01:17.080> sort<00:01:17.740> of<00:01:17.830> bend<00:01:18.039> and<00:01:18.310> move<00:01:18.520> and

00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:18.849 
naturally sort of bend and move and

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:22.169 
naturally sort of bend and move and
stuff<00:01:19.119> I'm<00:01:19.360> not<00:01:19.569> sure<00:01:19.840> anyway<00:01:20.709> it<00:01:21.700> does<00:01:21.910> have

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
stuff I'm not sure anyway it does have

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:24.389 
stuff I'm not sure anyway it does have
fracture<00:01:22.690> points<00:01:23.080> built<00:01:23.319> into<00:01:23.709> its<00:01:23.950> several

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
fracture points built into its several

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.730 
fracture points built into its several
pieces<00:01:24.700> pieced<00:01:25.240> together<00:01:25.479> and<00:01:25.929> it's<00:01:26.319> made<00:01:26.709> to

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
pieces pieced together and it's made to

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.249 
pieces pieced together and it's made to
break<00:01:27.369> if<00:01:27.640> it<00:01:27.940> doesn't<00:01:28.390> you<00:01:28.750> know<00:01:28.780> if<00:01:29.110> you

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
break if it doesn't you know if you

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.150 
break if it doesn't you know if you
don't<00:01:29.530> fall<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.429> way<00:01:30.550> that<00:01:30.759> you<00:01:30.849> should<00:01:32.160> now

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
don't fall the way that you should now

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.070 
don't fall the way that you should now
the<00:01:33.220> other<00:01:33.520> points<00:01:33.970> to<00:01:34.149> it<00:01:34.270> at<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:34.750> front<00:01:34.989> here

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
the other points to it at the front here

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.859 
the other points to it at the front here
one<00:01:35.590> clip<00:01:36.009> holds<00:01:36.550> it<00:01:36.670> together<00:01:36.819> so<00:01:37.569> it<00:01:37.630> just

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
one clip holds it together so it just

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.990 
one clip holds it together so it just
has<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.200> one<00:01:38.229> click<00:01:38.770> in<00:01:38.979> there<00:01:39.220> to<00:01:39.640> hold<00:01:39.789> it

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
has the one click in there to hold it

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.479 
has the one click in there to hold it
together<00:01:40.149> once<00:01:40.869> you<00:01:41.080> undo<00:01:41.470> that<00:01:41.739> you<00:01:42.130> can<00:01:42.340> then

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:42.489 
together once you undo that you can then

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:44.790 
together once you undo that you can then
take<00:01:42.789> the<00:01:43.030> brace<00:01:43.239> apart<00:01:43.780> and<00:01:44.080> it<00:01:44.319> breaks<00:01:44.590> down

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
take the brace apart and it breaks down

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.210 
take the brace apart and it breaks down
into<00:01:45.160> three<00:01:45.640> pieces<00:01:45.970> now<00:01:46.869> apparently<00:01:47.560> you

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
into three pieces now apparently you

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.699 
into three pieces now apparently you
cannot<00:01:48.700> take<00:01:49.030> that<00:01:49.060> off<00:01:49.479> without<00:01:50.050> having<00:01:50.649> it

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:50.709 
cannot take that off without having it

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:53.040 
cannot take that off without having it
open<00:01:51.160> I<00:01:51.369> haven't<00:01:51.670> forced<00:01:52.119> it<00:01:52.300> I<00:01:52.390> haven't<00:01:52.720> tried

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
open I haven't forced it I haven't tried

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.469 
open I haven't forced it I haven't tried
now<00:01:53.649> again<00:01:53.830> this<00:01:54.160> piece<00:01:54.429> on<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.759> back<00:01:54.970> here<00:01:55.300> is

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
now again this piece on the back here is

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.770 
now again this piece on the back here is
supposed<00:01:56.050> to<00:01:56.229> be<00:01:56.410> a<00:01:56.590> fracture<00:01:57.459> point<00:01:57.700> so<00:01:58.360> in

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
supposed to be a fracture point so in

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.410 
supposed to be a fracture point so in
the<00:01:58.959> case<00:01:59.140> of<00:01:59.200> an<00:01:59.470> accident<00:01:59.739> this<00:02:00.670> piece<00:02:01.149> here

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
the case of an accident this piece here

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.719 
the case of an accident this piece here
will<00:02:01.629> break<00:02:01.959> as<00:02:02.259> opposed<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:03.069> something<00:02:03.340> else

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
will break as opposed to something else

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.839 
will break as opposed to something else
such<00:02:04.030> as<00:02:04.060> your<00:02:04.420> spine<00:02:04.840> breaking<00:02:05.550> once<00:02:06.550> that's

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:06.849 
such as your spine breaking once that's

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:08.219 
such as your spine breaking once that's
out<00:02:07.030> of<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.239> way<00:02:07.270> you<00:02:07.420> can<00:02:07.629> break<00:02:07.869> it<00:02:08.050> down

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
out of the way you can break it down

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.859 
out of the way you can break it down
like<00:02:08.289> that<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:09.069> it<00:02:09.489> comes<00:02:09.789> packs<00:02:10.239> downs<00:02:10.539> for

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
like that and it comes packs downs for

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.470 
like that and it comes packs downs for
nice<00:02:11.110> small<00:02:11.800> transport<00:02:12.670> you<00:02:13.090> can<00:02:13.209> imagine

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
nice small transport you can imagine

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.600 
nice small transport you can imagine
that<00:02:13.900> could<00:02:14.319> go<00:02:14.440> into<00:02:14.590> gear<00:02:14.920> bag<00:02:15.190> fairly

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
that could go into gear bag fairly

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.970 
that could go into gear bag fairly
easily<00:02:15.870> now<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.930> final<00:02:17.230> little<00:02:17.560> part<00:02:17.800> that<00:02:17.920> we

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
easily now the final little part that we

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.040 
easily now the final little part that we
haven't<00:02:18.280> mentioned<00:02:18.730> here<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:19.150> these<00:02:19.720> little

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
haven't mentioned here is these little

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.119 
haven't mentioned here is these little
tabs<00:02:20.290> there<00:02:20.969> they<00:02:21.969> are<00:02:22.000> for<00:02:22.629> the<00:02:23.200> elastic

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
tabs there they are for the elastic

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.680 
tabs there they are for the elastic
which<00:02:24.519> keeps<00:02:24.909> it<00:02:25.150> down

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
which keeps it down

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.660 
which keeps it down
I<00:02:25.810> think<00:02:26.260> they<00:02:26.410> call<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.680> like<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.040> X<00:02:27.280> loop

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
I think they call it like the X loop

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.330 
I think they call it like the X loop
system<00:02:28.270> or<00:02:28.420> something<00:02:28.900> like<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:29.340> basically

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
system or something like that basically

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.190 
system or something like that basically
they're<00:02:30.520> just<00:02:30.700> big<00:02:30.880> elastic<00:02:31.450> bands<00:02:31.690> that<00:02:32.020> keep

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
they're just big elastic bands that keep

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.590 
they're just big elastic bands that keep
it<00:02:32.350> down<00:02:32.530> against<00:02:33.220> your<00:02:33.670> shoulders<00:02:34.270> in<00:02:34.450> your

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
it down against your shoulders in your

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.960 
it down against your shoulders in your
chest<00:02:34.960> which<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:35.260> where<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.800> should<00:02:35.830> be<00:02:36.070> now

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
chest which is where it should be now

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.570 
chest which is where it should be now
