00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:10.290
 e-4 f3 horse here we try to debut four 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.530
 horses to play against men and din 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:18.869
 bit version horse hits e5 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:23.580
 experimentally until 4 and 5 ended 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:27.300
 screen t5 g5 to recommendation array c6 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.859
 elephant back on battery elephant 6 plays 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.649
 it's all been tested so many times 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.059
 here what is there that you can play 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.750
 Estonian fy 6 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.149
 fergey 4 cook sweat long 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.910
 castling well let's try it and do 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.270
 took here 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.270
 movies 4 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.270
 through to 7 most likely yes he is 5 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.660
 now is an interesting moment exchange tier 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.230
 floor elephants but then weak fields 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:06.400
 d65 long castling for now let him take in 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.970
 In principle, they are not against the horse I 4 above 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.400
 watch what the opponent will do 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:17.390
 carefully so follow the ring 5 options 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:22.130
 there is so here too 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:25.190
 take here and will end badly 5 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.810
 game up 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.810
 what did he count on 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.620
 so took here 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.620
 also took on the same 5 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.750
 such a position is two pawns per vivi piece 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.750
 gave the second pawn look now how 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.160
 will play plays here gives more and 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.800
 third pawn but here will be already 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.010
 interesting I think so they took to play 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.140
 dad better not yet change the connection and 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.140
 leave the queens to play horse yes no 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.270
 I'll trade all the same pawns here 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.030
 not bad now for another 7 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.880
 grab as he will later play 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:24.600
 flour took another 4 pawns per piece 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:27.360
 turned out not bad so well played 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.950
 here it is calm here now 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.900
 answer f3 you can go rook ev1 as 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.660
 better to see what will happen next 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.660
 do partner what will do not 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.870
 quite understandable in 3 so far he is 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.290
 will make partners with such 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.110
 checkers so playing a horse in 5 will change 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.140
 well ok i don't mind 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:55.200
 the more pawns the less will be 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.130
 here the figures will be easier to emphasize 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.070
 the importance of pawns is exactly like this 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:07.250
 so also four notes in 4 would like 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.250
 put so while playing here 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.170
 so now he conner 4 it seems like you can 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.629
 do perch in 4 plays with the idea of horses barely 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.459
 Shah Dag 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:22.599
 from act act act act act act act act act 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.760
 act 1 v2 is obliged to play well that will be adjusted 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:28.420
 nadya to 4 black she has two acting out 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.920
 rush own you more neatly so 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.760
 play horse e3 here 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.150
 I plotted on trechok horse her peak 3 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.970
 until I defend the d4 pawn 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.160
 stabilize pawn structure 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.319
 now i'm here and then do 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.670
 holding pawns queens little 40 and 40 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:53.790
 seconds left more formalized in 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:57.250
 4 frets f1 king strengthen and then 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.220
 optimistic about what is happening 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:05.769
 King e4 one Valeev also spend 4 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:09.040
 and the winning position is likely just 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:13.829
 it is necessary now to play neatly and not 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.829
 do nonsense h3 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.520
 where is 1 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.510
 only against such a crowd of pawns filter 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:29.000
 will do 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.320
 white consolidated position and code 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.320
 here is clearly inferior 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.479
 black test batches thought 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.020
 Today I spend, let's see what will happen 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.220
 records 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:53.169
 so what's there on the same 4 going 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:57.220
 whole kilo here Deev 3 until I prepare b 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:05:01.210
 34 stood out a horse from the parking lot should be 5 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.880
 then still the length of g4 here is also pawns 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:08.289
 eat used people have more oxygen 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:11.590
 so ac4 plays here first buddy 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:19.080
 a little bit you didn't have time sorry bro 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:22.080
 Wows, gives back, guys, I'm sorry 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.080
 bro 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.409
 three extra checkers and tatyana donkey well 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:32.630
 so here 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:34.870
 shah 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:38.150
 became him 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.180
 this grandfather show is singing 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.720
 took here 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.650
 Yes, I lose the position by time 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.650
 won 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.940
 f10
