 the world of alexis marquez 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.190
 how to develop wealth 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.190
 of our knowledge 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.320
 and it is required to be competitive that we need as a country when entering the 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.810
 First world 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.810
 what does the term first world mean 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.780
 what is the destiny of mexico and latin america in the 21st century 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.570
 How the threat of globalization can be turned into an opportunity 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.500
 could Mexicans and Latin Americans be admired and 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.490
 respected in the world some day 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.490
 we can two Latin Americans learn to generate wealth 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.710

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.750
 in education how can we learn to become education and training 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.040
 in competitiveness weapon 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.869
 how can we transform the obligation of them 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.189
 Jews and training in intellectual pleasure source 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.150
 the privilege of sharing 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.340
 you have to raise the threshold of managing adversity in the human being 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.890
 like the intelligence potential 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.409
 we can convert to education and training 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.799
 in a source of pleasure through yasir the entertaining and entertaining 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.810
 you can land to education in an element to 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.799
 but that stops being a very intellectual player and becomes a resource 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.249
 real survival 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:18.249
 we can learn to make the knowledge profitable 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:20.469
 we can develop 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:25.439
 and they learned effective methods, live learning voices to create capital 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.519
 intellectual from new sources of knowledge 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:31.670
 in the values 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.670
 what is the impact of ethical values ​​on productivity 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:39.079
 how to learn to differentiate the passive values ​​that brought it out 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.650
 because germany 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.330
 an istat dresser in the store studies his profession for four years 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.410
 whereas in Latin America it only spends an average of eight days 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:54.229
 that leadership as trustee 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:58.639
 because today active values ​​are required as lassana aggressiveness power 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:02:59.450
 of decision 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.620
 the internal force the will to succeed and the healthy ambition more than 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.659
 positive values 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.939
 how our values ​​of visas and passed will influence in 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.889
 our attitude and behavior 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.329
 how can we have a personal quality plan to develop the 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.120
 transparency and honesty 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.120
 to turn them into sowers and confidence 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:27.559
 in futurology and prospective what is the impact of long-term planning 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:28.320
 term 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.510
 and the discipline of learning to think in future time 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:35.029
 that is a trend friend 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:38.079
 because he denied that mouth 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:45.109
 2 and three races at 50 and they feel very much and also refines a 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.659
 average of six languages 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.430
 in what way the development of the case 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.430
 such intellectual guarantees us the purchase of a 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.480
 united states has 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.010
 there companies that do planning for the next 200 years in both 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.120
 that our country hardly learn to plan next year 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.360
 because in Latin America and in the third world 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.979
 we are always late to the delivery of the op 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:16.169
 business units in the world 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.859
 Latin America there are a thousand historians for each futurologist 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.740
 and because he has always liked the tests at a glance and 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.740
 they spent more history in planning our future 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.550
 in marketing 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.639
 We can create real strategies that allow us to market our 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.059
 plans or 

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:38.020
 my dreams 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.620
 we can achieve that marketing then is the profession of some 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.430
 how many 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.810
 we can turn it into an attitude that allows us to take advantage of our 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.110
 environment 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.520
 the market economy that exists in the 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.199
 2 is a threat 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.169
 an opportunity 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.169
 to what extent the action lise personal active 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.039
 a decisive role in the success of marketing 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:08.210
 what is the use of having great ideas if we are not capable of concretizing them and of 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.399
 turn them into prosperous businesses and a source of survival 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.780
 because before so many cases in the world of people 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.060
 that appropriate the ideas of others 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.650
 and they could carry them out in a more efficient way because their own 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.150
 inventors 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.540
 because there are people who seem to be always turning 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.539
 around the ideas of others 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:30.650
 and because there 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.650
 just a few that are able to implement in putting their ideas to the 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:38.409
 exquisite and haiti 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:41.539
 nuclear with our own ideas 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.180
 these SMEs 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.270
 hundreds and maybe thousands of other questions we all ask 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.500
 an unconscious way 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.499
 at the beginning of the new millennium 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:53.919
 before a panorama of globalization 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.120
 that some people find scary while others think 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.039
 full of opportunities and inspiration 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.419
 it makes us stop to think and reflect 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.819
 the moment of our lives as maybe we are doing today 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.439
 The importance of creating 

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:14.559
 a specific strategy to learn to attach value to our ideas 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.789
 so is 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:17.990
 the one who knows 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.949
 but he does not know how to explain what he knows, it's as if they knew nothing 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.029
 it is useless to have high developed knowledge 

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:31.579
 even finds and inventions created if we are unable to place them in the 

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:32.339
 market 

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:35.229
 or in other words to convince others 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:37.889
 about what we have invented 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:40.230
 get a legitimate benefit from them
