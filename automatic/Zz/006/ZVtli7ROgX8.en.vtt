00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.660
 go straight to the make-up 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.620
 First, I use mine 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.620
 moisturizer from like us 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.930

 other tv cream but today or 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.090
 at least most of the time I used ran from 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:27.720
 Astor and I can catch that first 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:31.470
 whole face on then I use mine 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.300
 wife of patrice and sap 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.320
 I did something wrong and 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.530
 Although how do I actually use 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.850
 concealer and then my brother 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.750
 but I have it somehow 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.399
 research done 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.000
 So you let them I belong 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.710
 actually the other way round for the whole thing 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:55.619
 we use I do my concealer of 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:57.509
 mac is next at 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.380
 eyebrow pencil the iss from the kalinka 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.380
 similar to eating 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.970
 and then I use my translucent 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.020
 Character eyes run 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.910
 I actually make up my face every day 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.770
 with one of these three palettes and 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.680
 I do not have that day like the one from 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.480
 Katie decided 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.900
 First, I wear a light pink color 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.610
 on my whole complete song 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.130
 and then I just always take it 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.100
 the bright color palette has been 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.739
 it is and use the for the angle 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.130
 and for up to the high guided by the 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.130
 leave eyes 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.710
 then I use them if the brown ones 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.020
 hair or otherwise often times mine 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.740
 eggplant color then I own in 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.410
 my eyes case may involve football 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:02.420
 English but therefore, anyway 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.790
 it yes and that blinds then and then 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.400
 I give my channel in my grandma's 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:19.430
 waterline and then later in 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:21.350
 my lower next station if mine 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.610
 But you do not love that either 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.570
 every day it depends how the 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.540
 have time 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.490
 and yes I want that very easily 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.890
 Unfortunately today, for something thick 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.630
 that you are a bit thinner but you know 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.900
 Of course, never again will everyone 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.750
 different day and here I decide 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.100
 just what mascara I am today and am 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.540
 I then end up for the colossi 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.720
 but roll is from maybelline 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.130
 decided and are you mascara 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.150
 abstract that I start there 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.550
 most of the time it only has to be for the school 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.739
 a lip care stick but today i 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.610
 make this news lipstick 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.610
 decided to delete 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.220
 then I have a bit of it all 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.190
 made-up is very easy 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.260
 but became nevertheless it went very well 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.590
 You can tell me you guys 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.860
 I like that it was shocking 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.860

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.729

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.270

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.610

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.280

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.690
