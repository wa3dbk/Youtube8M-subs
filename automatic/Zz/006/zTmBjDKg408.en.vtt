00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.600 
terabyte or eight thousand GB hard drive
you<00:00:06.930> most<00:00:07.290> of<00:00:07.440> your<00:00:07.589> thing<00:00:07.859> basically<00:00:08.189> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
you most of your thing basically the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.299 
you most of your thing basically the
platter<00:00:08.940> hard<00:00:09.330> drive<00:00:09.570> at<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.230> indeed<00:00:10.769> not

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
platter hard drive at that indeed not

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.330 
platter hard drive at that indeed not
shooting<00:00:12.030> all<00:00:12.330> SSD<00:00:13.049> are<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.380> future<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.980> day

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
shooting all SSD are the future in day

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.349 
shooting all SSD are the future in day
to<00:00:14.400> not<00:00:14.849> indeed<00:00:15.980> basically<00:00:17.090> still<00:00:18.090> we<00:00:18.330> are

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
to not indeed basically still we are

to not indeed basically still we are
going<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.990> use<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.199> platter<00:00:19.619> harder<00:00:20.220> for<00:00:20.369> next

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
going to use a platter harder for next

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.179 
going to use a platter harder for next
100<00:00:21.449> yet<00:00:21.570> do<00:00:21.750> not<00:00:21.779> argue<00:00:22.170> with<00:00:22.380> me<00:00:22.890> basically

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
100 yet do not argue with me basically

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.820 
100 yet do not argue with me basically
after<00:00:24.090> one<00:00:24.539> here<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:25.019> are<00:00:25.140> going<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.650> have<00:00:25.800> a

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
after one here we are going to have a

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.660 
after one here we are going to have a
what<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:26.910> called<00:00:27.320> zettabyte<00:00:28.609> basically<00:00:29.609> I

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
what is called zettabyte basically I

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.290 
what is called zettabyte basically I
think<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.029> 100<00:00:31.019> 1000<00:00:31.619> billion<00:00:32.300> basically

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
think is 100 1000 billion basically

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.950 
think is 100 1000 billion basically
terabyte<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.980> really<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.790> big<00:00:36.210> high<00:00:36.510> number<00:00:36.899> I

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
terabyte is really so big high number I

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.990 
terabyte is really so big high number I
really<00:00:37.649> couldn't<00:00:37.950> calculate<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.520> my<00:00:38.700> mind

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
really couldn't calculate in my mind

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.680 
really couldn't calculate in my mind
basically<00:00:39.980> basically<00:00:40.980> today<00:00:41.610> I'm<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.210> going

expensive<00:02:10.110> we<00:02:10.500> really<00:02:10.770> could<00:02:11.009> not<00:02:11.099> put<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.520> lot

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
expensive we really could not put a lot

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.820 
expensive we really could not put a lot
so<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.750> hardware<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.379> make

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
so in the hardware to make

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.950 
so in the hardware to make
the<00:02:13.950> harder<00:02:14.250> faster<00:02:14.460> maxima<00:02:15.150> cashew<00:02:15.540> always<00:02:15.930> a

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
the harder faster maxima cashew always a

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.890 
the harder faster maxima cashew always a
64<00:02:16.590> megabyte<00:02:17.130> on<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.490> large-capacity<00:02:18.030> harder

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
64 megabyte on the large-capacity harder

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.600 
64 megabyte on the large-capacity harder
but<00:02:19.220> this<00:02:20.220> secret<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:21.000> terabyte<00:02:21.570> have<00:02:22.610> 128

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
but this secret a terabyte have 128

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.850 
but this secret a terabyte have 128
megabytes<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.540> means<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.110> information<00:02:25.350> to

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
megabytes so it means the information to

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.640 
megabytes so it means the information to
really<00:02:26.010> need<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.490> I<00:02:26.520> mean<00:02:27.020> process<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.410> CP

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
really need to I mean process to the CP

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.040 
really need to I mean process to the CP
or<00:02:28.830> program<00:02:29.460> it<00:02:29.730> gets<00:02:30.000> stored<00:02:30.210> in<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.750> cache

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
or program it gets stored in that cache

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.380 
or program it gets stored in that cache
in<00:02:31.380> 100<00:02:31.950> di<00:02:32.190> can<00:02:32.870> basically<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.620> really<00:02:35.160> also

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
in 100 di can basically is really also

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.820 
in 100 di can basically is really also
basically<00:02:36.390> another<00:02:36.960> good<00:02:37.320> thing<00:02:37.350> about<00:02:37.620> this

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
basically another good thing about this

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.130 
basically another good thing about this
harder<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.520> it<00:02:38.580> have<00:02:39.210> a<00:02:39.240> really<00:02:39.570> good<00:02:39.810> read<00:02:40.110> and

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
harder is it have a really good read and

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.320 
harder is it have a really good read and
write<00:02:40.530> speed<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.280> read<00:02:41.490> speed<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:41.910> this<00:02:42.060> hard

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
write speed that read speed of this hard

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.140 
write speed that read speed of this hard
drive<00:02:42.660> is<00:02:42.810> basically<00:02:43.340> 119<00:02:44.340> megabytes<00:02:45.030> per

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
drive is basically 119 megabytes per

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.750 
drive is basically 119 megabytes per
second<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.780> basically<00:02:46.380> is<00:02:46.800> a<00:02:46.860> good<00:02:47.160> hard<00:02:47.460> drive

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
second it basically is a good hard drive

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.720 
second it basically is a good hard drive
so<00:02:48.030> in<00:02:48.210> summary<00:02:48.960> basically<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.740> terabyte<00:02:50.520> hard

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
so in summary basically a terabyte hard

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.330 
so in summary basically a terabyte hard
drive<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.120> C<00:02:51.300> again<00:02:51.600> only<00:02:51.870> cost<00:02:52.230> 160<00:02:52.710> bucks

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
drive of C again only cost 160 bucks

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
drive of C again only cost 160 bucks
plus<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:54.210> mean<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:55.410> best<00:02:55.650> thing<00:02:55.890> is<00:02:56.070> is<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.360> 128

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
plus I mean the best thing is is a 128

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.020 
plus I mean the best thing is is a 128
megabyte<00:02:58.020> cache<00:02:58.320> which<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.310> double<00:02:59.730> than<00:02:59.880> the

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
megabyte cache which is double than the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.240 
megabyte cache which is double than the
regular<00:03:00.420> 64<00:03:00.900> megabyte<00:03:01.320> K<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.770> then<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.070> have<00:03:02.220> a

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
regular 64 megabyte K and then it have a

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.450 
regular 64 megabyte K and then it have a
7.5<00:03:02.880> what<00:03:03.360> is<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.020> power<00:03:04.260> supply<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:05.070> need

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
7.5 what is the power supply it need

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.950 
7.5 what is the power supply it need
basically<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:06.060> can<00:03:06.180> put<00:03:06.420> four<00:03:06.660> hard<00:03:06.900> drives

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
basically you can put four hard drives

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.840 
basically you can put four hard drives
no<00:03:07.230> Dexter<00:03:07.590> computer<00:03:08.040> not<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.280> worry<00:03:08.640> about

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
no Dexter computer not to worry about

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.420 
no Dexter computer not to worry about
that<00:03:09.420> your<00:03:10.230> power<00:03:10.500> supply<00:03:10.740> I<00:03:10.950> mean<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.340> is

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
that your power supply I mean it is

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.300 
that your power supply I mean it is
going<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.880> overrun<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.750> power<00:03:13.080> which<00:03:13.380> is<00:03:13.620> the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
going to overrun the power which is the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.490 
going to overrun the power which is the
power<00:03:14.820> which<00:03:15.150> is<00:03:15.330> required<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.780> run<00:03:15.960> the<00:03:16.020> pc

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
power which is required to run the pc

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.320 
power which is required to run the pc
basically<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.100> can<00:03:17.250> just<00:03:17.490> throw<00:03:17.790> even<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.239> our

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
basically you can just throw even in our

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.020 
basically you can just throw even in our
203<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.260> up<00:03:19.410> watt<00:03:20.070> power<00:03:20.310> supply<00:03:20.459> with<00:03:20.820> no

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
203 and up watt power supply with no

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.949 
203 and up watt power supply with no
problem<00:03:22.010> basically<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.550> would<00:03:24.450> recommend<00:03:24.870> this
