so in the last video cat scan the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.740 
so in the last video cat scan the
strategy<00:00:36.210> was<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:38.180> focus<00:00:39.180> only<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
strategy was to focus only on the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.880 
strategy was to focus only on the
fighter

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
fighter

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.580 
fighter
only<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> fighter<00:00:41.850> pods<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:43.140> battle<00:00:43.379> pots

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.470 
only on the fighter pods the battle pots
are<00:00:44.250> going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:44.640> still<00:00:44.940> kind<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.300> be

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
are going to be still kind of be

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.319 
are going to be still kind of be
attacking<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.879> still<00:00:48.059> need<00:00:48.210> to

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
attacking you and you still need to

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.880 
attacking you and you still need to
defend<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.780> cat's<00:00:48.989> eye<00:00:49.170> as<00:00:49.379> you're<00:00:49.559> coming<00:00:49.710> in

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
defend the cat's eye as you're coming in

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.090 
defend the cat's eye as you're coming in
on<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.070> reentry<00:00:50.640> but<00:00:51.480> deal<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.110> now<00:00:52.350> you're

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
on this reentry but deal is now you're

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.250 
on this reentry but deal is now you're
gonna<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.399> more<00:00:53.610> fighter<00:00:53.910> pods<00:00:54.239> than<00:00:54.989> just

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
gonna have more fighter pods than just

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.869 
gonna have more fighter pods than just
one<00:00:55.500> on<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> screen<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.340> think<00:00:56.579> there<00:00:56.699> might<00:00:56.850> be

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
one on the screen I think there might be

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.360 
one on the screen I think there might be
two<00:00:57.149> or<00:00:57.300> three<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.890> still<00:00:59.070> need<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.280> make

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
two or three so you still need to make

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.830 
two or three so you still need to make
them<00:00:59.520> your<00:00:59.670> primary<00:01:00.120> focus<00:01:01.280> again<00:01:02.629> mostly<00:01:03.629> use

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
them your primary focus again mostly use

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.550 
them your primary focus again mostly use
your<00:01:03.989> cannon<00:01:04.260> fire<00:01:06.140> conserve<00:01:07.140> some<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.380> your

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
your cannon fire conserve some of your

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.429 
your cannon fire conserve some of your
missiles<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.970> cat's<00:01:09.180> eye<00:01:09.390> you'll<00:01:10.140> notice

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
missiles the cat's eye you'll notice

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.380 
missiles the cat's eye you'll notice
you'll<00:01:10.710> ninnie<00:01:10.920> need<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.820> look<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.150> going

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
you'll ninnie need to look for going

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.719 
you'll ninnie need to look for going
down<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.439> constantly<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.130> down<00:01:14.520> in

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
down it's it's constantly going down in

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.210 
down it's it's constantly going down in
altitude<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.479> if<00:01:16.110> you're<00:01:16.350> getting<00:01:16.890> caught<00:01:17.070> up

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
altitude so if you're getting caught up

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.859 
altitude so if you're getting caught up
fighting<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.729> then<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.909> try<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.150> realize<00:01:18.689> hey

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
fighting and then you try to realize hey

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.580 
fighting and then you try to realize hey
I<00:01:18.900> need<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.200> go<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.439> see<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:20.430> boost<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
I need to go and see it just boost and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.469 
I need to go and see it just boost and
tend<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> fly<00:01:22.860> down<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.520> altitude<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.210> you'll

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
tend to fly down in altitude and you'll

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.050 
tend to fly down in altitude and you'll
catch<00:01:24.720> back<00:01:24.960> up<00:01:24.990> with<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:26.369> don't<00:01:26.790> stray

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
catch back up with it but don't stray

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.999 
catch back up with it but don't stray
too<00:01:27.090> far<00:01:27.270> from<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.840> keep<00:01:28.229> using<00:01:28.439> your<00:01:28.619> decoys

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
too far from it keep using your decoys

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.210 
too far from it keep using your decoys
around<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.670> focus<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.950> fighter<00:01:31.950> pods

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
around it and focus on the fighter pods

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.819 
around it and focus on the fighter pods
about<00:01:33.210> halfway<00:01:33.450> through<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.110> mission<00:01:34.470> you're

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
about halfway through the mission you're

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.490 
about halfway through the mission you're
gonna<00:01:35.040> get<00:01:35.280> mail<00:01:35.880> power<00:01:36.180> armor<00:01:36.570> units<00:01:36.840> but

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
gonna get mail power armor units but

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.530 
gonna get mail power armor units but
again<00:01:37.799> they<00:01:38.189> seem<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.549> be<00:01:38.640> focused<00:01:39.180> entirely

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
again they seem to be focused entirely

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.990 
again they seem to be focused entirely
on<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.490> ignore<00:01:41.820> them<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:43.820> stay<00:01:44.820> on

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
on you so just ignore them and stay on

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.030 
on you so just ignore them and stay on
the<00:01:45.210> fighter<00:01:45.720> pots<00:01:45.960> that's<00:01:46.649> really<00:01:46.920> about<00:01:47.040> it

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
the fighter pots that's really about it

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.710 
the fighter pots that's really about it
other<00:01:50.040> than<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.490> thought<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.119> I

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
other than that I thought that this I

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.420 
other than that I thought that this I
thought<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.560> mission<00:01:52.740> was<00:01:52.950> kind<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.220> neat

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
thought this mission was kind of neat

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.240 
thought this mission was kind of neat
just<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.030> terms<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.479> graphics<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.189> fact<00:01:56.189> that

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
just in terms of graphics the fact that

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.429 
just in terms of graphics the fact that
you're<00:01:56.430> kind<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.759> flying<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.659> entry

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
you're kind of flying in the entry

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.330 
you're kind of flying in the entry
atmosphere<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.280> I<00:02:00.380> thought<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:02.040> would<00:02:02.250> have

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
atmosphere and I thought it would have

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.539 
atmosphere and I thought it would have
been<00:02:02.430> even<00:02:02.700> cooler<00:02:03.000> if<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.890> game<00:02:05.070> designers

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
been even cooler if the game designers

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.690 
been even cooler if the game designers
had<00:02:05.700> put<00:02:06.590> some<00:02:07.590> little<00:02:07.740> animation<00:02:08.399> from<00:02:08.550> when

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
had put some little animation from when

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.190 
had put some little animation from when
you<00:02:08.789> shoot<00:02:09.000> down<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.179> fighter<00:02:09.539> pod<00:02:09.810> or<00:02:09.959> whatever

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
you shoot down a fighter pod or whatever

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.780 
you shoot down a fighter pod or whatever
instead<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.800> exploding<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.489> actually

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
instead of it exploding and actually

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.210 
instead of it exploding and actually
like<00:02:11.940> burns<00:02:12.209> up<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.660> atmosphere

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
like burns up in the atmosphere

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.390 
like burns up in the atmosphere
that<00:02:13.550> would<00:02:13.640> have<00:02:13.730> been<00:02:13.820> really<00:02:14.060> cool<00:02:14.270> but

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
that would have been really cool but
