00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:17.240
 Yes er by clicking the place no nothing of the mesh If you can up to this point and polygon reduction 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:22.340
 I have one more parameter here 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:25.189
 The thickness of this mesh when it clicks into polygons is actually 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.850
 It can be changed by the draw size 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.090
 Increase draw size and click 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:33.410
 Then a chunky polygon will be generated 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.770
 Thinning produces thin polygons 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.770
 In only if it was further to draw size 1 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.550
 There is no thickness 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:52.010
 Thick poly peaks are generated This is not the back side 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.960
 Only when the polygon of a single sheet is in the draw size position 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:01:00.500
 Will be generated 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.410
 There is no extra thickness only at draw side 1 and at other times sins are generated according to the draw size 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.920
 When 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:09.300
 This we become so say how this polo g brush 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.950
 So this time for the time being Draw size 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:16.250
 Let's go later without disaster prevention Follow the size 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:21.210
 In the state set after the draw size 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:28.200
 Click on the tool with the topology brush to polygonize 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:35.700
 The newly created Messi is the same subtool as the rice vinegar rice in this sailor suit 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:38.110
 Everything except for the part created inside as a new polygon is masked. 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.100
 I am 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.940
 Well, let's show this poly frame and this 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.600
 It's a bit hard to see 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:54.330
 The portion of the generated thickness is polygrouped and 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.830
 It will be made with Kleece in it, is it some kind of helpful function? 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:01.840
 Yes this is now 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:04.110
 This is another one because it comes with the subtool of the newly made model rack body. 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.770
 I would like to divide it into sub tools 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.300
 That's why I've masked it, though 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:16.210
 With the mask still being 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:22.340
 The visibility sub- palette at the bottom of the tool palette 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:24.500
 visi pili ty visibility sub-pallet hyde pt 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.830
 Press the button 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.130
 Yes pt 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:35.240
 medicine of pt also is because pt 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:40.490
 It will be an abbreviation of Siki point and if you do pt you 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:42.260
 Only the unmasked part generated this yes pt feature is applied 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.730
 Mesh has been hidden 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.170
 This is just the day of the delete day 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.170
 In this state 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:57.800
 Return to the top of the geometry palette 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.319
 Geometry Jain sub-tool does not try to pallet sub-tools sub-palette of 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.510
 Please open the split menu 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:08.379
 Even more button to split part 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.590
 Then it is new to the sub 2 palette 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:15.590
 now 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:17.420
 It is understood that the thickness of the moon mesh made from 1 topology brush is generated every time 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.890
 I think I can get 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.890
 Let's save once here 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.730
 10th Fukuda does not do 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:34.269
 Let's save the disc 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:35.769
 When various Toka It's time to make some kind happiness of parts because the REIT Po tools quite strong 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.520
 I think I can use it for 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:42.990
 It can be made hot as needed or not 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.990
 Please not miss master
