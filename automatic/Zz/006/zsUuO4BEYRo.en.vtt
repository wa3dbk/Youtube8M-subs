00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.290
 look could have done that good for 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.929
 that was roxana to tell us what 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.230
 you can do with a bathroom set that 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.810
 comes in white how can we decorate it 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.300
 the one that is divine in a super bathroom 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.109
 personal I have the set as I told you is 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.359
 I'm going to take the piece I'm going to 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.439
 clean it with cotton everything 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.690
 make your peace and be on slab or glass 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.660
 must be cleaned perfectly with cotton 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.329
 once I clean the piece with 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.079
 cotton this dries right away 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.120
 evaporates easily I will already have the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.030
 pieces the napkins that I chose in 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.480
 this case are vintage motives very 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.370
 romantic and good the idea is to cut 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.489
 of the piece of the paper napkin 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.340
 the designs that I'm going to need in 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.830
 this case 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.690
 as I told them are two romantic that of 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.870
 the rose this seemed a nice size 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.630
 to place it in the container where it is going to 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:12.770
 apply the liquid soap well then 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.250
 here I have already dry the sector where I go to 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.690
 do the decoupage I'm going to use 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.420
 adhesive and flexible varnish for 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:24.020
 to collapse in this case that's the first 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.060
 Adhesive step and flexible varnish after 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.810
 the same one that we use to do the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.070
 cups on fabric in wood in any 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.720
 other support this is the same product 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.300
 applied a good amount I'm not going to 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:43.399
 be afraid to pass me because everything 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:45.880
 What's left over afterwards is going to be 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.880
 remove 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.780
 I'm going to apply it 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.850
 so I will gently need the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.060
 sachet in this case a sachet 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.500
 of polypropylene supported it above 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.960
 the napkin where has the glasses 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.490
 that I'm going to face from the center towards 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.350
 outside that's going to help me get it done 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.620
 perfectly adhesion and remove 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.440
 any roughness or crease that 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.490
 I can get to form 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.330
 I'm going to gently rub Sixto well in 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.330
 the corners 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.860
 belt 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:31.000
 I remove my bag and it is already attached 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.090
 this I'm going to let it dry and left this 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 good step I have this is the second step 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.810
 it is already dry this step would be the one 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.840
 I did in the in the soap container 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.450
 liquid about this I have to make a 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.210
 application of the new again the 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.780
 product because I in a first step that 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:56.980
 I did I used it as an adhesive and the 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.560
 napkin then once it's 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.580
 adhered I have to protect what is the 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:07.410
 Second step did not apply clear varnish 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.720
 this step must also be dried 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.380
 once it is dry I already have it 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.750
 ready to protect definitely with 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.000
 the product that is shellac in color 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.650
 to which the shellac allows me in 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.210
 color to shellac gives me the 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.390
 possibility that this piece that I 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.520
 I'm working it's waterproofed 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.950
 it happens with this I can wash it 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.650
 times you need to sanitize it to 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.750
 wash it face it with a sponge and 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.420
 will give me the possibility that that does not 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.030
 lift is fully protected the 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.340
 shellac and color to waterproof and 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.250
 protect then I'm going to do that 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.260
 step in the bath that is pink already 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.640
 is attached and has both steps without 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.640
 adhesive and varnish 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:57.129
 I'm going to take 20 roses to clean the 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.040
 surplus now after shellac 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.930
 we must see that here it is noted as paco 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.060
 that remained on the slab then the 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.780
 adhesive in fact now I'm going to pass the 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.099
 Shellac has to dry very well 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.709
 after two hours or so when 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.650
 you take it again I repeat it a second 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:17.799
 I do not know if I already like how it was 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.259
 I let it dry well and with a damp cloth 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.600
 fruit all then this duty for this 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:24.669
 it turns out there is nothing fertile left 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.860
 clear it does not make sense to do it now 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.320
 because I would have to remove the man here 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.650
 also then what I'm going to do 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.449
 Now I'm going to moisten a brush with the 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:39.110
 shellac I will show here 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:42.899
 and I'm going to start brushing only in 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.999
 the sectors where I made the decoupage 

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:49.349
 coming out a little bit of the flat design 

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:49.349
 to protect the napkins 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:57.980
 All this 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.580
 evenly covering everything where there 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.580
 decoupage 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:08.580
 a hand we let dry very well 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:10.050
 when it absorbs we touch and that is not 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.839
 it adheres does not stick it does not have wheat 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.259
 we have to be very dry applied a 

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:19.289
 second hand well usually me 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:22.319
 I recommend at least two hands if I 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:25.050
 we give three better what you give in the 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:27.239
 Work term lacquer rubber is not 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.729
 wants to give shine acquires more brightness 

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:33.209
 The more you give it, the more shine 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:35.950
 those have two plus two hands only 

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:39.820
 two hands of shellac is color 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:44.440
 once this dry is a product to 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:46.510
 solvent this is what you achieve by 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.460
 that has a pretty clear smell and 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.740
 you must do remember the 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.600
 environments ventilated preferably in 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.200
 ventilated environments 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:59.380
 let it dry and it is ready well 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:03.910
 It's a very nice quick job to do 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:05.890
 it's very quick to be clear this can be 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.450
 make any piece that is made of earthenware 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.540
 of glass 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.730
 we can make jars dishes sources 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.300
 bowls there are many pieces to make with 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.950
 this 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.950
 roxana a pleasure as always
