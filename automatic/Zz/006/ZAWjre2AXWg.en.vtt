00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.370
 hello everyone we'll see with you 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.819
 wonderful program auslogics 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.450
 boostspeed 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.639
 the seventh version we include it 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.500
 It established a long time ago and the same 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.449
 program but earlier versions 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:21.990
 namely the fifth version in the given in the right 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.689
 Parts of the fifth version of a are indicated 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.510
 speed last seventh many by the way 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:32.279
 consider this fifth version of the 5510 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.710
 the most successful though I do not know maybe 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.739
 they are wrong someone read as 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.239
 many people get used to the fact that 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:43.170
 faced sometime earlier all for 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.309
 these changes are not very good close 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.079
 this program basically you see that 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.710
 here it was possible to increase somehow 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.899
 reduce 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.420
 window then at least in my 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.149
 currently new service version 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.829
 boost speed 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.600
 nothing is active beyond these boundaries in 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.199
 Unlike the fifth version I can not move 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.150
 okay close in principle they are decorated 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.640
 how is the version that just closed 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.040
 5 these are 7 services boostspeed 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.909
 we consider programs in one style 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.479
 there are such warm bluish colors and 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.210
 whitish gray most important tabs 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.890
 she now I have included such bend 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.990
 the main thing is then the privacy center 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.509
 acceleration support and all tools 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.290
 but to serve gu speed the fifth version was 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.500
 framed about this 6 years of color 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.710
 on the tab were on top let's still 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.380
 let's see how it was a system check 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.500
 most important adviser resources and 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.500
 instruments 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:51.659
 1 page home 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:53.640
 and suggest that we fix everything as 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.409
 I already checked my disk 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.750
 space cleared stability 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.439
 computer systems and speed also 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.399
 problem can be seen in more detail 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:07.890
 wrong fishermen help files and then and 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.340
 so back to the tab 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.629
 The main thing is looking at the privacy folder 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:19.910
 here we dream that you can delete 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:24.410
 certain private light let's not say 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.540
 so wrong i'm talking about data meaning 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.849
 tab conclude that when you 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.879
 clean up on them in privacy 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:34.120
 until taste and start a new test then 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.980
 you will have to be torn again 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.299
 let's say on those sites that you already 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.299
 led either 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.160
 there will be traces of your visit on the Internet 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.130
 program like here it is 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.329
 offers these traces for sites for 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.180
 adults honor and tracking cookies 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:58.760
 click clear 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.260
 27 tracks removed you can start a new one. 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.540
 check here, in principle, this tab 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.519
 why the program created flows into this 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.500
 just a little bass to protect your 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.940
 official data also has a center 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.280
 support, you can enable windows update 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.470
 for the operating system security 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.660
 surfing the internet but who wants here 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.350
 it can enable these features 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.000
 offered by this tab center 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.239
 support they will be active on your 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.040
 computer acceleration is possible here 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.810
 clear ps memory for use 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.790
 active programs enable 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.530
 corresponding auto application 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.620
 defragmentation when the computer is not 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.109
 also used it can be done well 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.660
 explanations let's say of vintage when 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:47.120
 you translate let's say on the processor 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.859
 optimization is immediately explained doing 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.319
 running the file in the application is faster like this 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.840
 running last change 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.689
 they can also go through everything and and 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.189
 on the right to read the explanations that you need 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:00.849
 all tools available 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:03.370
 disk defrag what am i using 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:06.459
 This program did but only the earliest 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.159
 Disk Defragmenter versions can 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.620
 read what the client register is for 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.750
 clean the register but there is a mass by the way 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.760
 specialized programs let's say 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.650
 wise registry fix it to me also 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.829
 installed there is an overview of it on you 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:27.960
 register the cleaner which cleans the register 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:30.849
 your computer registry apologize so 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.820
 registry optimization windows registry 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:34.990
 defrag startup manager allows 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.330
 sort the list of applications 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.770
 launched automatic system 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.440
 reduce it to at least for more 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.220
 quick launch helps solve 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:48.340
 push start here appears 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.900
 the corresponding function is also a window and 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.610
 in the old version of the program as far as 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.610
 remember tweak manager 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.099
 disk management 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.400
 There is a section please search and delete 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:05.949
 unnecessary duplicates 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:10.449
 application removal manager addition 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:13.630
 to system valid delete method 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:15.159
 applications you have installed but for 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.470
 uninstall the application I use 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:20.229
 revo program they became pk pro 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.880
 it does not suit here and icon as 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:25.509
 looks like a good application 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.520
 there are others to remove 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:30.130
 applications but you can use and 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:34.060
 built-in features vous 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.440

 depreciation boarding I don't know what 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.480
 here you can optimize when we 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:09.580
 let's say you're a toast so everything is fine 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:14.800
 work will give the manager service manager 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:17.320
 we can look at web resource management 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.920
 there is a security tab already looking 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.840
 file recovery helps to recover 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.360
 accidentally deleted files I used 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.680
 from this function and made her review shaft 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.380
 cases brought up nothing 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.590
 restored we can do it now 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:36.280
 it is better not to recover deleted from the card 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:40.020
 memory for certain video files 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.550
 saw nothing file shredder

 safe complete file deletion free 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:48.600
 space you are such a kind of combine 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:52.570
 now aru servants boostspeed where there is 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:55.120
 Any such functions we need a tab 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:57.160
 looked tools tab there 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.419
 run main parameters at startup

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:09.520
 delete deleted files permanently 

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:12.310
 you can turn them on but here you can 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.830
 several passes to make to remove 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:17.830

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:29.310
 can enable recovery in general all 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:31.960
 such things are not difficult function help

 online dating guide program 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.050
 In general, you can want this program 

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:38.190
 install try enough 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.190
 Hello everyone friends
