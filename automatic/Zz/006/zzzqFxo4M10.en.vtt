00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.880
 Hi, people are now two and 45 2 55 da 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.120

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.359
 I 'm recording this video that is 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.730
 rolling a general commotion in the city 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.710
 because it finally took almost 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.160
 end of the month of August, then already 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.349
 accumulated enough down there that you 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.849
 are also on the sidewalk in the middle of 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.630
 snow street 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:40.670
 I'll get you both falling. 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:43.649
 the flakes here because it's dark and more 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.559
 Maybe you'll see if tomorrow 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.530
 morning in a file house roof 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.230
 It is also dark here if tomorrow morning 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.920
 wake up you still have enough snow 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.379
 I want a second part for you 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.070
 to make a snow blog 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.969
 we want to do so , or even 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.439
 tomorrow 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.930
 Good morning we are now 8 7 am 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.570
 I just want to show you how it is. 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.490
 What are you doing after last night's snow? 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.280
 really after the 15 and 16 years without 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.250
 take enough yesterday 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.650
 this has changed I know many of you 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.270
 where was the car that came out today 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.610
 the roofs of the houses also have 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.400
 Grass I'll show you there on the other side. 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.990
 To you where the field is 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.439
 below will also show in the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.020
 garage on top of the cars really 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.450
 It took a lot yesterday morning. 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.000
 so I said I wanted to show the field 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.770
 for you but the field is after these and 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.229
 crappie the fifth will not give 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.290
 I'll show you down here where you have a 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.930
 land not yet built 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:03.000
 also high in snow 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.710
 the houses is also really I am 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.140
 impressed because the last time 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.810
 It snowed like this I was about four or five 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.310
 more than 15 years ago this 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.050
 So when I go down there I go 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.190
 get some of this snow for you 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.379
 to see how it is 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.360
 Hi guys, how are you? Everything here in the garage. 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.020
 of the building to show you how it is 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.670
 that's down here yes I'm mega 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.160
 full of clothes because it's very cold 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.650
 on the street but I'm here send the people off 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.720
 when I get to work then I go 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.980
 show you a little of how it is 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.980
 What is the snow down here? 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:43.170
 Good people, this was more or less the same. 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.430
 who fell out of anger is cup dawn was 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.090
 enough 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:52.890
 water bisch made 16 years did not fall so much 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:03:00.750
 snow, so let's see how it is 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:02.280
 here in cars is a very large layer 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.379
 You said you'll make it through the day. 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.280
 it's cloudy obviously there was one day 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:10.440
 well always but only here that fell out of 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.420
 snow and clear that if you do not send in 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.690
 child, never do this according to 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.290
 you will die here also has some 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:23.220
 you can not see frozen frost 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.440
 along with nelly that part here today to 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.230
 late thawing 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.870
 It's more or less this way. 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.140
 that the cars were left out 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.129
 I find it closer there, it 's obvious that you 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.129
 You have to be very careful. 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.239
 This is what fell out of the snow this morning 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.040
 must be three centimeters of snow 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:54.019
 it was not really enough for a 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.019
 a city that did not take much time 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.410
 We think this is going to be the last 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.300
 part of my snow blog I 'm already in 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.750
 I work that you're really here 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.430
 on the front is the paper that the arc series 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.990
 third group people artillery 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.530
 anti-aircraft caxias 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.180
 here in the center the ship is already freezing 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.460
 thawing a bit more than there in the 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:10.000
 neighborhood but still enjoys everything 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.250
 in the background is the church of the 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.750
 Capuchins to an inspired church 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.840
 a little more baroque where I want 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.820
 make a blog with all the churches here 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.720
 of the city has several influences of 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.990
 relatives 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.670
 but it 's raining here on the grass 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.950
 third place is already 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.600
 thawing a little more I hope 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.110
 that you have enjoyed if you 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.240
 liked blogs boss of themes then I 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.340
 I do more and when I have an event 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.020
 atypical here as snow seems to 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.200
 Last time it snowed like this in the 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:46.320
 town was in 94 so it was quite small 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.320
 same and this is it kisses and even more
