00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.880
 Good Morning Occidentally she has interviewed how to interview her now 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.290
 his first Bambi over time here is Nazan Eckes 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.130
 the sign painter were then 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.439
 I was born against cool or cool one would say guy 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.409
 my parents should be 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:30.949
 When I was six years old I asked my mother about Nicholas 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.130
 she said to me 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.000
 Clink my daughter 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.070
 Nicholas does not exist 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.310
 and I was the only one in the class on the sixth of December 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.900
 Candy boots has 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.240
 and today 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.500
 Nicholas comes to me almost 30 years later 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.360
 it is the proof I have arrived 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.290
 arrived in my native Germany 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.730
 I grew up in two cultures in the Turkish my parents us in the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.470
 German 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.520
 It was not always easy at the beginning 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.540
 but today I know 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.000
 Germany is my home 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.240
 the country has opened up more opportunities that I never would Rome otherwise 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.820
 would have had 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.090
 and like me, many of the three million people in Germany are involved 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.160
 Turkish roots 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.920
 the nimble Heicks for us security in a country that our parents still " 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.100
 decided very very strange 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.799
 the process he is everywhere under the buzzword integration is discussed 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.860
 is in full swing 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.150
 and the 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.900
 That's good 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.000
 a man 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.590
 with German and Turkish roots showed us this summer 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.770
 the light-footed and of course integration of 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.160
 can go 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.610
 WLS dar 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.190
 not so thesing 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.370
 the Turkish national team wanted him too 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.840
 that is to say we also absolutely wanted to have it 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.070
 the most harmonious Thiersee was always clear 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.360
 he grew up in Germany 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.120
 he went to school here 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.540
 his friends live here 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.560
 so 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.139
 he also plays for Germany 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.199
 and we are all 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:14.209
 the Germans and the Turks proud of him 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:20.579
 when Mesut Ozil led the German team in South Africa to the World Cup semi-final 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.529
 cheered German Stammtisch 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:25.529
 The rooms were returned to us together 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.469
 that he immediately conquered a place in Real Madrid among the best in the world 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:33.299
 has find german 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.089
 and rarely great 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:37.779
 and the few confused on both sides 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:40.919
 the Missa de see themselves want to complain 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:43.359
 are pretty lonely there 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:48.009
 they become of the obvious joy of the majority consequence in the 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.079
 Shadowed 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.219
 for a change, a big tabloid was once right 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:55.729
 wrote 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:58.389
 we still need many visits 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.139
 Until then we are glad that we have the one like her 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.339
 Bolivia 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:16.029
 the wm qualifier Germany against Turkey 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.109
 in the 79 minutes the preliminary decision 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:22.280
 Mesut Ozil 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.419
 he scores the 2 0 but rare 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:27.799
 because of course before the goal did 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.779
 and thrown out of space 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:31.449
 you could see that today 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:32.849
 Mesut Ozil 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.629
 is the symbol of this game 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.849
 his parents are from Turkey 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.849
 but he was born and raised in Gelsenkirchen 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:45.989
 At the age of 20, he decides on the German national team and 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.669
 shoot with a dream goal in the knockout stages of the World Cup in South Africa 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.489
 at Smartrac 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.489

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.419
 The monthly is the game through pictures 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:05.089
 There was no other nation except Germany 

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:08.829
 together with his teammates until we have a national SVO image for one 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.339
 successful integration 

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:13.789
 many have roots from other countries 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:16.409
 in the spring come very well clear with 3 0 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.469
 and prince of whatever origin 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:22.520
 Everyone is proud of this rousing team 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.020

 Firstly, thank you for the restoration 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:26.330

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.210
 Integration means becoming part of a clan in which you feel 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:33.449
 Brings in euros 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.110
 without losing his identity 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.110
 Integration means mutual respect 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:42.599
 all respect 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:47.299
