00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.010

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.110
 great for cycling world magazine 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.269

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.730
 the race also a greeting to me 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.130
 team storman campagnolo then I feel 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.449
 very happy to have achieved this title 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.580
 thank god things were given up 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.740
 the last day and we were able to get up with the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.660
 title of this return to points l 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.820
 always because the everyday were 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.040
 very difficult but yesterday was the most 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.740
 complicated where we always had to 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.930
 sacrifice 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.730
 to others than to my other classmates 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.220
 that were among the ten of the general 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.320
 but I think the sacrifice was for something 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.510
 very good team behaved very well 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.140
 and because thanks to them it is also that 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.970
 we have this title 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.380
 in the key to win then the 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.809
 strategy that we had mounted with the 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.610
 team the team I think you knew 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.040
 understand very well and we handle with with 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.180
 calm and tranquility and grace of 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.530
 things were given until the last rival 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.629
 Well, I think Colombia has always had 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.330
 rivals very strong runners of very 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.790
 high experience yes it was always 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.180
 evident that Colombia has very very high 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.770
 experience but well with very good 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.330
 strategies and with the help of the teacher 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:22.780
 and we had an advantage I think for its 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.950
 great technical experience traveled as 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.460
 it seemed 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.930
 so very nice I think I met 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.300
 quite from the land of Colombia that does not 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.160
 had known is the first time that 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.800
 I have a very big return here 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.619

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:45.620

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.670
 of more relevance that I have won here in 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.350

 we did a great demonstration day by day 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.650
 we were the most battling team and 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.660
 in a strategy that we set out to 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.970
 Riosucio we won the return to youth 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.069
 but the day before was pretty 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.920
 complicated for you but in the 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.349
 last stage could be maintained if I 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.590
 I think that one moment I was with the 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.840
 race a bit complicated but 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.550
 we suffer to defend ourselves well I have a great 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.849
 team and a great preparation with them 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.630
