00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.949 

the<00:00:01.770> general<00:00:02.310> idea<00:00:02.489> of<00:00:02.969> directional<00:00:03.510> felling

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
the general idea of directional felling

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.170 
the general idea of directional felling
is<00:00:04.200> that<00:00:04.439> you<00:00:04.560> first<00:00:04.859> saw<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.549> directional

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
is that you first saw a directional

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.510 
is that you first saw a directional
notch<00:00:06.480> which<00:00:07.140> determines<00:00:07.830> which<00:00:08.010> direction

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:08.520 
notch which determines which direction

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.270 
notch which determines which direction
the<00:00:08.760> tree<00:00:08.969> will<00:00:09.180> fall<00:00:09.350> the<00:00:10.350> directional<00:00:11.039> knot

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
the tree will fall the directional knot

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.910 
the tree will fall the directional knot
can<00:00:11.549> be<00:00:11.670> made<00:00:11.850> in<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.090> variety<00:00:12.270> of<00:00:12.660> ways<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.740> one

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
can be made in a variety of ways the one

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.500 
can be made in a variety of ways the one
we're<00:00:14.129> showing<00:00:14.160> here<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.879> called<00:00:15.180> the<00:00:15.299> open

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:15.510 
we're showing here is called the open

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:23.480 
we're showing here is called the open
directional<00:00:16.470> notch<00:00:21.770> firstly<00:00:22.770> you<00:00:22.980> make<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.190> top

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
directional notch firstly you make a top

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.700 
directional notch firstly you make a top
cut<00:00:23.789> into<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.360> stem<00:00:24.660> at<00:00:24.900> an<00:00:25.020> angle<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.500> about

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
cut into the stem at an angle of about

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.800 
cut into the stem at an angle of about
60<00:00:26.220> degrees<00:00:28.130> saw<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.190> a<00:00:29.430> depth<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.910> about<00:00:30.030> 20<00:00:30.660> to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
60 degrees saw to a depth of about 20 to

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.300 
60 degrees saw to a depth of about 20 to
25%<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.920> trees<00:00:32.160> diameter<00:00:34.040> then<00:00:35.040> make<00:00:35.280> a

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.310 
25% of the trees diameter then make a

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.470 
25% of the trees diameter then make a
horizontal<00:00:35.730> undercut<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.780> meet<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.140> top<00:00:37.380> cut

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
horizontal undercut to meet the top cut

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.180 
horizontal undercut to meet the top cut
next<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.720> saw<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> horizontal<00:00:40.800> felling<00:00:41.160> cut

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
next you saw a horizontal felling cut

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.400 
next you saw a horizontal felling cut
slightly<00:00:41.910> above<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.329> level<00:00:42.630> of<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.840> undercut

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
slightly above the level of the undercut

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.740 
slightly above the level of the undercut
it's<00:00:44.160> important<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.790> you<00:00:45.149> stop<00:00:45.450> flowing

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
it's important that you stop flowing

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.690 
it's important that you stop flowing
just<00:00:46.140> before<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.620> reach<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.070> directional

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
just before you reach the directional

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.630 
just before you reach the directional
notch<00:00:47.970> leaving<00:00:48.840> what<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.110> called<00:00:49.380> a<00:00:49.500> hinge<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
notch leaving what is called a hinge the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.709 
notch leaving what is called a hinge the
hinge<00:00:50.880> guides<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.600> tree<00:00:51.809> as<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.110> falls<00:00:52.380> the

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
hinge guides the tree as it falls the

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.479 
hinge guides the tree as it falls the
hinge<00:00:54.719> should<00:00:55.140> be<00:00:55.320> 10%<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.250> trees

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
hinge should be 10% of the trees

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:07.029 
hinge should be 10% of the trees
diameter<00:00:57.180> or<00:00:57.360> at<00:00:57.450> least<00:00:57.690> 2<00:00:57.899> centimeters<00:00:58.590> wide

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:07.039 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:09.770 

how<00:01:08.039> you<00:01:08.100> use<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.759> saw<00:01:08.999> when<00:01:09.270> felling<00:01:09.659> is

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
how you use the saw when felling is

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.779 
how you use the saw when felling is
decided<00:01:10.319> in<00:01:10.439> part<00:01:10.740> by<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.039> thickness<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.639> the

tree first let's look at what you do

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.300 
tree first let's look at what you do
when<00:01:15.719> the<00:01:15.840> bar<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.079> longer<00:01:16.770> than<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> diameter

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
when the bar is longer than the diameter

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.810 
when the bar is longer than the diameter
of<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.909> tree
