00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 I was very young, they told me you can 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:18.390
 they propelled in every way 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:19.980
 Even nobody knows but says a lot 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.220
 people a lot of people believe that this was 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.439
 planned this was not true I had two 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.269
 cards two yellow and two red and 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.730
 everything came up because once in Zacatecas 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.529
 in leagues in shadows of many years I was going to 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.570
 bother a player and did a lot 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.690
 cold and he snatches the card from me 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.690
 the removes 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:49.340
 the card card if I do not have come not 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:01.620
 but if they change, no, no, he did not give it to me 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.140
 already apart from that he took the cards but 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.250
 will use the two yellow and two red 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.560
 foreseeing if later in the center life 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.240
 He gave me time for anything and that day 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.680
 came two games that are causing and 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.479
 everything and they were a bit messy 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.399
 the party sent them to Gio sent them 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.140
 call but I had a yellow the 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.070
 another one but not all the ones reprimanded 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.560
 the card 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.360
 He did not score there and took this card 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.080
 that was not where they had been reprimanded 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.170
 then piggyback 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.170
 very well 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.550
 there's a graph that says there's 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.960
 admonish raising the hand to the player 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.060
 the offender tells you about the truth of 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.670
 one player game yes but never you 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.250
 says of two obviously how a broke 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.990
 traditional logical scheme if it was like 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.000
 well it was critical and that you have to 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.399
 take responsibility that always 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.560
 it cost dear because it almost cost me 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.450
 the cup the world I had to start another 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.020
 time to apply stone now 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.149
 to work to obtain credibility the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.159
 called is you have to innovate you have to be 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.100
 a transformation change agent 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.100
 but always with their respective 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.100
 shrillness
