00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:31.769 

I<00:00:29.789> think<00:00:30.789> it's<00:00:30.939> important<00:00:31.330> to<00:00:31.450> have<00:00:31.480> a<00:00:31.630> good

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
I think it's important to have a good

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.350 
I think it's important to have a good
relationship<00:00:32.290> with<00:00:32.739> a<00:00:32.890> fence<00:00:33.160> and<00:00:33.640> I<00:00:34.120> think

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
relationship with a fence and I think

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.060 
relationship with a fence and I think
there<00:00:34.510> was<00:00:34.629> a<00:00:34.660> great<00:00:34.960> because<00:00:35.559> every<00:00:36.010> time

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
there was a great because every time

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.220 
there was a great because every time
when<00:00:36.340> I<00:00:36.370> heard<00:00:36.610> my<00:00:36.790> name<00:00:36.820> there<00:00:37.750> was<00:00:37.870> I<00:00:37.989> feel<00:00:38.199> a

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
when I heard my name there was I feel a

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.470 
when I heard my name there was I feel a
lot<00:00:38.320> of<00:00:38.440> bar<00:00:38.769> so<00:00:39.580> then<00:00:39.850> I<00:00:39.940> can<00:00:40.090> play<00:00:40.269> a<00:00:40.300> little

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
lot of bar so then I can play a little

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.500 
lot of bar so then I can play a little
bit<00:00:40.720> better<00:00:41.140> and<00:00:41.470> with<00:00:42.280> a<00:00:42.370> lot<00:00:42.519> of<00:00:42.550> confidence

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
bit better and with a lot of confidence

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.710 
bit better and with a lot of confidence
i<00:00:43.930> think<00:00:44.470> the<00:00:45.160> support<00:00:45.550> of<00:00:45.640> defense<00:00:46.059> is<00:00:46.300> very

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
i think the support of defense is very

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.670 
i think the support of defense is very
important<00:00:47.230> to<00:00:47.440> us<00:00:47.830> players<00:00:48.960> because<00:00:49.960> you<00:00:50.440> feel

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
important to us players because you feel

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.810 
important to us players because you feel
the<00:00:50.920> atmosphere<00:00:51.100> and<00:00:51.730> like<00:00:52.600> what<00:00:52.840> you<00:00:52.989> said

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
the atmosphere and like what you said

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.700 
the atmosphere and like what you said
you<00:00:54.820> get<00:00:55.000> better<00:00:55.210> you<00:00:55.360> get<00:00:55.660> more<00:00:56.020> motivation

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
you get better you get more motivation

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.380 
you get better you get more motivation
and<00:00:56.950> i<00:00:57.600> think<00:00:58.600> without<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:59.140> fancies<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:01.120> not

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
and i think without the fancies it's not

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.320 
and i think without the fancies it's not

wonderful because I came here and we're

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.719 
wonderful because I came here and we're
in<00:01:50.229> almost<00:01:50.710> every<00:01:51.070> game<00:01:51.280> and<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.720> was<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:54.220> big

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
in almost every game and it was a big

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.789 
in almost every game and it was a big
success<00:01:54.909> I<00:01:55.299> think<00:01:55.330> for<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.899> team<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:56.409> also

family I think the hardest part to come

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.940 
family I think the hardest part to come
to<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.549> new<00:02:51.700> club<00:02:51.880> is<00:02:52.180> more<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.930> part<00:02:53.650> outside

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
to a new club is more the part outside

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
to a new club is more the part outside
football<00:02:54.670> because<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:56.049> need<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.410> fix<00:02:56.970> like

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
football because you need to fix like

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.310 
football because you need to fix like
what<00:02:58.410> Martin<00:02:59.410> said<00:02:59.620> like<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.670> apartment<00:03:01.320> all

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
what Martin said like the apartment all

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.099 
what Martin said like the apartment all
the<00:03:02.620> stuff<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.100> car<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.609> everything<00:03:04.239> like

the stuff the car and everything like
and<00:03:05.350> I<00:03:05.470> think<00:03:05.709> also<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.220> language<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:07.049> there

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
and I think also the language and there

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.199 
and I think also the language and there
are<00:03:08.109> many<00:03:08.170> things<00:03:08.590> but<00:03:08.829> we<00:03:09.549> are<00:03:09.640> professionals

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
are many things but we are professionals

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.560 
are many things but we are professionals
and<00:03:10.480> we<00:03:10.810> need<00:03:11.109> to<00:03:11.850> we<00:03:12.850> need<00:03:12.880> to<00:03:13.180> know<00:03:13.359> these

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
and we need to we need to know these

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.270 
and we need to we need to know these
things<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:14.140> we<00:03:14.530> need<00:03:14.709> to<00:03:14.829> handle<00:03:15.010> these

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
things and we need to handle these

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.720 
things and we need to handle these
things<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:15.820> I<00:03:16.030> think<00:03:16.390> it's<00:03:17.290> okay<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:18.609> has

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
things and I think it's okay the has

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.550 
things and I think it's okay the has
better<00:03:18.970> person<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.690> need<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:20.019> speak<00:03:20.230> with<00:03:20.290> the

with the with the guys the four guys be
in<00:03:24.250> front<00:03:24.459> of<00:03:24.640> me<00:03:24.790> so<00:03:25.540> I<00:03:25.569> think<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:26.019> most

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
in front of me so I think the most

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.520 
in front of me so I think the most
important<00:03:26.739> worth<00:03:27.160> its<00:03:27.430> yeah<00:03:28.090> ha<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.540> try<00:03:29.500> to

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
learn

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.210 
learn
then<00:03:31.810> it<00:03:31.960> was<00:03:32.140> because<00:03:32.440> it's<00:03:32.590> easier<00:03:32.950> for<00:03:32.980> the

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
then it was because it's easier for the

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.850 
then it was because it's easier for the
guys<00:03:33.400> if<00:03:33.910> I<00:03:34.060> speak<00:03:34.300> Danish<00:03:34.630> but<00:03:34.660> it's<00:03:35.590> very

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
guys if I speak Danish but it's very

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.910 
guys if I speak Danish but it's very
hard<00:03:36.070> language<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:36.520> think<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:37.270> understand<00:03:38.080> but

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
hard language I think to understand but

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.520 
hard language I think to understand but
I<00:03:38.980> i<00:03:39.370> promise<00:03:39.910> i<00:03:40.030> will<00:03:40.420> try<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:41.020> speak<00:03:41.230> Danish

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.910 
I i promise i will try to speak Danish
and<00:03:41.910> I<00:03:42.910> think<00:03:43.240> the<00:03:43.450> most<00:03:43.600> important<00:03:44.080> was<00:03:44.230> its

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
and I think the most important was its

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.570 
and I think the most important was its
yahuh<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:45.550> Vince<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.300> whole<00:03:47.290> your<00:03:47.470> nails<00:03:48.310> and

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
yahuh and Vince the whole your nails and

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.090 
yahuh and Vince the whole your nails and
something<00:03:48.940> like<00:03:49.090> this<00:03:49.210> so<00:03:49.530> it's<00:03:50.530> not<00:03:50.680> so<00:03:50.890> hard

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
something like this so it's not so hard

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.910 
something like this so it's not so hard
this<00:03:51.520> this<00:03:51.790> was<00:03:52.000> but<00:03:52.270> I<00:03:52.540> will<00:03:53.110> try<00:03:53.260> to<00:03:53.380> learn<00:03:53.650> a
