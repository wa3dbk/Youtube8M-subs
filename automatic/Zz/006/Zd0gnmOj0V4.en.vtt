00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
this little movie shows how to make a

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.940 
this little movie shows how to make a
template<00:00:03.480> for<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.049> trial<00:00:04.710> mudguard<00:00:06.649> our<00:00:07.649> first

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
template for a trial mudguard our first

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.400 
template for a trial mudguard our first
step<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.519> make<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.730> model<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.809> mudguard

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
step is to make a model of the mudguard

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.799 
step is to make a model of the mudguard
we<00:00:11.099> only<00:00:11.309> need<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.820> make<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.000> model<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.540> one

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
we only need to make a model of one

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.169 
we only need to make a model of one
section<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.500> mudguard

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
section of the mudguard

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.720 
section of the mudguard
to<00:00:15.179> do<00:00:15.299> this<00:00:15.560> find<00:00:16.560> someone<00:00:16.949> mill<00:00:17.130> sheet<00:00:17.400> metal

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
to do this find someone mill sheet metal

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.630 
to do this find someone mill sheet metal
and<00:00:17.910> cut<00:00:18.390> out<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> size<00:00:18.980> approximately<00:00:19.980> 200<00:00:20.520> by

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
and cut out a size approximately 200 by

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.009 
and cut out a size approximately 200 by
300<00:00:20.939> millimeters<00:00:23.269> then<00:00:24.269> mark<00:00:24.539> out<00:00:24.779> your

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
300 millimeters then mark out your

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.370 
300 millimeters then mark out your
longitudinal<00:00:25.980> folds<00:00:26.519> as<00:00:27.210> per<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.840> dimensions

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
longitudinal folds as per the dimensions

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.999 
longitudinal folds as per the dimensions
on<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> drawing<00:00:30.019> then<00:00:31.019> approximately<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
on the drawing then approximately in the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.220 
on the drawing then approximately in the
middle<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.430> shape<00:00:32.840> draw<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> center<00:00:34.170> line

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
middle of the shape draw a center line

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.810 
middle of the shape draw a center line
now<00:00:37.230> we<00:00:37.290> are<00:00:37.500> going<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.920> mark<00:00:38.100> out<00:00:38.399> at<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.610> back

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
now we are going to mark out at the back

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.510 
now we are going to mark out at the back
edge<00:00:39.090> which<00:00:40.050> has<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.440> 90<00:00:40.920> degree<00:00:41.370> angle<00:00:43.520> we

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
edge which has the 90 degree angle we

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.779 
edge which has the 90 degree angle we
mark<00:00:44.760> out<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> anchor<00:00:45.239> with<00:00:45.480> an<00:00:45.600> angle<00:00:45.989> gauge

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
mark out the anchor with an angle gauge

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.260 
mark out the anchor with an angle gauge
but<00:00:47.789> what<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.539> angle<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.559> actually

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
but what is the angle that we actually

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.470 
but what is the angle that we actually
scribe<00:00:51.270> or<00:00:51.570> back<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.140> line<00:00:52.350> at<00:00:53.149> this<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.329> an

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
scribe or back the line at this is an

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.990 
scribe or back the line at this is an
easy<00:00:54.660> one<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.350> because<00:00:55.640> according<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
easy one to do because according to the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.950 
easy one to do because according to the
drawing<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:58.500> angle<00:00:59.250> or<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.520> fold<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.239> at<00:01:00.390> 45

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
drawing the angle or the fold is at 45

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.420 
drawing the angle or the fold is at 45
degrees<00:01:01.910> so<00:01:02.910> our<00:01:03.059> cutout<00:01:03.300> has<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:04.430> 45

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
degrees so our cutout has to be 45

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.140 
degrees so our cutout has to be 45
degrees<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.070> 22<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.189> 1/2<00:01:08.280> degrees<00:01:08.610> each

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
degrees that is 22 and 1/2 degrees each

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.920 
degrees that is 22 and 1/2 degrees each
side<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> center<00:01:10.049> line<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:12.360> next<00:01:12.630> cut<00:01:12.900> out

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
side of the center line the next cut out

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.560 
side of the center line the next cut out
is<00:01:13.229> much<00:01:13.560> more<00:01:13.799> difficult<00:01:14.310> because<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:15.509> have

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
is much more difficult because we have

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.600 
is much more difficult because we have
what<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:16.049> call<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> compound<00:01:16.799> angle<00:01:17.630> we<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
what we call a compound angle we have a

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.210 
what we call a compound angle we have a
45<00:01:20.610> degree<00:01:21.030> fold<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.689> one<00:01:21.840> direction<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.650> 45

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
45 degree fold in one direction and a 45

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.550 
45 degree fold in one direction and a 45
degree<00:01:23.400> fold<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> other<00:01:24.150> direction

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
degree fold in the other direction

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.010 
degree fold in the other direction
coming<00:01:25.560> from<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.009> same<00:01:26.220> point<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:27.479> gives<00:01:27.840> us

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
coming from the same point this gives us

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.679 
coming from the same point this gives us
what<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.380> call<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> compound<00:01:28.979> angle<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.450> not

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
what we call a compound angle it is not

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.460 
what we call a compound angle it is not
simple<00:01:31.170> as<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.189> previous<00:01:32.670> one<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.259> so<00:01:34.259> we

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
simple as the previous one and so we

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.640 
simple as the previous one and so we
have<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:35.040> work<00:01:35.820> out<00:01:36.090> what<00:01:36.689> they<00:01:36.900> cut<00:01:37.140> out<00:01:37.350> will

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
have to work out what they cut out will

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.910 
have to work out what they cut out will
be<00:01:38.479> we<00:01:39.479> could<00:01:39.750> work<00:01:39.930> out<00:01:40.200> what<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.500> angle

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
be we could work out what this angle

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.330 
be we could work out what this angle
would<00:01:41.040> be<00:01:41.360> mathematically<00:01:42.680> but<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.310> a

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
would be mathematically but it is a

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.749 
would be mathematically but it is a
complex<00:01:44.970> formula<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.439> not<00:01:46.860> used<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
complex formula and it is not used in a

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.380 
complex formula and it is not used in a
general<00:01:47.970> work<00:01:48.590> situation<00:01:49.909> what<00:01:50.909> we<00:01:51.000> would<00:01:51.149> do

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
general work situation what we would do

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.080 
general work situation what we would do
in<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.630> general<00:01:51.960> workshop<00:01:52.399> situation<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.579> to

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
in a general workshop situation is to

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.130 
in a general workshop situation is to
use<00:01:54.540> trial<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.049> error

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
use trial and error

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.800 
use trial and error
and<00:01:56.800> that<00:01:57.340> means<00:01:57.580> we<00:01:57.760> make<00:01:57.970> a<00:01:58.000> cut<00:01:58.330> out<00:01:58.480> first

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
and that means we make a cut out first

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.740 
and that means we make a cut out first
and<00:01:59.290> then<00:02:00.190> try<00:02:01.060> it<00:02:01.800> see<00:02:02.800> if<00:02:03.370> it<00:02:03.730> fits<00:02:04.090> if<00:02:04.480> it

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
and then try it see if it fits if it

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.580 
and then try it see if it fits if it
doesn't<00:02:05.110> we<00:02:05.380> then<00:02:05.590> alter<00:02:05.980> it<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:08.259> with<00:02:08.440> this

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
doesn't we then alter it so with this

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.550 
doesn't we then alter it so with this
cut<00:02:08.860> out<00:02:09.009> we<00:02:09.190> will<00:02:09.369> start<00:02:09.670> at<00:02:09.970> an<00:02:10.300> angle<00:02:11.110> of<00:02:11.140> 15

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
cut out we will start at an angle of 15

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.200 
cut out we will start at an angle of 15
degrees<00:02:12.010> either<00:02:12.220> side<00:02:12.550> of<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.730> center<00:02:13.060> line

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
degrees either side of the center line

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.970 
degrees either side of the center line
from<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.630> apex<00:02:15.510> we<00:02:16.510> will<00:02:16.690> also<00:02:17.020> draw<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.680> line

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
from the apex we will also draw a line

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.260 
from the apex we will also draw a line
90<00:02:18.790> degrees<00:02:19.120> from<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.200> edge<00:02:20.790> for<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.910> small

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
90 degrees from the edge for the small

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.320 
90 degrees from the edge for the small
fold-over<00:02:23.190> which<00:02:24.190> is<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.910> 20

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
fold-over which is that the 20

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:38.719 
however in the first instance it will

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:42.970 
however in the first instance it will
not<00:03:38.989> fold<00:03:39.439> up<00:03:39.769> to<00:03:39.980> an<00:03:40.069> angle<00:03:40.370> of<00:03:40.489> 45<00:03:41.239> degrees<00:03:41.980> we

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
not fold up to an angle of 45 degrees we

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.729 
not fold up to an angle of 45 degrees we
fold<00:03:43.280> up<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.609> component<00:03:44.209> and<00:03:44.389> to<00:03:45.200> the<00:03:45.349> edges

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
fold up the component and to the edges

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.089 
fold up the component and to the edges
start<00:03:45.889> touching<00:03:46.659> these<00:03:47.659> edges<00:03:48.169> these

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
start touching these edges these

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.309 
start touching these edges these
touching<00:03:49.639> edges<00:03:50.000> will<00:03:50.510> prevent<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.079> fall

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
touching edges will prevent the fall

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.390 
touching edges will prevent the fall
from<00:03:51.620> going<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.159> full<00:03:52.430> 45<00:03:52.909> degrees<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.980> next

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
from going a full 45 degrees the next

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.089 
from going a full 45 degrees the next
step<00:03:55.639> is<00:03:55.939> to<00:03:56.120> then<00:03:56.269> cut<00:03:56.659> away<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.650> touching

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
step is to then cut away the touching

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.940 
step is to then cut away the touching
edges<00:03:58.459> so<00:03:59.180> that<00:03:59.389> we<00:03:59.569> can<00:03:59.810> fold<00:04:00.139> the<00:04:00.319> component

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
edges so that we can fold the component

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.270 
edges so that we can fold the component
up<00:04:01.159> further<00:04:01.669> and<00:04:02.260> eventually<00:04:03.260> get<00:04:03.469> to<00:04:03.620> our<00:04:03.739> 45

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
up further and eventually get to our 45

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.190 
up further and eventually get to our 45
degrees<00:04:05.950> we<00:04:06.950> cut<00:04:07.250> out<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.730> touching<00:04:08.299> services

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
degrees we cut out the touching services

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.740

our<00:05:15.320> next<00:05:15.680> step<00:05:15.890> is<00:05:16.130> to<00:05:16.160> then<00:05:16.580> unfold<00:05:17.330> all<00:05:17.900> of

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
our next step is to then unfold all of

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.670 
our next step is to then unfold all of
the<00:05:18.410> folds<00:05:18.800> that<00:05:18.860> we<00:05:18.980> have<00:05:19.280> completed<00:05:20.470> once<00:05:21.470> we

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
the folds that we have completed once we

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.970 
the folds that we have completed once we
unfold<00:05:22.100> everything<00:05:22.310> flatten<00:05:23.180> it<00:05:23.270> out<00:05:23.800> we<00:05:24.800> will

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
unfold everything flatten it out we will

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.770 
unfold everything flatten it out we will
then<00:05:25.130> have<00:05:25.310> produced<00:05:25.790> a<00:05:25.910> template<00:05:26.390> which<00:05:26.630> we

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
then have produced a template which we

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.710 
then have produced a template which we
can<00:05:26.960> use<00:05:27.260> for<00:05:27.920> our<00:05:28.450> manufacture<00:05:29.450> of<00:05:29.540> our

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
can use for our manufacture of our

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.160 
can use for our manufacture of our
mudguard<00:05:31.420> unfold<00:05:32.420> first<00:05:32.690> with<00:05:32.900> a<00:05:32.930> pair<00:05:33.140> of

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
mudguard unfold first with a pair of

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:39.460 
mudguard unfold first with a pair of
pliers<00:05:35.230> then<00:05:36.230> use<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:37.550> clamp<00:05:38.360> on<00:05:38.630> the<00:05:39.050> folder

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
pliers then use the clamp on the folder

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.320 
pliers then use the clamp on the folder
to<00:05:40.460> flatten<00:05:41.180> out<00:05:41.300> the<00:05:42.280> model<00:05:43.280> as<00:05:43.640> much<00:05:44.060> as<00:05:44.210> you

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
to flatten out the model as much as you

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.540 
to flatten out the model as much as you
possibly<00:05:44.510> can

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
possibly can

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.400 
possibly can
we<00:05:47.550> then<00:05:47.759> have<00:05:47.940> a<00:05:47.970> finished<00:05:48.360> template<00:05:51.410> when

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
we then have a finished template when

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.399 
we then have a finished template when
making<00:05:52.650> a<00:05:52.919> my<00:05:53.129> god<00:05:53.400> we<00:05:54.270> must<00:05:54.509> first<00:05:54.780> mark<00:05:55.169> out

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
making a my god we must first mark out

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:57.409 
making a my god we must first mark out
according<00:05:56.069> to<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:56.310> drawing<00:05:56.759> the

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
according to the drawing the

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.719 
according to the drawing the
intersecting<00:05:58.080> points<00:05:58.530> were<00:05:59.129> all<00:05:59.340> the<00:05:59.460> joins

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
intersecting points were all the joins

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.330 
intersecting points were all the joins
are<00:05:59.940> to<00:06:00.060> take<00:06:00.270> place<00:06:00.860> we<00:06:01.860> then<00:06:02.069> use<00:06:02.310> that

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
are to take place we then use that

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.700 
are to take place we then use that
template<00:06:03.000> of<00:06:03.509> each<00:06:03.720> of<00:06:03.930> those<00:06:04.020> intersecting

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
template of each of those intersecting

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.909 
template of each of those intersecting
points<00:06:05.129> and<00:06:05.310> mark<00:06:06.060> out<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.449> cut<00:06:06.659> out<00:06:06.919> which

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
points and mark out the cut out which

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.649 
points and mark out the cut out which
will<00:06:08.190> be<00:06:08.370> the<00:06:08.550> same<00:06:08.819> on<00:06:09.180> each<00:06:09.449> point<00:06:11.659> this

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:12.659 
will be the same on each point this

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:15.860 
will be the same on each point this
saves<00:06:12.990> a<00:06:13.169> lot<00:06:13.379> of<00:06:13.440> time<00:06:13.620> a<00:06:14.069> lot<00:06:14.520> of<00:06:14.550> work<00:06:14.849> a<00:06:15.180> lot

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
saves a lot of time a lot of work a lot

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.950 
saves a lot of time a lot of work a lot
of<00:06:15.930> effort<00:06:16.319> in<00:06:16.740> marking<00:06:17.340> out<00:06:17.550> each<00:06:18.060> individual

of effort in marking out each individual
cut<00:06:19.560> out<00:06:20.419> the<00:06:21.419> process<00:06:21.870> you<00:06:22.080> have<00:06:22.110> just<00:06:22.440> seen

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
cut out the process you have just seen

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.510 
cut out the process you have just seen
is<00:06:23.370> what<00:06:23.669> would<00:06:23.819> happen<00:06:24.090> in<00:06:24.180> a<00:06:24.270> workshop<00:06:25.520> by

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
is what would happen in a workshop by

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.600 
is what would happen in a workshop by
taking<00:06:26.940> time<00:06:27.180> to<00:06:27.539> make<00:06:28.199> a<00:06:28.229> model<00:06:28.710> and<00:06:28.889> then

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
taking time to make a model and then

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.059 
taking time to make a model and then
producing<00:06:30.120> a<00:06:30.330> template<00:06:30.810> will<00:06:31.500> save<00:06:31.740> you<00:06:31.949> a<00:06:31.979> lot

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:32.069 
producing a template will save you a lot

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:35.860 
producing a template will save you a lot
of<00:06:32.340> time<00:06:32.659> in<00:06:33.659> the<00:06:34.259> manufacture<00:06:34.860> of<00:06:34.979> subsequent
