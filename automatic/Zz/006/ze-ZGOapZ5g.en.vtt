00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.250
 hello big little lovers 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:10.260
 tanks today structure and guide on t18 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:14.070
 American self - propelled anti - tank 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.000
 level two is definitely the king 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.970
 sandbox 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.390
 why I will tell you now firstly 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.960
 we have available hl2 guns on 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:30.179
 the choice is 75 millimeter howitzers with 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.910
 alpha damage 175 and a gun with a decent 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.489
 breaking through 64 is enough to break through 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.059
 any tank any place at your level and 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.579
 damage on the 45 principle you can choose 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.910
 a gun at your discretion but I am everything and 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.789
 I suggest to actually play on 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.449
 button because because i am now 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.809
 will show you why we also have a very 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.180
 good armor at 51 millimeter or 32 and 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.690
 25 a little worse we book a board and 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.469
 stern 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.420
 but our forehead is so strong that 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.670
 most machine guns at this level of it 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.600
 just does not break through and paypal tank 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.979
 very, very flexible 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.950
 Look here as well as possible. 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.500
 competently use this landfill 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.020
 at first we will support the banana you see 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.479
 there are no special people here 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:29.159
 one was this stuck flippers 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.720
 we are very well thrown here more 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.900
 tank part 2 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.890
 however, there is a first level 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.369
 clearly out of luck 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.899
 why because without gold 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.240
 the gun of these first level tanks 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.159
 T18 lobovuhu likely not struck and 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.289
 what guns 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:55.829
 we have one so on machine guns 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:59.549
 no options do not break in any way of course 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.429
 there is such a minion 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.469
 this instrument that it comes down a long time is necessary 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:09.959
 wait until it comes down to aim and 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:13.069
 only then shoot but the stream 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:17.280
 since projectiles often fly to the center 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.200
 There are such things here and years without 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.569
 information is good that the charge is enough 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:28.829
 fast and besides it is not my thing 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:30.450
 Look, there is almost no any 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.730
 the enemy on her own she is practically 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.209
 destroys in one shot with proper 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.459
 of luck 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.849
 although I'm not always lucky now 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.040
 I will demonstrate mostly one 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:45.440
 quickly enough to disassemble 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:48.120
 any opponents rub it once it was 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.540
 a lesson probably somewhere in the caterpillar or else 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.239
 somewhere not vanshot yes here of course it has 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:59.670
 meaning sometimes aim to exactly 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:01.920
 coupe beat but as you see very often 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.250
 we take off Vanshota and see 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:09.209
 my little we have 125 x n we already 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.489
 shot 505 damage and continue on 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.370
 shoot on pouring again impenetrable 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.790
 Yes, because it shoots from the guard 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.650
 I probably did not know where 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.799
 so it is sometimes worth it all the same 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.810
 aim to be sure but not 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.090
 less fast recharge allows you 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:32.400
 enough with impunity to shoot a couple 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.560
 once and no tank really i just 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.450
 I feel that there really are these guys 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.389
 nobody can do anything to me 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.370
 they try frags again 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.480
 Naturally begins the pursuit of 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.550
 warriors like me already 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.500
 love two faces all the players of our team 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.659
 try to destroy as quickly as possible 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.319
 all opponents that this warrior is not for me 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:57.670
 give well nevertheless it is natural 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:59.860
 practice yes and you have only two 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.170
 an opponent which one of them was 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:07.180
 on mountain 2 is on our base 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.239
 yes here here so here are the languages â€‹â€‹t1 and 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.519
 maneuverability of course p18 she is not a fountain 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.640
 but that turns out to be no less 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:18.729
 fast enough and twist and 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.750
 maybe not everyone out there level 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:25.270
 will see . 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:28.530
 and d1 are they tearing up everyone who tried 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.530
 capture enemy base 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:39.639
 see how we ship from the guard 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.100
 comrade fitter yes that's how it happens 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:47.229
 we have such cumulative projectiles 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:49.810
 whose damage h110 actually 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:53.320
 I do not know whether it makes sense at the very level 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:56.190
 here unlike t8 are two kinds of someone 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:00.010
 inaccurate world here mines as you can see 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.080
 quite enough here and so but we play on 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.539
 this self-propelled gun use high-explosive 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.360
 gun feel free very nice 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:09.340
 the device I hope you all will also 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.190
 nice to play on it as well as me 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.260
 Thank you all. I was new to you. 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.610
 tour subscribes to the channel and put 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.610
 thumb up bye bye
