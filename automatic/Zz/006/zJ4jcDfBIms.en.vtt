00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
off to college and I can imagine being

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.760 
off to college and I can imagine being
able<00:01:23.470> to<00:01:23.710> call<00:01:24.130> them<00:01:24.430> and<00:01:24.730> see<00:01:25.690> them<00:01:25.960> but<00:01:26.650> also

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
able to call them and see them but also

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.460 
able to call them and see them but also
look<00:01:27.640> into<00:01:27.820> their<00:01:28.000> eyes<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:28.930> see<00:01:29.170> how<00:01:29.350> are

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
look into their eyes and see how are

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.910 
look into their eyes and see how are
they<00:01:29.590> really<00:01:29.740> doing<00:01:31.350> what<00:01:32.350> makes<00:01:32.470> it<00:01:32.680> even

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
they really doing what makes it even

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.460 
they really doing what makes it even
better<00:01:33.100> is<00:01:33.730> that<00:01:34.000> it<00:01:34.510> switches<00:01:35.050> from<00:01:35.230> the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
better is that it switches from the

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.890 
better is that it switches from the
front<00:01:35.740> camera<00:01:36.040> to<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.550> back<00:01:36.790> camera<00:01:37.090> so<00:01:37.870> you

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
front camera to the back camera so you

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.740 
front camera to the back camera so you
