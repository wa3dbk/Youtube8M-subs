00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.600 
now of course you have to speed up your
hand<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.960> hand<00:01:43.200> timing<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.710> everything<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
hand the hand timing is everything the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.160 
hand the hand timing is everything the
biggest<00:01:44.970> mistake<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.390> see<00:01:45.420> people<00:01:45.570> make<00:01:46.020> is

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
biggest mistake I see people make is

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.749 
biggest mistake I see people make is
they<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.470> get<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.740> feet<00:01:47.070> they<00:01:47.430> can<00:01:47.579> get<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
they can get the feet they can get the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.789 
they can get the feet they can get the
timing<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.299> feet<00:01:48.509> right<00:01:48.720> they<00:01:49.439> can't<00:01:49.680> get

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
timing of the feet right they can't get

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.469 
timing of the feet right they can't get
the<00:01:49.920> hands<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.369> check<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:51.030> need<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.299> make<00:01:51.450> sure

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the hands in check you need to make sure

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.870 
the hands in check you need to make sure
you're<00:01:51.780> swinging<00:01:52.200> your<00:01:52.229> hands<00:01:52.710> as<00:01:52.860> fast<00:01:53.700> as

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
you're swinging your hands as fast as

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.039 
you're swinging your hands as fast as
the<00:01:54.000> feet<00:01:54.150> are<00:01:54.270> going<00:01:54.420> otherwise<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:54.930> never

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
the feet are going otherwise it's never

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.300 
the feet are going otherwise it's never
going<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.259> work<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.619> other<00:01:55.710> thing<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.159> do

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
going to work the other thing you can do

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.010 
going to work the other thing you can do
is<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:57.570> rope

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
is the rope

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.020 
is the rope
the<00:01:58.290> choice<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.770> rope<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.159> key<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.850> is<00:01:59.909> a

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
the choice of rope is key this is a

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.179 
the choice of rope is key this is a
speed<00:02:00.329> rope<00:02:00.590> obviously<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.710> means<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.979> spins

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
speed rope obviously it means it spins

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.980 
speed rope obviously it means it spins
fast<00:02:02.460> right<00:02:02.729> they<00:02:03.210> have<00:02:03.390> weighted<00:02:03.780> ropes

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
fast right they have weighted ropes

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.660 
fast right they have weighted ropes
they've<00:02:04.170> got<00:02:04.350> beaded<00:02:04.710> ropes<00:02:04.920> they<00:02:05.250> have<00:02:05.399> ropes

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
they've got beaded ropes they have ropes

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.520 
they've got beaded ropes they have ropes
that<00:02:05.790> are<00:02:05.939> actual<00:02:06.659> ropes<00:02:06.990> those<00:02:07.259> are<00:02:07.380> going<00:02:07.470> to

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
that are actual ropes those are going to

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.009 
that are actual ropes those are going to
spin<00:02:07.799> slower<00:02:08.129> so<00:02:08.549> when<00:02:09.299> you<00:02:09.419> go<00:02:09.569> when<00:02:09.749> you<00:02:09.869> try

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
spin slower so when you go when you try

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.809 
spin slower so when you go when you try
to<00:02:10.079> buy<00:02:10.289> one<00:02:10.319> test<00:02:10.889> them<00:02:11.039> out<00:02:11.099> see<00:02:11.489> which<00:02:11.639> one
