the best players before that we just

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.159

wanted to enjoy the game and wanted to

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.500 
wanted to enjoy the game and wanted to

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
show the world that that we can that we

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.320 
show the world that that we can that we
were<00:00:34.750> capable<00:00:35.050> to<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:36.640> play<00:00:36.850> against<00:00:37.150> them

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
were capable to to play against them

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.170 
were capable to to play against them
really<00:00:38.110> we<00:00:38.230> didn't<00:00:38.559> know<00:00:38.710> the<00:00:38.950> the<00:00:39.370> result<00:00:39.850> the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
really we didn't know the the result the

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.630 
really we didn't know the the result the
other<00:00:40.330> result<00:00:40.809> of<00:00:40.960> I<00:00:41.440> think<00:00:41.559> was<00:00:41.920> Turkey

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
other result of I think was Turkey

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.479 
other result of I think was Turkey
against<00:00:42.879> China<00:00:43.360> if<00:00:43.870> we<00:00:44.110> had<00:00:44.290> someone<00:00:45.129> there

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
against China if we had someone there

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.790 
against China if we had someone there
you<00:00:45.820> know<00:00:46.000> telling<00:00:46.360> us<00:00:46.480> how<00:00:46.660> I<00:00:47.020> was<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:47.530> the

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
you know telling us how I was the the

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.149 
you know telling us how I was the the
scorer<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:49.570> other<00:00:49.690> game<00:00:49.989> we<00:00:50.290> could<00:00:51.040> have

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
scorer in the other game we could have

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.790 
scorer in the other game we could have
managed<00:00:51.970> a<00:00:52.089> little<00:00:52.330> bit<00:00:52.480> better<00:00:53.290> the<00:00:53.620> game

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
managed a little bit better the game

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.020 
managed a little bit better the game
because<00:00:54.760> actually<00:00:55.390> we<00:00:55.600> we<00:00:56.440> lost<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.760> chance

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
because actually we we lost the chance

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.329 
because actually we we lost the chance
to<00:00:58.269> go<00:00:58.449> through<00:00:58.750> because<00:00:58.989> I<00:00:59.620> think<00:00:59.890> we<00:01:00.190> missed

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
to go through because I think we missed

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.619 
to go through because I think we missed
ball<00:01:00.820> from<00:01:01.570> one<00:01:02.170> goal<00:01:02.199> I<00:01:02.440> think<00:01:02.890> and<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:04.420> lost

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
ball from one goal I think and we lost

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.160 
ball from one goal I think and we lost
like<00:01:04.870> five<00:01:05.409> to<00:01:05.740> five<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.370> two<00:01:06.520> so<00:01:06.820> I<00:01:07.060> think<00:01:07.840> that

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
like five to five to two so I think that

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:16.590 
like five to five to two so I think that
was<00:01:08.350> experience

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.900 

that<00:01:17.600> was<00:01:17.720> a<00:01:17.750> you<00:01:18.320> know<00:01:18.440> really<00:01:18.910> experienced

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
that was a you know really experienced

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.350 
that was a you know really experienced
player<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:20.690> know<00:01:20.810> I've<00:01:20.990> been<00:01:21.490> through<00:01:22.490> so

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
player you know I've been through so

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.980 
player you know I've been through so
much<00:01:23.570> good<00:01:24.530> games<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.340> with<00:01:26.270> pressure<00:01:26.570> and

everything<00:01:27.410> and<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:29.450> only<00:01:29.630> thing<00:01:29.900> I<00:01:29.990> have<00:01:30.200> in

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
everything and the only thing I have in

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.500 
everything and the only thing I have in
my<00:01:30.440> mind<00:01:30.470> is<00:01:30.800> just<00:01:31.220> to<00:01:31.370> score<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:32.060> that's<00:01:32.300> it

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
my mind is just to score and that's it

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.590 
my mind is just to score and that's it
you<00:01:32.780> know<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:33.140> good<00:01:33.860> thing<00:01:34.100> that<00:01:34.130> I<00:01:34.730> did<00:01:35.300> score

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
that goal and from there I think we

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.040 
that goal and from there I think we
deepen<00:01:39.410> our<00:01:40.100> hearts<00:01:40.790> we<00:01:41.330> truly<00:01:41.720> believe<00:01:42.020> that

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
deepen our hearts we truly believe that

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.550 
deepen our hearts we truly believe that
maybe<00:01:42.740> we<00:01:42.950> can<00:01:43.190> do<00:01:43.730> something<00:01:44.300> give<00:01:44.810> her<00:01:44.930> a<00:01:44.960> big

maybe we can do something give her a big

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.640 
maybe we can do something give her a big
surprise<00:01:45.800> to<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.640> world<00:01:46.880> it<00:01:47.720> was<00:01:47.869> a<00:01:47.900> special<00:01:48.470> I

to to play the World Cup so that's not

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:54.420 
to to play the World Cup so that's not
something<00:02:46.570> big

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.949 

any<00:02:55.090> one<00:02:55.330> of<00:02:55.360> those<00:02:56.129> teams<00:02:57.129> I<00:02:57.430> mean<00:02:57.580> really<00:02:58.540> why

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
any one of those teams I mean really why

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.649 
any one of those teams I mean really why
we<00:02:59.890> know<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.069> the<00:03:00.610> quality<00:03:01.060> they<00:03:01.180> have<00:03:01.209> of

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
we know the the quality they have of

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.440 
we know the the quality they have of
course<00:03:01.930> where<00:03:02.260> is<00:03:02.500> Kalani<00:03:03.060> they<00:03:04.060> will<00:03:04.239> be<00:03:04.420> a

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
course where is Kalani they will be a

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.110 
course where is Kalani they will be a
threat<00:03:05.049> upfront<00:03:05.650> Italia<00:03:06.430> who<00:03:06.670> is<00:03:06.760> gonna<00:03:06.970> be

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
threat upfront Italia who is gonna be

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.080 
threat upfront Italia who is gonna be
the<00:03:07.299> favorites<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.349> win<00:03:09.099> the<00:03:09.280> World<00:03:09.819> Cup

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
the favorites to win the World Cup

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.350 
the favorites to win the World Cup
and<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:11.680> course<00:03:12.010> England<00:03:12.489> they<00:03:12.760> have<00:03:12.940> quality

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
and of course England they have quality

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.199 
and of course England they have quality
players<00:03:13.870> so<00:03:14.079> I<00:03:14.319> won't<00:03:14.680> say<00:03:14.890> who<00:03:15.670> will<00:03:15.879> be<00:03:16.030> the

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
players so I won't say who will be the

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.960 
players so I won't say who will be the
hardest<00:03:16.629> because<00:03:17.409> obviously<00:03:17.709> any<00:03:18.459> of<00:03:18.700> those

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
hardest because obviously any of those

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.440 
hardest because obviously any of those
things<00:03:19.360> can<00:03:20.049> go<00:03:20.230> through
