TouchWiz<00:02:44.310> UI<00:02:44.580> which<00:02:44.940> we<00:02:45.090> have<00:02:45.240> seen<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:46.140> does

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
TouchWiz UI which we have seen it does

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.770 
TouchWiz UI which we have seen it does
make<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.640> know<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.060> are<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.270> little

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
make the you know the you are a little

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.630 
make the you know the you are a little
bit<00:02:49.050> laggy<00:02:49.489> not<00:02:50.489> very<00:02:51.239> much<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:53.250> problem

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
bit laggy not very much of a problem

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.760 
bit laggy not very much of a problem
with<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.060> phone<00:02:54.270> but<00:02:54.600> you<00:02:54.720> know<00:02:54.840> at<00:02:55.230> times<00:02:55.530> you

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
with the phone but you know at times you

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.240 
with the phone but you know at times you
do<00:02:55.980> see<00:02:56.510> slight<00:02:57.510> amount<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.959> lag<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.860> that's

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
do see slight amount of lag and that's

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.810 
do see slight amount of lag and that's
probably<00:02:59.489> because<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.060> TouchWiz<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.690> are

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
probably because the TouchWiz you are

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.190 
probably because the TouchWiz you are
overall<00:03:02.820> that<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.510> performance<00:03:03.810> has<00:03:04.170> been

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
overall that is the performance has been

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.870 
overall that is the performance has been
very<00:03:04.709> good<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.880> hasn't<00:03:06.330> been<00:03:06.360> like<00:03:06.950> are<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.550> or

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
very good it hasn't been like are the or

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.330 
very good it hasn't been like are the or
the<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.420> know<00:03:09.540> out<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.290> proportion<00:03:10.920> kind<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.250> a
