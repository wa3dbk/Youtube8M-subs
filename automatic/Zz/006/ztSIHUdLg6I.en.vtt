and give him a go

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
and give him a go
you<00:01:17.670> check<00:01:17.910> that<00:01:17.940> because<00:01:18.270> that's<00:01:18.420> what<00:01:18.540> God

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
you check that because that's what God

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.450 
you check that because that's what God

of<00:01:55.260> me<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:56.460> first<00:01:56.490> fish<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:58.229> bearded

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
of me the first fish is the bearded

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.700 
of me the first fish is the bearded
trout<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.070> case<00:01:59.310> now<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.660> know<00:02:01.260> you<00:02:01.440> saw

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
trout in this case now I know you saw

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.250 
trout in this case now I know you saw
this<00:02:01.860> on<00:02:02.010> camera<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:03.180> don't<00:02:03.630> take<00:02:03.900> this<00:02:04.080> to

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
this on camera but don't take this to

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.320 
this on camera but don't take this to
heart<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.830> fish<00:02:05.100> can<00:02:05.280> be<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.790> lot<00:02:06.119> more

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
heart this fish can be a lot more

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.660 
heart this fish can be a lot more
difficult<00:02:06.780> than<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.050> to<00:02:07.229> get<00:02:07.970> it<00:02:08.970> really<00:02:09.360> is

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
difficult than this to get it really is

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.640 
difficult than this to get it really is
so<00:02:12.770> while<00:02:13.770> we're<00:02:14.070> here<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:15.200> guess<00:02:16.200> we'll<00:02:16.470> go

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
so while we're here I guess we'll go

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.760 
so while we're here I guess we'll go
over<00:02:16.920> here<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:17.310> other<00:02:17.520> pond<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:19.440> go<00:02:19.590> the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
over here to this other pond and go the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.340 
over here to this other pond and go the
