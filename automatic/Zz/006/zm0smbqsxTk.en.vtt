then a better area the final thing is
the<00:01:02.350> ion<00:01:02.770> anti<00:01:03.310> freeze<00:01:03.610> solutions<00:01:03.910> this<00:01:04.720> is<00:01:04.930> a

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
the ion anti freeze solutions this is a

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.560 
the ion anti freeze solutions this is a
lightweight<00:01:06.070> moisture<00:01:06.759> and<00:01:07.000> detangling

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570

leave-in<00:01:07.990> conditioner<00:01:08.649> so<00:01:08.829> we're<00:01:08.920> going<00:01:09.040> to

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
leave-in conditioner so we're going to

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.730 
leave-in conditioner so we're going to
use<00:01:09.250> that<00:01:09.490> so<00:01:10.329> we're<00:01:10.479> gonna<00:01:10.540> start<00:01:10.960> off<00:01:11.140> and

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
use that so we're gonna start off and

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.490 
use that so we're gonna start off and
we're<00:01:11.950> going<00:01:12.220> to<00:01:12.250> mist<00:01:13.060> her<00:01:13.300> hair<00:01:13.600> lightly

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
we're going to mist her hair lightly

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.469 
we're going to mist her hair lightly
with<00:01:14.890> water<00:01:15.159> and<00:01:15.400> you<00:01:15.490> do<00:01:15.700> that<00:01:15.880> because<00:01:16.060> if

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
with water and you do that because if

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.940 
with water and you do that because if
you<00:01:16.510> try<00:01:16.900> to<00:01:16.930> brush<00:01:17.350> out<00:01:17.850> biracial<00:01:18.850> hair<00:01:19.950> or

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
you try to brush out biracial hair or

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.770 
you try to brush out biracial hair or
it's<00:01:21.280> really<00:01:21.520> curly<00:01:21.850> hair<00:01:21.880> in<00:01:22.180> general<00:01:22.360> and

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
it's really curly hair in general and

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.960 
it's really curly hair in general and
it's<00:01:23.020> completely<00:01:23.560> dry<00:01:23.860> you're<00:01:24.280> gonna<00:01:24.460> end<00:01:24.760> up

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
it's completely dry you're gonna end up

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.649 
it's completely dry you're gonna end up
with<00:01:25.780> an<00:01:25.930> afro<00:01:26.290> and<00:01:26.620> that's<00:01:27.360> not<00:01:28.360> a<00:01:28.420> good<00:01:28.600> look

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
with an afro and that's not a good look

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.030 
with an afro and that's not a good look
unless<00:01:29.049> that's<00:01:29.229> what<00:01:29.440> you're<00:01:29.590> intending<00:01:29.890> to

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
unless that's what you're intending to

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.289 
unless that's what you're intending to
go<00:01:30.220> for<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:30.640> then<00:01:30.729> I<00:01:30.820> guess<00:01:30.970> that's<00:01:31.150> another

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
go for and then I guess that's another

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:31.890 
go for and then I guess that's another
story

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
story

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.440 
story
so<00:01:32.170> we've<00:01:32.979> lightly<00:01:33.400> misted<00:01:33.729> her<00:01:33.850> hair<00:01:34.060> another

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
so we've lightly misted her hair another

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.120 
so we've lightly misted her hair another
reason<00:01:34.870> for<00:01:34.900> this<00:01:35.140> is<00:01:35.380> because<00:01:35.409> if<00:01:35.710> you<00:01:36.010> were

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
reason for this is because if you were

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.390 
reason for this is because if you were
to<00:01:36.310> use<00:01:36.549> enough<00:01:37.150> of<00:01:37.510> the<00:01:38.130> ion<00:01:39.130> leave-in

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
to use enough of the ion leave-in

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.340 
to use enough of the ion leave-in
conditioner<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:40.240> get<00:01:40.420> her<00:01:40.570> hair<00:01:40.810> wet<00:01:40.840> you're

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
conditioner to get her hair wet you're

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.010 
conditioner to get her hair wet you're
gonna<00:01:41.470> be<00:01:41.680> using<00:01:42.100> like<00:01:42.430> half<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.760> bottle<00:01:42.940> so<00:01:43.360> now

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
gonna be using like half a bottle so now

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.899 
gonna be using like half a bottle so now
we're<00:01:44.229> going<00:01:44.350> to<00:01:44.409> mist<00:01:44.650> her<00:01:44.830> hair<00:01:45.130> with<00:01:45.880> a

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
we're going to mist her hair with a

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.990 
we're going to mist her hair with a
leave-in<00:01:46.210> conditioner<00:01:47.520> which<00:01:48.520> smells<00:01:48.820> really

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
leave-in conditioner which smells really

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.539 
leave-in conditioner which smells really
good<00:01:49.240> by<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.479> way

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
good by the way

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.130 
good by the way
it's<00:01:51.549> like<00:01:51.700> almost<00:01:51.909> a<00:01:52.210> lightly<00:01:52.510> fruity<00:01:53.080> scent

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
it's like almost a lightly fruity scent

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.469 
it's like almost a lightly fruity scent
so<00:01:56.140> we're<00:01:56.290> going<00:01:56.409> to<00:01:56.470> pair<00:01:56.979> with<00:01:57.400> that<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:58.330> as

so we're going to pair with that and as

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.420 

if<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.290> need<00:02:04.470> more<00:02:04.590> water<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:05.010> can<00:02:05.160> do<00:02:05.280> that

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
if you need more water you can do that

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.590 
if you need more water you can do that
too<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:05.820> you're<00:02:05.970> going<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.150> start<00:02:06.390> with<00:02:06.510> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
too so you're going to start with the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.740 
too so you're going to start with the
Tangle<00:02:06.930> Teezer<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.620> I<00:02:08.040> usually<00:02:08.190> start<00:02:08.750> up

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
Tangle Teezer and I usually start up

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.080 
Tangle Teezer and I usually start up
here<00:02:10.020> because<00:02:10.170> her<00:02:10.380> hair<00:02:10.619> as<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.550> can<00:02:11.730> see<00:02:11.910> she

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
here because her hair as you can see she

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.880 
here because her hair as you can see she
hasn't<00:02:12.300> fully<00:02:12.630> grown<00:02:13.350> in<00:02:13.470> her<00:02:13.590> hair<00:02:13.800> around

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
hasn't fully grown in her hair around

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.490 
hasn't fully grown in her hair around
here<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:14.850> that's<00:02:14.970> section<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.540> off<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.080> I

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
here but that's section it off and I

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.380 
here but that's section it off and I
will<00:02:16.710> hold<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.220> down<00:02:17.430> toward<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.850> root<00:02:18.120> so

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
will hold it down toward the root so

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.730 
will hold it down toward the root so
that<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.630> don't<00:02:18.840> pull<00:02:19.050> her<00:02:19.170> hair<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.530> hurt

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
that you don't pull her hair and hurt

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.150 
that you don't pull her hair and hurt
your<00:02:19.950> child<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.810> then<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.740> want<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.980> brush

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
your child and then you want to brush

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.340 
your child and then you want to brush
through<00:02:23.460> on<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.790> top<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.780> bottom<00:02:24.930> like

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
through on the top and the bottom like

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.860 
through on the top and the bottom like
this<00:02:25.970> because<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.240> don't<00:02:27.330> want<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.630> just

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
this because you don't want to just

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.830 
this because you don't want to just
brush<00:02:28.140> through<00:02:29.180> on<00:02:30.180> one<00:02:30.450> or<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.660> other

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
brush through on one or the other

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.160 
brush through on one or the other
because<00:02:31.230> you're<00:02:31.380> going<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.530> end<00:02:31.590> up<00:02:31.860> leaving

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
because you're going to end up leaving

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.300 
because you're going to end up leaving
tangles<00:02:34.170> behind<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:34.620> that's<00:02:34.800> what<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.010> do<00:02:35.100> is

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
tangles behind so that's what I do is

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.680 
tangles behind so that's what I do is
just<00:02:35.340> go<00:02:35.610> throughout<00:02:35.880> her<00:02:36.060> whole<00:02:36.209> head<00:02:36.450> like

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
just go throughout her whole head like

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.410 
just go throughout her whole head like
this<00:02:36.900> section<00:02:37.230> off<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.590> little<00:02:37.830> bit<00:02:38.240> hold<00:02:39.240> it

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
this section off a little bit hold it

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.410 
this section off a little bit hold it
near<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.780> base<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:40.500> brush<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.610> out<00:02:41.700> like<00:02:41.910> this

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
near the base and brush it out like this

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.199 
near the base and brush it out like this
and<00:02:43.410> then<00:02:43.650> I'll<00:02:43.740> come<00:02:43.950> on<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.190> underside<00:02:44.640> and

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
and then I'll come on the underside and

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.510 
and then I'll come on the underside and
brush<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.900> here<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.530> if<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:47.010> spill<00:02:47.310> it

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
brush it here and if you spill it

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.630 
brush it here and if you spill it
pulling<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:49.590> know<00:02:49.709> just<00:02:49.980> be<00:02:50.100> real<00:02:50.310> gentle

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
pulling you know just be real gentle

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.670 
pulling you know just be real gentle
with<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.790> but<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.120> works<00:02:51.300> pretty<00:02:51.660> easily<00:02:51.990> the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
with it but it works pretty easily the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.890 
with it but it works pretty easily the
comb<00:02:52.920> or<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.370> brush<00:02:53.580> goes<00:02:53.880> through<00:02:54.150> there<00:02:54.330> and

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
comb or the brush goes through there and

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.380 
comb or the brush goes through there and
so<00:02:55.140> when<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.380> get<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.739> brushed<00:02:56.310> out<00:02:56.640> just

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
so when you get that brushed out just

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.390 
so when you get that brushed out just
lay<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.690> down<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.380> pick<00:02:58.680> up<00:02:58.830> another<00:02:59.070> section

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
lay it down and pick up another section

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.030 
lay it down and pick up another section
I<00:02:59.760> don't<00:02:59.940> know<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:01.110> back<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.470> her<00:03:01.590> hair<00:03:01.830> gets

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
I don't know I the back of her hair gets

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.630 
I don't know I the back of her hair gets
tangled<00:03:02.340> worse<00:03:03.290> then<00:03:04.290> everything<00:03:04.800> else<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.610> I

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
tangled worse then everything else so I

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.910 
tangled worse then everything else so I
tend<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.060> leave<00:03:06.270> it<00:03:06.570> for<00:03:06.780> last<00:03:07.020> because<00:03:07.440> that's

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
tend to leave it for last because that's

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.900 
tend to leave it for last because that's
my<00:03:08.510> least<00:03:10.489> favorite<00:03:12.050> part<00:03:13.050> to<00:03:13.350> brush<00:03:13.560> out<00:03:13.910> so

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
my least favorite part to brush out so

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.229 
my least favorite part to brush out so
you<00:03:15.030> see<00:03:15.269> that<00:03:15.420> works<00:03:15.630> pretty<00:03:15.870> well<00:03:15.989> there<00:03:17.239> but

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
you see that works pretty well there but

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.750 
you see that works pretty well there but
if<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.480> hold<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.080> hair<00:03:19.350> close<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.670> the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
if you hold the hair close to the

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.400 
if you hold the hair close to the
child's<00:03:21.150> head<00:03:21.360> and<00:03:21.660> then<00:03:21.780> brush<00:03:21.989> out<00:03:22.200> you're

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
child's head and then brush out you're

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.410 
child's head and then brush out you're
not<00:03:22.560> going<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.860> hurt<00:03:23.070> them<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.180> don't

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
not going to hurt them and you don't

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.960 
not going to hurt them and you don't
want<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:24.989> establish<00:03:25.650> like<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.459> negative

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
want to establish like a negative

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.030 
want to establish like a negative
relationship<00:03:27.260> toward<00:03:28.260> having<00:03:28.590> their<00:03:28.860> hair

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
relationship toward having their hair

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.490 
relationship toward having their hair
brushed<00:03:29.310> when<00:03:29.549> they're<00:03:29.670> little<00:03:29.880> like<00:03:30.090> this
