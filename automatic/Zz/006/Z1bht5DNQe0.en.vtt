00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
today we're in the middle of nowhere in

today we're in the middle of nowhere in
Surrey<00:00:28.189> believe<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.340> or<00:00:29.460> not<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.820> is

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
Surrey believe it or not this is

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.490 
Surrey believe it or not this is
actually<00:00:30.180> where<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.779> forefront<00:00:31.230> of

actually where the forefront of

actually where the forefront of
planetary<00:00:31.949> sites<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.399> other<00:00:32.579> space<00:00:32.879> sites

happens

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.490 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.850 

I<00:00:42.550> love<00:00:43.180> the<00:00:43.330> idea<00:00:43.720> that<00:00:43.900> all<00:00:44.290> the<00:00:44.560> stuff<00:00:44.830> that

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
I love the idea that all the stuff that

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.100 
I love the idea that all the stuff that
I<00:00:45.100> do<00:00:45.160> on<00:00:45.460> my<00:00:45.490> computer<00:00:46.060> is<00:00:46.300> data<00:00:46.600> that's<00:00:46.870> come

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
I do on my computer is data that's come

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.160 
I do on my computer is data that's come
all<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:47.560> way<00:00:47.590> from<00:00:47.710> Saturn<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:49.510> took<00:00:49.750> the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
all the way from Saturn it took the

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.010 
all the way from Saturn it took the
spacecraft<00:00:51.040> seven<00:00:51.340> years<00:00:51.520> to<00:00:51.790> get<00:00:51.940> from<00:00:52.360> the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
spacecraft seven years to get from the

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.810 
spacecraft seven years to get from the
earth<00:00:53.170> to<00:00:53.530> something<00:00:53.860> but<00:00:54.220> it<00:00:54.340> sends<00:00:54.520> us<00:00:54.670> back

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
earth to something but it sends us back

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.690 
earth to something but it sends us back
new<00:00:55.000> data<00:00:55.240> every<00:00:55.570> single<00:00:55.840> day<00:00:55.990> but<00:00:56.650> just<00:00:56.920> blows

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
new data every single day but just blows

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.520 
new data every single day but just blows
your<00:00:57.880> mind<00:00:57.940> literally<00:00:58.450> you<00:00:58.750> just<00:00:58.990> think<00:00:59.140> that

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
your mind literally you just think that

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.590 
your mind literally you just think that
is<00:00:59.710> incredible<00:01:00.370> what<00:01:00.970> we<00:01:01.090> can<00:01:01.240> tell<00:01:01.270> by

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
is incredible what we can tell by

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.120 
is incredible what we can tell by
looking<00:01:01.930> at<00:01:01.990> data<00:01:02.140> like<00:01:02.440> this<00:01:02.470> is<00:01:02.860> that

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
looking at data like this is that

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.280 
looking at data like this is that
there's<00:01:03.580> a<00:01:03.640> big<00:01:03.700> moon<00:01:04.000> here<00:01:04.330> which<00:01:04.630> is<00:01:04.900> also

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
there's a big moon here which is also

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.110 
there's a big moon here which is also
giving<00:01:05.860> off<00:01:05.980> dust<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.700> dust<00:01:06.970> is

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
giving off dust and the dust is

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.030 
giving off dust and the dust is
absorbing<00:01:07.570> electrons<00:01:07.960> as<00:01:08.080> well<00:01:08.260> and<00:01:08.530> we<00:01:08.560> can

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
absorbing electrons as well and we can

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.000 
absorbing electrons as well and we can
see<00:01:09.250> that<00:01:09.400> all<00:01:09.550> in<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.910> electron<00:01:10.240> data<00:01:11.010> being

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
see that all in the electron data being

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.350 
see that all in the electron data being
a<00:01:12.100> research<00:01:12.430> scientist<00:01:12.850> is<00:01:13.150> very

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
a research scientist is very

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.630 
a research scientist is very
collaborative<00:01:13.990> your<00:01:14.440> work<00:01:14.650> by<00:01:14.860> itself<00:01:15.250> well

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
collaborative your work by itself well

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.490 
collaborative your work by itself well
it's<00:01:15.880> useful<00:01:16.330> but<00:01:16.450> it's<00:01:16.570> not<00:01:16.780> as<00:01:16.990> useful<00:01:17.229> as<00:01:17.440> it

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
it's useful but it's not as useful as it

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.290 
it's useful but it's not as useful as it
is<00:01:17.740> if<00:01:18.160> you're<00:01:18.220> collaborating<00:01:18.670> with<00:01:19.030> other

this place has always reminded me of
have<00:02:06.910> you<00:02:07.000> seen<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.180> x-men<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:08.110> dr.<00:02:09.070> Xavier's

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
have you seen the x-men and dr. Xavier's

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.360 
have you seen the x-men and dr. Xavier's
mansion<00:02:11.110> in<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.320> middle<00:02:11.530> of<00:02:11.590> nowhere<00:02:11.950> there's

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
mansion in the middle of nowhere there's

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.340 
mansion in the middle of nowhere there's
some<00:02:12.520> really<00:02:12.730> high<00:02:13.060> tech<00:02:13.480> stuff<00:02:13.810> going<00:02:14.230> on

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
some really high tech stuff going on

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.800 
some really high tech stuff going on
here<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:15.520> it<00:02:15.640> feels<00:02:15.880> like<00:02:16.120> if<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:16.570> push<00:02:16.780> a

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
here and it feels like if you push a

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.720 
here and it feels like if you push a
button<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.680> swimming<00:02:17.920> pool<00:02:18.100> will<00:02:18.250> open<00:02:18.610> up

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
button the swimming pool will open up

are<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.520> mechanical<00:02:28.030> workshops<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.780> this<00:02:29.650> is

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
are the mechanical workshops and this is

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.920 
are the mechanical workshops and this is
where<00:02:29.980> actual<00:02:30.580> bits<00:02:30.850> of<00:02:31.090> spacecraft<00:02:31.480> were

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
where actual bits of spacecraft were

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.680 
where actual bits of spacecraft were
built<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:32.710> the<00:02:33.190> instrument<00:02:33.670> i'm<00:02:33.820> using<00:02:34.240> took

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
built so the instrument i'm using took

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.540 
built so the instrument i'm using took
seven<00:02:35.110> years<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.320> get<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.620> some<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.430> was

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
seven years to get to some and it was

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.250 
seven years to get to some and it was
built<00:02:36.730> in<00:02:36.940> this<00:02:37.090> shed<00:02:38.880> bits<00:02:39.880> of<00:02:40.150> Cassini<00:02:41.050> were

are building our instruments is pretty
cool<00:02:54.040> as<00:02:54.220> well<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.850> I<00:02:54.880> can<00:02:55.120> pop<00:02:55.360> down<00:02:55.510> from<00:02:55.750> my

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
cool as well that I can pop down from my
