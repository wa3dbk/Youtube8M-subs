00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:13.980
 hi to all and flash time on a 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.760
 little video on a pc tutor I'm fine 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.130
 think fast as all the tutos measure 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.519
 stop to show you how 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:27.150
 to erase a rewritable dvd - cede 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.529
 respectively only because in 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.820
 did I have a lot there are a lot of 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.610
 people who have to find mackerel 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.829
 tabasco sauce it rained by formatting 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:38.550
 and hard with himself that care cdrs 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.770
 cultivate so I 'm going to show how 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.360
 to do one would quote five times first a 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.710
 8th 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.899
 so it must be software 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.289
 do not misunderstand software you 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:56.250
 I can not take my debut in 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:59.129
 gold xp pro that's not bad so I you 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.449
 showed hours first so I have a 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.019
 certain dimensions that I have never 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.189
 engraved on it so it has six baskets that 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.189
 most people will do that is 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.640
 fertig dreux formatted so not actually that 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.869
 you'll see I do it was a good 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:32.700
 it does not last long on my computer 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:37.549
 formatting normally better it goes a little 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.549
 more than that but we wait 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.020
 at worst I do not have the time 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.850
 that's a little bit longer 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.220
 the formatting is complete as you 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:05.570
 can see then ok so here we close 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:09.380
 we're going this one is the reader 9 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.390
 hours to be able to burn and that's the 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.060
 see it marks inserted clues 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.320
 writable so I have it tight if 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.440
 I'm trying to put something in there 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.550
 I'm still busy posting but here it is 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.410
 will walk but if you put some 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.420
 swamp to engraving it does not matter and everything 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:30.680
 simply because in fact they 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:31.490
 do not detect giving it away so that's 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.230
 normally they should 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.380
 display for example if it is 5 gigas 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.970
 climb should show 5 gigas on his 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:44.240
 gig and when I plains neyton that 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.920
 excuse me a complexion if I put a 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.580
 video will lower it will put by 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.370
 let's admit three villas on his brief 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:56.480
 so when to use the sky and white 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:03:02.150
 succeed burner xp ok there so people 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.260
 want to start being badly crazy so here 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.209
 it's very simple you insert your 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:11.720
 cd and you have everything and get done and in 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:15.080
 cd erased yes she after having you 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.170
 can engrave if you do in the morning I 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.250
 could not sake hot I got 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:27.110
 a lot of people retreats who says this 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:28.130
 problem me too at the beginning yes but there 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.490
 I think it is time that 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:44.360
 is 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:49.760
 it's already good there I had a 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:52.480
 pause so it's him so for the record 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.420
 was faxed so we can close software 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.210
 there we will go on windows player 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:04.580
 media got worse and we got you 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:10.100
 some 3 giga available on 4.3 if 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:12.110
 a video you see 58 - a little 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:22.520
 video so that's because I think and 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:26.560
 better and that's it yes you saw 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.560
 now 3 giga available out of 4.3 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.410
 list here is so it was a small 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:37.460
