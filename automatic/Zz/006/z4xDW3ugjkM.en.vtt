00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.450
 here recently discussed a question related to 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.090
 so that's why people start to value little 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.120
 relationship or value your little 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.059
 it is possible for example not a wife and a chair such 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.940
 An interesting idea to me a friend says here 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.890
 I gave him so much from life east 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.100
 all made so helped 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.439
 I there it is him I list it to him 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.330
 its merits that's what it is there 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.029
 the guy up for what she has done and 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.430
 says and how so here I am so much 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.840
 for him made for last not home 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.760
 I meet 45 years and can not remember it 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.649
 spoke to do so much 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.110
 they managed so much so here he is 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.760
 I am not a cent as it may be that 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.940
 that's how she does 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.699
 that he has parents too we are not there 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.260
 all the heaps gave and went to buy and 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.140
 all that and 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.210
 he, too, doesnâ€™t particularly appreciate it 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.210
 perhaps you are just a man that emotions 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.229
 as if with a soul but he is not a goal and I 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.210
 thought that she was not very right decided 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.020
 will go about what to do video to what 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.240
 really appreciate people and like so 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.090
 that you run all further and now this is not 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.720
 appreciate here seems to me very important 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.840
 understand such a simple thought people always 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.500
 Well, in relation to, including not appreciate 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.740
 what they were given and what they did not invest in 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.860
 what they gave them there or something 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.460
 they will always appreciate what they did 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.560
 yourself and this is so it seems to me 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.479
 the obvious thing and I find it strange that there is 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.210
 many do not understand I just do not understand 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.880
 people 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.140
 let's go to another from another country with 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.390
 back man for example yes 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.460
 wealthy and he is his wife 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.470
 gives gifts for example provided and 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.260
 housing tomato invited his house to live and 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.869
 so on and after some time he is so 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.690
 how so I nadar it so much there 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.670
 gold diamonds and in general it can be 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.600
 say from there outback pulled all 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.580
 so she does not appreciate the activator and went to 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.040
 another reason she could have it 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.810
 Do not evaluate at all and then absolutely 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.660
 similarly and the rule is people 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.870
 will never appreciate what they gave 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.980
 is that they were presented with what it is that 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.410
 they have invested 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.140
 people will always appreciate what they are 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.959
 Do yourself and the fact that they 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.030
 someone invested so very interesting 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.220
 the trend of the usual so lamenting 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.010
 those people who actually invested 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.350
 into something when you put your soul 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.480
 your money your time into something you 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.580
 you start to appreciate it and therefore that 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.709
 men and for women to other water i 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.930
 so much invested in it and how are you 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.030
 doesn't really value it 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.519
 very much appreciates and she this person 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.410
 very much beginning to appreciate but not 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.660
 the opposite is not due to the fact that you are in it 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.790
 he invested you now will appreciate no 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.420
 he will appreciate you then when he 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.610
 will lay as much and this rule is needed 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.989
 understand and in no case need 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.980
 thinking that if you are someone to something 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.470
 gave 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.739
 then automatically that person starts 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.140
 you appreciate it no, he will start you 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.150
 then appreciate when he gives you the answer 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.269
 something the same or you for him 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.280
 did anything he would appreciate no 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.530
 it you will appreciate it for what you 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.140
 for him it was done that is the more 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.880
 you do something for someone all the more 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.510
 in your eyes this person becomes 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.900
 valuable and in the opposite direction it is not 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.209
 acts therefore it seems to me never 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.790
 worth investing in a person more than 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.829
 he invests in you is not worth spending 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.549
 time per person more than he spends 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:51.100
 you should not invest your strength 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.870
 husband more than he puts you because 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.000
 that otherwise there will be a bias 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.700
 imbalances you begin to appreciate it more 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.110
 and you will demand from him that he 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.520
 appreciated you more though they are clearly 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.700
 will appreciate you more if you have him 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.550
 also three kopecks there and time well I 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.500
 as if in pennies not only in money but 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.830
 in general, he still did not give you 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.450
 may be enough so that you appreciate no well 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.400
 help tell me to let him too 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.579
 rely on and it will start you like this 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.829
 it works therefore family relationships 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:25.040
 This is especially true in pairs in which 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.490
 one such ah I'm for him there at all and not 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.720
 I know I run there I cook dinner and beautiful 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.690
 I look and toyota 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.370
 she doesn't appreciate girls we won't have 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.100
 appreciate until he does the same for you 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.050
 most so slow down a little 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.540
 man if for girls too 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.220
 try to slow down a lot too 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.220
 always keep the balance even if you 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.570
 Man wants to do something 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.880
 keep balance until it is you 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.190
 answered do not do further otherwise this 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.320
 imbalance mango will drive into such not 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.790
 equivalent relationships in which you 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.040
 will be uncomfortable because you want 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.230
 to appreciate you but he still for this 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.480
 enough or she still for this 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.310
 didn't do enough well then friends i 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.890
 I hope this idea will help you. 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.320
 sort out a little bit of your relationship 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.479
 will help to feel where you are allowed 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.510
 some kind of warp where you overdid it 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:16.400
 0 and vice versa where you have not tried yet 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.680
 if you feel required of you 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.850
 some 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.400
 respect too much something 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.680
 is it and you feel that well, I somehow 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.479
 not very ready and then perhaps even our 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.669
 little in this man have invested strength there 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:30.860
 their time of some kind of internal 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.860
