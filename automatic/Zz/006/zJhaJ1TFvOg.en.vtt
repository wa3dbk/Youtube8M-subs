00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
but I kind of contributed to me just

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.380 
but I kind of contributed to me just
putting<00:02:25.830> water<00:02:26.100> on<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.550> instead<00:02:26.850> of<00:02:26.910> mixing<00:02:27.300> it

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390

conditioner hair ok talks
I<00:02:41.220> put<00:02:41.910> probably<00:02:42.120> about<00:02:42.500> twenty<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.740> thirty

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
I put probably about twenty to thirty

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:44.570 
I put probably about twenty to thirty
percent

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
percent

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.420 
percent
conditioner<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.600> rest<00:02:45.840> was<00:02:46.020> water<00:02:46.430> and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
conditioner and the rest was water and

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.300 
conditioner and the rest was water and
that<00:02:47.700> kind<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.060> brought<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.980> softness<00:02:49.980> back

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
that kind of brought the softness back

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.820 
that kind of brought the softness back
to<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.700> hair<00:02:50.960> as<00:02:51.960> you<00:02:52.170> guys<00:02:52.320> know<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.800> a

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
to the hair as you guys know this is a

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.740 
to the hair as you guys know this is a
waterway<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.610> hair<00:02:53.790> gets<00:02:54.030> tangled<00:02:54.270> up<00:02:54.600> a

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
waterway so the hair gets tangled up a

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.080 
waterway so the hair gets tangled up a
little<00:02:55.080> bit<00:02:55.230> but<00:02:55.650> not<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:55.920> much<00:02:56.400> where<00:02:56.790> it

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
little bit but not that much where it

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.800 
little bit but not that much where it
was<00:02:57.500> distracting<00:02:58.500> or<00:02:59.250> like<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.940> don't<00:03:00.510> want

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
this hair it just tangled up when the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.200 
this hair it just tangled up when the
curls<00:03:04.890> just<00:03:04.950> kind<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.220> interlock<00:03:05.670> but<00:03:06.030> like

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
curls just kind of interlock but like

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.580 
curls just kind of interlock but like
you<00:03:06.360> see<00:03:06.540> what<00:03:06.750> I'm<00:03:06.840> doing<00:03:07.020> now<00:03:07.140> is<00:03:07.170> running<00:03:07.530> my

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
you see what I'm doing now is running my

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.830 
you see what I'm doing now is running my
fingers<00:03:07.950> through<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.640> was<00:03:09.150> able<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.510> get<00:03:09.720> the

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
fingers through it I was able to get the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.610 
fingers through it I was able to get the
tangles<00:03:10.110> out<00:03:10.380> by<00:03:11.960> doing<00:03:12.960> that<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.200> just

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
tangles out by doing that and just

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.870 
tangles out by doing that and just
waiting<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.070> just<00:03:14.250> go<00:03:14.490> in

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
waiting and just go in

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.370 
waiting and just go in
I<00:03:14.910> will<00:03:15.210> rate<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.170> shedding<00:03:16.530> about<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.430> four

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
I will rate the shedding about a four

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.570 
I will rate the shedding about a four
yes<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.590> haven't<00:03:19.830> read<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.130> something<00:03:20.550> that

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
yes I haven't read it something that

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.580 
yes I haven't read it something that
high<00:03:20.970> in<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.210> long<00:03:21.390> time<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.200> reason<00:03:22.470> why<00:03:22.560> I

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
high in a long time and the reason why I

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.860 
high in a long time and the reason why I
say<00:03:22.890> that<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:23.280> because<00:03:23.510> when<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.630> hair

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
say that is because when the hair

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.410 
say that is because when the hair
interlocks<00:03:25.800> or<00:03:26.190> you<00:03:26.730> know<00:03:26.820> entwined<00:03:27.270> with
