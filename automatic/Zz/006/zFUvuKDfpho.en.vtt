00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.639
 but how about friends from youtube 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.290
 welcome back video I am from 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.819
 esna jurek equal not quickly I'm going 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.309
 to show how to download call of duty 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.530
 black ops is the latest version 1.0 point 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.170
 5 and then the truth is that it's too much 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.080
 good 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.369
 I recommend them too much and everything goes 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.710
 to go very well if they continue exactly 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.150
 the steps that should make an error 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.580
 more than an error that could come out 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.260
 but in the description of the video I'm going 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.939
 to leave how to solve that problem if 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.099
 is that it comes out and I 'm going to tell you which 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.539
 after good first of all we have 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.520
 that go to the links that I'm going to leave 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.010
 in the description of the video that is one 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.070
 which has the game pk for 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.040
 install it and the other the folder of the 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.989
 game data ok game data 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.140
 they are more or less heavy are 144 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.030
 megabytes and the apec to 39 megabytes ok 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.559
 you have to give it here where if you fold and a 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.690
 Once they have downloaded this they will 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.909
 be two files two files very 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:58.339
 weird that some would carry the data in this 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.979
 case this is the winrar of the data of the 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.930
 call of duty black ops and the apk nothing more 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:06.250
 no pardon was a file come with the 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.520
 data and the other one is the pk 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.030
 well then let's right click 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.720
 extract here 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.250
 the letter of the data if they do not have 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.900
 winrar them driving video as 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.050
 download install 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.300
 and well let's wait ok make sure 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.870
 have enough space and now 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.610
 let's connect the cell phone and good as 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.440
 come here is already with the cellular theme and 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.720
 good if we go to this good team 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.630
 although my cell phone has room to spare 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.640
 because I have 22 gigabytes left 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.590
 good enough space once in 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.140
 our cell phone connected we're going to 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.260
 the folder that says android and here we go 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.560
 to pass the folder with the data of the 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.560
 game 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.730
 let's wait for them to pass while 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.980
 I'm going to pause 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.510
 and well they already passed and well 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.760
 let's move here once and for all 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:03.710
 the game apk file 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.710
 This is very fast, it weighs almost nothing 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.740
 good ready now let's move on to 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.240
 cellular and good once full modular 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.760
 what we are going to do is get to 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.590
 file explorer or how you guys 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.160
 know how to find the files that have just 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.530
 pay in this case 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.690
 my cell phone brings by default is that it says 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.820
 file management if you do not have 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.710
 some to look for so they 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.800
 I recommend 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.840
 espil explorer is for is equal good 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.740
 let's open it and we search here 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.830
 interprets excellent let's look for what 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.780
 we put in the android folder because 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.990
 as you see here is 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.760
 up to the folder of the 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.930
 data and here is the application we are going to 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.730
 install it let's install there are 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.190
 installed an application is known 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.709
 they have to in the description of 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.510
 video I leave as you can 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.100
 solve the possible problems that 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.080
 have when installing the game 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.320
 accepting one that I will explain to 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.320
 final 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.920
 and well it was installed before 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.159
 you arrive in April you have to 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.109
 squeeze where it says done and good before 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:21.129
 to open the game we will select the 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:23.769
 data folder and we're going to give it in 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.689
 cut cut or copy like you 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.870
 want to put us in the folder that 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:29.290
 says or bb well if they do not have it then the 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.140
 create 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.709
 then here we are going to paste the data 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.389
 and once we wait for the data we are going to 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.400
 open the game for the first time but 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.329
 when they open it for the first time they have 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.329
 have an internet connection 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.390
 and they must have done all that 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:51.510
 we did this one a moment ago 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.720
 there is activision 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.580
 [Music] 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.070
 and as you see in what more could be 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.690
 take is to download the game as they see the 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.200
 installation and all this is very 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.200
 simple 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.420
 you are right 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.160
 all hopefully very well perfectly if 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.510
 They did as I explained 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:18.229
 there must be no problem 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.910
 give it light and if you liked it if it served you in 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.709
 serious and it is very much one of the problems 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.320
 what you can have when you open the game is 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.940
 the game is not open or after 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.400
 that leaves the activision closes the 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.750
 game if you want to know how to solve 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.400
 this problem in the description of 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.620
 video I leave the link of the video I made 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.449
 to solve this problem because I 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.150
 before I had it but as they see it no longer in 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.289
 game if I open perfectly and this does not 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.460
 serves only for this game but 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.510
 any game that does not open 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.340
 correctly 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.080
 he taught them in the video section how 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.270
 fix that problem of the eggs that 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.229
 they close only because nothing else would be 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.570
 all 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.570
 dale like subscribe and until next time
