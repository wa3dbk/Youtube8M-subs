00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.240
 crunchy almonds our when uci for 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.340

 anise seed soup the zest of a 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.070
 orange 210 liters of ricard so that I 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.719
 the dish to enhance the taste of the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.870
 nive that even if you do not drink 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.269
 alcohol of course would not put it 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:52.920
 also a half glass of neutral then 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:55.289
 That's about 7 to 7 cm oil 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.539
 a little bit of bitter almond aromas 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.280
 as well as a vanilla pod that their 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.769
 graffiti at first we go 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.129
 take care of bleaching the egg jets 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:07.369
 with sugar as well as with the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.369
 vanilla 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.370
 I'm going to scrape the vanilla pod 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.480
 open jallet in two and I scratch 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.480
 with the back of a knife 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:29.910
 with the whip it's because the mixture 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.620
 is well and truly well sent 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.450
 sparkling voice will book 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:38.090
 now in the robot's tank 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.090
 put the flour that adds the yeast 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.400
 this scene then put the sheet 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.500
 I'm already going to mix the flour 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.620
 I add the zoo 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.730
 in addition this balance seems to be good but 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.730
 Japan is coming out 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.970
 I will add him 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.150
 ja plays my role 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.180
 bonus 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.349
 the world 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.250
 I finish with a few drops 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.250
 bitter almond aromas 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:54.620
 job champion here I like me from 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:03:00.970
 parchment paper in the dish I'm going 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.970
 add some grease money 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.480
 I will drop my dough and then I will 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.630
 to flatten to try to get some 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.830
 Rectangular enough thing 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.690
 traditionally the cantons that have 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.180
 makes two sailboat rollers of buddha 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.800
 and then in the oven we'll go to 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.960
 conflict a little bit that we will detail 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.930
 in slices I want you 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.430
 present the recipe this way I 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.960
 find that it is more original since 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.420
 just it will change a little bit 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.660
 not in the form of lightened Buddhas 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.060
 preheat the oven to 180 degrees so we 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.800
 will leave for about 15 minutes 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.380
 a quarter of an hour after cooking 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.960
 so the costs all china went out of the 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.650
 fire they are not fully cooked and 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.850
 That's the point 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.250
 what I'm going to do now is 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.710
 that I cut into pieces and I'm going 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.710
 return them in an oven at around 100 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.290
 120 degrees for drying it 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.420
 completely cooked in the end we will have 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.560
 again for a half an hour and 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.560
 then there we will have finished 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.329
 10 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.560
 you see I cut them in small 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.330
 tape and then in the other direction 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.490
 now we will put them to dry on 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.950
 a plate 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.250
 so here I insist I put them at 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.590
 oven or still to dry during a 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.240
 good half going between 100 and 120 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.610
 degrees no more because otherwise they will 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.560
 browning is actually the crisp ones to 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.750
 Almond defect shot is light-colored 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.400
 so here they are going to dry up go 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.060
 take the rest of the noon tea they have 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.920
 and then here they are going to keep this 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.160
 color and this texture but they will 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.450
 hard here's the crunch 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.460
 are finished and I let them dry 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.370
 in the oven about forty minutes 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.600
 you see there we can see the lovers of 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.870
 vanilla on orange voi 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.980
 they are very dry knew that happiness 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.040
 I'm already salivating 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.680
 no ben I keep calmer go to 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.690
