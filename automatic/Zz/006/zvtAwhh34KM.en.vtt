old Mercedes diesel engine and I and I
looked<00:00:10.019> at<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.200> said<00:00:10.530> wow<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.429> has<00:00:11.610> got<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.120> be

looked at I said wow this has got to be

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.460 
looked at I said wow this has got to be
a<00:00:12.540> really<00:00:13.200> good<00:00:13.620> example<00:00:13.950> for<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.759> very

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
a really good example for a very

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
a really good example for a very
important<00:00:16.470> lesson<00:00:16.650> I'm<00:00:16.949> talking<00:00:17.250> about<00:00:17.310> a

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
important lesson I'm talking about a

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.210 
important lesson I'm talking about a
lesson<00:00:17.820> for<00:00:18.119> all<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.300> us<00:00:18.570> who<00:00:19.350> do<00:00:19.590> work<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:20.070> our

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
lesson for all of us who do work on our

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.179 
lesson for all of us who do work on our
own<00:00:20.369> cars<00:00:20.730> or<00:00:21.150> who<00:00:21.449> just<00:00:21.480> drive<00:00:22.080> cars<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.769> want

own cars or who just drive cars and want
them<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.609> last<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:24.240> long<00:00:24.779> time

let me show you up close what I'm
looking<00:00:27.390> at<00:00:27.510> here<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.840> think<00:00:28.019> you'll<00:00:28.170> be

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
looking at here and I think you'll be

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.790 
looking at here and I think you'll be
surprised<00:00:28.980> as<00:00:29.310> well<00:00:30.289> just<00:00:31.289> look<00:00:31.529> at<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
surprised as well just look at the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.580 
surprised as well just look at the
extent<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.550> corrosion<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.840> aluminum

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590

extent of the corrosion on this aluminum
thermostat<00:00:35.340> housing<00:00:36.020> look<00:00:37.020> at<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.290> look<00:00:37.559> at

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
thermostat housing look at that look at

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.450 
thermostat housing look at that look at
it's<00:00:37.980> actually<00:00:38.430> almost<00:00:38.940> corroded<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.690> hole

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
it's actually almost corroded a hole

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.340 
it's actually almost corroded a hole
completely<00:00:41.460> through<00:00:41.790> right<00:00:42.510> there<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.079> look

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
completely through right there and look

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.910 
completely through right there and look
at<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> build-up<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:45.210> corrosion<00:00:45.770> this<00:00:46.770> is

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
at the build-up of the corrosion this is

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.100 
at the build-up of the corrosion this is
where<00:00:47.160> one<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.850> cones<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.539> clamped<00:00:48.989> on

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
where one of the cones is clamped on

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.410 
where one of the cones is clamped on
right<00:00:49.440> here<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.879> might<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.210> wondering

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
right here and you might be wondering

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
right here and you might be wondering
what<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> world<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:53.180> causing<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.440> well

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
what in the world is causing that well

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.830 
what in the world is causing that well
can<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.949> imagine<00:00:56.070> if<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.300> happening

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
can you imagine if this is happening

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.139 
can you imagine if this is happening
here<00:00:58.260> what<00:00:58.710> might<00:00:59.039> be<00:00:59.399> happening<00:00:59.640> elsewhere

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
here what might be happening elsewhere

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.569 
here what might be happening elsewhere
inside<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.989> engine<00:01:01.140> particularly<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.399> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
inside the engine particularly if the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.450 
inside the engine particularly if the
engine<00:01:02.850> has<00:01:03.030> an<00:01:03.210> aluminum<00:01:03.629> cylinder<00:01:03.960> head

engine has an aluminum cylinder head
this<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.900> I've<00:01:07.170> seen<00:01:07.280> create<00:01:08.420> problems

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
this this this I've seen create problems

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.539 
this this this I've seen create problems
throughout<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.500> engine<00:01:10.590> including<00:01:10.950> problems

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
throughout the engine including problems

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.660 
throughout the engine including problems
with<00:01:11.670> premature<00:01:11.880> head<00:01:12.450> gasket<00:01:12.930> failure<00:01:13.140> and

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
guess as to what what caused this I'm

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.090 
guess as to what what caused this I'm
sure<00:01:24.090> some<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.570> already<00:01:24.810> know<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.560> some

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
sure some of you already know and some

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.580 
sure some of you already know and some
of<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.430> seen<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.820> before<00:01:27.030> but<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.229> is

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
of you have seen this before but this is

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.910 
of you have seen this before but this is
a<00:01:28.650> classic<00:01:29.490> example<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:30.420> what<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.659> call<00:01:30.780> lack<00:01:31.560> of

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
a classic example of what I call lack of

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.359 
a classic example of what I call lack of
coolant<00:01:32.549> maintenance<00:01:33.259> okay<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:35.159> could

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
coolant maintenance okay and this could

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.200 
coolant maintenance okay and this could
take<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> couple<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.780> forms<00:01:37.170> number<00:01:37.530> one

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
take on a couple of forms number one

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.420 
take on a couple of forms number one
never<00:01:39.210> changing<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.619> coolant<00:01:40.979> or<00:01:41.100> flushing

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
never changing the coolant or flushing

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.819 
never changing the coolant or flushing
your<00:01:41.729> cooling<00:01:42.090> system<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.720> could<00:01:43.500> be<00:01:43.619> one

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
your cooling system that could be one

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.950 
your cooling system that could be one
reason<00:01:43.860> another<00:01:44.460> reason<00:01:44.549> which<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.479> think<00:01:45.840> is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
reason another reason which I I think is

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.380 
reason another reason which I I think is
even<00:01:46.200> more<00:01:46.470> common<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.909> people<00:01:48.240> have

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
even more common is that people have

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.359 
even more common is that people have
these<00:01:48.570> old<00:01:48.780> cars<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.409> they<00:01:49.500> develop<00:01:50.070> little

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
these old cars and they develop little

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.130 
these old cars and they develop little
coolant<00:01:50.729> leaks<00:01:50.909> whether<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.450> be<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> small<00:01:51.780> leak

in the coolant system and and you can
imagine<00:02:04.829> over<00:02:04.890> time<00:02:05.040> if<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.579> do<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:06.200> you

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
imagine over time if you do that you

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.350 
imagine over time if you do that you
just<00:02:07.229> pretty<00:02:07.740> soon<00:02:08.069> have<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.879> know<00:02:08.970> 80<00:02:09.239> 90

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
just pretty soon have you know 80 90

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.260 
just pretty soon have you know 80 90
percent<00:02:10.020> water<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.709> very

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
percent water and very

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.110 
percent water and very
remember<00:02:11.930> coolant<00:02:12.410> has<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.920> rust<00:02:13.340> inhibitor<00:02:14.000> in

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
remember coolant has a rust inhibitor in

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.260 
remember coolant has a rust inhibitor in
it<00:02:14.500> corrosion<00:02:15.500> inhibitors<00:02:16.130> as<00:02:16.340> well<00:02:17.090> as

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
it corrosion inhibitors as well as

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.050 
it corrosion inhibitors as well as
lubricants<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.460> prolong<00:02:19.460> the<00:02:19.670> life<00:02:19.850> of

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
lubricants that prolong the life of

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.600 
lubricants that prolong the life of
things<00:02:20.300> like<00:02:20.570> your<00:02:20.900> wire<00:02:21.290> pump<00:02:21.620> so<00:02:22.400> if<00:02:22.490> you

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
things like your wire pump so if you

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.670 
things like your wire pump so if you
think<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:23.000> can<00:02:23.180> just<00:02:23.390> drive<00:02:24.020> your<00:02:24.230> car<00:02:24.470> around

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
think you can just drive your car around

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.070 
think you can just drive your car around
with<00:02:25.250> very<00:02:25.640> little<00:02:25.850> cool<00:02:26.150> in<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.480> or<00:02:26.630> a<00:02:26.690> real

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
with very little cool in it or a real

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.370 
with very little cool in it or a real
dirty<00:02:27.500> coolant<00:02:28.450> this<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:29.660> what<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:30.200> can

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
dirty coolant this is what you can

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.890 
dirty coolant this is what you can
expect<00:02:30.770> okay<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.880> either<00:02:32.030> pay<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.360> little<00:02:32.750> now

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
expect okay you either pay a little now

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.740 
expect okay you either pay a little now
or<00:02:33.320> you<00:02:33.470> pay<00:02:33.710> a<00:02:33.740> lot<00:02:34.040> later

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
or you pay a lot later

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.320 
or you pay a lot later
so<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:36.080> recommend<00:02:36.710> depending<00:02:37.550> upon<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:38.090> type

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
so I recommend depending upon the type

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.180 
so I recommend depending upon the type
of<00:02:38.360> driving<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:39.200> you<00:02:39.350> change<00:02:39.710> your<00:02:39.800> coolant

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
of driving that you change your coolant

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.490 
of driving that you change your coolant
at<00:02:40.280> least<00:02:40.610> every<00:02:41.120> three<00:02:41.360> years<00:02:41.390> you<00:02:41.720> know<00:02:41.810> take

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
at least every three years you know take

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.590 
at least every three years you know take
it<00:02:42.650> into<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.010> place<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.550> does<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.940> it's<00:02:44.090> really

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
it into a place that does it it's really

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.930 
it into a place that does it it's really
a<00:02:44.630> messy<00:02:45.020> job<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.650> it's<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.520> know<00:02:46.550> you<00:02:46.700> know

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
a messy job and it's you know you know

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.000 
a messy job and it's you know you know
you<00:02:47.360> need<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:47.720> get<00:02:47.900> rid<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.410> old<00:02:48.530> coolant

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
you need to get rid of the old coolant

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.860 
you need to get rid of the old coolant
so<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.640> recommend<00:02:50.210> this<00:02:50.360> something<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:50.720> just

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
so I recommend this something you just

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.800 
so I recommend this something you just
have<00:02:51.140> done<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.970> know<00:02:53.090> get<00:02:53.270> the<00:02:53.420> system

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
have done and you know get the system

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.720 
have done and you know get the system
flushed<00:02:54.080> out<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.320> put<00:02:54.620> new<00:02:54.860> proper<00:02:55.490> cooling

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
flushed out and put new proper cooling

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.810 
flushed out and put new proper cooling
okay<00:02:56.540> it's<00:02:56.900> very<00:02:57.140> important<00:02:57.560> that<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:58.520> use

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
okay it's very important that you use

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.420 
okay it's very important that you use
mercedes-benz<00:02:59.740> specification<00:03:00.740> coolant<00:03:01.160> if

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
mercedes-benz specification coolant if

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.120 
mercedes-benz specification coolant if
the<00:03:02.330> shop<00:03:02.630> doing<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.320> flush<00:03:03.590> won't<00:03:03.860> use<00:03:04.100> that

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
the shop doing the flush won't use that

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.890 
the shop doing the flush won't use that
coolant<00:03:04.700> then<00:03:04.910> go<00:03:05.180> somewhere<00:03:05.420> else

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
coolant then go somewhere else

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.840 
coolant then go somewhere else
because<00:03:06.230> that's<00:03:06.440> an<00:03:06.620> absolute<00:03:07.250> must<00:03:07.580> on

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
because that's an absolute must on

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.260 
because that's an absolute must on
Mercedes<00:03:08.810> Benz<00:03:09.230> in<00:03:09.410> particular<00:03:09.950> that<00:03:10.640> you<00:03:10.940> use

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
Mercedes Benz in particular that you use

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.880 
Mercedes Benz in particular that you use
the<00:03:11.540> proper<00:03:12.670> m.b.a<00:03:13.670> coolant<00:03:14.180> okay<00:03:14.540> so<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.530> word

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
the proper m.b.a coolant okay so a word

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.140 
the proper m.b.a coolant okay so a word
till<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.480> DI<00:03:17.720> wire<00:03:18.460> do<00:03:19.460> not<00:03:19.670> let<00:03:19.910> this<00:03:20.090> happen

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
till the DI wire do not let this happen

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.660 
till the DI wire do not let this happen
to<00:03:20.630> you
