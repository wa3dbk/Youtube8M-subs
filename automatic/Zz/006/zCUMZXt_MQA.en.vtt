00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello to you andrew andreevich my 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:09.240
 YouTube channel all-all ru and we decide 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:12.660
 task 270 and there are 277 and so how many 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.320
 contained under the letter a eighth in a fraction 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.990
 three fourths now we have three fourths 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.779
 and we need to be the eighth as we 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.869
 make the denominator the eighth 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.019
 you need to multiply by 2 multiply by 2 and in 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:37.050
 denominator and in numerator 3 multiply by 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:38.730
 2 and 4 multiply by 2 2 by 483 by 26 we 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.640
 we have rights and numerator and denominator 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.809
 multiply by the same number in this 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.870
 case multiplied by 2 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.120
 why there is pressed for 2 because 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.610
 we need you to know whether it was 84 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.949
 if he can but two fights just 8 a 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.570
 why did we need to be eight 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.570
 because we were asked how many 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:03.449
 is contained eighth that is whether it takes 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:07.680
 should be 8 under the letter b / three fifths 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.820
 so 2 under the letter b / we have three fifths and 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.229
 you ask how many of us 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.820
 contains tenths in the womb three fifths 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.070
 that there is much to learn 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.009
 It contains tenths you need to do in order to 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.009
 the denominator was 10 like a five 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.799
 make ten through multiplication you need 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.619
 multiply by 22 multiply by 5 will 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:32.950
 ten times we denominator multiplied by 2 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:36.729
 then the numerator also needs to be multiplied by 2 3 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.679
 multiply by 2 will be 6 we are at twos 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.509
 multiplied above and below it turned out six 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:45.550
 tenths 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:48.750
 the answer of the 60s under the letter v is given a fraction of 75 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:52.990
 they and we are asked how much is contained 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.119
 fifteenth in fraction 7 5 to find out 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.069
 how many fifteen are needed 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.360
 so that the denominator was 15 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.610
 how do we know whether 15 needs 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.229
 multiply by 3 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.070
 if we multiply knows in the denominator by 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:13.920
 three will be three to 5-15 but then you need and 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:17.730
 the numerator also multiply by 33 by 721 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:23.549
 so the following is under the letter g 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:26.470
 how many cells are there in 1 4 to 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.780
 find out how many combos you need to know 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.640
 whether that was 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.730
 how much to multiply 4 to 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:39.280
 it turned out 104 needs to be multiplied by 25 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:41.680
 then it will be 100 if we multiply 4 by 25 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.060
 it turned out 100 then one thing too 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.739
 multiply by cheat by 25 we multiply from above 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:55.470
 25 and below 25 25 hectare contained 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:59.739
 so under the letter d two-fifths 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.329
 how many are the twenties in the fraction two 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.680
 fifth 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.030
 to find out how many twenties you need 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.430
 so that the denominator was twenty 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.819
 so we multiply and denominator by 4 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.209
 there will be 20 and the numerator also multiplies by 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:16.540
 the same number is also 4 is 88 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.209
 twenties and the last question which 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:24.250
 ask under the letter e how much 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:25.900
 contains comb in a fraction of 2 25 but nachitka 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.530
 the denominator should be 100 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.230
 so multiply by 4 25 multiply by 4 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.609
 will be 100 2 multiplied by 4 will be eight 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.750
 eight hundredths 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.530
 such a short and simple task 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.109
 My name is Andrew Andreevich 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.560
 my channel on youtube and all ru all 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.560
 until
