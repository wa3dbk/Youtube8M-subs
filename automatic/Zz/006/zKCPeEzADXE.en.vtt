little<00:04:44.210> bit<00:04:44.300> different<00:04:44.630> I<00:04:44.660> kind<00:04:44.870> of<00:04:44.930> like

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
little bit different I kind of like

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.560 
little bit different I kind of like
messing<00:04:45.380> around<00:04:45.470> with<00:04:45.910> drone<00:04:46.910> or<00:04:47.180> open

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
messing around with drone or open

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.440 
messing around with drone or open
strings<00:04:48.250> we're<00:04:49.250> gonna<00:04:49.340> take<00:04:49.610> this<00:04:49.850> sixth<00:04:50.240> here

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
strings we're gonna take this sixth here

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.710 
strings we're gonna take this sixth here

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
we have the twelfth fret first string

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.720 
we have the twelfth fret first string
thirteenth<00:04:54.470> fret<00:04:54.710> third<00:04:55.130> string

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
thirteenth fret third string

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.150 
thirteenth fret third string
I'm<00:04:56.480> hybrid<00:04:57.020> picking<00:04:57.230> what<00:04:57.740> I'm<00:04:57.800> gonna<00:04:57.890> do<00:04:58.100> is

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
I'm hybrid picking what I'm gonna do is

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.730 
I'm hybrid picking what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:04:58.280> gonna<00:04:58.370> pick<00:04:58.840> the<00:04:59.840> first<00:05:00.140> note<00:05:00.260> and<00:05:00.650> I'm

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
I'm gonna pick the first note and I'm

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.670 
I'm gonna pick the first note and I'm
gonna<00:05:01.419> play<00:05:02.419> the<00:05:02.660> twelfth<00:05:03.169> fret<00:05:03.260> first<00:05:03.620> string

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
gonna play the twelfth fret first string

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.640 
gonna play the twelfth fret first string
and<00:05:04.190> then<00:05:04.970> pull<00:05:05.180> off<00:05:05.300> to<00:05:05.450> the<00:05:05.540> open<00:05:05.840> string<00:05:06.110> and

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.020 

as<00:05:09.650> I<00:05:09.770> move<00:05:09.950> these<00:05:10.130> six<00:05:10.460> down

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.490 

I'm<00:05:14.030> just<00:05:14.360> every<00:05:14.690> note<00:05:14.840> that's<00:05:15.020> on<00:05:15.170> the<00:05:15.290> first

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
I'm just every note that's on the first

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:23.760 
I'm just every note that's on the first
string

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:37.029 

so<00:05:24.770> if<00:05:24.860> I<00:05:24.919> do<00:05:24.979> it<00:05:25.099> quicker<00:05:26.860> not<00:05:27.860> see<00:05:36.039> there's

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
so if I do it quicker not see there's

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.230 
so if I do it quicker not see there's
just<00:05:37.069> a<00:05:37.250> little<00:05:37.430> bit<00:05:37.520> different<00:05:37.879> not

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
just a little bit different not

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.480 
just a little bit different not
real-world<00:05:38.689> a<00:05:38.810> normal<00:05:39.110> guitar<00:05:39.259> signing<00:05:39.800> you

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
real-world a normal guitar signing you

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.920 
real-world a normal guitar signing you
can<00:05:40.610> do<00:05:40.669> that<00:05:40.759> with<00:05:40.879> any<00:05:41.000> of<00:05:41.090> these<00:05:41.210> the<00:05:41.750> last

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
can do that with any of these the last

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.929 
can do that with any of these the last
one<00:05:42.139> we<00:05:42.319> do<00:05:42.439> here<00:05:42.710> there's<00:05:43.189> a<00:05:43.280> little<00:05:43.580> out<00:05:43.759> of

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:43.939 
one we do here there's a little out of

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:45.730 
one we do here there's a little out of
the<00:05:44.120> Blues<00:05:44.900> room<00:05:45.169> might<00:05:45.349> be<00:05:45.379> a<00:05:45.469> little<00:05:45.560> more

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
the Blues room might be a little more

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.689 
the Blues room might be a little more
country<00:05:46.900> we're<00:05:47.900> on<00:05:47.960> the<00:05:48.050> 9th<00:05:48.229> fret<00:05:48.610> 2nd<00:05:49.610> and

country we're on the 9th fret 2nd and

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.730 
country we're on the 9th fret 2nd and
4th<00:05:49.879> strings<00:05:50.150> we're<00:05:50.810> gonna<00:05:50.930> have<00:05:51.139> then<00:05:51.530> note

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
4th strings we're gonna have then note

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.469 
4th strings we're gonna have then note
on<00:05:51.919> the<00:05:52.069> second<00:05:52.610> string<00:05:52.759> pulling<00:05:53.060> off<00:05:53.240> to<00:05:53.270> the

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
on the second string pulling off to the

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.649 
on the second string pulling off to the
open<00:05:53.840> B<00:05:54.229> string<00:05:54.280> which<00:05:55.280> the<00:05:55.639> beam<00:05:55.909> or<00:05:56.180> the<00:05:56.360> open

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:56.659 
open B string which the beam or the open

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:58.959 
open B string which the beam or the open
second<00:05:57.050> string<00:05:57.080> that<00:05:57.440> happens<00:05:57.770> to<00:05:57.949> be<00:05:58.099> the

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:58.969 
second string that happens to be the

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:01.809 
second string that happens to be the
fifth<00:05:59.210> note<00:05:59.449> in<00:05:59.659> an<00:05:59.840> E<00:06:00.080> major<00:06:00.259> one<00:06:00.740> so<00:06:01.699> it's

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:01.819 
fifth note in an E major one so it's

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:09.400 
fifth note in an E major one so it's
still<00:06:02.000> a<00:06:02.030> chord<00:06:02.330> tone<00:06:02.569> it<00:06:02.750> still<00:06:02.990> works

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.180 

so<00:06:10.370> what<00:06:10.490> I<00:06:10.520> have<00:06:10.790> here<00:06:10.990> ninth<00:06:11.990> fret<00:06:12.320> on<00:06:12.830> both

of over a over an e-minor kind of chord

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:58.760 
of over a over an e-minor kind of chord
progression<00:06:55.970> and<00:06:56.970> what<00:06:57.270> it<00:06:57.390> is<00:06:57.540> is<00:06:57.780> I'm<00:06:58.650> using

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
progression and what it is is I'm using

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.170 
progression and what it is is I'm using
with<00:06:58.950> a<00:06:58.980> lot<00:06:59.100> of<00:06:59.280> distortion<00:06:59.790> doesn't<00:07:00.030> sound

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 
with a lot of distortion doesn't sound

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.150 
with a lot of distortion doesn't sound
very<00:07:00.240> country<00:07:00.720> it<00:07:00.780> almost<00:07:01.200> sounds<00:07:01.650> more<00:07:01.920> like

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 
very country it almost sounds more like

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.880 
very country it almost sounds more like
Randy<00:07:02.970> Rhoads<00:07:03.240> and<00:07:03.780> goes<00:07:03.990> chicken<00:07:04.500> picking<00:07:04.770> or

Randy Rhoads and goes chicken picking or
something<00:07:05.270> and<00:07:06.270> that<00:07:06.540> actually<00:07:06.960> that<00:07:07.080> solo

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:07.410 
something and that actually that solo

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.100 
something and that actually that solo
might<00:07:07.740> end<00:07:08.010> up<00:07:08.160> being<00:07:08.370> an<00:07:09.150> object<00:07:09.690> lesson<00:07:09.900> for

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.110 
might end up being an object lesson for

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.310 
might end up being an object lesson for
us<00:07:10.410> here<00:07:10.710> in<00:07:10.860> the<00:07:10.920> near<00:07:11.580> future<00:07:12.050> because<00:07:13.050> it's

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320 
us here in the near future because it's

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.220 
us here in the near future because it's
got<00:07:13.470> some<00:07:13.650> kind<00:07:13.830> of<00:07:13.890> cool<00:07:14.070> things<00:07:14.370> that<00:07:15.230> where
