00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
thing to note and why it is smart for

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.760 
thing to note and why it is smart for
right<00:01:36.600> not<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.170> make<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> flood<00:01:37.740> of

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
right not to just make a flood of

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.859 
right not to just make a flood of
changes<00:01:38.220> all<00:01:38.340> at<00:01:38.369> once<00:01:38.700> there<00:01:39.090> are<00:01:39.299> some<00:01:39.570> tank

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
changes all at once there are some tank

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.960 
changes all at once there are some tank
junglers<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.350> are<00:01:40.470> already<00:01:41.009> good<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.640> very

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
junglers that are already good and very

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.149 
junglers that are already good and very
powerful<00:01:42.270> but<00:01:42.869> are<00:01:42.990> simply<00:01:43.320> not<00:01:43.530> meta<00:01:43.890> or

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
powerful but are simply not meta or

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.069 
powerful but are simply not meta or
they're<00:01:44.640> not<00:01:44.670> popular<00:01:45.240> at<00:01:45.270> all<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.780> have<00:01:46.020> a

they're not popular at all I have a

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.510 
they're not popular at all I have a
feeling<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.439> these<00:01:46.619> changes<00:01:47.040> can<00:01:47.159> run<00:01:47.399> the

feeling that these changes can run the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.920 
feeling that these changes can run the
potential<00:01:47.909> risk<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.270> making<00:01:48.420> some<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.810> these

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
potential risk of making some of these

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.260 
potential risk of making some of these
champions<00:01:49.409> very<00:01:49.950> powerful<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.790> potentially

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
champions very powerful and potentially

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.200 
champions very powerful and potentially
even<00:01:51.810> overpowered<00:01:52.439> but<00:01:52.740> sadly<00:01:53.220> not<00:01:53.700> be<00:01:53.970> able

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
even overpowered but sadly not be able

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.060 
even overpowered but sadly not be able
to<00:01:54.540> save<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.930> weaker<00:01:55.229> champions<00:01:55.740> to

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
to save the weaker champions to

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.490 
to save the weaker champions to
reiterate<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:57.180> already<00:01:57.630> strong<00:01:57.960> tanks<00:01:58.380> will

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
reiterate the already strong tanks will

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.590 
reiterate the already strong tanks will
become<00:01:58.770> better<00:01:59.100> while<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.939> weak<00:02:00.149> ones<00:02:00.390> will

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
become better while the weak ones will

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.810 
become better while the weak ones will
likely<00:02:00.840> continue<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.500> be<00:02:01.649> weak<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.130> also<00:02:02.430> hope

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
likely continue to be weak I also hope

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.819 
likely continue to be weak I also hope
that<00:02:02.850> people<00:02:03.390> understand<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.259> tanks<00:02:04.680> are

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
that people understand that tanks are

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.679 
that people understand that tanks are
trading<00:02:05.159> efficiency<00:02:05.820> for<00:02:05.969> power<00:02:06.180> they<00:02:06.600> are

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
trading efficiency for power they are

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.809 
trading efficiency for power they are
losing<00:02:06.990> cooldown<00:02:07.619> reduction<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.369> tenacity

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
losing cooldown reduction and tenacity

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.300 
losing cooldown reduction and tenacity
in<00:02:09.239> exchange<00:02:10.020> for<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.319> sunfire<00:02:10.770> effect

thankfully<00:02:12.209> there<00:02:12.390> are<00:02:12.420> more<00:02:12.750> strong<00:02:13.200> jungle

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
thankfully there are more strong jungle

hanks<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.370> there<00:02:14.459> are<00:02:14.580> weak<00:02:14.819> ones<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.390> the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
hanks and there are weak ones so the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.270 
hanks and there are weak ones so the
potential<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.110> see<00:02:16.290> resurgence<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:17.040> at<00:02:17.160> least

some<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.700> them<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.090> rather<00:02:18.300> high<00:02:18.630> with<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.200> in

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
some of them is rather high with that in

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.530 
some of them is rather high with that in
mind<00:02:19.349> I<00:02:19.830> do<00:02:19.950> think<00:02:20.580> there<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.910> few<00:02:21.239> diggers

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
mind I do think there is a few diggers

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.030 
mind I do think there is a few diggers
who<00:02:21.720> could<00:02:21.870> potentially<00:02:21.989> become<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.739> menace

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
who could potentially become a menace

who could potentially become a menace
with<00:02:23.310> these<00:02:23.459> jumbo<00:02:23.700> changes<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.330> funny<00:02:24.720> thing

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
with these jumbo changes a funny thing

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.660 
with these jumbo changes a funny thing
about<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.860> few<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.190> them<00:02:26.310> are<00:02:26.489> not

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
about this is that a few of them are not

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.180 
about this is that a few of them are not
necessarily<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.660> most<00:02:27.690> purest<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.500> Tanks<00:02:28.890> but

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
necessarily the most purest of Tanks but

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.890 
necessarily the most purest of Tanks but
they<00:02:29.370> will<00:02:29.550> definitely<00:02:29.849> see<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.420> power<00:02:30.690> shift

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
they will definitely see a power shift

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.650 
they will definitely see a power shift

to<00:07:49.000> the<00:07:49.210> jungle<00:07:49.630> but<00:07:49.900> I<00:07:49.930> do<00:07:50.020> not<00:07:50.260> claim<00:07:50.500> to

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:50.650 
to the jungle but I do not claim to

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.280 
to the jungle but I do not claim to
predict<00:07:51.190> that<00:07:51.250> any<00:07:51.550> of<00:07:51.730> these<00:07:51.850> will<00:07:52.150> become

predict that any of these will become
competitively<00:07:53.290> viable<00:07:53.800> we<00:07:54.100> will<00:07:54.280> not<00:07:54.490> know

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:54.790 
competitively viable we will not know

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.670 
competitively viable we will not know

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:56.680 
whether or not the item will bring 10

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.650 
whether or not the item will bring 10
junglers<00:07:57.130> to<00:07:57.250> the<00:07:57.370> forefront<00:07:57.790> until<00:07:58.540> the

junglers to the forefront until the

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.590 
junglers to the forefront until the
changes<00:07:58.990> are<00:07:59.140> released<00:07:59.530> and<00:07:59.740> we<00:08:00.070> have<00:08:00.160> players

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:00.600 
changes are released and we have players

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.610 
changes are released and we have players

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:02.620 
excruciating Lee testing them out I

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.400 
excruciating Lee testing them out I
could<00:08:03.280> be<00:08:03.520> very<00:08:03.820> wrong<00:08:04.150> or<00:08:04.480> I<00:08:04.540> could<00:08:05.050> be<00:08:05.200> right

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:05.410 
could be very wrong or I could be right

could be very wrong or I could be right
but<00:08:05.950> either<00:08:06.160> way<00:08:06.430> I'm<00:08:06.730> excited<00:08:07.300> at<00:08:07.450> the

but either way I'm excited at the
