00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:10.429
 The deeper is now the most basic 8b tick 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:15.620
 Now is the time to pattern the left hand right hand left foot right foot, albeit something different nerve 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:22.100
 I think you are the dew who is going through a lot of difficulties. 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:27.820
 If you have a lot of difficulties , take a left foot count and go once . 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.820
 If you can afford it later, you can put it in. I'll be right behind you. 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.900
 If you see yourself, you will know that One House Lee has a bass. 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.330
 Then you hit me with your hands . 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:44.890
 Now and then I've a high-end 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.890
 I'm going to go with four straight beats in the Schulter section. 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:01:13.340
 Ah lee 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:01:13.340
 5 4 5 4 5 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:37.470
 Oh deuryeotjiman words, even before the time I now write to the pretzel mixture high and high 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:41.390
 Hi-e-chef bass 2 It 's great to have these things all at the same time 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.390
 For example, hand 2 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.990
 I can make this difference with your child. 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:55.200
 Why are you starting now? 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:02:00.689
 So if you are able to start doing this a little more negative u-22 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.350
 If you listen to Yui once, you'll be able to catch him early in the middle 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.460
 same 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.460
 Let me once again 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:31.510
 Almost anything in all rhythms is really basic 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.520
 What do you say you can not say? 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.780
 That's the rhythm. 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:41.830
 This time I'll look for the second cool c priesthood every fourth bullet. 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.920
 If you make a 1n count, it's a little harder to beat. 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:50.830
 In that case, my Korean is good. 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:55.150
 For example, 2 to 2 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:03:00.760
 2 to 3 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:05.610
 So this is the way I do it every once in a while 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.610
 Hitting the shoes once again I'll try to play 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:43.770
 I have been in aaaaa. 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:44.100
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:09.729
 Now, besides the exhibition I mentioned , 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:15.130
 I think you'll practice a lot when you think about it. 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:18.750
 It is very helpful if you practice while practicing with a little thought 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.750
 I 'll go a little faster. 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:56.699
 4 Then we will see you next time.
