00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:04.719
 ah 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.750
 Y 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.940
 Y 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:37.739
 hello beautiful how are you today 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.940
 I'm going to show you how I make myself 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.449
 wash routine the first thing I do is 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:48.750
 putting the oil on me all 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:51.780
 hair and this usually I do in the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.440
 nights or before going to exercise as 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.469
 Now that I go to a bar 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.769
 then nothing else I wash my hair clear 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:07.979
 is today I am using the car of the 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:12.780
 monkey and you that I like very much always 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:15.450
 try to wash your hair just by giving yourself a 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.259
 skull massage never but never 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:23.310
 going up is so because this 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:29.700
 can give or cause them to have many 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:33.179
 entangled if you opted for a pp of 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.770
 oils in all the hair most likely 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:41.030
 that one or two are going to do you 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.600
 enough foam so you'll have to 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.390
 resort to a third shampoo like in my 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.580
 case 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.290
 and nothing that left him with a ditty 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.950
 that I 'm going to sing to you in the bathroom, not 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.009
 that will not happen for god 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:06.899
 and I put it in mine because I want them 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.899
 too much to keep him in that torture 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.120
 hi daily podium and now I'm using 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:21.500
 the trader joe's of tweet I have a goal 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:25.670
 as it is conditional that I owe them the 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.280
 review this and nothing good I'm going to 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.540
 untangle the rest of a massage 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:37.460
 how rich fascinates me I will use my 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.620
 wide-tooth comb you if you want what 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.100
 you can do with your hands but I do not 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.550
 I'm in that what I'm going to 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.550
 use 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.340
 and the 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.970
 tangled is a crucial part of the wash 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.460
 usually if you made a dog with 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.670
 some the main qualities of this 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:03.570
 It is that it helps you to deliver given 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.370
 be more easier or more bearable 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:11.069
 You always start by your tiptoes by 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:15.269
 please be a little delicate and 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:17.189
 from the bottom up is very, very, very 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.609
 good recommendation that you divide the 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:23.579
 hair in two in three or four according to you 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:26.340
 you think it's your convenience or fall and 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:30.569
 stop singing then tell them from 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.859
 tip up delicately with 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.859
 the strength that they have to give 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.720
 I'm sure it was less than 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.830
 values ​​that your mother gave you when 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.560
 I was doing on February 3 and 4 chignon true only 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.090
 we have come far thank God and 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.980
 all these products 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:54.180
 then then you take them off or I 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:57.000
 I remove and then I think it's cold 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.750
 check that there is no mess if there 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:06.209
 to a cousin like an old rag 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:10.049
 no and now I'm going to apply my mask 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.500
 deep I do this once to the 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.319
 week 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.049
 usually me 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:20.729
 not like I count on that all the the 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:23.789
 week I applied it well because with everything 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.620

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.630
 little bit up and all the hair has to 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.509
 be saturated including your little tips 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.190
 beautiful of love today I tiptoe pretty the 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:34.259
 I want if the pro did not come out 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.349
 worry that's normal and I had a 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:40.440
 week that I did not comb my hair then 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:43.440
 I was there then I got the tubes 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.199
 style sometimes yes I do not get 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.880
 a plastic or a hat or conditional 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:53.070
