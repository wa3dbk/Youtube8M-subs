00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.460
 would like to see and I would like to 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.540
 Let's start with the public 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.630
 Building the enemy with the public 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.250
 so between the view of so much 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.590
 get exercise exercises from ss game 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.950
 today it would now has aroused while 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.239
 it just another just the rest 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.070
 that's the the victim's number 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.539
 Camouflage for those who want to know if 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.379
 I still looked 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.180
 I did not get that one when you did 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.680
 with his clear energold the vision 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:04.470
 is and has won a small war there 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:06.720
 down really out there own 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.640
 top of the roof here on the map is 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.159
 very important it is always 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.939
 actually best on such a high 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.450
 position as possible because one 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.810
 tied a good overview of the map 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.810
 yes, too 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:31.560
 thank you thank you thank you to wait until their 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.620
 health is regenerated we look 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.620
 take a shot at us is one 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:47.300
 earthquake told me it is 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:55.080
 I hear something down there 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.900
 but of course not caught gaming 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.240
 not quite there is morning so 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:05.180
 we have 70 currently then we here 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:14.700
 Pure are also like quite some times 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:17.160
 here and there, I almost 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.360
 I have to narrow a weapon with if 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.930
 here the ammunition empty sometime 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.930
 should go 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.760
 because my team has I also always 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:34.200
 the ass was rescued shortly off you go 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:36.380
 Again, the topic is just a long time 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.720
 down there is already ten cameras 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:47.910
 can we go further here? 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:50.900
 what five times panzer break take 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.590
 should be considered ammunition 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.160
 who might not be a bad one 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.150
 to shoot through the walls 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.850
 Let's have our teammates 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.750
 just lie around and go here 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:08.430
 I will not go that way again 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.610
 right through the conclusion series very much 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.610
 beautiful 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:20.290
 Let's see below we have to wait 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.910
 to do with him for my back 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:28.500
 now time is on the roof 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.500
 We always have one , too 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.550
 Quickly over here into the house 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.550
 to have 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:47.740
 he gets europe now he is yes 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.580
 just curious 12 1 there we have 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.520
 Again he was lucky that he was one 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:56.050
 has missed 12 wise theirs 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.960
 ideas almost the specialist technical 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:04.870
 Specialists get bonus at 13 kills 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:11.280
 I get the bit of luck on top of the 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.280
 roof at the ladder the way here 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:34.610
 I do not fit backwards for a long time 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.610
 do not know where to come from everywhere 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.140
 come 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:03.300
 I can already hear something like what 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:06.870
 do not shit there was no 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.220
 Damn there you would have me 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.540
 should instead prefer to go away then 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.890
 turn around and then try him too 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.240
 because he had me before 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.220
 he has seen basically the time 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.030
 had to aim 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.160
 while I had to turn around 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.650
 still had to look against one and 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.160
 so on and so forth 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:26.010
 hohoho no chance now 20 2 currently 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:33.860
 throughout the team deathmatch that is whole 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:33.860
 okay, I heard that, too 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:44.490
 where do we have the next opponents 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:47.100
 i believe in the minimap bmi all 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.470
 muffler almost all there 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.790
 above 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:55.770
 as one of us probably perished 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:06:04.390
 risked from there he is down 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:11.500
 and hopp and are seeing some again 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:18.100
 but very full down from hello and 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:22.750
 Next victory behind we have one 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:24.550
 Behind an ambulance, it goes to the 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.520
 opponents to oracle now can namely 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.570
 see very briefly 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:33.190
 Unfortunately, I have nothing against it 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:34.420
 I've packed in the now 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.880
 Last time I have to be so common 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.200
 So I did not pack that 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.670
 although I believe something as a specialist 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.920
 have tackled that one oracle me 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:44.140
 can not see because if I have already 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.930
 specialist then there it is not 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.790
 more far to the camp and maybe 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.460
 also create some kind of live cam 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:54.000
 would not be bad either 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:07:02.560
 I was once what the opponents approach 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:05.110
 I will not go first then if we what we 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.920
 the movement was the fault and we 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.670
 lie back 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:12.600
 my god people i have a complete 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.600
 Team carry quasi 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.970
 I have to go mixing offensive now 

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.750
 I have to move fast now 

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.060
 quickly make the kills 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.600
 i know the topic on kde main thing 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.600
 finally won 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.720
 then rather from the coat shot the thing 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:32.550
 through and we lost 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:37.970
 I think that is 20 2 on the 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.970
 220 4 and my team 

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:43.320
 I am disappointed with my team 

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.760
 and yes I hope I hope so of course 

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.290
 Nevertheless, you see, I am 

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.020
 completely confused by the power of my 

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:50.820
 teams it is unacceptable 

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.620
 so if you have just told him 

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.700
 damn you, please straighten yourself 

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.620
 in the future 

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.330
 and what about me then I hope so 

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.890
 Let's see you next time 

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.170
 in another live.com terry and 

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.520
 other video and we hit me one 

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.950
 with which I should gamble weapon before 

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:09.740
 what I build from it the man himself 

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:09.740
 after and until then
