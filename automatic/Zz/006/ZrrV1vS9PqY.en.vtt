00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.809
 but when the time of departure is to say that everything is complicated 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:22.009
 must know how to slice the caravan but that's automatic 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.099
 it is possible that he works but it is the worst of the moments of the 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.329
 weekend it had allowed him to remember to know more 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.329
