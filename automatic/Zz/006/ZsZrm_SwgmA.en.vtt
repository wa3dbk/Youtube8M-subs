apply this right before a bed because it

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.720

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.269 
is a little bit thicker than my other
lotions<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.810> say<00:00:31.230> if<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.470> was<00:00:31.619> going<00:00:31.859> out<00:00:32.009> or

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.270 
lotions that I say if I was going out or
something<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.969> would<00:00:33.480> use<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.870> thinner<00:00:34.290> kind<00:00:35.100> of

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280
