and dig in and open the box up I was

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.139 
and dig in and open the box up I was
kind<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.189> debating<00:00:32.610> whether<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.850> was<00:00:32.969> going<00:00:33.059> to

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
kind of debating whether I was going to

get<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.480> 17<00:00:34.050> inch<00:00:34.200> or<00:00:34.320> not<00:00:34.469> now<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.739> screen

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
get the 17 inch or not now the screen

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.000 
get the 17 inch or not now the screen
looks<00:00:35.340> fantastic<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.870> once<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.380> close<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.980> lid

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
looks fantastic but once I close the lid

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.160 
looks fantastic but once I close the lid
it<00:00:38.309> just<00:00:38.460> looked<00:00:38.760> way<00:00:39.030> too<00:00:39.059> big

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
it just looked way too big

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.319 
it just looked way too big
also<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> fact<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.000> I'm<00:00:42.090> going<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.239> be

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
also the fact is that I'm going to be

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.840 
also the fact is that I'm going to be
hooking<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.660> up<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.870> monitor<00:00:43.640> seemed<00:00:44.640> kind

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
hooking it up to a monitor seemed kind

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.819 
hooking it up to a monitor seemed kind
of<00:00:44.940> pointless<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.750> go<00:00:45.899> for<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> huge<00:00:46.469> screen

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
of pointless to go for the huge screen

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.950 
of pointless to go for the huge screen
at<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.789> same<00:00:47.969> time<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.239> like<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> portability

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
at the same time I like the portability

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.540 
at the same time I like the portability
factor<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.559> 15<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.100> kind<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.370> sweet

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
factor of the 15 it's kind of a sweet

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.939 
factor of the 15 it's kind of a sweet
spot<00:00:51.000> Thirteen's<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.050> little<00:00:52.260> too<00:00:52.410> small<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
spot Thirteen's a little too small and a

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.970 
spot Thirteen's a little too small and a
17<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.610> little<00:00:53.910> bit<00:00:54.030> too<00:00:54.180> big<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.570> my<00:00:54.690> eyes

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980

now<00:02:50.210> what's<00:02:50.420> cool<00:02:50.600> with<00:02:50.630> this<00:02:50.960> I<00:02:51.140> was<00:02:51.260> reading

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
now what's cool with this I was reading

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.960 
now what's cool with this I was reading
it<00:02:51.680> actually<00:02:51.950> is<00:02:52.010> going<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.160> do<00:02:52.310> audio<00:02:52.700> and

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
video so if you get an HDMI adduct

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.140 
video so if you get an HDMI adduct
adapter<00:02:55.400> you<00:02:55.520> can<00:02:55.550> hook<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:55.820> up<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:55.940> your<00:02:56.060> TV
