off<00:03:45.930> first<00:03:46.260> impressions<00:03:46.830> I<00:03:47.070> can<00:03:47.730> notice<00:03:47.940> some

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
off first impressions I can notice some

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.550 
off first impressions I can notice some
pixels<00:03:48.540> when<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.720> look<00:03:48.900> up<00:03:49.020> close<00:03:49.260> at<00:03:49.320> the

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
pixels when I look up close at the

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.740 
pixels when I look up close at the
display<00:03:49.980> but<00:03:50.640> you<00:03:50.820> know<00:03:50.940> it's<00:03:51.060> really<00:03:51.270> not<00:03:51.420> too

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
display but you know it's really not too

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.900 
display but you know it's really not too
bad<00:03:51.780> it's<00:03:52.170> definitely<00:03:52.590> manageable<00:03:52.710> if<00:03:53.310> you're

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
bad it's definitely manageable if you're

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.460 
bad it's definitely manageable if you're
a<00:03:53.940> pixel<00:03:54.300> junkie<00:03:54.690> then<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:54.930> might<00:03:55.080> have<00:03:55.260> some

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
a pixel junkie then you might have some

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.930 
a pixel junkie then you might have some
problems<00:03:55.950> but<00:03:56.040> considering<00:03:56.790> the

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
problems but considering the

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.990 
problems but considering the
off-contract<00:03:57.540> price<00:03:57.990> of<00:03:58.370> $200<00:03:59.370> it's<00:03:59.640> quite

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
off-contract price of $200 it's quite

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.090 
off-contract price of $200 it's quite
good<00:04:00.140> so<00:04:01.140> when<00:04:01.320> I<00:04:01.350> have<00:04:01.500> more<00:04:01.680> time<00:04:01.860> with<00:04:02.010> this

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
good so when I have more time with this

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.710
