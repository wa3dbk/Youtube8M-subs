i use for wasp but this time i'm turning
them<00:00:24.029> vertical<00:00:24.689> instead<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.019> horizontal

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
them vertical instead of horizontal

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.179 
them vertical instead of horizontal
ought<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.029> get<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.449> different<00:00:27.750> view<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.289> a

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
ought to get just a different view and a

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.080 
ought to get just a different view and a
different<00:00:29.900> outcome<00:00:31.369> so<00:00:32.369> i<00:00:32.399> found<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.880> picture

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
different outcome so i found a picture

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.830 
different outcome so i found a picture
of<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.540> online<00:00:35.270> instead<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.510> chrome

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
of this online instead of the chrome

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.510 
of this online instead of the chrome
they<00:00:37.050> use<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.320> light<00:00:37.530> blue<00:00:37.800> by<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.160> have<00:00:38.489> a

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
they use the light blue by to have a

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.100 
they use the light blue by to have a
light<00:00:38.730> blue<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.149> i<00:00:39.210> modified<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.719> some

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
light blue so i modified it some

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.959 
light blue so i modified it some
modified<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.129> paint<00:00:41.309> job<00:00:41.460> up<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> little<00:00:41.850> bit

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
modified the paint job up a little bit

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.760 
modified the paint job up a little bit
if<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> light<00:00:43.350> blue<00:00:43.530> i<00:00:43.559> would

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
if you have a light blue i would

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.389 
if you have a light blue i would
recommend<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:45.890> because<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.100> turns<00:00:47.280> out

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
recommend that because it turns out

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.430 
recommend that because it turns out
pretty<00:00:47.579> well<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.660> paint<00:00:48.960> job<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.289> do

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
pretty well but in this paint job you do

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.470 
pretty well but in this paint job you do
a<00:00:49.469> lot<00:00:49.739> more<00:00:49.770> covering<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.940> base<00:00:51.149> coat

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
a lot more covering of the base coat

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.660 
a lot more covering of the base coat
then<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.110> do<00:00:52.289> overlapping<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.449> others<00:00:55.670> so

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
then you do overlapping of others so

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.729 
then you do overlapping of others so
what<00:00:57.660> you're<00:00:57.780> going<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.960> do<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.260> once<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.559> cut

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
what you're going to do is once you cut

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.260 
what you're going to do is once you cut
out<00:00:58.770> your<00:00:58.859> stencils<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.489> got<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.730> do<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> white

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.200 
out your stencils you got to do a white
first<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.960> then<00:01:01.559> gray<00:01:02.190> or<00:01:02.399> chrome<00:01:02.730> or<00:01:03.000> light

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210

eagle<00:01:05.970> eyes<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.299> darkest<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:08.280> kind

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
eagle eyes to darkest and you just kind

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.280 
eagle eyes to darkest and you just kind
of<00:01:08.460> want<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.640> cover<00:01:08.850> up<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.780> main<00:01:09.930> parts<00:01:10.200> of

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
you don't have to do a lot so I did a

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.480

dark<00:01:23.189> blue<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.880> base<00:01:24.090> coat<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:25.380> then<00:01:26.280> let

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
dark blue for the base coat and then let

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.980 
dark blue for the base coat and then let
that<00:01:26.640> dry<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:26.850> about<00:01:27.090> 20<00:01:27.479> minutes<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.869> then

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
that dry for about 20 minutes and then

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.580 
that dry for about 20 minutes and then
came<00:01:28.200> back<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.470> did<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.540> white<00:01:30.540> let<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.409> dry

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
came back and did a white let that dry

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.380 
came back and did a white let that dry
for<00:01:31.619> about<00:01:31.979> 10<00:01:32.400> minutes<00:01:32.640> since<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.150> not<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
for about 10 minutes since it's not the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.789 
for about 10 minutes since it's not the
whole<00:01:33.540> coast<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:33.990> some<00:01:34.170> areas<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:36.799> just

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
whole coast just some areas and just

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.609 
whole coast just some areas and just
kind<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.009> went<00:01:38.159> from<00:01:38.220> there<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:40.229> pain<00:01:40.470> I

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
kind of went from there so the pain I

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.090 
kind of went from there so the pain I
use<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.570> Rustoleum<00:01:42.570> extra<00:01:43.200> cover<00:01:43.439> semi-gloss

black<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.840> use<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.110> same<00:01:46.380> for<00:01:46.979> all<00:01:47.100> that

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
black and I use the same for all that

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.840 
black and I use the same for all that
for<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.820> why<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.630> use<00:01:48.780> normal<00:01:49.110> primer

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
for the why I just use normal primer

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.550 
for the why I just use normal primer
because<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.030> all<00:01:51.149> works<00:01:51.329> out<00:01:51.479> pretty<00:01:51.630> well<00:01:51.750> so
