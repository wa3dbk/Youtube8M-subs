I went for the call mind then he goes
into<00:02:42.520> a<00:02:42.610> Flygon<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.360> have<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.690> switch<00:02:43.960> even

gengar<00:02:55.450> again<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.110> I<00:02:56.590> know<00:02:56.650> he<00:02:56.860> can't

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
gengar again and I know he can't

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.440 
gengar again and I know he can't
probably<00:02:57.700> because<00:02:57.850> i<00:02:57.910> don't<00:02:58.060> have<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.240> npower

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
probably because i don't have the npower

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.360 
probably because i don't have the npower
fire<00:02:58.750> not<00:02:59.050> I<00:02:59.080> so<00:02:59.440> I<00:02:59.470> know<00:02:59.680> he<00:02:59.800> can't<00:03:00.010> kill<00:03:00.220> my

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
fire not I so I know he can't kill my

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.700 
fire not I so I know he can't kill my
salamence<00:03:00.970> with<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:01.240> gengar<00:03:01.690> but<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.530> best

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
salamence with this gengar but the best

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.140 
salamence with this gengar but the best
he<00:03:02.830> can<00:03:02.950> do<00:03:03.070> is<00:03:03.100> really<00:03:03.340> just<00:03:03.490> Shadow<00:03:03.730> Ball<00:03:03.970> and

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
he can do is really just Shadow Ball and

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.240 
he can do is really just Shadow Ball and
do<00:03:04.270> damage<00:03:04.480> so<00:03:05.410> I<00:03:05.440> just<00:03:05.710> decided<00:03:05.830> to<00:03:06.130> finish

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
do damage so I just decided to finish

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.370 
do damage so I just decided to finish
off<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:06.730> gengar<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:07.420> that's<00:03:07.570> what<00:03:07.660> I<00:03:07.720> do<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.260> I

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
off the gengar so that's what I do and I

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.690 
off the gengar so that's what I do and I
just<00:03:08.530> fire<00:03:08.740> blasts<00:03:09.070> that's<00:03:09.370> going<00:03:09.520> to<00:03:09.580> finish

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
just fire blasts that's going to finish

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.730 
just fire blasts that's going to finish
off<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.120> gengar<00:03:10.540> so<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.230> goes<00:03:11.350> out<00:03:11.500> injustice

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
off the gengar so it goes out injustice

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.200 
off the gengar so it goes out injustice
or<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.220> I<00:03:12.250> was<00:03:12.340> going<00:03:12.490> to<00:03:12.550> fire<00:03:12.700> boss<00:03:12.910> again

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
or and I was going to fire boss again

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.610 
or and I was going to fire boss again
even<00:03:13.570> though<00:03:13.630> he's<00:03:13.780> kind<00:03:14.020> of<00:03:14.080> KO<00:03:14.320> me<00:03:14.500> with

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
even though he's kind of KO me with

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.930 
even though he's kind of KO me with
bullet<00:03:14.860> punch<00:03:15.040> I<00:03:15.400> really<00:03:15.760> don't<00:03:15.910> have

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.410 
anything to take two bullet punches
really<00:03:18.100> make<00:03:18.670> could've<00:03:18.850> went<00:03:18.970> out<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.210> Reich

really make could've went out and Reich
who<00:03:19.600> I<00:03:19.690> suppose<00:03:20.020> but<00:03:20.380> I<00:03:20.620> don't<00:03:21.460> want<00:03:21.610> him<00:03:21.700> to

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
who I suppose but I don't want him to

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.090 
who I suppose but I don't want him to
take<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.180> choice<00:03:23.110> banded<00:03:23.260> bullet<00:03:23.620> punch<00:03:23.740> twice

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
take a choice banded bullet punch twice

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.430 
take a choice banded bullet punch twice
um<00:03:24.450> but<00:03:25.450> yeah<00:03:25.600> I<00:03:25.630> just<00:03:25.840> can't<00:03:26.020> go<00:03:26.170> down<00:03:26.320> to

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
um but yeah I just can't go down to

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.920 
um but yeah I just can't go down to
register<00:03:26.860> which<00:03:27.010> really<00:03:27.220> sucks<00:03:27.870> if<00:03:28.870> I

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
register which really sucks if I

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.480 
register which really sucks if I
actually<00:03:29.170> went<00:03:29.350> for<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.560> sub<00:03:29.800> this<00:03:29.980> time<00:03:30.190> and

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
actually went for the sub this time and

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.430 
actually went for the sub this time and
yeah<00:03:31.330> I'm<00:03:31.420> just<00:03:31.540> gonna<00:03:31.660> go<00:03:31.720> for<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:31.990> call<00:03:32.200> mind

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
yeah I'm just gonna go for the call mind

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.860 
yeah I'm just gonna go for the call mind
hopefully<00:03:33.310> this<00:03:33.550> isn't<00:03:33.760> like<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.090> special

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
hopefully this isn't like a special

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.050 
hopefully this isn't like a special
defense<00:03:35.280> registeel<00:03:36.280> because<00:03:36.730> sometimes

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
defense registeel because sometimes

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.150 
defense registeel because sometimes
their<00:03:37.270> EV<00:03:37.780> trained<00:03:38.050> boars<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.620> special

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
their EV trained boars and special

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.350 
their EV trained boars and special
sometimes<00:03:39.520> they're<00:03:39.670> EV<00:03:39.850> trained<00:03:40.120> more<00:03:40.270> in

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
sometimes they're EV trained more in

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.330 
sometimes they're EV trained more in
defense<00:03:40.480> you<00:03:40.959> know<00:03:40.990> because<00:03:41.920> they<00:03:42.100> can<00:03:42.310> be

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
defense you know because they can be

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.949 
defense you know because they can be
kind<00:03:42.760> of<00:03:42.790> like<00:03:42.910> a<00:03:42.970> mixed<00:03:43.300> walls<00:03:43.540> basically

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
kind of like a mixed walls basically

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.100 
kind of like a mixed walls basically
what<00:03:44.050> they<00:03:44.200> are<00:03:44.380> they<00:03:44.860> have<00:03:45.310> 150<00:03:46.270> base<00:03:46.600> defense

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
what they are they have 150 base defense

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.110 
what they are they have 150 base defense
and<00:03:47.350> special<00:03:47.560> defense<00:03:47.980> I<00:03:48.250> was<00:03:48.850> going<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.060> go

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
and special defense I was going to go

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.380 
and special defense I was going to go
for<00:03:49.240> Thunderbolt<00:03:49.660> sandwich<00:03:50.020> does<00:03:51.270> helping<00:03:52.270> me

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
for Thunderbolt sandwich does helping me

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.360 
for Thunderbolt sandwich does helping me
I<00:03:52.420> can<00:03:52.510> get<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.780> 38<00:03:53.140> KO<00:03:53.380> out<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:53.800> it<00:03:53.920> but<00:03:54.130> it

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
I can get a 38 KO out of it but it

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.620 
I can get a 38 KO out of it but it
actually<00:03:54.490> doesn't<00:03:54.820> look<00:03:54.940> like<00:03:55.209> it<00:03:55.390> which

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
actually doesn't look like it which

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.080 
actually doesn't look like it which
really<00:03:55.870> sucks<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:56.680> seismic<00:03:57.459> toss<00:03:57.640> is<00:03:57.880> going

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
really sucks and seismic toss is going

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.730 
really sucks and seismic toss is going
to<00:03:58.150> be<00:03:58.270> doing<00:03:58.480> more<00:03:58.750> damage<00:03:58.990> than<00:03:59.320> my<00:03:59.470> Thunder
