00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.510
 deutz engines one right one left with 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:48.870
 two eight-cylinder engines each 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:53.440
 a total of 1360 ps has about 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.410
 Tank capacity of 750 to 800 liters in the 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.050
 hour you can say and the full load 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.940
 go so 120 again go against it 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.270
 go through the engine 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.119
 the asc 16 13 60 will be in frankfurt 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.070
 mainly for the giant birds airbus 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.460
 a380 and the boeing 747 uses but 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.680
 even for the smaller models like these 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.390
 push the a340 push back 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.610
 vehicle tugs the fliers out of their 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.250
 Parking and drag her to her 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.680
 place of destination always at transactions on 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.290
 plane with the operator too 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.670
 walker called the mountain car is in the 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.240
 principle here the extension of 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.920
 pilots 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.150
 he is over a headset with poland 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.520
 connected and killed by the 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.229
 instruction what to do 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.880
 both the operator and the driver 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.100
 make sure before the tow 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.650
 process that the plane is in order 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.229
 with the help of cameras the driver knows 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.700
 we have to go to the front wheels with it 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.909
 he is not too fast doing it 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.380
 Two photocells control electronics 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.990
 once the correct position is reached 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.610
 is shooting 1500 liters per minute 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.100
 Hydraulic oil through the hoses and 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.320
 lines two brackets take that 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.810
 Bugrad suspension in the lack and lift 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.479
 is up to 50 centimeters 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.490
 the push back can start there is still 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.360
 another variant to a plane 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.149
 position 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.380
 namely with a bar tug 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.010
 rod tug is actually back 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.569
 a very different story rolling 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:20.239
 Other things must be considered in the end 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.430
 we want to drive a little harder 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.349
 always really resisted on 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.269
 flier has and so it is actually 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.810
 easier because I have the plane 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.220
 what I have in the tractor and he 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.780
 can not get out because I 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.610
 just run on a pole 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.959
 In the end, it can still work 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.989
 what can happen can break and 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:44.269
 everything yes and here in the weather with if 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.709
 or without rod around 500 times a day 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.000
 are the tugs of frankfurter 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.280
 airport in action 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.379
 until a tractor driver all models 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.780
 It takes about three years to drive 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.810
 A truck driver's license is for it 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.000
 the job is the one and only fun 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.730
 High concentration demands on top of that 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.349
 I like it very much is my dream job 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.950
 actually and I am already 13 years 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:10.340
 here altogether since 1990 on the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.579
 airport and since 2001 the 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.349
 tractor driver and yes it is easy 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.049
 always been a dream of mine 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.239
 to handle big machines and it 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.250
 is now the non-plus-ultra too 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.949
 just this tug is natural 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.139
 A dream to drive as easy 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:29.569
 The biggest is there, I think only 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:32.299
 Three pieces around the world from and 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.739
 that's already okay in 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.919
 frankfurt there are the two ps 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.900
 strongest models of the asc 16 13 60 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.730
 moreover, there are meanwhile 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.370
 three more with one thing 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.709
 lower ps number and one million euro 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.549
 was per vehicle in frankfurt 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.549
 invested
