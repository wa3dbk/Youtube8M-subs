00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:11.280
 Hello today in our video tutorial 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:13.799
 will be the topic of how we rearrange the eyes or 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.410
 other parts of the body from one drawing to 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.410
 other use we have Photoshop 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:28.220
 we have two pictures in the first picture 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:32.460
 we have a boy with eyes closed probe 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:36.390
 in the second picture we have the wrong one 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.910
 mimic of the birthday boy and so we need 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.899
 rearrange the person's birthday with this 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:52.289
 photos on this for this we highlight 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:53.000
 face we take stock go in lair come out 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.670
 rather 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.120
 copy the memory buffer go abs 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:04.820
 sorry wrong copy the boy's face 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.950
 copy from here 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.290
 go to our image on 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.860
 correct why we chose it because 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.400
 that we have less work here we have 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.740
 boy with open eyes and no umbrella 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.070
 we only need to rearrange the face 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.970
 birthday boy copied now paste 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.970
 his edit 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:40.130
 ps ps 3 post I do not know how to insert 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:40.130
 we can close the second picture 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.240
 we bring the counter plus control minus 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:51.630
 now we need to put 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.750
 boys one to one as it should be for 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.049
 this we do transparency lyra 50 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:03.140
 percent before he surely must be 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:06.899
 active this live set at 50 percent and 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.860
 apply inversion image a-jays departure 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.150
 mins 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.190
 and here we are looking for invert invert 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.340
 buttons this control and oh 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.850
 control and in English further we need 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.690
 put the point the very first it will be 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.690
 ear 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:32.760
 we expose the ear now we need a trance 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:36.320
 go into trans mode for transformers 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:41.310
 this we we we we press edit 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:46.770
 free transform or control the english 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.420
 All abbreviations will be in English and. 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.910
 right here you can see the center 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.060
 of our facility 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:57.540
 center around which everything rotates 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.790
 under the ground we put it here 2 here 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.620
 because because 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:08.010
 because this is our most accurate 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:10.370
 getting further we already just rotate on 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.410
 our view as possible and 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.930
 then with the buttons 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.810
 right left we dub enter enter 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:23.239
 changes now do the opposite 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:27.830
 reverse image image adjustments 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:30.530
 invert and do one hundred percent barks 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.239
 one hundred percent visibility 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.660
 turn on-off to see how 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:40.489
 we all got all cool now we 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.250
 we see that we have a different illumination 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:47.959
 was in two shots 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.959
 for this we are to align 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:58.040
 align color we go image 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:04:04.410
 adjustments curis control and 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:07.620
 take the center point and start here 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.940
 such movements watch what and how us 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.560
 This area of neck is interested in 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.630
 here we have the edge and we will be very 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.169
 clearly visible because it is important to us 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.019
 skin that is not so much even any fans 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:25.970
 how much skin is skin color 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:30.370
 was monotonous increase normally 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.909
 preview turn on and off look 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.840
 ok ok 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:39.669
 apply now we leveled 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.139
 tonality lighting 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.000
 now we need to remove all unnecessary for 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.370
 this we will use bunk masks 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.319
 mask she is in likes here 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:53.680
 Now he is not for the right, we have applied the mask 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:57.740
 here we see now we select the mode 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:02.289
 non instrument mode b in english 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:05.150
 just b brush tool 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:09.520
 check to here was one hundred percent 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.520
 here is one hundred percent and we start 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.750
 sure we need here 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.129
 check that the colors are black and 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:21.650
 white for this we just need to click 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:24.860
 I do not remember where well in general here it is necessary 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:30.949
 choose black here you need to choose white 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:33.050
 We start to wash if you do not erase 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:37.099
 you need to click this button to change 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.740
 colors in places to see what 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:43.479
 we erase and do we master them correctly 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:46.219
 turn off the bottom background bottom layer 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.080
 disconnected and now you see what I 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:51.469
 you said the opposite, that is, we need 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.990
 change and firing sudachek all we have 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:06:02.150
 erased what we need we boldly 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:06.020
 can erase the edges down to we need 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:12.800
 leave only we do not need ears 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:15.380
 we only need eyes and mouth for example 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.110
 if you're inadvertently piri-piri 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:22.000
 erased for this we turn again into 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:27.680
 mode here or x English push 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.610
 dark we can recover after all this 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:37.280
 plus and maski maski shou 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:47.659
 and so erase all leave only mouth 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:50.300
 eyes include the lower layer and including 

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:55.270
 including lair we see what we have 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:07:00.219
 I would change a little bit 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.219
 down here and down a little bit 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:13.909
 almost almost perfect everything 

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:22.060
 Shift in two layers 

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:31.569
 control e or or or whether you dream 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:36.219
