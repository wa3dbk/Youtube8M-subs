here is the zebra Zi p450 it's a thermal
printer<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:08.330> you<00:00:09.330> can<00:00:09.450> see<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:09.660> have<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:09.929> massive

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
printer and you can see I have a massive

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.830 
printer and you can see I have a massive
roll<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.160> labels<00:00:11.429> here<00:00:11.880> that's<00:00:12.120> way<00:00:12.480> too<00:00:12.509> big

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
roll of labels here that's way too big

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.740 
roll of labels here that's way too big
for<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.139> printer<00:00:13.700> this<00:00:14.700> one<00:00:14.880> takes<00:00:15.089> smaller

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
for the printer this one takes smaller

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.029 
for the printer this one takes smaller
roles<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.379> roll<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.859> labels<00:00:17.029> or<00:00:18.029> like<00:00:18.600> this

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
roles of a roll of labels or like this

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.090 
roles of a roll of labels or like this
you<00:00:20.039> can<00:00:20.250> get<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.609> fan<00:00:21.060> fold<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.949> feed<00:00:22.949> it

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
you can get the fan fold and feed it

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.529 
you can get the fan fold and feed it
from<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.400> back<00:00:23.580> there's<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.910> little<00:00:23.939> slot<00:00:24.300> back

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
from the back there's a little slot back

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.470 
from the back there's a little slot back
here<00:00:24.810> feed<00:00:25.199> straight<00:00:25.529> through<00:00:25.910> fan<00:00:26.910> fold<00:00:27.240> is

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
here feed straight through fan fold is

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.460 
here feed straight through fan fold is
where<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:28.380> labels<00:00:28.650> are<00:00:29.779> stacked<00:00:30.779> back<00:00:31.260> and

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
where the labels are stacked back and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.030 
where the labels are stacked back and
forth<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.369> fan<00:00:32.640> they're<00:00:32.880> not<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.300> core<00:00:34.140> at

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
forth and a fan they're not on a core at

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.900 
forth and a fan they're not on a core at
all<00:00:35.870> anyway<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.200> super<00:00:38.010> simple<00:00:38.309> printer

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
all anyway it's a super simple printer

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.540 
all anyway it's a super simple printer
works<00:00:39.660> really<00:00:40.020> well<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.850> it<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:43.280> has<00:00:44.280> one

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
works really well and it just has one

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.700 
works really well and it just has one
button<00:00:44.789> there<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.090> feed<00:00:45.539> through<00:00:45.780> these<00:00:46.050> open

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
button there to feed through these open

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.889 
button there to feed through these open
it<00:00:46.800> up<00:00:46.980> anyway<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:47.969> got<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> label<00:00:48.450> ready<00:00:48.780> to

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
it up anyway I got a label ready to

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.420 
it up anyway I got a label ready to
print<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.289> can<00:00:49.350> see<00:00:49.500> how<00:00:49.649> fast<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.160> thing

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
print you can see how fast this thing

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.970 
print you can see how fast this thing
works<00:00:50.989> there<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.140> go<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:54.770> send<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
works there we go and send to the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.500 
works there we go and send to the
printer<00:00:58.039> and<00:00:59.039> it's<00:00:59.280> thinking<00:00:59.760> about<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.270> and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
printer and it's thinking about it and

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
how you can feed them through 2 ways of

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.510 
how you can feed them through 2 ways of
doing<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.990> doesn't<00:01:58.320> show<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.649> fan<00:01:58.979> fold<00:01:59.250> their

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
doing it doesn't show you fan fold their

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.020 
doing it doesn't show you fan fold their
own<00:01:59.729> but<00:02:00.659> does<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.290> works<00:02:01.530> anyway<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:05.030> these

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
own but does it works anyway so these

has these old ports but there's a USB

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.809 
has these old ports but there's a USB
and<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:45.180> power<00:02:45.389> supply<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:46.230> interesting

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
and the power supply it's interesting

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.800

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
let me see I don't know if there's a way

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.699 
let me see I don't know if there's a way
to<00:03:39.989> detach<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.859> bottom<00:03:42.319> so<00:03:43.319> because<00:03:43.560> there's

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
to detach the bottom so because there's

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.140 
to detach the bottom so because there's
some<00:03:43.889> one<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.129> these<00:03:44.280> looks<00:03:44.759> like<00:03:44.909> a<00:03:44.939> little

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
some one of these looks like a little

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.879 
some one of these looks like a little
cleaning<00:03:45.599> card<00:03:45.870> probably<00:03:46.109> slips<00:03:46.590> in<00:03:46.829> there

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
cleaning card probably slips in there

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.460 
cleaning card probably slips in there
these<00:03:49.889> are<00:03:50.099> four<00:03:50.729> by<00:03:50.879> six<00:03:51.269> labels<00:03:52.049> that<00:03:52.199> I<00:03:52.290> was

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
these are four by six labels that I was

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.679 
these are four by six labels that I was
feeding<00:03:52.829> through<00:03:53.150> yeah<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.239> looks<00:03:54.479> like<00:03:54.659> a

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
feeding through yeah it looks like a

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.360 
feeding through yeah it looks like a
separate<00:03:55.199> piece<00:03:55.439> but<00:03:55.769> it<00:03:55.919> doesn't<00:03:56.159> come<00:03:56.280> off

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
separate piece but it doesn't come off

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:07.330 
separate piece but it doesn't come off
oh<00:03:56.639> here's<00:03:56.939> some<00:03:57.560> specs<00:03:58.560> down<00:03:58.859> there

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:17.050 

so<00:04:08.340> it's<00:04:08.519> a<00:04:08.610> two<00:04:08.879> amp<00:04:14.450> plug<00:04:15.450> that<00:04:16.079> you<00:04:16.229> need
