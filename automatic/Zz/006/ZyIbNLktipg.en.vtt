00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
for boys as well and so you start

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.299

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
the whole process and you know I think

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.960 
the whole process and you know I think
the<00:01:08.570> key<00:01:08.750> thing<00:01:08.780> is<00:01:09.020> is<00:01:09.500> to<00:01:09.700> just<00:01:10.700> talk<00:01:10.940> about

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
the key thing is is to just talk about

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.090 
the key thing is is to just talk about
it<00:01:11.480> and<00:01:11.630> prepare<00:01:12.170> them<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:12.680> just<00:01:12.920> start

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
it and prepare them and just start

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.670 
it and prepare them and just start
saying<00:01:13.370> oh<00:01:13.610> and<00:01:14.180> you<00:01:14.420> are<00:01:14.720> big<00:01:15.140> enough<00:01:15.350> you<00:01:15.560> can

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
saying oh and you are big enough you can

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.110 
saying oh and you are big enough you can
have<00:01:15.860> your<00:01:16.040> own<00:01:16.220> underwear<00:01:16.580> in<00:01:16.820> your<00:01:16.970> own

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
have your own underwear in your own

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.840

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
potty and just start talking about four

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.760 
potty and just start talking about four
I<00:01:20.150> guess<00:01:20.570> like<00:01:20.720> two<00:01:20.900> or<00:01:21.050> three<00:01:21.110> weeks<00:01:21.230> before

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
I guess like two or three weeks before

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.430 
I guess like two or three weeks before
you<00:01:21.860> actually<00:01:22.300> start<00:01:23.300> pushing<00:01:23.930> them<00:01:24.080> to<00:01:24.230> sit

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
you actually start pushing them to sit

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.230 
you actually start pushing them to sit
down<00:01:24.470> on<00:01:24.650> it<00:01:24.860> okay<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.550> next<00:01:25.790> step<00:01:25.910> is

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
down on it okay the next step is

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.900 
down on it okay the next step is
throwing<00:01:26.720> out<00:01:26.840> all<00:01:27.020> your<00:01:27.500> diapers<00:01:27.920> I<00:01:28.220> know<00:01:28.610> it

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
throwing out all your diapers I know it

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.000 
throwing out all your diapers I know it
seems<00:01:29.180> so<00:01:29.450> drastic<00:01:30.080> but<00:01:30.260> that's<00:01:30.410> such<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.680> key

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
seems so drastic but that's such a key

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.520 
seems so drastic but that's such a key
aspect<00:01:31.910> of<00:01:32.060> this<00:01:32.210> whole<00:01:32.420> method<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:33.080> so<00:01:33.470> you

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
aspect of this whole method and so you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.050 
aspect of this whole method and so you
take<00:01:33.770> him<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:34.010> the<00:01:34.100> area<00:01:34.310> where<00:01:34.730> you<00:01:34.790> keep<00:01:35.030> your

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
take him to the area where you keep your

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.490 
take him to the area where you keep your
diapers<00:01:35.480> and<00:01:35.630> by<00:01:35.750> now<00:01:35.900> they<00:01:36.080> know<00:01:36.200> where<00:01:36.350> that

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
diapers and by now they know where that

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.800 
diapers and by now they know where that
