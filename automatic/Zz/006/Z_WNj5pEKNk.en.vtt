00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
to say that this figure does have one

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.010 
to say that this figure does have one
thing<00:05:05.330> that<00:05:05.540> I<00:05:05.570> don't<00:05:05.720> like<00:05:06.110> about<00:05:06.260> it<00:05:06.790> um<00:05:08.020> I'm

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
thing that I don't like about it um I'm

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.480 
thing that I don't like about it um I'm
not<00:05:09.230> sure<00:05:09.290> if<00:05:09.620> it's<00:05:09.680> just<00:05:09.980> the<00:05:10.040> figure<00:05:10.310> that<00:05:10.430> I

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
not sure if it's just the figure that I

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.180 
not sure if it's just the figure that I
got<00:05:10.940> or<00:05:11.450> if<00:05:12.170> they<00:05:12.320> were<00:05:12.380> all<00:05:12.470> made<00:05:12.770> like<00:05:12.980> this

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
got or if they were all made like this

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:21.220 
got or if they were all made like this
but<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:14.840> waist<00:05:15.440> is<00:05:15.890> very<00:05:16.700> loose<00:05:18.430> um<00:05:19.430> and<00:05:20.230> I

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
but the waist is very loose um and I

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.200 
but the waist is very loose um and I
think<00:05:21.470> it's<00:05:21.590> do<00:05:22.220> more<00:05:22.550> in<00:05:22.640> part<00:05:22.910> to<00:05:23.090> this

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
think it's do more in part to this

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.230 
think it's do more in part to this
little<00:05:23.740> Underpants<00:05:24.740> piece<00:05:24.950> here<00:05:25.310> it's<00:05:26.090> a

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
little Underpants piece here it's a

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.700 
little Underpants piece here it's a
really<00:05:26.540> loose<00:05:27.400> um<00:05:29.050> but<00:05:30.050> I<00:05:30.080> think<00:05:30.440> it<00:05:30.560> might

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
really loose um but I think it might

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:31.750 
really loose um but I think it might
just<00:05:30.740> be<00:05:31.010> that<00:05:31.040> this<00:05:31.280> is<00:05:31.460> a<00:05:31.490> little<00:05:31.670> too

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
just be that this is a little too

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:39.550 
just be that this is a little too
stretched<00:05:33.910> but<00:05:34.910> it's<00:05:35.360> really<00:05:35.660> loose<00:05:38.200> now<00:05:39.200> um

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
stretched but it's really loose now um

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.290 
stretched but it's really loose now um
this<00:05:40.370> shares<00:05:40.970> the<00:05:41.240> same<00:05:42.610> body<00:05:43.610> mass<00:05:44.000> pretty

this shares the same body mass pretty

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.560 
this shares the same body mass pretty
much<00:05:44.420> everything<00:05:44.900> with<00:05:45.260> um<00:05:45.590> the<00:05:46.160> regular<00:05:47.030> ODST

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
when I review the army builders um just

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.540 
when I review the army builders um just
like<00:05:56.060> that<00:05:56.540> ODST<00:05:57.080> he<00:05:57.710> comes<00:05:57.980> with<00:05:58.220> a<00:05:59.260> weapon

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
like that ODST he comes with a weapon

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.460 
like that ODST he comes with a weapon
now<00:06:01.550> if<00:06:01.970> you've<00:06:02.210> watched<00:06:02.600> the<00:06:02.870> previous<00:06:03.170> two

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
now if you've watched the previous two

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.350 
now if you've watched the previous two
reviews<00:06:03.980> you'll<00:06:04.760> know<00:06:04.940> that<00:06:04.970> I've<00:06:05.210> been

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
reviews you'll know that I've been

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.600 
reviews you'll know that I've been
complaining<00:06:06.050> that<00:06:06.080> they<00:06:06.740> only<00:06:06.920> have<00:06:07.160> assault

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
complaining that they only have assault

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:14.280 
complaining that they only have assault
rifles<00:06:08.620> so<00:06:10.240> we<00:06:11.240> have<00:06:11.390> a<00:06:11.420> battle<00:06:11.810> rifle<00:06:12.880> but

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
rifles so we have a battle rifle but

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:20.190 
rifles so we have a battle rifle but
it's<00:06:15.290> clear<00:06:15.650> plastic<00:06:16.690> it<00:06:17.690> too<00:06:18.260> is<00:06:18.590> invisible

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
it's clear plastic it too is invisible

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:26.110 
it's clear plastic it too is invisible
which<00:06:21.200> is<00:06:21.500> very<00:06:21.760> disappointing<00:06:24.790> he<00:06:25.790> holds<00:06:26.030> it

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
which is very disappointing he holds it

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.860 
which is very disappointing he holds it
well<00:06:26.240> in<00:06:26.420> his<00:06:26.510> hand<00:06:26.870> but<00:06:27.410> since<00:06:27.830> this<00:06:28.400> has<00:06:28.870> this

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
well in his hand but since this has this

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.350 
well in his hand but since this has this
little<00:06:30.050> piece<00:06:30.350> here<00:06:30.380> it<00:06:30.950> kind<00:06:31.730> of<00:06:31.820> stays<00:06:32.300> on

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
little piece here it kind of stays on

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.800 
little piece here it kind of stays on
the<00:06:32.870> the<00:06:33.380> arm<00:06:33.620> and<00:06:33.980> he<00:06:34.760> isn't<00:06:34.910> able<00:06:35.240> to<00:06:35.420> hold<00:06:35.630> it

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
the the arm and he isn't able to hold it

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:42.280 
the the arm and he isn't able to hold it
fully<00:06:36.260> in<00:06:36.590> his<00:06:36.710> hand<00:06:39.850> now<00:06:40.850> this<00:06:41.360> figure<00:06:41.720> mainly

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.290 
fully in his hand now this figure mainly

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.170 
fully in his hand now this figure mainly
gets<00:06:42.590> me<00:06:42.740> excited<00:06:42.830> about<00:06:43.580> the<00:06:43.760> idea<00:06:43.910> of

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
gets me excited about the idea of

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.180 
gets me excited about the idea of
figures<00:06:45.020> from<00:06:45.380> the<00:06:45.890> game<00:06:46.850> ODST<00:06:47.830> while<00:06:48.830> I

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
figures from the game ODST while I

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.760 
figures from the game ODST while I
really<00:06:49.700> hated<00:06:50.060> the<00:06:50.300> game<00:06:50.600> I<00:06:50.930> like<00:06:51.620> the

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
really hated the game I like the

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.800 
really hated the game I like the
characters<00:06:52.370> and<00:06:53.440> I<00:06:54.440> can't<00:06:54.710> wait<00:06:54.860> to<00:06:54.890> see<00:06:55.810> the

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
characters and I can't wait to see the

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.610 
characters and I can't wait to see the
rookie<00:06:57.940> Nathan<00:06:58.940> Fillion<00:06:59.180> character

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620 
rookie Nathan Fillion character

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.370 
rookie Nathan Fillion character
tricia<00:07:01.250> helfer<00:07:01.370> character<00:07:02.300> which<00:07:03.050> I'm<00:07:03.199> sure

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
tricia helfer character which I'm sure

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.350 
tricia helfer character which I'm sure
they<00:07:03.500> could<00:07:03.560> do<00:07:03.800> really<00:07:04.130> really<00:07:04.610> easily<00:07:04.970> in

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 
they could do really really easily in

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.300 
they could do really really easily in
that<00:07:05.570> cost<00:07:06.320> effectively<00:07:06.800> since<00:07:07.100> they

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:07.310 
that cost effectively since they

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.850 
that cost effectively since they
probably<00:07:08.150> still<00:07:08.510> have<00:07:08.660> the<00:07:08.810> same<00:07:09.020> heads<00:07:09.620> from

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:09.860 
probably still have the same heads from

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.520 
probably still have the same heads from
the<00:07:09.979> Battlestar<00:07:10.460> Galactica<00:07:11.030> minimates<00:07:13.510> now

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:14.530 
the Battlestar Galactica minimates now

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.700 
the Battlestar Galactica minimates now
if<00:07:15.530> I<00:07:15.889> had<00:07:16.010> to<00:07:16.160> say<00:07:16.690> which<00:07:17.690> pack<00:07:18.290> would

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.710 
if I had to say which pack would

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.850 
if I had to say which pack would
probably<00:07:19.340> be<00:07:19.520> passed<00:07:19.820> up<00:07:20.090> the<00:07:20.150> most<00:07:20.600> it<00:07:21.169> would

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:21.860 
probably be passed up the most it would

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.950 
probably be passed up the most it would
probably<00:07:22.130> be<00:07:22.490> this<00:07:22.669> one<00:07:22.850> which<00:07:23.630> is<00:07:23.810> a<00:07:23.840> shame

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 
probably be this one which is a shame

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.230 
probably be this one which is a shame
because<00:07:24.199> there's<00:07:24.710> two<00:07:25.130> really<00:07:25.370> great<00:07:25.760> figures

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 
because there's two really great figures

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.370 
because there's two really great figures
in<00:07:26.389> here<00:07:26.680> um<00:07:27.680> I<00:07:28.550> actually<00:07:29.449> might<00:07:29.870> have<00:07:30.169> to

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:30.380 
in here um I actually might have to

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.140 
in here um I actually might have to
recommend<00:07:30.680> this<00:07:31.040> one<00:07:31.100> more<00:07:31.610> than<00:07:31.910> the

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:32.150 
recommend this one more than the

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.969 
recommend this one more than the
sergeant<00:07:32.630> Johnson<00:07:33.080> and<00:07:33.289> cqb<00:07:34.010> um<00:07:35.080> if<00:07:36.080> not<00:07:36.680> just

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:36.979 
sergeant Johnson and cqb um if not just

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:40.990 
sergeant Johnson and cqb um if not just
for<00:07:37.190> the<00:07:37.690> ODST<00:07:38.690> here
