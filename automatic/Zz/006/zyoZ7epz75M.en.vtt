this is the one with the cogs and wheels
looks<00:01:52.150> like<00:01:52.299> it's<00:01:52.450> some<00:01:52.659> sort<00:01:52.810> of<00:01:52.900> mechanism

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020

actually looking to do here now if you
notice<00:02:08.530> on<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:08.860> screen<00:02:09.190> in<00:02:09.340> front<00:02:09.489> of<00:02:09.759> you<00:02:09.819> you

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
notice on the screen in front of you you

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.479 
notice on the screen in front of you you
get<00:02:10.450> two<00:02:10.840> types<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.290> wheels<00:02:11.560> both<00:02:11.950> spinning<00:02:12.400> in

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
get two types of wheels both spinning in

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.690 
get two types of wheels both spinning in
different<00:02:12.880> directions<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:14.410> implies<00:02:15.250> the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
different directions that implies the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.150 
different directions that implies the
two<00:02:15.940> types<00:02:16.300> of<00:02:16.510> cogs<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.080> want<00:02:17.349> and<00:02:17.560> the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
two types of cogs you want and the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.390 
two types of cogs you want and the
spacing<00:02:18.760> between<00:02:18.790> them<00:02:20.040> which<00:02:21.040> will<00:02:21.250> make

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
spacing between them which will make

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.530 
spacing between them which will make
them<00:02:21.730> both<00:02:22.120> go<00:02:22.450> opposite<00:02:22.870> directions<00:02:24.540> also

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
them both go opposite directions also

them both go opposite directions also
you<00:02:25.630> need<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.840> climb<00:02:25.930> up<00:02:26.080> here<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.489> loosen<00:02:27.489> this

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
you need to climb up here to loosen this

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.820 
you need to climb up here to loosen this
cog<00:02:28.330> which<00:02:28.600> is<00:02:28.780> stuck<00:02:29.049> up<00:02:29.200> here<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:29.560> get<00:02:29.739> it

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.600 
the the piece so you want to be looking
for<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:38.200> cogs<00:02:38.500> with<00:02:38.769> the<00:02:38.860> crosses<00:02:39.370> and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
for the the cogs with the crosses and

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.490 
for the the cogs with the crosses and
the<00:02:39.700> circles<00:02:40.269> there's<00:02:40.569> various<00:02:40.930> other<00:02:41.140> sort

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
the circles there's various other sort

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.350 
the circles there's various other sort
of<00:02:41.560> red<00:02:41.890> herring<00:02:42.250> cogs<00:02:42.580> around<00:02:42.940> which<00:02:43.209> you

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
of red herring cogs around which you

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.729 
of red herring cogs around which you
just<00:02:43.540> need<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.810> ignore<00:02:43.930> don't<00:02:44.470> bother<00:02:44.620> with

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
just need to ignore don't bother with

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.400 
just need to ignore don't bother with
them<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.510> then<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.750> want<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.049> put<00:02:47.230> them<00:02:47.319> in

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
them and then you want to put them in

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.789 
them and then you want to put them in
opposites<00:02:48.660> obviously<00:02:49.660> one<00:02:49.989> of<00:02:50.019> them<00:02:50.230> is<00:02:50.290> fixed

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
opposites obviously one of them is fixed

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.479 
opposites obviously one of them is fixed
so<00:02:50.890> that's<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:51.730> end<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.239> start<00:02:52.630> on<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.489> then

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
so that's the end you start on and then

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.300 
so that's the end you start on and then
you<00:02:54.609> just<00:02:54.790> go<00:02:55.239> cross<00:02:55.900> circle<00:02:56.440> cross<00:02:56.739> circle

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
you just go cross circle cross circle

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.319 
you just go cross circle cross circle
cross<00:02:57.609> circle<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.440> then<00:02:59.440> approach<00:03:00.100> this<00:03:01.090> in

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
cross circle and then approach this in

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.160 
cross circle and then approach this in
the<00:03:01.420> middle<00:03:01.540> and

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:12.059 

hopefully<00:03:06.319> voila

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:23.729 

and<00:03:13.069> that's<00:03:13.280> puzzle<00:03:13.970> number<00:03:14.120> two<00:03:15.520> sold

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.170 

the<00:03:24.739> third<00:03:25.010> puzzles<00:03:25.459> quite<00:03:25.700> difficult<00:03:25.940> to

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
the third puzzles quite difficult to

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.869 
the third puzzles quite difficult to
explain<00:03:26.510> without<00:03:26.780> being<00:03:27.170> a<00:03:27.590> complete<00:03:28.069> spoiler

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
explain without being a complete spoiler

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.670 
explain without being a complete spoiler
so<00:03:29.300> I<00:03:29.330> guess<00:03:29.750> you<00:03:29.900> just<00:03:30.110> have<00:03:30.170> to<00:03:30.379> kind<00:03:30.590> of

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
so I guess you just have to kind of

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.320 
so I guess you just have to kind of
imitate<00:03:31.160> where<00:03:31.370> I<00:03:31.400> am<00:03:31.610> I<00:03:31.790> mean<00:03:31.940> I'm<00:03:32.060> giving

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
imitate where I am I mean I'm giving

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.970 
imitate where I am I mean I'm giving
away<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.599> position<00:03:33.050> here<00:03:33.349> what<00:03:33.860> you're

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
away the position here what you're

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.589 
away the position here what you're
essentially<00:03:34.280> have<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.519> do<00:03:34.610> is<00:03:34.730> use<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.060> light

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
essentially have to do is use the light

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.320 
essentially have to do is use the light
to<00:03:36.410> cast<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.980> right<00:03:37.160> shadow<00:03:37.549> using<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.150> body

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
to cast the right shadow using the body

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.559 
to cast the right shadow using the body
parts<00:03:38.720> in<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.019> room<00:03:40.180> so<00:03:41.180> you<00:03:41.239> need<00:03:41.450> to

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
parts in the room so you need to

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.660 
parts in the room so you need to
replicate<00:03:42.019> that<00:03:42.290> image<00:03:42.739> from<00:03:42.890> your<00:03:42.950> book<00:03:43.340> and

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
replicate that image from your book and

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.309 
replicate that image from your book and
as<00:03:44.060> you<00:03:44.180> see<00:03:44.360> here<00:03:44.569> it's<00:03:44.690> on<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.930> right<00:03:45.140> hand

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
as you see here it's on the right hand

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.979 
as you see here it's on the right hand
side<00:03:45.440> of<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.950> room<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:46.430> then<00:03:47.269> it's<00:03:47.510> kind<00:03:47.930> of

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
side of the room and then it's kind of

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.050 
side of the room and then it's kind of
lining<00:03:48.230> them<00:03:48.470> up<00:03:48.560> right<00:03:48.769> I<00:03:48.830> have<00:03:49.040> effects<00:03:49.849> I

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
lining them up right I have effects I

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.850 
lining them up right I have effects I
haven't<00:03:50.420> lined<00:03:50.660> them<00:03:50.870> up<00:03:50.959> correctly<00:03:51.349> that<00:03:51.709> was

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
haven't lined them up correctly that was

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.890 
haven't lined them up correctly that was
here<00:03:52.190> but<00:03:52.849> I<00:03:52.910> was<00:03:53.090> trying<00:03:53.299> to<00:03:53.329> give<00:03:53.480> an<00:03:53.569> example

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
here but I was trying to give an example

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.020 
here but I was trying to give an example
of<00:03:54.170> how<00:03:55.030> you<00:03:56.030> have<00:03:56.180> to<00:03:56.299> get<00:03:56.450> it<00:03:56.569> spot-on<00:03:56.930> so<00:03:58.030> you

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
of how you have to get it spot-on so you

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.690 
of how you have to get it spot-on so you
line<00:03:59.569> up<00:03:59.599> them<00:04:00.530> here<00:04:00.799> and<00:04:01.069> then<00:04:01.190> you<00:04:01.280> just<00:04:01.459> move

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
line up them here and then you just move

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.670 
line up them here and then you just move
until<00:04:02.150> it<00:04:02.360> looks<00:04:02.599> exactly<00:04:02.870> like<00:04:03.200> it<00:04:03.440> does<00:04:03.560> in

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
until it looks exactly like it does in

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.410 
until it looks exactly like it does in
the<00:04:03.769> book<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:04.190> then<00:04:04.549> there's<00:04:04.819> when<00:04:05.209> you<00:04:05.239> pull

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
the book and then there's when you pull

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.140 
the book and then there's when you pull
away<00:04:06.049> from<00:04:06.470> that<00:04:06.650> there<00:04:07.459> should<00:04:07.670> be<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.790> slot<00:04:08.120> on

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
away from that there should be a slot on

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.720 
away from that there should be a slot on
the<00:04:08.269> floor<00:04:08.860> which<00:04:09.860> will<00:04:10.040> line<00:04:10.220> it<00:04:10.250> up<00:04:10.489> and

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
the floor which will line it up and

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.150 
the floor which will line it up and
trigger<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.030> cutscene<00:04:11.599> and<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.920> third

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
trigger the cutscene and the third

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.090 
trigger the cutscene and the third
solution<00:04:13.549> to<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.000> puzzle<00:04:14.150> I<00:04:17.949> hope<00:04:18.949> this
