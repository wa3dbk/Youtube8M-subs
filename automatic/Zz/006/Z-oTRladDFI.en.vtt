00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.960
 hello here are our equipment 500 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.900
 years 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.809
 the effect tells alan a coil that 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.980
 converts mechanical energy into energy 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.449
 electrical 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:23.530
 an old cell phone because the one occurs 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:36.379
 to win and loaded from which we cut 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:39.680
 water and plug the humiliation cool and there 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:42.620
 is three of the seven hills power the 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.579
 governor comes in with strength 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.130
 manual 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.540
 I want and up to eight goals 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.940
 Good people and what are you seeing? 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.739
 talked about mechanical energy going 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.140
 tire produced here by generating 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.210
 together with the pedal and energy 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.460
 that will be converted past 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.040
 by this thread here for this gambiarra that 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.500
 we made it here very crazy connected 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.899
 phone charger wire going 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.609
 be charged to the cell that will yield 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:14.319
 the screen with the loading name that will 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:14.319
 is loading ranking 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.890
 you there and carrying with the photograph 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.070
 world beauty now I'll talk a little 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.360
 than our example mechanical energy 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:46.950
 that he the player is a bar 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:51.479
 converted into energy is the crazy part 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.630
 bertin thermal energy outsourced 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.640
 Good folks, there you go, try 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.910
 charge whatever at home takes some 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.310
 girls for precaution for example use 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.080
 a voltage regulator for the matter 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.520
 oscillate a lot because there are hours 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.410
 that we lose at least others to 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.220
 You have to do more and strength 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.350
 this difference of neither in it kinetic 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.660
 produced will also differentiate the 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.480
 assembly produced by the trainer may 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.880
 overcharge the battery and heating up 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.860
 she might not have exploded and if she 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.420
 blast you could die on time or 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.630
 even have a cancer 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.700
 and if it is to made simply 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.190
 of the old salary 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.540
 may be able to damage what you 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.730
 do not be too close with 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.530
 security and the boys there were 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.780
 near to do an experiment but it is 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.110
 because I do not paulo in the name of fifa and 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.110
 also
