00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
but one of the things that I do change

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.219 
but one of the things that I do change
is<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:31.290> little<00:01:31.650> thing<00:01:31.860> right<00:01:31.890> here<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:33.229> that

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
is this little thing right here and that

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.280 
is this little thing right here and that
is<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.060> stop<00:01:36.060> time

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
is the stop time

that's under the DJ preferences in the
first<00:01:41.100> pane<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:42.090> reason<00:01:42.420> why<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.960> change<00:01:43.380> it

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
first pane the reason why I change it

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.660 
first pane the reason why I change it
just<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.790> little<00:01:45.030> bit<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.689> because<00:01:46.290> when<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.189> stop

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
just a little bit is because when I stop

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.060 
just a little bit is because when I stop
I<00:01:47.970> want<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.990> sound<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.439> little<00:01:49.560> bit<00:01:49.710> more

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
I want it to sound a little bit more

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.850 
I want it to sound a little bit more
like<00:01:50.340> an<00:01:50.549> actual<00:01:50.700> record<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:53.299> learned<00:01:54.299> on

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
like an actual record I learned on

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.280 
like an actual record I learned on
turntables<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.640> still<00:01:56.939> use<00:01:57.149> turntables<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.049> love

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290

turntables I still use turntables I love
turntables<00:01:59.149> and<00:02:00.229> so<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.590> love<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.520> feel<00:02:02.880> so

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
turntables and so I love that feel so

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.850 
turntables and so I love that feel so
that<00:02:03.479> helps<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.369> as<00:02:05.369> far<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:05.939> start<00:02:06.780> having<00:02:07.740> it

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
that helps it as far as start having it

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.880 
that helps it as far as start having it
all<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.250> way<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> fastest<00:02:09.750> helps<00:02:10.170> when

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
all the way to the fastest helps when

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.130 
all the way to the fastest helps when
you<00:02:11.129> release<00:02:11.520> record<00:02:12.060> foot<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:12.660> start

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
you release record foot to just start

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.520 
you release record foot to just start
right<00:02:13.380> up<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.700> that's<00:02:14.880> what<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.900> pretty<00:02:16.380> much

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
right up so that's what the pretty much

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.410 
right up so that's what the pretty much
I'm<00:02:16.860> pretty<00:02:17.250> sure<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.580> only<00:02:17.670> thing<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.120> change

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
I'm pretty sure the only thing I change

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.170 
I'm pretty sure the only thing I change
on<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:19.650> first<00:02:19.980> DJ<00:02:20.400> preferences<00:02:21.180> pane<00:02:22.730> as<00:02:23.730> far

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
as recording I left it on 16 I could go

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.360 
as recording I left it on 16 I could go
24<00:02:28.890> with<00:02:29.069> it<00:02:29.990> but<00:02:30.990> it<00:02:31.320> takes<00:02:31.530> more<00:02:31.800> space<00:02:32.010> in

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
24 with it but it takes more space in

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.970 
24 with it but it takes more space in
the<00:02:32.459> computer<00:02:33.050> so<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.470> I'm<00:02:34.650> just<00:02:34.830> going<00:02:34.950> to

the computer so and I'm just going to

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.440 
the computer so and I'm just going to
upload<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.580> YouTube<00:02:35.940> anyway<00:02:36.560> so

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
upload it to YouTube anyway so

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.360 
upload it to YouTube anyway so
everything<00:02:39.450> else<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.810> just<00:02:39.840> pretty<00:02:40.260> much<00:02:40.370> left

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
everything else I just pretty much left

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.220 
everything else I just pretty much left
it<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.700> way<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.970> is

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
it the way it is

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.270 
it the way it is
from<00:02:44.040> there<00:02:44.690> we<00:02:45.690> go<00:02:45.900> over<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.620> library<00:02:47.100> and

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
from there we go over to library and

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.060 
from there we go over to library and
display<00:02:47.850> this<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.630> what<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.840> have<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.320> on<00:02:49.440> again

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
display this is what I have it on again

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.340 
display this is what I have it on again
I<00:02:50.310> don't<00:02:51.030> even<00:02:51.300> know<00:02:51.570> that<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.810> changed

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
I don't even know that I changed

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.460 
I don't even know that I changed
anything<00:02:52.860> on<00:02:53.220> here<00:02:55.130> but<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:57.690> can<00:02:58.019> mess<00:02:58.320> around

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
anything on here but you can mess around

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.170 
anything on here but you can mess around
with<00:02:58.739> it<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.070> see<00:02:59.250> if<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.550> works<00:02:59.790> better<00:03:00.030> for

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
with it and see if it works better for

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.740 
with it and see if it works better for
your<00:03:00.420> laptop<00:03:00.660> or<00:03:01.170> for<00:03:01.350> your<00:03:01.470> preference<00:03:02.750> mixer

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
your laptop or for your preference mixer

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.840 
your laptop or for your preference mixer
of<00:03:03.989> course<00:03:04.320> I<00:03:04.500> changed<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.980> few<00:03:05.190> things<00:03:05.250> here

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
of course I changed a few things here

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.770 
of course I changed a few things here
and<00:03:08.540> most<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.870> stuff<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:10.320> left<00:03:11.420> default<00:03:12.420> but

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
and most of the stuff I left default but

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.250 
and most of the stuff I left default but
the<00:03:12.810> things<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.380> did<00:03:13.650> change<00:03:14.180> was<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.690> cross

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
the things I did change was the cross

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.759 
the things I did change was the cross
fader

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
fader

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.590 
fader
I<00:03:16.920> probably<00:03:17.160> should<00:03:17.430> change<00:03:17.640> up<00:03:17.970> fate<00:03:18.209> or<00:03:18.390> two

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
I probably should change up fate or two

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.750 
I probably should change up fate or two
but<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:19.170> mainly<00:03:19.739> just<00:03:19.950> scratched<00:03:20.430> with<00:03:20.610> the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
but I mainly just scratched with the

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.160 
but I mainly just scratched with the
cross<00:03:20.940> fader<00:03:21.269> so<00:03:22.579> this<00:03:23.579> is<00:03:23.850> my<00:03:24.720> phone<00:03:24.959> so

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
cross fader so this is my phone so

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.390 
cross fader so this is my phone so
luckily<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.930> cross<00:03:28.350> fader<00:03:28.680> Avedon<00:03:29.190> the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
luckily the cross fader Avedon the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.310 
luckily the cross fader Avedon the
fastest<00:03:30.829> that<00:03:31.829> way<00:03:32.480> when<00:03:33.480> I'm<00:03:33.630> scratching

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
fastest that way when I'm scratching

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.600 
fastest that way when I'm scratching
then<00:03:35.450> it's<00:03:36.450> I<00:03:36.959> don't<00:03:37.350> have<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.980> move<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.370> cross

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
then it's I don't have to move the cross

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.770 
then it's I don't have to move the cross
fader<00:03:38.910> so<00:03:39.269> far<00:03:39.630> over<00:03:41.480> university<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.600> can

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
fader so far over university you can

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.710 
fader so far over university you can
disable<00:03:43.110> it<00:03:43.410> whatever<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.860> want<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.130> do<00:03:44.720> but

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
disable it whatever you want to do but

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.720 
disable it whatever you want to do but
that's<00:03:45.930> one<00:03:46.350> of<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.590> main<00:03:46.769> things<00:03:47.070> I<00:03:47.280> changed

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
that's one of the main things I changed

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.319 
that's one of the main things I changed
their<00:03:48.799> effects<00:03:49.799> I<00:03:50.160> haven't<00:03:50.610> done<00:03:50.730> anything<00:03:51.120> I

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
their effects I haven't done anything I

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.810 
their effects I haven't done anything I
just<00:03:51.450> have<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:52.019> standard<00:03:52.530> effects<00:03:54.019> I<00:03:55.820> might

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
just have the standard effects I might

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.610 
just have the standard effects I might
look<00:03:57.060> into<00:03:57.360> getting<00:03:57.510> some<00:03:57.870> more<00:03:58.049> cuz<00:03:58.290> I<00:03:58.410> love

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
look into getting some more cuz I love

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.440 
look into getting some more cuz I love
messing<00:03:58.829> with<00:03:59.040> them<00:03:59.340> around<00:03:59.760> with<00:03:59.970> those<00:04:00.180> but

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
messing with them around with those but

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.560 
messing with them around with those but
I'm<00:04:00.540> pretty<00:04:01.230> old<00:04:01.440> schools<00:04:01.829> I<00:04:02.010> don't<00:04:02.220> use<00:04:03.150> too

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
I'm pretty old schools I don't use too

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.300 
I'm pretty old schools I don't use too
much<00:04:03.780> of<00:04:03.840> that<00:04:04.459> and<00:04:05.459> then<00:04:06.000> there's<00:04:06.209> my<00:04:06.450> buffer

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
much of that and then there's my buffer

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.020 
much of that and then there's my buffer
latency<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.549> don't<00:04:08.820> have<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.209> on<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:11.730> lowest

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
latency I don't have it on the lowest

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.279 
latency I don't have it on the lowest
latency<00:04:13.130> but<00:04:14.130> I<00:04:14.459> also<00:04:15.019> want<00:04:16.019> to<00:04:16.079> make<00:04:16.260> sure

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
latency but I also want to make sure

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.009 
latency but I also want to make sure
that<00:04:16.769> my<00:04:17.130> computer<00:04:17.579> load<00:04:17.910> isn't<00:04:18.269> too<00:04:18.419> high<00:04:18.660> so

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
that my computer load isn't too high so

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.500 
that my computer load isn't too high so
this<00:04:19.470> works<00:04:19.739> for<00:04:19.890> me<00:04:20.190> maybe<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:21.060> should<00:04:21.330> mess

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
this works for me maybe I should mess

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.000 
this works for me maybe I should mess
with<00:04:21.539> a<00:04:21.750> little<00:04:22.200> bit<00:04:22.380> and<00:04:22.530> see<00:04:22.710> if<00:04:22.740> it<00:04:22.919> helps

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
with a little bit and see if it helps

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.040 
with a little bit and see if it helps
with<00:04:23.580> everything<00:04:24.120> but<00:04:24.380> yeah<00:04:25.380> it's

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
with everything but yeah it's

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.320 
with everything but yeah it's
pretty<00:04:26.169> much<00:04:26.379> it<00:04:26.650> as<00:04:27.129> far<00:04:27.250> as<00:04:27.430> my<00:04:27.580> preferences

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
pretty much it as far as my preferences

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.520 
pretty much it as far as my preferences
so<00:04:28.629> you<00:04:29.470> guys<00:04:29.650> asked<00:04:30.039> for<00:04:30.099> it<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:30.639> there<00:04:30.970> is

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
so you guys asked for it and there is

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.369 
so you guys asked for it and there is
the<00:04:33.210> only<00:04:34.210> other<00:04:34.419> thing<00:04:34.720> I<00:04:34.840> would<00:04:34.870> say<00:04:35.050> is

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:35.379 
the only other thing I would say is

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:38.040 
the only other thing I would say is
we'll<00:04:36.039> throw<00:04:36.280> out<00:04:36.370> a<00:04:36.400> DJ<00:04:36.940> I<00:04:37.180> love<00:04:37.599> the<00:04:37.750> fact

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
we'll throw out a DJ I love the fact

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.969 
we'll throw out a DJ I love the fact
that<00:04:38.729> you<00:04:39.729> can<00:04:39.909> record<00:04:40.360> your<00:04:40.810> mix<00:04:41.110> right<00:04:41.530> here

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
that you can record your mix right here

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.730 
that you can record your mix right here
in<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:43.090> software<00:04:43.509> itself<00:04:43.930> you<00:04:44.289> don't<00:04:44.440> have<00:04:44.560> to

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
in the software itself you don't have to

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.409 
in the software itself you don't have to
run<00:04:44.889> wires<00:04:45.129> you<00:04:45.669> have<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.090> do<00:04:46.180> anything

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
run wires you have to do anything

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.689 
run wires you have to do anything
separate<00:04:47.080> so<00:04:47.680> that's<00:04:47.860> one<00:04:48.069> of<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:48.280> big<00:04:48.460> things

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
separate so that's one of the big things

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:53.640 
separate so that's one of the big things
I<00:04:48.970> like<00:04:50.009> the<00:04:51.009> other<00:04:51.220> thing<00:04:51.610> is<00:04:52.259> you<00:04:53.259> do<00:04:53.409> have<00:04:53.620> a

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
I like the other thing is you do have a

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.399 
I like the other thing is you do have a
lot<00:04:54.009> of<00:04:54.190> different<00:04:54.759> effects<00:04:55.300> that<00:04:55.690> just<00:04:56.199> come

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
lot of different effects that just come

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:59.159 
lot of different effects that just come

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
standard and you can always get more if

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:05.399 
standard and you can always get more if
you<00:04:59.379> like<00:05:00.900> this<00:05:01.900> combo<00:05:02.440> fade<00:05:02.889> echo<00:05:03.460> is<00:05:04.379> what<00:05:05.379> I

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
you like this combo fade echo is what I

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:08.580 
you like this combo fade echo is what I
been<00:05:06.250> using<00:05:06.490> lately<00:05:06.960> people<00:05:07.960> would<00:05:08.139> ask<00:05:08.289> me

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
been using lately people would ask me

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.100 
been using lately people would ask me
about<00:05:08.620> I<00:05:09.150> like<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.360> fact<00:05:10.569> that<00:05:10.659> I<00:05:10.780> just<00:05:10.990> hit

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
about I like the fact that I just hit

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.990 
about I like the fact that I just hit
the<00:05:11.259> button<00:05:11.590> and<00:05:11.740> it<00:05:12.099> does<00:05:12.310> what<00:05:12.520> it<00:05:12.639> needs<00:05:12.669> to

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
the button and it does what it needs to

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.529 
the button and it does what it needs to
do<00:05:13.379> but<00:05:14.379> I<00:05:14.409> actually<00:05:15.159> mix<00:05:15.789> it<00:05:16.000> a<00:05:16.060> little<00:05:16.090> bit

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
do but I actually mix it a little bit

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:24.240 
do but I actually mix it a little bit
with<00:05:17.319> this<00:05:18.009> repeater<00:05:20.280> effects<00:05:21.280> also<00:05:21.960> and<00:05:23.250> so

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
with this repeater effects also and so

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.020 
with this repeater effects also and so
I'll<00:05:25.000> turn<00:05:25.300> this<00:05:25.569> up<00:05:25.840> to<00:05:26.069> about<00:05:27.069> maybe<00:05:27.699> right

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
I'll turn this up to about maybe right

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.399 
I'll turn this up to about maybe right
about<00:05:28.150> here<00:05:28.629> and<00:05:29.759> in<00:05:30.759> it<00:05:31.599> doesn't<00:05:32.080> like<00:05:32.229> I'm

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 
about here and in it doesn't like I'm

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.890 
about here and in it doesn't like I'm
flipping<00:05:32.830> doubles<00:05:33.190> and<00:05:33.430> I'll<00:05:34.000> go<00:05:34.270> over<00:05:34.449> video

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
flipping doubles and I'll go over video

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.320 
flipping doubles and I'll go over video
on<00:05:35.349> what<00:05:35.650> that<00:05:35.860> means<00:05:36.159> exactly<00:05:36.669> or<00:05:37.029> you<00:05:37.180> can

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
on what that means exactly or you can

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.209 
on what that means exactly or you can
look<00:05:37.479> it<00:05:37.599> up<00:05:37.690> I'm<00:05:37.930> sure<00:05:38.169> there's<00:05:38.830> already<00:05:39.069> a

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:39.219 
look it up I'm sure there's already a

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:43.740 
look it up I'm sure there's already a
video<00:05:39.520> on<00:05:39.669> YouTube<00:05:40.090> flippin<00:05:40.990> devils<00:05:41.380> arm<00:05:42.750> but

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
video on YouTube flippin devils arm but

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.450 
video on YouTube flippin devils arm but
it's<00:05:43.930> basically<00:05:44.380> taking<00:05:44.620> the<00:05:44.860> same<00:05:45.099> song

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
it's basically taking the same song

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.490 
it's basically taking the same song
going<00:05:45.849> back<00:05:46.120> and<00:05:46.300> forth<00:05:46.630> with<00:05:46.810> the<00:05:46.930> same<00:05:47.169> part

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
going back and forth with the same part

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.480 
going back and forth with the same part
and<00:05:48.150> so<00:05:49.150> I'll<00:05:49.419> turn<00:05:49.659> this<00:05:49.930> one<00:05:50.199> on<00:05:50.500> and<00:05:50.860> then

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
and so I'll turn this one on and then

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.249 
and so I'll turn this one on and then
very<00:05:51.759> quickly<00:05:51.909> I<00:05:52.210> have<00:05:52.330> to<00:05:52.449> hit<00:05:52.599> this<00:05:52.840> and<00:05:53.169> it

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259 
very quickly I have to hit this and it

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:57.930 
very quickly I have to hit this and it
will<00:05:53.409> give<00:05:53.919> a<00:05:53.949> nice<00:05:54.219> little<00:05:55.529> effect<00:05:56.580> so<00:05:57.580> when

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
will give a nice little effect so when

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.450 
will give a nice little effect so when
you<00:05:58.479> will<00:05:58.659> ask<00:05:58.779> what<00:05:59.080> effect<00:05:59.409> I<00:05:59.560> use<00:05:59.860> sometimes

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460

you will ask what effect I use sometimes
it's<00:06:00.879> only<00:06:01.029> this<00:06:01.300> sometimes<00:06:01.810> this<00:06:02.199> sometimes

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
it's only this sometimes this sometimes

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.640 
it's only this sometimes this sometimes
I'll<00:06:03.279> use<00:06:03.430> a<00:06:03.460> delay<00:06:03.849> but<00:06:04.090> I<00:06:04.330> don't<00:06:04.960> use<00:06:05.229> a<00:06:05.259> lot

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
bunch of artists and I ask they would do

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.430 
bunch of artists and I ask they would do
a<00:06:25.990> drop<00:06:26.289> for<00:06:26.560> me<00:06:26.590> to<00:06:26.860> call<00:06:27.069> the<00:06:27.190> DJ<00:06:27.370> drop<00:06:27.819> and

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.230 
a drop for me to call the DJ drop and
they<00:06:29.440> just<00:06:29.710> grabbed<00:06:30.219> a<00:06:30.310> microphone<00:06:30.460> and

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
they just grabbed a microphone and

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.809 
they just grabbed a microphone and
recorded<00:06:31.960> it<00:06:32.110> and<00:06:32.319> this<00:06:32.949> is<00:06:33.159> obviously<00:06:33.580> my

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:33.819 
recorded it and this is obviously my

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:37.680 
recorded it and this is obviously my
favorite<00:06:34.000> one<00:06:34.649> and<00:06:35.649> so<00:06:36.370> I<00:06:36.399> have<00:06:37.000> it<00:06:37.240> I<00:06:37.270> use<00:06:37.659> it

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
favorite one and so I have it I use it

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:38.820 
favorite one and so I have it I use it
all<00:06:37.930> the<00:06:37.960> time

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
all the time

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.520 
all the time
and<00:06:38.919> then<00:06:39.159> I<00:06:39.280> just<00:06:39.490> chopped<00:06:39.789> it<00:06:39.940> up<00:06:40.090> and<00:06:40.330> I<00:06:41.319> used

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
and then I just chopped it up and I used

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.869 
and then I just chopped it up and I used
different<00:06:41.919> parts<00:06:42.159> of<00:06:42.310> that<00:06:42.490> saying<00:06:42.819> drop<00:06:44.879> and

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:45.879 
different parts of that saying drop and

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:49.110 
different parts of that saying drop and
so<00:06:46.919> that's<00:06:47.919> pretty<00:06:48.220> much<00:06:48.310> it<00:06:48.460> if<00:06:48.879> you<00:06:49.000> guys
