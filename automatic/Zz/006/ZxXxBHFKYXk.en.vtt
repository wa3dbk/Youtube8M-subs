00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.390
 people are going to start with the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.699
 from the middle of the plane 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.699

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.070
 I wait a little while he took 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.270

00:01:46.850 --> 00:02:02.680
 rudder can only have a stabilization in 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:02:02.680

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.400
