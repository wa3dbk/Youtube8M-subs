00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.080 
here the true hole and if I show you
here<00:01:48.990> that's<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:51.200> Shimano<00:01:52.909> mountain<00:01:53.909> bike

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
cleat rather small and you could

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.420 
cleat rather small and you could
theoretically<00:01:57.649> fit<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.770> into<00:01:59.070> these<00:01:59.369> two

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
theoretically fit it into these two

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.740 
theoretically fit it into these two
holes<00:01:59.759> here<00:02:00.799> well<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.399> not<00:02:02.750> actually

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750

so you can see that it can be suggested

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.869 
so you can see that it can be suggested
you<00:02:57.139> have<00:02:57.260> some<00:02:57.530> adjusting<00:02:58.310> range<00:02:58.549> here<00:02:58.849> and

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
you have some adjusting range here and

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.210 
you have some adjusting range here and
even<00:02:59.150> some<00:02:59.530> gauges<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:00.799> you<00:03:00.859> can<00:03:01.659> measure<00:03:02.659> this

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
even some gauges so you can measure this

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.240 
even some gauges so you can measure this
the<00:03:04.220> changes<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:04.819> you<00:03:04.970> do<00:03:05.829> the<00:03:06.829> thing<00:03:07.069> is

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
the changes that you do the thing is

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.349 
the changes that you do the thing is
that<00:03:07.400> you<00:03:07.609> usually<00:03:07.970> just<00:03:08.650> make<00:03:09.650> it<00:03:09.799> tight

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
that you usually just make it tight

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.690 
that you usually just make it tight
right<00:03:11.359> with<00:03:11.629> it<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.079> when<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.590> feel<00:03:12.700> that

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
right with it and when you feel that

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.119 
right with it and when you feel that
it's<00:03:13.879> a<00:03:14.000> bit<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.139> left<00:03:15.169> to<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.680> right<00:03:15.709> to

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
it's a bit to the left to the right to

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.599 
it's a bit to the left to the right to
the<00:03:16.220> back<00:03:16.430> so<00:03:17.150> on<00:03:17.329> you<00:03:18.290> can<00:03:18.530> make<00:03:18.979> small<00:03:19.370> small

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
the back so on you can make small small

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.229 
the back so on you can make small small
doubt<00:03:19.819> adjustments<00:03:20.690> with<00:03:21.349> these<00:03:22.060> with<00:03:23.060> these

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
doubt adjustments with these with these

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.750 
doubt adjustments with these with these
like<00:03:25.209> markings<00:03:26.209> here<00:03:27.040> of<00:03:28.040> course<00:03:28.310> this<00:03:28.549> must

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
like markings here of course this must

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.099 
like markings here of course this must
be<00:03:30.129> perfectly<00:03:31.129> tight<00:03:31.370> before<00:03:31.909> you<00:03:32.060> go<00:03:32.840> riding

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
be perfectly tight before you go riding

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.500 
be perfectly tight before you go riding
I<00:03:33.349> didn't<00:03:33.650> do<00:03:33.709> that<00:03:33.739> in<00:03:34.129> this<00:03:34.430> case<00:03:34.760> just<00:03:35.359> to

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
I didn't do that in this case just to

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.599 
I didn't do that in this case just to
show<00:03:35.690> you<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.989> you<00:03:36.709> can<00:03:36.889> play<00:03:37.129> with<00:03:37.340> it<00:03:37.489> you

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
show you the you can play with it you

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.219 
show you the you can play with it you
know<00:03:37.729> it's<00:03:37.940> not<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.599> beginning<00:03:38.780> it's<00:03:39.109> not

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:39.229 
know it's not the beginning it's not

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:41.409 
know it's not the beginning it's not
fixed<00:03:39.650> before<00:03:40.639> you<00:03:40.760> make<00:03:40.940> it<00:03:40.970> really<00:03:41.389> really

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
fixed before you make it really really

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:45.789 
fixed before you make it really really
tight<00:03:41.949> now<00:03:42.949> on<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.870> question<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:44.959> hear<00:03:45.139> a<00:03:45.199> lot<00:03:45.440> is

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
tight now on a question I hear a lot is

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.210 
tight now on a question I hear a lot is
how<00:03:46.609> does<00:03:46.790> this<00:03:46.940> actually<00:03:47.269> works<00:03:47.690> you<00:03:48.019> know

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
how does this actually works you know

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.460 
how does this actually works you know
because<00:03:49.220> this<00:03:49.510> cleat<00:03:50.510> you<00:03:50.959> can<00:03:51.139> see<00:03:51.349> it's

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
because this cleat you can see it's

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.689 
because this cleat you can see it's
really<00:03:51.919> different<00:03:52.370> this<00:03:52.489> is<00:03:52.549> the

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699 
really different this is the

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.179 
really different this is the
mountain-bike<00:03:53.060> cleat<00:03:53.510> this<00:03:54.500> is<00:03:54.680> a<00:03:54.709> rock<00:03:54.979> wait

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:55.189 
mountain-bike cleat this is a rock wait

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:58.770 
mountain-bike cleat this is a rock wait
so<00:03:56.060> how<00:03:56.329> does<00:03:56.389> it<00:03:56.540> how<00:03:57.260> does<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.530> actually<00:03:57.650> work

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
so how does it how does it actually work

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.719 
so how does it how does it actually work
well<00:03:59.780> for<00:04:00.709> this<00:04:00.889> I<00:04:01.040> have<00:04:01.129> to<00:04:01.159> show<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:01.430> the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
crank arm okay what you can also see

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.280 
crank arm okay what you can also see
here<00:04:33.160> is<00:04:33.280> this<00:04:33.490> part<00:04:33.850> the<00:04:34.150> rear<00:04:34.330> part<00:04:34.660> I've

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
here is this part the rear part I've

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.650 
here is this part the rear part I've
tried<00:04:35.590> to<00:04:35.740> apply<00:04:36.310> force<00:04:36.669> to<00:04:36.760> it<00:04:37.030> pull<00:04:37.300> it<00:04:37.480> and

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
tried to apply force to it pull it and

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.320 
tried to apply force to it pull it and
you<00:04:37.990> can<00:04:38.169> see<00:04:38.410> that<00:04:38.590> it<00:04:38.680> it's<00:04:39.520> moving<00:04:40.000> okay

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
you can see that it it's moving okay

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.960 
you can see that it it's moving okay
because<00:04:40.630> you<00:04:40.720> have<00:04:40.870> a<00:04:41.070> hinge<00:04:42.070> here<00:04:42.190> and<00:04:42.730> a

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
because you have a hinge here and a

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.300 
because you have a hinge here and a
spring<00:04:43.930> inside<00:04:44.430> so<00:04:45.430> that<00:04:46.060> is<00:04:46.330> that<00:04:46.690> when<00:04:47.050> you

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
spring inside so that is that when you

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.659 
spring inside so that is that when you
place<00:04:48.310> your<00:04:48.340> shoe<00:04:48.930> on<00:04:49.930> to<00:04:50.200> here<00:04:50.530> you<00:04:51.340> have<00:04:51.520> this

place your shoe on to here you have this

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.370 
place your shoe on to here you have this
this<00:04:52.390> kind<00:04:52.720> of<00:04:52.810> edge<00:04:53.530> here<00:04:54.130> okay<00:04:55.050> and<00:04:56.050> you<00:04:56.230> have

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
this kind of edge here okay and you have

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.940 
this kind of edge here okay and you have
an<00:04:56.590> edge<00:04:56.830> here<00:04:57.310> so<00:04:57.850> if<00:04:58.270> you<00:04:58.900> press<00:04:59.169> it<00:04:59.230> together

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
an edge here so if you press it together

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.140 
an edge here so if you press it together
it<00:05:00.790> will<00:05:01.030> lock<00:05:01.440> tightly<00:05:02.440> inside<00:05:03.250> okay<00:05:03.940> this

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
it will lock tightly inside okay this

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.640 
it will lock tightly inside okay this
front<00:05:04.660> side<00:05:04.930> this<00:05:05.740> locks<00:05:06.040> here<00:05:06.400> and<00:05:06.580> then<00:05:07.650> into

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
front side this locks here and then into

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.680 
front side this locks here and then into
the<00:05:08.770> back<00:05:08.980> I<00:05:09.190> will<00:05:09.340> not<00:05:09.370> do<00:05:09.610> this<00:05:09.790> because<00:05:10.030> I

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
the back I will not do this because I

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.950 
the back I will not do this because I
need<00:05:11.530> a<00:05:11.729> great<00:05:12.729> amount<00:05:12.910> of<00:05:13.090> force<00:05:13.360> to<00:05:13.419> detach

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
need a great amount of force to detach

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.680 
need a great amount of force to detach
it<00:05:14.200> with<00:05:14.350> my<00:05:14.500> hand<00:05:14.770> and<00:05:15.030> I<00:05:16.030> want<00:05:16.270> to<00:05:16.360> show<00:05:16.630> you
