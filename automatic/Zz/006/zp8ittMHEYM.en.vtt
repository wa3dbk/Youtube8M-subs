so<00:00:00.930> now<00:00:01.050> here's<00:00:01.290> where<00:00:01.469> the<00:00:01.650> fun<00:00:01.680> part<00:00:02.129> comes

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
so now here's where the fun part comes

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.340 
so now here's where the fun part comes
in<00:00:02.610> no<00:00:03.240> when<00:00:03.510> you're<00:00:03.659> you're<00:00:03.990> trying<00:00:04.259> to

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
in no when you're you're trying to

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.340 
in no when you're you're trying to
figure<00:00:04.650> out<00:00:04.799> what's<00:00:05.130> going<00:00:05.460> on<00:00:05.839> how<00:00:06.839> you<00:00:06.899> feel

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
figure out what's going on how you feel

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.680 
figure out what's going on how you feel
about<00:00:07.379> things<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.580> where<00:00:08.820> you're<00:00:09.000> going<00:00:09.510> and

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
about things and where you're going and

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.530 
about things and where you're going and
who's<00:00:09.900> who<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.559> what's<00:00:10.620> what<00:00:11.130> Oh<00:00:11.540> basically

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
who's who and what's what Oh basically

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.270 
who's who and what's what Oh basically
the<00:00:12.660> hypothesis<00:00:13.349> goes<00:00:13.590> something<00:00:14.099> like<00:00:14.130> this

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
the hypothesis goes something like this

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.740 
the hypothesis goes something like this
I<00:00:15.410> believed<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.590> eventually<00:00:17.240> human<00:00:18.240> beings

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
I believed it eventually human beings

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.029 
I believed it eventually human beings
will<00:00:18.960> discover<00:00:19.439> life<00:00:19.800> on<00:00:20.160> another<00:00:20.820> planet

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
will discover life on another planet

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.220 
will discover life on another planet
flight<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.279> based<00:00:23.580> on<00:00:23.820> things<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.510> far<00:00:24.810> from

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
flight is based on things so far from

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.670 
flight is based on things so far from
the<00:00:25.740> carbon-based<00:00:26.250> life<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:27.029> we<00:00:27.180> know<00:00:27.680> that

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
the carbon-based life that we know that

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.769 
the carbon-based life that we know that
it's<00:00:29.039> going<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.369> open<00:00:29.519> up<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.939> possibilities

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
it's going to open up the possibilities

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.319 
it's going to open up the possibilities
that<00:00:30.810> life<00:00:31.380> could<00:00:31.650> have<00:00:31.830> had<00:00:32.009> happened<00:00:32.940> under

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
that life could have had happened under

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.540 
that life could have had happened under
very<00:00:33.719> very<00:00:34.110> very<00:00:34.440> different<00:00:35.370> circumstances

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
very very very different circumstances

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.139 
very very very different circumstances
and<00:00:36.480> different<00:00:36.899> universes<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.950> think<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:38.910> may

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
and different universes I think this may

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.850 
and different universes I think this may
even<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.660> case<00:00:39.899> for<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.290> light<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.680> days

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
even be the case for the light of days

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.510 
even be the case for the light of days
bound<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.430> deep<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.879> ocean<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.980> dis<00:00:44.219> life

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
bound and deep in the ocean the dis life

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.639 
bound and deep in the ocean the dis life
may<00:00:45.149> be<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.510> radically<00:00:46.020> different<00:00:46.410> than<00:00:46.440> what

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
may be so radically different than what

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.639 
may be so radically different than what
we<00:00:46.800> know<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.640> can<00:00:47.700> almost<00:00:48.059> be<00:00:48.440> called<00:00:49.440> a

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
we know that it can almost be called a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.410 
we know that it can almost be called a
different<00:00:50.100> branch<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.579> life<00:00:50.789> even<00:00:51.149> though<00:00:51.270> it

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
different branch of life even though it

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.170 
different branch of life even though it
is<00:00:51.480> dna-based<00:00:52.340> but<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.460> believe<00:00:53.670> since<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.030> is

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
is dna-based but I believe since it is

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.529 
is dna-based but I believe since it is
since<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.750> like<00:00:54.930> was<00:00:55.140> found<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.559> earth<00:00:55.620> it

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
since I like was found on earth it

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.319 
since I like was found on earth it
constitutes<00:00:57.649> still<00:00:58.649> life<00:00:59.370> part<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.969> listener

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
constitutes still life part of listener

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.410 
constitutes still life part of listener
I<00:01:00.570> think<00:01:01.289> we'll<00:01:01.410> find<00:01:01.590> life<00:01:01.920> we<00:01:02.760> may<00:01:02.910> find<00:01:03.180> life

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
I think we'll find life we may find life

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.620 
I think we'll find life we may find life
that<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.870> more<00:01:04.650> similar<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.760> may<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:05.970> less

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
that is more similar that may be less

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.100 
that is more similar that may be less
dissimilar<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.560> us<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.729> some<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.299> life

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
dissimilar to us and some of that life

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.980 
dissimilar to us and some of that life
that<00:01:10.380> they<00:01:10.500> found<00:01:10.770> at<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.280> ocean<00:01:11.700> vents<00:01:11.990> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
that they found at the ocean vents the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.859 
that they found at the ocean vents the
deep<00:01:13.170> ocean<00:01:13.560> vents<00:01:14.180> but<00:01:15.180> it'll<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.600> at<00:01:15.810> a

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
deep ocean vents but it'll be at a

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.020 
deep ocean vents but it'll be at a
