00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
most perfect part of my day well if I

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.760 
most perfect part of my day well if I
think<00:04:50.340> about<00:04:50.550> special<00:04:51.259> experiences<00:04:52.259> I<00:04:52.320> think

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
think about special experiences I think

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.520 
think about special experiences I think
they're<00:04:53.099> almost<00:04:53.280> too<00:04:53.699> numerous<00:04:53.970> to<00:04:54.389> to<00:04:55.020> start

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
they're almost too numerous to to start

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.640 
they're almost too numerous to to start
picking<00:04:56.520> out<00:04:56.639> one<00:04:56.880> in<00:04:56.909> particular<00:04:57.240> I<00:04:57.810> think

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
picking out one in particular I think

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.159 
picking out one in particular I think
most<00:04:59.490> special<00:04:59.940> to<00:05:00.060> me<00:05:00.240> probably<00:05:00.539> is<00:05:00.990> our

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
most special to me probably is our

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.730 
most special to me probably is our
special<00:05:01.650> needs<00:05:01.770> population<00:05:02.520> I<00:05:02.729> think<00:05:03.590> in<00:05:04.590> a

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
special needs population I think in a

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.129 
special needs population I think in a
surgical<00:05:05.009> subspecialties<00:05:05.690> oftentimes<00:05:06.690> hard

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
surgical subspecialties oftentimes hard

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.140 
surgical subspecialties oftentimes hard
to<00:05:07.500> establish<00:05:07.889> relationships<00:05:08.820> where<00:05:09.030> you

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
to establish relationships where you

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.570 
to establish relationships where you
meet<00:05:09.419> families<00:05:10.229> from<00:05:10.650> day<00:05:10.830> one<00:05:11.099> and<00:05:11.130> follow

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
meet families from day one and follow

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.820 
meet families from day one and follow
them<00:05:11.789> through<00:05:11.969> their<00:05:12.060> lives<00:05:12.240> but<00:05:12.740> with<00:05:13.740> our

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
them through their lives but with our

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.950 
them through their lives but with our
special<00:05:14.159> needs<00:05:14.280> populations<00:05:15.000> often<00:05:15.389> times<00:05:15.780> we

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
special needs populations often times we

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.240 
special needs populations often times we
meet<00:05:16.139> them<00:05:16.320> in<00:05:16.409> the<00:05:16.440> first<00:05:16.680> weeks<00:05:16.979> of<00:05:17.099> their

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
meet them in the first weeks of their

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.399 
meet them in the first weeks of their
life<00:05:17.400> and<00:05:17.669> we<00:05:17.759> follow<00:05:18.000> them<00:05:18.210> to<00:05:18.479> their<00:05:18.960> adults

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409 
life and we follow them to their adults

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:21.950 
life and we follow them to their adults
and<00:05:19.590> so<00:05:19.770> that<00:05:20.460> I<00:05:20.759> think<00:05:21.000> is<00:05:21.090> very<00:05:21.270> unique<00:05:21.570> to

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
and so that I think is very unique to

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.010 
and so that I think is very unique to
the<00:05:22.229> pediatric<00:05:22.770> center<00:05:22.949> I<00:05:23.389> have<00:05:24.389> a<00:05:24.419> parent

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
the pediatric center I have a parent

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.640 
the pediatric center I have a parent
that<00:05:25.260> has<00:05:25.349> a<00:05:25.500> child<00:05:25.710> with<00:05:25.800> a<00:05:25.949> condition

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
that has a child with a condition
