up<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.140> rodin<00:00:28.410> predicting<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.830> quite<00:00:29.070> nicely

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
up to rodin predicting that quite nicely

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.060 
up to rodin predicting that quite nicely
now<00:00:29.730> I'm<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.119> switch<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.480> my<00:00:30.570> latios

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
now I'm going to switch to my latios

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.260 
now I'm going to switch to my latios
really<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.189> sponge<00:00:32.460> either<00:00:32.730> one<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.910> his<00:00:33.059> stab

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
really to sponge either one of his stab

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.819 
really to sponge either one of his stab
moves<00:00:33.540> or<00:00:33.660> take<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> wisp<00:00:34.110> but<00:00:34.350> he<00:00:34.410> actually<00:00:34.530> was

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
moves or take a wisp but he actually was

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.470 
moves or take a wisp but he actually was
going<00:00:35.040> for<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.280> trick<00:00:35.520> with<00:00:36.090> just<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
going for the trick with just have a

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.639 
going for the trick with just have a
really<00:00:36.630> good<00:00:36.870> opportunity<00:00:37.079> for<00:00:37.350> me<00:00:37.469> because

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
really good opportunity for me because

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.369 
really good opportunity for me because
now<00:00:37.770> I'm<00:00:37.920> choice<00:00:38.570> this<00:00:39.570> does<00:00:39.719> make<00:00:39.840> me<00:00:39.960> fasten

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
now I'm choice this does make me fasten

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.170 
now I'm choice this does make me fasten
is<00:00:40.469> Rotem<00:00:40.680> I'm<00:00:40.829> figuring<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.460> nothing<00:00:41.910> that

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
is Rotem I'm figuring that nothing that

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.490 
is Rotem I'm figuring that nothing that
he's<00:00:42.300> not<00:00:42.390> going<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.660> leave<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.079> here<00:00:43.290> to

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
he's not going to leave this in here to

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.680 
he's not going to leave this in here to
take<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> jerk<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.489> meteor<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.450> I'm<00:00:45.510> going<00:00:45.660> to

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
take a jerk a meteor so I'm going to

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.000 
take a jerk a meteor so I'm going to
predict<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.410> then<00:00:46.590> go<00:00:46.710> for<00:00:46.890> hidden

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
predict that and then go for hidden

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.560 
predict that and then go for hidden
power<00:00:47.160> fire<00:00:47.460> as<00:00:47.670> he<00:00:47.730> goes<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> sizzler

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
power fire as he goes up to a sizzler

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.310 
power fire as he goes up to a sizzler
which<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.870> absolutely<00:00:49.800> amazing<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.820> me

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
which is absolutely amazing for me

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.299 
which is absolutely amazing for me
because<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.530> don't<00:00:52.649> really<00:00:52.739> like<00:00:52.949> doing<00:00:53.129> with

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
because I don't really like doing with

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.939 
because I don't really like doing with
scissor<00:00:53.579> as<00:00:53.699> much<00:00:53.850> either<00:00:54.260> so<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.710> gives<00:00:55.829> me

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
scissor as much either so that gives me

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.189 
scissor as much either so that gives me
an<00:00:56.100> early<00:00:56.430> 65<00:00:56.820> lead<00:00:57.059> which<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.510> really<00:00:57.899> really

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
an early 65 lead which is really really

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.130 
an early 65 lead which is really really
really<00:00:58.530> good<00:00:59.120> so<00:01:00.120> um<00:01:00.449> he's<00:01:00.660> not<00:01:00.780> going<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.020> go

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
really good so um he's not going to go

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.759 
really good so um he's not going to go
into<00:01:01.289> his<00:01:01.559> um<00:01:02.480> Gengar<00:01:03.480> I'm<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.470> going<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.680> go

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
into his um Gengar I'm just going to go

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.170 
into his um Gengar I'm just going to go
into<00:01:04.979> my<00:01:05.070> skarmory<00:01:05.489> expecting<00:01:05.850> him<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.000> like

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
into my skarmory expecting him to like

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.789 
into my skarmory expecting him to like
go<00:01:06.360> for<00:01:06.540> like<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.659> substitute<00:01:07.290> because<00:01:07.470> those

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
go for like a substitute because those

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.130 
go for like a substitute because those
are<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.400> know<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.790> commons<00:01:09.150> gengar<00:01:09.630> sets<00:01:09.900> are

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
are you know the commons gengar sets are

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.160 
are you know the commons gengar sets are
sub<00:01:11.100> ones<00:01:11.479> but<00:01:12.479> he<00:01:12.570> actually<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.930> heard<00:01:13.080> her

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
sub ones but he actually just heard her

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.600 
sub ones but he actually just heard her
after<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> focus<00:01:13.770> blast<00:01:13.920> i<00:01:14.100> guess<00:01:14.220> predicting

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
after the focus blast i guess predicting

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.660 
after the focus blast i guess predicting
my<00:01:14.700> tyranitar<00:01:15.540> switch<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.369> i<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.490> get<00:01:17.610> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
my tyranitar switch and i do get a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.160 
my tyranitar switch and i do get a
special<00:01:17.970> defense<00:01:18.150> drop<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:18.659> judging<00:01:19.020> by<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
special defense drop but judging by the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.050 
special defense drop but judging by the
amount<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.500> damage<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:19.860> did<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.430> didn't

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
amount of damage that did that didn't

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.420 
amount of damage that did that didn't
matter<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> slightest<00:01:21.990> bit<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:23.189> really

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
matter in the slightest bit so really

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.100 
matter in the slightest bit so really
I'm<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.939> was<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.150> going<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.330> whirlwind<00:01:24.689> here

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
I'm I was just going to whirlwind here

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.230 
I'm I was just going to whirlwind here
in<00:01:25.170> case<00:01:25.320> he<00:01:25.350> did<00:01:25.590> want<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.799> sub<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.850> just

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
in case he did want to sub but I just

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.719 
in case he did want to sub but I just
figured<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:27.869> skarmory<00:01:28.380> as<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.520> point

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
figured that skarmory as of this point

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.690 
figured that skarmory as of this point
would<00:01:30.000> best<00:01:30.210> be<00:01:30.329> served<00:01:30.509> as<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> death<00:01:31.409> water<00:01:31.700> so

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700

more<00:03:33.950> if<00:03:34.190> he<00:03:34.910> wanted<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.209> switch<00:03:35.569> in<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:36.500> you

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
more if he wanted to switch in and you

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.960 
more if he wanted to switch in and you
know<00:03:36.709> play<00:03:36.859> around<00:03:36.950> with<00:03:37.310> this<00:03:37.430> stuff<00:03:37.489> so<00:03:37.790> he's

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
know play around with this stuff so he's

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.379 
know play around with this stuff so he's
limited<00:03:38.209> to<00:03:38.510> switching<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.959> whole<00:03:39.139> lot<00:03:40.060> so<00:03:41.060> um

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
limited to switching a whole lot so um

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:42.789 
limited to switching a whole lot so um
he's<00:03:41.630> gonna<00:03:41.750> go<00:03:41.900> into<00:03:42.139> his<00:03:42.290> at<00:03:42.440> infinity

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
he's gonna go into his at infinity

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.590 
he's gonna go into his at infinity
predicting<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.250> obvious<00:03:43.579> crunch<00:03:44.090> which<00:03:44.389> was

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
predicting the obvious crunch which was

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.390 
predicting the obvious crunch which was
fairly<00:03:45.170> obvious<00:03:45.650> because<00:03:45.769> i<00:03:45.920> want<00:03:46.100> to<00:03:46.130> damage

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
fairly obvious because i want to damage

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.110 
fairly obvious because i want to damage
on<00:03:46.700> anything

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
on anything

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.580 
on anything
and<00:03:48.269> it's<00:03:48.870> not<00:03:49.049> gonna<00:03:49.200> do<00:03:49.349> a<00:03:49.379> whole<00:03:49.560> lot

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
and it's not gonna do a whole lot

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.199 
and it's not gonna do a whole lot
because<00:03:50.099> I<00:03:50.280> mean<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.519> is<00:03:50.610> an<00:03:50.790> infinite

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
because I mean it is an infinite

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.300 
because I mean it is an infinite
regardless<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.810> how<00:03:51.870> frail<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.590> still

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
investment rather in this tyranitar so

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.580 
investment rather in this tyranitar so
I'm<00:04:00.180> gonna<00:04:00.330> leave<00:04:00.540> him<00:04:00.659> in<00:04:00.810> his<00:04:00.989> father<00:04:01.230> Scott

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
I'm gonna leave him in his father Scott

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.860 
I'm gonna leave him in his father Scott
what<00:04:01.680> he's<00:04:01.799> gonna<00:04:01.890> want<00:04:02.099> to<00:04:02.159> do<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.599> see<00:04:03.599> he<00:04:03.720> goes

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
what he's gonna want to do I see he goes

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.280 
what he's gonna want to do I see he goes
for<00:04:04.049> the<00:04:04.110> close<00:04:04.680> combat<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.720> I<00:04:06.720> see<00:04:06.930> that<00:04:07.110> he's

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
for the close combat and I see that he's

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.280 
for the close combat and I see that he's
a<00:04:07.319> life<00:04:08.129> form<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:08.640> he's<00:04:09.329> either<00:04:09.450> physical<00:04:10.079> mix

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
a life form so he's either physical mix

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.949 
a life form so he's either physical mix
or<00:04:10.560> specially<00:04:11.129> mixed<00:04:11.310> so<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:12.030> was<00:04:12.720> going<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:12.900> go

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
or specially mixed so I was going to go

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.420 
or specially mixed so I was going to go
into<00:04:13.110> a<00:04:13.260> Vaporeon<00:04:13.739> because<00:04:14.069> I<00:04:14.099> can<00:04:14.250> really

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
into a Vaporeon because I can really

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.120 
into a Vaporeon because I can really
sponge<00:04:14.819> anything<00:04:15.360> that<00:04:16.290> either<00:04:16.470> set<00:04:16.829> really

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
sponge anything that either set really

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.030 
sponge anything that either set really
wants<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.400> throw<00:04:17.519> off<00:04:17.699> at<00:04:17.880> me<00:04:18.290> so<00:04:19.290> right<00:04:19.829> here<00:04:19.859> I

go for a wish and he goes out to latios
and<00:04:22.109> because<00:04:23.070> I'm<00:04:23.190> thinking<00:04:23.460> that<00:04:23.550> this<00:04:23.639> is

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
and because I'm thinking that this is

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.779 
and because I'm thinking that this is
aspects<00:04:24.180> latios<00:04:24.630> um<00:04:25.100> right<00:04:26.100> here<00:04:26.490> I'm<00:04:26.639> just

gonna go for protect to see what he
wanted<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.680> lock<00:04:28.800> himself<00:04:28.979> into<00:04:29.340> because<00:04:29.490> I

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
wanted to lock himself into because I

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.950 
wanted to lock himself into because I
really<00:04:29.970> didn't<00:04:30.240> feel<00:04:30.389> like<00:04:30.449> getting<00:04:30.720> myself

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
really didn't feel like getting myself

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.939 
really didn't feel like getting myself
tricked<00:04:31.650> at<00:04:31.979> this<00:04:32.789> exact<00:04:33.150> moment<00:04:33.210> in<00:04:33.539> time<00:04:33.949> so

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
tricked at this exact moment in time so

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.170 
tricked at this exact moment in time so
I<00:04:34.979> know<00:04:35.100> that<00:04:35.310> that<00:04:35.430> was<00:04:35.460> kind<00:04:35.699> of<00:04:35.760> a<00:04:35.850> waste<00:04:36.030> of

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
I know that that was kind of a waste of

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.580 
I know that that was kind of a waste of
a<00:04:36.270> wish<00:04:36.449> but<00:04:36.630> at<00:04:36.750> least<00:04:36.810> I<00:04:37.020> know<00:04:37.080> now<00:04:37.199> that<00:04:37.410> I

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
a wish but at least I know now that I

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.210 
a wish but at least I know now that I
won't<00:04:37.740> get<00:04:37.919> tricked<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:38.550> further<00:04:39.030> crippled

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
won't get tricked and further crippled

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.640 
won't get tricked and further crippled
so<00:04:41.449> now<00:04:42.449> he's<00:04:42.600> gonna<00:04:42.720> fire<00:04:42.930> for<00:04:43.169> drug<00:04:43.289> a<00:04:43.320> meteor

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
so now he's gonna fire for drug a meteor

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.469 
so now he's gonna fire for drug a meteor
I<00:04:43.710> figure<00:04:44.100> that<00:04:44.250> I<00:04:44.280> can<00:04:44.490> live<00:04:44.729> once<00:04:44.970> because<00:04:45.330> of

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
I figure that I can live once because of

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.830 
I figure that I can live once because of
my<00:04:45.600> natural<00:04:45.840> bulk<00:04:46.440> and<00:04:46.880> um<00:04:47.880> I<00:04:48.300> am<00:04:48.570> running<00:04:48.780> a

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
my natural bulk and um I am running a

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.110 
my natural bulk and um I am running a
more<00:04:48.990> defensive<00:04:49.530> vaporeon<00:04:50.340> so<00:04:50.669> I<00:04:50.699> don't<00:04:50.970> take

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
more defensive vaporeon so I don't take

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.850 
more defensive vaporeon so I don't take
that<00:04:51.330> as<00:04:51.449> well<00:04:51.720> as<00:04:51.930> probably<00:04:52.229> some<00:04:52.410> other<00:04:52.470> for

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
that as well as probably some other for

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.839 
that as well as probably some other for
eons<00:04:53.099> but<00:04:53.490> regardless<00:04:54.150> I<00:04:54.330> still<00:04:54.360> live<00:04:54.840> and

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
eons but regardless I still live and

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.219 
eons but regardless I still live and
right<00:04:56.849> here<00:04:57.090> I'm<00:04:57.240> going<00:04:57.389> to<00:04:57.510> expect<00:04:57.810> him<00:04:57.990> to<00:04:58.139> go

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
right here I'm going to expect him to go

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.760 
right here I'm going to expect him to go
into<00:04:58.440> his<00:04:58.770> not<00:04:59.610> go<00:04:59.760> into<00:04:59.910> this<00:05:00.120> but<00:05:00.620> fire<00:05:01.620> off

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
into his not go into this but fire off

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.930 
into his not go into this but fire off
another<00:05:01.800> Drake<00:05:02.220> and<00:05:02.400> meteor<00:05:02.580> so<00:05:02.700> I'm<00:05:02.789> going<00:05:02.910> to

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
another Drake and meteor so I'm going to

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.589 
another Drake and meteor so I'm going to
go<00:05:03.060> into<00:05:03.210> my<00:05:03.330> terrakion<00:05:03.810> with<00:05:04.139> the<00:05:04.460> sandstorm

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
go into my terrakion with the sandstorm

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.870 
go into my terrakion with the sandstorm
boosted<00:05:06.599> special<00:05:07.050> defense<00:05:07.320> and<00:05:07.789> sponge<00:05:08.789> it

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
boosted special defense and sponge it

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.950 
boosted special defense and sponge it
but<00:05:08.970> he<00:05:09.030> actually<00:05:09.120> pulls<00:05:09.419> a<00:05:09.479> double<00:05:09.720> switch<00:05:09.840> he

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
but he actually pulls a double switch he

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.750 
but he actually pulls a double switch he
goes<00:05:10.110> up<00:05:10.229> to<00:05:10.349> his<00:05:10.470> Rotom<00:05:10.800> which<00:05:11.370> in<00:05:11.639> all

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
goes up to his Rotom which in all

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.490 
goes up to his Rotom which in all
honesty<00:05:12.180> is<00:05:12.270> perfectly<00:05:12.660> fine<00:05:12.750> by<00:05:13.110> me<00:05:13.320> because

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
honesty is perfectly fine by me because

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.170 
honesty is perfectly fine by me because
I<00:05:13.680> can<00:05:13.830> still<00:05:14.070> at<00:05:14.190> least<00:05:14.340> fire<00:05:14.639> off<00:05:14.880> a<00:05:14.910> close

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180

meteors so um his heatran is now out of
the<00:05:38.370> way<00:05:38.520> he<00:05:38.760> never<00:05:38.940> got<00:05:39.120> rocks<00:05:39.660> up<00:05:39.870> with<00:05:40.080> it

the way he never got rocks up with it
which<00:05:40.500> um

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
which um

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.770 
which um
would've<00:05:41.940> been<00:05:41.970> that<00:05:42.240> you<00:05:42.690> know

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
would've been that you know

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.180 
would've been that you know
game-changing<00:05:43.410> at<00:05:43.530> this<00:05:43.680> point<00:05:43.920> because<00:05:44.040> you

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
game-changing at this point because you

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.940 
game-changing at this point because you
brought<00:05:44.310> it<00:05:44.430> out<00:05:44.520> so<00:05:44.760> late<00:05:44.930> um<00:05:45.930> so<00:05:46.680> anyways

incomes<00:05:47.490> his<00:05:47.900> latios<00:05:48.900> and<00:05:49.110> I'm<00:05:49.470> just<00:05:49.650> gonna

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
incomes his latios and I'm just gonna

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.190 
incomes his latios and I'm just gonna
fire<00:05:50.550> off<00:05:50.730> vaporeon<00:05:51.660> because<00:05:51.930> that's<00:05:52.080> the

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
fire off vaporeon because that's the

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.510 
fire off vaporeon because that's the
best<00:05:52.380> thing<00:05:52.500> that<00:05:52.680> I<00:05:52.710> can<00:05:52.800> do<00:05:53.010> at<00:05:53.250> this<00:05:53.280> point

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
best thing that I can do at this point

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.660 
best thing that I can do at this point
is<00:05:54.290> just<00:05:55.290> let<00:05:55.650> let<00:05:55.860> it<00:05:55.950> die<00:05:56.100> and<00:05:56.340> then<00:05:56.460> get<00:05:56.640> a

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
is just let let it die and then get a

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.600 
is just let let it die and then get a
free<00:05:56.880> switch<00:05:57.150> into<00:05:57.630> one<00:05:57.780> of<00:05:57.870> my<00:05:57.900> other<00:05:58.020> guys<00:05:58.610> so

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
free switch into one of my other guys so

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.850 
free switch into one of my other guys so
um<00:05:59.970> the<00:06:00.420> poori<00:06:00.630> on<00:06:00.750> goes<00:06:00.930> down<00:06:01.170> and<00:06:01.470> in<00:06:01.620> comes

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
um the poori on goes down and in comes

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.170 
um the poori on goes down and in comes
to<00:06:02.070> rocking<00:06:02.250> out<00:06:02.460> again<00:06:02.700> because<00:06:02.910> I<00:06:03.120> figured

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
to rocking out again because I figured

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.560 
to rocking out again because I figured
that<00:06:03.800> at<00:06:04.800> least<00:06:05.040> now<00:06:05.520> because<00:06:06.000> he's<00:06:06.120> got<00:06:06.330> um

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
that at least now because he's got um

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.850 
that at least now because he's got um
the<00:06:07.560> minus<00:06:07.860> 2<00:06:08.460> special<00:06:09.030> attack<00:06:09.330> drop<00:06:10.170> that<00:06:10.470> I

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
the minus 2 special attack drop that I

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.410 
the minus 2 special attack drop that I
can't<00:06:11.040> least<00:06:11.220> set<00:06:11.370> up<00:06:11.460> a<00:06:11.550> rock<00:06:11.700> polish<00:06:12.150> and

can't least set up a rock polish and

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.570 
can't least set up a rock polish and
pretty<00:06:13.050> much<00:06:13.110> just<00:06:13.500> now<00:06:13.770> sweep<00:06:14.190> through<00:06:14.430> the
