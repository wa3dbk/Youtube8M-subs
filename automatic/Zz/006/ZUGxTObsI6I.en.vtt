00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.419 

the<00:00:09.929> tuning<00:00:10.230> that<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.379> use<00:00:10.530> on<00:00:10.679> drifting<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.219> is

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
the tuning that I use on drifting is is

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.789 
the tuning that I use on drifting is is
called<00:00:11.849> dadgad<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:13.200> that's<00:00:13.379> just<00:00:13.650> a

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
called dadgad and that's just a

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.470 
called dadgad and that's just a
reference<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.369> the<00:00:14.490> names<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.030> notes<00:00:15.179> from

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
reference to the names of the notes from

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.280 
reference to the names of the notes from
low<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.780> high

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.290 
low to high

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.499 
low to high
like<00:00:17.189> Jimmy<00:00:17.430> Page<00:00:17.610> used<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.000> in<00:00:18.090> Kashmir

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:18.509 
like Jimmy Page used it in Kashmir

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:20.269 
like Jimmy Page used it in Kashmir
actually<00:00:18.900> it's<00:00:19.050> pretty<00:00:19.500> one<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.890> one<00:00:20.160> of

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
actually it's pretty one of the one of

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.510 
actually it's pretty one of the one of
the<00:00:20.369> more<00:00:20.730> common<00:00:21.150> altered<00:00:21.990> tunings<00:00:22.520> you're

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
the more common altered tunings you're

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.130 
the more common altered tunings you're
going<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.700> take<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.029> sixth<00:00:24.390> string<00:00:24.539> down<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.750> D

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
going to take the sixth string down to D

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.020 
going to take the sixth string down to D
so<00:00:26.029> just<00:00:27.029> down<00:00:27.179> a<00:00:27.210> whole<00:00:27.480> step

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.030
