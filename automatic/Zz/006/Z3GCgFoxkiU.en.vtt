00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.730
 it's not solidarity it 's charity like every 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.170
 Saturday the young people of San Jose meet 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.690
 punctually in a parish of 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.910
 barcelona at nine o'clock at night 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.670
 they accompany two young priests and 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.860
 some adults their mission to distribute 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.920
 food to dozens of homeless people of all 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:36.510
 the city and especially offer them a 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:37.859
 reason for hope to these young people in 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.039
 mostly members of the movement 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:43.109
 Catholic secular union of San Antonio 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:45.269
 prepare before going out on the streets with 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.940
 a brief talk in which they are spoken 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.769
 of humility and poverty one by one and 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.530
 out loud offers in his night work 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.929
 by various intentions all are 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.719
 remember the father also from his friends 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:01:00.269
 and sick family members and they ask for 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.979
 course of faith in Spain- is like a 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.899
 good experience for me as a Christian 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.880
 because not only do you feed the 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.950
 poor sometimes we give as a catechesis 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.180
 as a religion class 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.920
 more targeted for the poor 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.270
 especially but for us 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.759
 Young people are also doing well for us 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.920
 training an experience that stops work 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.130
 It seems boring and to throw back the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.490
 principle but it's interesting and if what 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.649
 I wanted to do well it 's fun even 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.720
 tonight they are about 40 distribute the 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.280
 food between two vans and divide 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.780
 in two groups 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.090
 we go out with those who go to the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.039
 north station just arrived and 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.350
 unfold the table appear from nowhere 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.020
 dozens of homeless people waiting for them 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.849
 eager young priest reminds 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.299
 the young the words of the pope 

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:47.280
 francisco that are not an NGO but that 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.569
 go the name of the church and you a 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.640
 fragment of the bible before the 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:53.890
 destitute people who are already in line for dinner 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.720
 it's a group of friends instead of going to 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.040
 as many people do not like 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.970
 be on holiday Saturdays 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.350
 They decided to buy food or take out 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.900
 food anywhere to take the 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.940
 poor people of Barcelona because to a person 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.310
 that is on the street of this situation and 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.840
 I already tell you that you realize what 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.490
 thankful that they are because really 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.140
 it's like this society I have a 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.209
 apart people do not want to see but 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.910
 this is really happening in cancer 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.890
 olive but not everything is food too 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.959
 they carry boxes full of clothes so that 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.730
 everyone who approaches can catch 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.820
 what they like or need the most 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.580
 the young people talk to them come up 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.980
 and they worry about their situation they try 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.880
 help them and they extend the hand of the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.480
 church always 1 or 2 and we are with 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.980
 our main weapon which is the rosary 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.519
 for us this is very important 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.650
 because we see that prayer is linked to 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.720
 the action 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.829
 sometimes between them as there are some 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.880
 small brawl and we see you approach 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.520
 in prayer and 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.620
 the virgin helps us and I feel that 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.260
 calm as if it were the rosary is music 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.930
 for your ears 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.810
 in the world poverty young is the result of 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.430
 a spiritual need everything is going to 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.349
 Pauline and is that these young people 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.659
 exemplars know that suffering 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.000
 it has an added value if you live with faith 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.310
 and that the needy should see in them 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.989
 a reason for hope what more 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.599
 lament the young people of san jose is the 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.209
 lack of resources are increasingly more 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.400
 destitute who approach them but they 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.220
 they do not have enough for everyone and they do not give 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.769
 they are asking for financial help 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.090
 to keep getting food for 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.090
 who need it most
