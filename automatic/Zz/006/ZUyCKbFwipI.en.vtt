with fraps I hope you don't mind that a

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.160 
with fraps I hope you don't mind that a
counter<00:01:14.189> up<00:01:14.310> there<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.850> bit<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.299> know<00:01:15.960> it's

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
counter up there it's a bit I know it's

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.460 
counter up there it's a bit I know it's
a<00:01:16.229> bit<00:01:16.350> annoying<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:17.070> um<00:01:17.220> it'll<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.090> do

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
a bit annoying but um it'll have to do

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.170 
a bit annoying but um it'll have to do
so<00:01:19.470> let's<00:01:19.740> get<00:01:19.920> started<00:01:20.250> with<00:01:20.430> explaining

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
so let's get started with explaining

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.800 
so let's get started with explaining
some<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.619> main<00:01:22.619> graphic<00:01:22.860> user<00:01:23.369> interface

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
some of the main graphic user interface

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.780 
some of the main graphic user interface
so<00:01:24.810> here<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.530> four<00:01:25.979> viewports<00:01:26.580> here

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
so here we have the four viewports here

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.640 
so here we have the four viewports here
when<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.390> start<00:01:27.630> up<00:01:27.720> 3ds<00:01:28.020> max<00:01:28.380> and

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
when you just start up 3ds max and

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.160 
when you just start up 3ds max and
they're<00:01:29.430> pretty<00:01:30.000> much<00:01:30.180> how<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.390> how<00:01:31.110> you

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
they're pretty much how you how you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.890 
they're pretty much how you how you
visualize<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.979> 3d<00:01:32.280> scene<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:33.420> one<00:01:33.630> here<00:01:33.810> is

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
visualize the 3d scene this one here is

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.050 
visualize the 3d scene this one here is
set<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.770> its<00:01:34.979> pretty<00:01:35.189> much<00:01:35.340> how<00:01:35.640> your<00:01:35.880> eyes

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
set of its pretty much how your eyes

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.929 
set of its pretty much how your eyes
would<00:01:36.329> see<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> scene<00:01:36.810> as<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.310> um<00:01:38.310> yes<00:01:38.640> this

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
would see the scene as and um yes this

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.550 
would see the scene as and um yes this
is<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.299> you're<00:01:39.600> going<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.079> using<00:01:40.380> this

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
is the you're going to be using this

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.219 
is the you're going to be using this
viewport<00:01:41.189> for<00:01:42.150> majority<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.630> your<00:01:42.780> animations

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
viewport for majority of your animations

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.440 
viewport for majority of your animations
along<00:01:43.500> with<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> camera<00:01:44.189> viewport<00:01:44.640> which<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.360> do

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
along with a camera viewport which I do

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.230 
along with a camera viewport which I do
not<00:01:45.479> have<00:01:45.630> right<00:01:45.899> now<00:01:46.820> but<00:01:47.820> when<00:01:48.149> you're

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
not have right now but when you're

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.609 
not have right now but when you're
animating<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.930> you're<00:01:49.110> hardly<00:01:49.500> ever

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
animating you know you're hardly ever

in 3dsmax so my terminology is gonna be

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.820 
in 3dsmax so my terminology is gonna be
a<00:02:16.280> bit<00:02:16.459> off<00:02:16.840> but<00:02:17.840> in<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.110> end<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.290> hope<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.680> guys

this<00:02:26.300> is<00:02:26.390> parenting<00:02:26.750> tools<00:02:26.959> this<00:02:27.319> these<00:02:27.739> are

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
this is parenting tools this these are

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.710 
this is parenting tools this these are
these<00:02:28.069> select<00:02:28.370> tools<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.120> can<00:02:29.239> select<00:02:29.450> by

animation<00:02:51.230> you<00:02:51.349> hardly<00:02:51.709> ever<00:02:51.829> use<00:02:52.040> scale<00:02:52.310> if

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
animation you hardly ever use scale if

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.370 
animation you hardly ever use scale if
not<00:02:53.090> just<00:02:53.299> never<00:02:53.480> touched<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:53.989> thing<00:02:54.019> at<00:02:54.290> all

animation we try to export it into other

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.770 
animation we try to export it into other
games<00:02:58.250> it's<00:02:58.730> really<00:02:58.849> buggy<00:02:59.150> just<00:02:59.540> don't<00:02:59.660> touch

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
games it's really buggy just don't touch

be about the simple stuff now gonna talk
about<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.470> keyframes<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:20.090> course<00:03:20.389> you<00:03:20.510> had

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
about the keyframes of course you had

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.280 
about the keyframes of course you had
the<00:03:20.840> side<00:03:21.170> bar<00:03:21.380> which<00:03:22.130> is<00:03:22.160> all<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:23.290> object

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
the side bar which is all the object

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.680 
the side bar which is all the object
specific<00:03:24.980> controls<00:03:25.400> so<00:03:25.790> if<00:03:25.910> I<00:03:26.000> was<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.180> make<00:03:26.510> us

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
specific controls so if I was to make us

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.569 
specific controls so if I was to make us
fear<00:03:26.930> in<00:03:27.049> the<00:03:27.170> scene<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:28.010> will<00:03:28.130> give<00:03:28.280> me<00:03:28.430> the

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
fear in the scene it will give me the

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.129 
fear in the scene it will give me the
modify<00:03:28.940> options<00:03:29.120> for<00:03:29.480> it<00:03:29.599> along<00:03:29.810> with<00:03:30.019> the

modify options for it along with the

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.559 
modify options for it along with the
hierarchy<00:03:30.349> motion<00:03:31.220> whatever<00:03:31.489> stuff<00:03:32.180> I'm<00:03:32.450> not

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
hierarchy motion whatever stuff I'm not

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:33.879 
hierarchy motion whatever stuff I'm not
going<00:03:32.720> to<00:03:32.780> talk<00:03:32.840> about<00:03:33.079> that<00:03:33.230> it's<00:03:33.530> a<00:03:33.680> bit<00:03:33.859> too

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
going to talk about that it's a bit too

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.220 
going to talk about that it's a bit too

time<00:03:37.209> so<00:03:38.209> that<00:03:38.569> is<00:03:38.810> it<00:03:39.200> for<00:03:39.230> pretty<00:03:39.590> much<00:03:39.769> the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
time so that is it for pretty much the

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.180 
time so that is it for pretty much the
main<00:03:40.220> user<00:03:40.819> interface<00:03:40.910> it<00:03:41.540> is<00:03:41.569> a<00:03:41.690> bit<00:03:41.900> much<00:03:42.079> for

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
main user interface it is a bit much for

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.949 
main user interface it is a bit much for
beginning<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.280> look<00:03:43.459> at<00:03:43.609> but<00:03:44.359> eventually<00:03:44.599> you

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
beginning to look at but eventually you

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.830 
beginning to look at but eventually you
get<00:03:45.109> used<00:03:45.169> to<00:03:45.380> it<00:03:46.239> so<00:03:47.239> now<00:03:47.269> let's<00:03:47.599> talk<00:03:47.720> about

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
get used to it so now let's talk about

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.250 
get used to it so now let's talk about
the<00:03:48.169> viewport<00:03:49.040> setup<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.549> viewport<00:03:49.639> controls

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
the viewport setup and viewport controls

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.809 
the viewport setup and viewport controls
so<00:03:51.260> as<00:03:51.590> you<00:03:51.680> can<00:03:51.769> see<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.069> beginning<00:03:52.400> tutorial

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
so as you can see the beginning tutorial

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.610 
so as you can see the beginning tutorial
is<00:03:52.910> dragging<00:03:53.239> around<00:03:53.329> the<00:03:53.540> viewport<00:03:54.019> rotating

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
is dragging around the viewport rotating

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.710 
is dragging around the viewport rotating
around<00:03:54.739> of<00:03:55.099> it<00:03:55.190> you<00:03:55.579> know<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:56.150> zooming<00:03:56.480> in

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
around of it you know and the zooming in

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.440 
around of it you know and the zooming in
and<00:03:56.870> out<00:03:57.639> these<00:03:58.639> controls<00:03:59.060> can<00:03:59.120> be<00:03:59.299> easily

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
and out these controls can be easily

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.569 
and out these controls can be easily
accessed<00:03:59.840> using<00:04:00.680> a<00:04:00.889> three<00:04:01.130> button<00:04:01.340> Mouse

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
accessed using a three button Mouse

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.159 
accessed using a three button Mouse
along<00:04:02.030> with<00:04:02.269> your<00:04:02.359> keyboard<00:04:03.700> so<00:04:04.700> uh<00:04:04.989> to<00:04:05.989> zoom

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
along with your keyboard so uh to zoom

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.009 
along with your keyboard so uh to zoom
in<00:04:06.380> you<00:04:06.889> can<00:04:06.950> zoom<00:04:07.430> in<00:04:07.639> now<00:04:07.760> you<00:04:07.880> can<00:04:08.030> use<00:04:08.299> the

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
in you can zoom in now you can use the

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.129 
in you can zoom in now you can use the
scroll<00:04:09.620> scroll<00:04:10.400> bar<00:04:10.599> scroll<00:04:11.599> wheel<00:04:11.840> on<00:04:12.079> your

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
mouse by just scrolling in and out you

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.319 
mouse by just scrolling in and out you
can<00:04:14.810> hold<00:04:15.169> out<00:04:15.519> which<00:04:16.519> will<00:04:16.700> allow<00:04:17.120> you<00:04:17.180> to

scroll in zoom in a bit less another

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.080 
scroll in zoom in a bit less another
smaller<00:04:21.109> interval<00:04:21.590> or<00:04:21.950> you<00:04:22.430> can<00:04:22.550> hold<00:04:22.729> control

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
smaller interval or you can hold control

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.000 
smaller interval or you can hold control
what<00:04:23.870> shows<00:04:24.050> zoom<00:04:24.260> in<00:04:24.409> and<00:04:24.560> out<00:04:24.620> on<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:24.830> bigger

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
what shows zoom in and out on the bigger

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.120 
what shows zoom in and out on the bigger
interval

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
interval

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.300 
interval
so<00:04:26.910> again<00:04:27.090> that's<00:04:27.240> out<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:27.890> that's<00:04:28.890> with

so again that's out and that's with

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.360 
so again that's out and that's with
control<00:04:29.730> and<00:04:30.320> of<00:04:31.320> course<00:04:31.530> that's<00:04:31.740> just<00:04:31.800> the

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
control and of course that's just the

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.240 
control and of course that's just the
zoom<00:04:33.120> in<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:33.360> out<00:04:33.390> to<00:04:33.810> pan<00:04:34.140> through<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.980> scene

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
zoom in and out to pan through the scene

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.730 
zoom in and out to pan through the scene
you<00:04:35.640> hold<00:04:36.420> down<00:04:36.630> middle<00:04:37.080> mouse<00:04:37.230> button<00:04:37.260> and

mini curve editor but then I cannot see
my<00:05:28.920> track<00:05:29.190> view<00:05:29.400> and<00:05:29.610> I<00:05:30.060> want<00:05:30.180> to<00:05:30.330> see<00:05:30.540> both<00:05:30.750> of

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
my track view and I want to see both of

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.140 
my track view and I want to see both of
them<00:05:30.990> at<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.170> same<00:05:31.320> time<00:05:31.610> so<00:05:32.610> solution<00:05:33.030> to

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
them at the same time so solution to

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.880 
them at the same time so solution to
that<00:05:33.180> would<00:05:33.480> be<00:05:33.540> to<00:05:33.780> customize<00:05:34.650> these

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
that would be to customize these

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.100 
that would be to customize these
viewports<00:05:35.490> here<00:05:35.760> to<00:05:36.420> allow<00:05:36.630> me<00:05:36.840> to<00:05:36.930> put<00:05:37.080> a

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
viewports here to allow me to put a

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.650 
viewports here to allow me to put a
track<00:05:37.380> bar<00:05:37.530> at<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.800> bottom<00:05:38.390> along<00:05:39.390> with<00:05:39.450> a

I<00:05:44.550> go<00:05:44.700> ahead<00:05:44.820> and<00:05:44.910> close<00:05:45.180> this<00:05:45.330> mini<00:05:45.960> curve

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
I go ahead and close this mini curve

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.800 
I go ahead and close this mini curve
editor<00:05:46.320> and<00:05:46.880> let's<00:05:47.880> customize<00:05:48.060> these

here first right clicking left going to

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.600 
here first right clicking left going to
extend<00:06:18.270> the<00:06:18.420> viewports<00:06:19.020> going<00:06:19.410> to<00:06:19.620> track<00:06:20.310> view

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
extend the viewports going to track view

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.230 
extend the viewports going to track view
and<00:06:20.910> making<00:06:21.480> a<00:06:21.600> new<00:06:21.780> track<00:06:22.080> view<00:06:22.670> and<00:06:23.670> now<00:06:23.910> as

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
and making a new track view and now as

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.170 
and making a new track view and now as
you<00:06:24.390> can<00:06:24.480> see<00:06:24.540> this<00:06:24.900> brings<00:06:25.170> up<00:06:25.350> me<00:06:25.500> up<00:06:25.680> a<00:06:25.860> new

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
you can see this brings up me up a new

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.060 
you can see this brings up me up a new
curve<00:06:27.180> editor<00:06:27.360> here<00:06:27.810> I'm<00:06:28.050> just<00:06:28.710> gonna<00:06:28.860> bring

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
curve editor here I'm just gonna bring

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.890 
curve editor here I'm just gonna bring
that<00:06:29.190> down<00:06:29.520> a<00:06:29.580> bit<00:06:29.820> so<00:06:30.210> I<00:06:30.240> can<00:06:30.360> see<00:06:30.630> more<00:06:30.840> of

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
that down a bit so I can see more of

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.200 
that down a bit so I can see more of
these<00:06:31.080> two<00:06:31.290> windows

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
these two windows

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.330 
these two windows
as<00:06:33.330> you<00:06:33.479> can<00:06:33.600> see<00:06:33.750> you<00:06:33.840> have<00:06:33.870> the<00:06:34.530> track<00:06:35.100> view

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
as you can see you have the track view

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.760 
as you can see you have the track view
along<00:06:35.910> with<00:06:35.970> the<00:06:36.210> curve<00:06:36.690> editor<00:06:36.780> in<00:06:37.139> place<00:06:37.470> and

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
along with the curve editor in place and

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.320 
along with the curve editor in place and
this<00:06:38.220> is<00:06:38.280> really<00:06:38.610> useful<00:06:38.940> when<00:06:39.120> you're

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
this is really useful when you're

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.510 
this is really useful when you're
animating<00:06:39.720> I<00:06:40.020> won't<00:06:40.860> be<00:06:40.919> talking<00:06:41.069> about<00:06:41.250> the

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
animating I won't be talking about the

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.080 
animating I won't be talking about the
both<00:06:41.940> of<00:06:42.120> these<00:06:42.210> things<00:06:42.569> in<00:06:42.990> another<00:06:43.139> tutorial

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
both of these things in another tutorial

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.670 
both of these things in another tutorial
so<00:06:45.090> now<00:06:45.240> these<00:06:45.479> two<00:06:45.539> reports<00:06:45.810> here<00:06:46.229> at<00:06:46.319> most<00:06:46.500> at

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
so now these two reports here at most at

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.249 
so now these two reports here at most at
this<00:06:46.770> warrants<00:06:47.160> perspective<00:06:48.020> which<00:06:49.020> is<00:06:49.050> going

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 
this warrants perspective which is going

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.080 
this warrants perspective which is going
to<00:06:49.349> be<00:06:49.440> used<00:06:49.680> for<00:06:49.949> navigating<00:06:50.400> scene<00:06:50.789> and

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
to be used for navigating scene and

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.540 
to be used for navigating scene and
we'll<00:06:51.300> set<00:06:51.509> this<00:06:51.599> one<00:06:51.780> as<00:06:52.020> a<00:06:52.080> camera<00:06:52.560> which<00:06:53.220> I'm

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
we'll set this one as a camera which I'm

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.740 
we'll set this one as a camera which I'm
not<00:06:53.699> going<00:06:53.910> to<00:06:53.970> create<00:06:54.180> now<00:06:54.360> I'm<00:06:54.509> gonna

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
not going to create now I'm gonna

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.860 
not going to create now I'm gonna
explain<00:06:55.199> the<00:06:55.349> cameras<00:06:55.740> on<00:06:56.220> a<00:06:56.280> later<00:06:56.580> date<00:06:56.870> so

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
explain the cameras on a later date so

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.270 
explain the cameras on a later date so
I'm<00:06:58.139> mostly<00:06:58.199> this<00:06:58.410> one<00:06:58.560> it's<00:06:58.740> camera<00:06:59.130> by

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 
I'm mostly this one it's camera by

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.770 
I'm mostly this one it's camera by
pressing<00:06:59.310> C<00:06:59.789> but<00:07:00.120> I<00:07:00.150> don't<00:07:00.300> have<00:07:00.360> a<00:07:00.449> camera<00:07:00.660> in

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 
pressing C but I don't have a camera in

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.040 
pressing C but I don't have a camera in
scene<00:07:01.080> so<00:07:01.319> that's<00:07:01.500> not<00:07:01.620> gonna<00:07:01.770> work<00:07:02.900> so<00:07:03.900> that's

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
scene so that's not gonna work so that's

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.749 
scene so that's not gonna work so that's
pretty<00:07:04.199> much<00:07:04.289> the<00:07:04.410> setup<00:07:05.280> you're<00:07:05.400> gonna<00:07:05.520> have

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 
pretty much the setup you're gonna have

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:09.439 
pretty much the setup you're gonna have
for<00:07:06.150> your<00:07:06.660> app<00:07:06.990> for<00:07:07.320> animating<00:07:08.130> and<00:07:08.430> then<00:07:09.330> of

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:09.449 
for your app for animating and then of

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:11.540 
for your app for animating and then of
course<00:07:09.720> this<00:07:10.229> is<00:07:10.380> the<00:07:10.470> graphic<00:07:10.889> modeling<00:07:11.340> tool

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:11.550 
course this is the graphic modeling tool

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:12.770 
course this is the graphic modeling tool
bar<00:07:11.699> here<00:07:11.729> you're<00:07:12.090> not<00:07:12.180> gonna<00:07:12.330> be<00:07:12.509> needing
