00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
to take out a a pin it's not really a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.020 
to take out a a pin it's not really a
pin<00:00:33.510> but<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.989> clasping<00:00:35.420> circular<00:00:36.420> pin<00:00:38.030> and

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
pin but it's a clasping circular pin and

find it in here it's like this and that

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.420 
find it in here it's like this and that
pin<00:00:46.399> will<00:00:47.399> actually<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.210> here<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> top

bail out once you get the clutch bail
out<00:01:16.710> what<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.040> did<00:01:17.280> was<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.549> screwed<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.150> housing

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
out what I did was I screwed the housing

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.870 
out what I did was I screwed the housing
down<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> plywood<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:21.470> put<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.880> bail

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
down to a plywood and put the bail

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.960 
down to a plywood and put the bail
clutch<00:01:24.590> on<00:01:25.590> top<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.280> housing<00:01:26.490> right<00:01:26.759> there

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
clutch on top of the housing right there

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.569 
clutch on top of the housing right there
because<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.330> has<00:01:27.450> all<00:01:27.600> those<00:01:27.720> holes<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.290> just

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
because it has all those holes and just

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.039 
because it has all those holes and just
slip<00:01:29.579> some<00:01:29.850> Allen<00:01:30.630> wrenches<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.140> there<00:01:31.320> mm-hmm

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
slip some Allen wrenches in there mm-hmm

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.780 
slip some Allen wrenches in there mm-hmm
and<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.470> allen<00:01:34.770> wrench<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.100> because<00:01:35.460> they're

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
and the allen wrench is because they're

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.170 
and the allen wrench is because they're
hooked<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.200> they<00:01:37.380> can<00:01:37.970> cause<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> little

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
hooked like that they can cause a little

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.469 
hooked like that they can cause a little
more<00:01:39.390> catch<00:01:39.630> I'm<00:01:40.259> gonna<00:01:40.409> put<00:01:40.619> torque<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.070> it

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
more catch I'm gonna put torque on it

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.639 
more catch I'm gonna put torque on it
and<00:01:42.479> then<00:01:42.780> what<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.960> did<00:01:43.200> was<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.439> grabbed<00:01:43.710> a

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
and then what I did was I grabbed a

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.950 
and then what I did was I grabbed a
eight<00:01:46.649> inch<00:01:47.509> wrench<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:50.360> as<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.720> see

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
eight inch wrench and as you can see

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.959 
eight inch wrench and as you can see
maybe<00:01:52.470> not<00:01:53.509> as<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.689> can<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.079> grabbed<00:01:55.619> a

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
maybe not as you can see I grabbed a

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.389 
maybe not as you can see I grabbed a
sprocket<00:01:56.969> with<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> wrench<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:58.189> this<00:01:59.189> was

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
sprocket with a wrench and this was

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.649 
sprocket with a wrench and this was
actually<00:01:59.640> worked<00:01:59.969> better<00:02:00.180> than<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.450> vise

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
actually worked better than the vise

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.060 
actually worked better than the vise
grips<00:02:00.930> because<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.409> vise<00:02:01.560> grips<00:02:01.829> were

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
grips because the vise grips were

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.450 
grips because the vise grips were
tearing<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.610> up<00:02:02.790> whereas<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.390> could<00:02:03.630> grab<00:02:03.840> it

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
tearing it up whereas this could grab it

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.960 
tearing it up whereas this could grab it
right<00:02:05.460> on<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.060> what<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.420> did<00:02:06.630> was<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.899> just

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
right on and what I did was I just

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.790 
right on and what I did was I just
torqued<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.060> as<00:02:09.179> hard<00:02:09.360> as<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.569> could<00:02:09.800> without

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
torqued it as hard as I could without

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.820 
torqued it as hard as I could without
jerking<00:02:11.420> because<00:02:12.420> jerking<00:02:12.840> will<00:02:12.989> cause<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
jerking because jerking will cause the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.280 
jerking because jerking will cause the
clutch<00:02:14.130> bells<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.790> run<00:02:15.030> into<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.540> Allen

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
clutch bells to run into the Allen

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.070 
clutch bells to run into the Allen
wrenches<00:02:16.940> with<00:02:17.940> jolts<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.360> force<00:02:18.630> which<00:02:18.870> can

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
wrenches with jolts of force which can

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.240 
wrenches with jolts of force which can
cause<00:02:19.320> your<00:02:19.940> clutch<00:02:20.940> belt<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:21.360> get<00:02:22.040> dents<00:02:23.040> in

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
cause your clutch belt to get dents in

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.460 
cause your clutch belt to get dents in
there<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:24.060> get<00:02:24.210> kind<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.480> messed<00:02:24.690> up<00:02:24.870> which

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
there and get kind of messed up which

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.670 
there and get kind of messed up which
isn't<00:02:25.650> very<00:02:25.920> good<00:02:26.540> but<00:02:27.540> if<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:27.720> apply<00:02:28.650> a

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
isn't very good but if you apply a

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.220 
isn't very good but if you apply a
constant<00:02:29.130> torque<00:02:29.570> you'll<00:02:30.570> eventually<00:02:30.750> fill

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
constant torque you'll eventually fill

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.950 
constant torque you'll eventually fill
up<00:02:31.350> hole<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:32.070> will<00:02:32.220> slide<00:02:32.600> this<00:02:33.600> thing<00:02:33.810> will

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
up hole it will slide this thing will

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.690 
up hole it will slide this thing will
come<00:02:34.110> undone<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.680> then<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.130> unscrew<00:02:35.520> the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
come undone and then you can unscrew the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.060 
come undone and then you can unscrew the
rest<00:02:35.850> of<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.000> way<00:02:36.090> off<00:02:36.470> as<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.680> can<00:02:37.830> see<00:02:37.980> it

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
rest of the way off as you can see it

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.460 
rest of the way off as you can see it
just<00:02:38.100> screws<00:02:38.430> in<00:02:38.610> there<00:02:39.020> some<00:02:40.020> people<00:02:40.290> will

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
just screws in there some people will

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.570 
just screws in there some people will
claim<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.830> have<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.460> standard<00:02:43.040> hole<00:02:44.040> on<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.430> end

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
claim to have a standard hole on the end

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.250 
claim to have a standard hole on the end
of<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.820> inside<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.540> clutch<00:02:45.720> bail<00:02:45.960> but<00:02:46.080> mine

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
of it inside the clutch bail but mine

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.340 
of it inside the clutch bail but mine
didn't<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:47.360> so<00:02:48.360> from<00:02:48.600> there<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.840> can<00:02:49.170> take

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
didn't and so from there you can take

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:58.070 
didn't and so from there you can take
your<00:02:49.560> new<00:02:49.830> part<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:53.210> basically<00:02:56.810> just<00:02:57.810> screw

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
your new part and basically just screw

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.300

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
it back in there and tighten it up and

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.180 
it back in there and tighten it up and
you're<00:03:02.490> good<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.670> go<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:03.560> that's<00:03:04.560> how<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:04.890> get

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
you're good to go so that's how you get

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.390 
you're good to go so that's how you get
the<00:03:06.110> six<00:03:07.110> sprocket<00:03:07.590> out<00:03:07.710> of<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.390> engine
