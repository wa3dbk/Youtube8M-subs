00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Today we got a review 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.940
 special edition but then rider like 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.929
 see the box here outside the box it's 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.759
 an unusual 9 boxing so slightly swollen 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.889
 can be said and the reason for this is 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.020
 artbook which is inside but about him 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.760
 talk later and so box 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.980
 sustained in such gray tones 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.020
 such a lara is pretty pretty here 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.490
 I can cover this box 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.350
 somewhere on your shelf 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.849
 apartment and in general keep on me 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.480
 dressed in the lead roles she looks 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.980
 very spectacular we also note that 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.079
 some things here are a little bit 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.880
 bulging ie there is a name there raider 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.100
 for example, well, so a little bit stands on 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.530
 common box background and the same can be 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.960
 say about the screenshots that are 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.059
 behind and about these icons 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.480
 also such a little bit 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.950
 Generally it is unusual a little on the back 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.260
 side, in general, everything is standard 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.180
 lists the main features of the new 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.460
 the mechanics of the game that moisture man 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.800
 constantly fighting for their lives and also 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.710
 emphasis is placed on network mode which 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:08.780
 before the series as it was known was not 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:11.430
 let's open the box here 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.200
 opens in a somewhat unusual way 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.750
 as you can see you can not remove the cover 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.590
 completely and honestly we saw it 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.360
 for the first time we see an unusual solution 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.780
 some galleons 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.159
 17th century and it looks like it all 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.540
 very spectacular that is box in 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.430
 principle, you can put it like this 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.590
 way too in the apartment somewhere and 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.049
 create yourself such a nice one 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.610
 entourage 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.210
 pirate theme and so let's 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.680
 let's see what we have inside the first thing 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.060
 hands we have this card 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:48.149
 cass island map i mota it is sustained 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.030
 also such gray tones in general 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.020
 like the whole game and on it we see in 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.390
 In general, all the main 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.850
 attractions that we rather 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.040
 just have to visit in the game on on 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.210
 look at too gray hang on 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.250
 wall don't know we probably wouldn't 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.070
 advised but need to give 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.630
 developers should on the other part 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.479
 cards we have Lara 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.500
 and in general, this side in our opinion 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.050
 more preferred think 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:20.400
 and even eat and so on further on with us 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.260
 does not see the disc itself with the game on account 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.630
 need to say that the cover is different 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.850
 here lara more close to the waist 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.540
 here she is already full length and also 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.730
 different rear countries of this disc 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.440
 there are already some other screenshots and some 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.170
 another text although in principle the essence 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.780
 naturally the same 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.150
 so open it and what we see on the right 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.170
 actually gram itself that in general 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.380
 unsurprisingly and on the left we have a row so 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.150
 called supplementary materials and 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:58.209
 so let's see what we have here 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:00.280
 there is first this user guide 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.980
 the word is the standard for any editions 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.810
 here we have listed standard 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.239
 the size on which with the help of which 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.900
 you will play technical 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.239
 support 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.920
 phones there by which you can call 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.840
 in Moscow and say that the game you have not 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.560
 running a site where you can 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.450
 buy 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.180
 official souvenirs afterwards 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.769
 rider at the end advertising md video card 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.150
 as you know on the last episodes of these 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.070
 people out there just to be incredible 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.570
 going on with lara hair and in general 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.750
 call it pretty successful 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.480
 advertising move but this is short 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.040
 guide but too short in 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.380
 it is generally done simply to 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.360
 it was nothing special you are here 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.850
 find the following this we can see it 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.500
 edition but has two codes 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.350
 digital downloads with which you 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.209
 can download some materials 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.860
 the first one will allow you to load 10 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.950
 music tracks from soundtrack 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.360
 games written by jason graves he then 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.880
 is with this code you enter 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.390
 on the site and actually download yourself 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.630
 music and here is the next code in our opinion 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.989
 much more important already he will allow you 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.630
 download several weapons from the game 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.100
 hitman from 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.440
 need which as you know did the same 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.060
 developers but this weapon will be already 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.390
 network game lara 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.489
 and in theory we will have some for a 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.520
 compared to others with yours 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.350
 rivals and this cat is already at a glance 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.510
 much more important that is you will have 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.900
 advantage over players who 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.820
 bought an ordinary jewel box 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.570
 now let's go to the heart of this 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.370
 editions 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.810
 this artbook artbook 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.470
 see a little book in such a solid 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.900
 hardcover 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:46.300
 somewhat in such a non-standard size 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:50.720
 here we have Laurent magnet 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.940
 open it what we see need to say 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.550
 that the printing quality is on 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.830
 pretty high level ie watch 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.920
 on all of this or become quite enjoyable 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.900
 you get aesthetic pleasure on 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.900
 The first page here is a brief 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.390
 biography of Lara in English and here 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.420
 Next start just the pictures 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.980
 without any text and this is our view 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.690
 small puncture because if you 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:19.790
 Buy for example Ramon this mess 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:21.980
 There is no text, this is normal, but we buy 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.300
 rather looking at the beech then the ride wants 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.310
 some text you want some 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.160
 stories maybe something more about 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.230
 staff but unfortunately we donâ€™t have it 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.990
 here are just beautiful views of the sunken 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:36.820
 missing aircraft ships 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:39.380
 Lars with torch jungle in general 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.080
 beautiful views in general of all that 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.570
 what are we going to face in the game end here already 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.770
 the main character of the game begins or 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.800
 character with whom you will 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.529
 generally face pretty good and 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.199
 So 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:55.869
 let's talk about the main thing about the price of it 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:59.199
 the edition costs in Ukraine 300 hryvnias that in 

00:05:55.869 --> 00:06:01.479
 In general, it is quite a lot to buy it. 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:03.009
 whether or not we advise you will not you 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.839
 have to figure it out yourself in 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:07.529
 depending on your salary, we believe 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:10.779
 that is a little over priced though 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:11.909
 Note that this artbook is very 

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:14.439
 cool thing 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:17.499
 note the original box which 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:19.439
 such an option you honestly 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:21.639
 saying see for the first time repeat 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:25.539
 also you can hang on the wall 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:27.579
 poster that is important and also note 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:29.319
 codes for network weapon download for 

00:06:27.579 --> 00:06:31.149
 lovers play network modes this 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:34.840
 really very very cool overall 

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:38.760
 the building has all the attributes 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:41.500
 for the title of good such here 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:45.010
 well balanced powerful edition 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.660
 so decide whether you need it or not 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.790
 or it may be worth buying a jewel box for 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.060
 150 hryvnia well, meet you 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.060
 g
