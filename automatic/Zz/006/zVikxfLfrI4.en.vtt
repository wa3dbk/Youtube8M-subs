00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
pickaxes everything scroll down to look

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.899 
pickaxes everything scroll down to look
at<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.770> other<00:01:31.890> items<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.310> can<00:01:32.430> make<00:01:32.610> and

at the other items that you can make and
it<00:01:33.720> tells<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.079> exactly<00:01:34.200> how<00:01:34.680> much<00:01:34.890> material

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
it tells you exactly how much material

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.640 
it tells you exactly how much material
you're<00:01:35.549> going<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.909> use<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.630> five<00:01:37.259> min<00:01:37.530> to

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
you're going to use this so five min to

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.890 
you're going to use this so five min to
build<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.979> rail<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.090> use<00:01:39.210> six<00:01:39.540> iron

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
build a rail it's going to use six iron

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.389 
build a rail it's going to use six iron
and<00:01:40.259> one<00:01:40.650> stick<00:01:41.180> so<00:01:42.860> this<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.009> probably<00:01:44.250> for

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
and one stick so this is probably for

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.030 
and one stick so this is probably for
