00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.480 

okay<00:00:04.290> so<00:00:04.350> before<00:00:04.589> we<00:00:04.859> get<00:00:04.950> into<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.279> schematic

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
okay so before we get into the schematic

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.810 
okay so before we get into the schematic
diagrams<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:07.490> tracing<00:00:08.490> through<00:00:08.670> the

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
diagrams and tracing through the

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.700 
diagrams and tracing through the
different<00:00:09.150> cycles<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.750> freeze<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.320> defrost

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
different cycles of freeze and defrost

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.740 
different cycles of freeze and defrost
you<00:00:11.490> need<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.730> understand<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.389> little<00:00:12.509> bit<00:00:12.690> more

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
you need to understand a little bit more

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.570 
you need to understand a little bit more
about<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.200> defrost<00:00:13.679> termination<00:00:14.400> and

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
about the defrost termination and

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.970 
about the defrost termination and
Vandelay<00:00:15.150> relay<00:00:15.660> what<00:00:16.440> this<00:00:16.680> sensor<00:00:17.160> does<00:00:17.430> is

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
Vandelay relay what this sensor does is

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.790 
Vandelay relay what this sensor does is
senses<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.130> coil<00:00:20.340> temperature<00:00:20.609> when<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:21.119> in

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
senses the coil temperature when it's in

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.679 
senses the coil temperature when it's in
defrost<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.160> once<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.090> coil<00:00:24.269> temperature

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
defrost and once the coil temperature

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.550 
defrost and once the coil temperature
gets<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.080> point<00:00:25.320> where<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:27.720> ice<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:27.900> melted

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
gets to a point where the ice is melted

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.669 
gets to a point where the ice is melted
in<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.769> temperature<00:00:29.220> hits<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.939> certain<00:00:30.269> point

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
in the temperature hits a certain point

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.620 
in the temperature hits a certain point
it<00:00:31.679> will<00:00:31.949> terminate<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.820> defrost<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.510> and

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
it will terminate the defrost and and

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.690 
it will terminate the defrost and and
and<00:00:34.200> kick<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.100> back<00:00:35.219> into<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.610> freezer<00:00:35.880> and

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
and kick it back into the freezer and

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.360 
and kick it back into the freezer and
the<00:00:38.700> other<00:00:38.820> thing<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.329> does<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:40.129> once<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the other thing that it does is once the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.360 
the other thing that it does is once the
coil<00:00:42.000> gets<00:00:42.180> defrosted<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:42.960> rather<00:00:43.140> warm<00:00:43.469> so

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
coil gets defrosted it's rather warm so

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.340 
coil gets defrosted it's rather warm so
it<00:00:44.520> delays<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.180> fans<00:00:45.420> coming<00:00:45.750> back<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.170> until

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
it delays the fans coming back on until

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.979 
it delays the fans coming back on until
the<00:00:46.559> coil<00:00:46.739> temperature<00:00:47.219> drops<00:00:47.579> down<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.480> that

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the coil temperature drops down so that

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.740 
the coil temperature drops down so that
when<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> fans<00:00:49.379> come<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.800> were<00:00:49.980> blowing<00:00:50.750> cold

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
when the fans come on were blowing cold

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.500 
when the fans come on were blowing cold
air<00:00:51.989> into<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.500> box<00:00:52.800> rather<00:00:53.190> than<00:00:53.550> blowing<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
air into the box rather than blowing the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.630 
air into the box rather than blowing the
warm<00:00:54.719> air<00:00:54.960> off<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.500> freshly<00:00:55.890> defrosted

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
warm air off of that freshly defrosted

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.119 
warm air off of that freshly defrosted
coil<00:00:57.170> so<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.289> pretty<00:00:58.410> interesting<00:00:58.530> how<00:00:58.980> it

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
coil so it's pretty interesting how it

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.119 
coil so it's pretty interesting how it
works<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.520> that's<00:00:59.609> pretty<00:00:59.850> simple<00:01:00.120> actually

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
works and that's pretty simple actually

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.509 
works and that's pretty simple actually
the<00:01:02.129> one<00:01:02.280> thing<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:03.270> note<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:04.519> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the one thing to note is that the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.820 
the one thing to note is that the
defrost<00:01:06.000> termination<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.020> fan<00:01:07.200> delay<00:01:07.500> is

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
defrost termination the fan delay is

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.190 
defrost termination the fan delay is
controlled<00:01:08.280> by<00:01:08.369> break<00:01:09.240> making<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.840> breaking

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
controlled by break making and breaking

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.620 
controlled by break making and breaking
the<00:01:10.380> neutral<00:01:10.770> wire<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:12.299> defrost

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the neutral wire to the defrost

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.200 
the neutral wire to the defrost
termination<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> fans<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.060> red

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
termination and to the fans so the red

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.109 
termination and to the fans so the red
wire<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.810> neutral<00:01:16.310> from<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.610> power

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
wire is the neutral from the power

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.429 
wire is the neutral from the power
connection<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> front<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.170> defrost

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
connection on the front of the defrost

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.780 
connection on the front of the defrost
timer<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:21.320> when<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.830> temperature<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.400> above

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790

55 degrees

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.640 
55 degrees
the<00:01:27.060> connection<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.689> made<00:01:27.720> between<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.380> red

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the connection is made between the red

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.649 
the connection is made between the red
and<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.920> brown<00:01:29.040> wire<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:29.820> supply<00:01:30.630> a

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
and the brown wire so we supply a

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.499 
and the brown wire so we supply a
neutral<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> defrost<00:01:32.549> termination<00:01:33.360> on

neutral to the defrost termination on

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.140 
neutral to the defrost termination on
the<00:01:36.020> defrost<00:01:37.020> timer<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.759> will<00:01:38.909> kick

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
the defrost timer and that it will kick

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.280 
the defrost timer and that it will kick
the<00:01:39.770> system<00:01:40.770> out<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:40.950> defrost<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:42.509> one<00:01:43.170> is

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
the system out of defrost the one is

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.420 
the system out of defrost the one is
below<00:01:43.590> 25<00:01:44.070> degrees<00:01:44.810> Brown<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.049> open<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.619> then

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
below 25 degrees Brown is open and then

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.550 
below 25 degrees Brown is open and then
the<00:01:48.390> connection<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.869> made<00:01:48.899> between<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
the connection is made between the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.590 
the connection is made between the
neutral<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.250> black<00:01:51.090> which<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
neutral and the black which is the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.499 
neutral and the black which is the
neutral<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.290> fans<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:54.390> freezer<00:01:55.430> so

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
neutral to the fans in in the freezer so

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.399 
neutral to the fans in in the freezer so
this<00:01:57.509> will<00:01:57.750> kick<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:59.299> fans<00:02:00.299> back<00:02:00.899> on<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.320> the
