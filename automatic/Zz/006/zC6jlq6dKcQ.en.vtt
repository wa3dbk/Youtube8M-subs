00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
more than my previous bikes i think i

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:03.390 
more than my previous bikes i think i
was<00:02:55.790> maxing<00:02:56.450> about<00:02:56.900> 40<00:02:57.890> 42<00:02:58.730> on<00:02:59.739> my<00:03:00.739> last<00:03:01.340> bike

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
was maxing about 40 42 on my last bike

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.670 
was maxing about 40 42 on my last bike
performance<00:03:04.400> is<00:03:04.730> absolutely<00:03:05.030> amazing<00:03:05.870> it

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
performance is absolutely amazing it

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:15.069 
performance is absolutely amazing it
handles<00:03:07.160> really<00:03:07.599> well<00:03:08.599> and<00:03:13.450> it<00:03:14.450> gives<00:03:14.840> me<00:03:15.049> a

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
handles really well and it gives me a

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.140 
handles really well and it gives me a
huge<00:03:15.680> amount<00:03:16.040> of<00:03:16.099> confidence<00:03:16.370> on<00:03:16.849> the<00:03:16.970> road

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
huge amount of confidence on the road

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.539 
huge amount of confidence on the road
especially<00:03:18.019> in<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.530> wet<00:03:18.739> actually<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:19.489> I

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
especially in the wet actually and I

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.910 
especially in the wet actually and I
think<00:03:19.790> that's<00:03:20.030> partially<00:03:20.420> down<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.260> the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
think that's partially down to the the
