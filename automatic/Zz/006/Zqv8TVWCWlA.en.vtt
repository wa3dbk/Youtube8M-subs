in the middle and it's not just gonna

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.580 
in the middle and it's not just gonna
take<00:01:09.180> off<00:01:09.420> exactly<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> way<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.140> want<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.530> I

emotion even if it's not completely real
it<00:01:24.299> doesn't<00:01:24.540> need<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.750> be<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.900> promise<00:01:25.530> but<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.100> am

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340

my happiest when I feel like things are

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.749 
my happiest when I feel like things are
going<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.650> picking<00:01:28.799> up<00:01:29.040> speed<00:01:29.189> even<00:01:29.520> if<00:01:29.640> it's

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
going and picking up speed even if it's

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.429 
going and picking up speed even if it's
just<00:01:29.820> conversations<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.720> just<00:01:30.900> keeps<00:01:31.290> me

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
just conversations it just keeps me

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.100 
just conversations it just keeps me
floating<00:01:32.100> along<00:01:32.460> confident<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.869> there's<00:01:34.020> a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
floating along confident so there's a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.440 
floating along confident so there's a
lot<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.680> frustration<00:01:35.090> when<00:01:36.090> things<00:01:36.329> just

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
lot of frustration when things just

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.240 
lot of frustration when things just
weren't<00:01:36.780> really<00:01:37.170> moving<00:01:37.380> there<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.890> when<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
weren't really moving there and when the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.100 
weren't really moving there and when the

day by day stuff was taking priority
over<00:01:40.650> long-term<00:01:40.860> stuff<00:01:41.430> because<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.700> had<00:01:41.880> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
over long-term stuff because it had to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.880 
over long-term stuff because it had to
and<00:01:42.360> then<00:01:42.540> when<00:01:43.049> things<00:01:43.290> would<00:01:43.500> come<00:01:43.710> up<00:01:43.860> that

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and then when things would come up that

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.160 
and then when things would come up that
involve<00:01:44.310> money<00:01:44.610> or<00:01:44.850> whatever<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.020> just

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
involve money or whatever that I just

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.300 
involve money or whatever that I just
wasn't<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.649> position<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.189> say<00:01:47.369> no

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
wasn't in a position to say no

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.940 
wasn't in a position to say no
and<00:01:48.790> I've<00:01:49.180> never<00:01:49.450> liked<00:01:49.960> school<00:01:50.380> like<00:01:50.740> ever

but at least with school there's there's

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.750 
but at least with school there's there's
this<00:01:53.140> sense<00:01:53.470> of<00:01:53.650> momentum<00:01:54.250> that<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.520> can't

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
part of of breaking that loop of ending

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.390

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
nearly an immediate effect because it

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.410 
nearly an immediate effect because it
just<00:02:45.370> isn't<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:45.850> never<00:02:46.000> will<00:02:46.209> be

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
just isn't it never will be

and<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:47.170> human<00:02:47.470> brain<00:02:47.680> is<00:02:47.980> like<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.340> very

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
and the human brain is like a very

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.560 
and the human brain is like a very
actual<00:02:49.720> nightmare<00:02:50.560> but<00:02:51.100> it's<00:02:51.250> also<00:02:51.570> because

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
actual nightmare but it's also because

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.430 
actual nightmare but it's also because
it<00:02:52.780> will<00:02:53.170> catch<00:02:53.470> up<00:02:54.660> so<00:02:55.660> we<00:02:55.750> decided<00:02:56.079> to<00:02:56.200> move

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
it will catch up so we decided to move

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.930 
it will catch up so we decided to move
and<00:02:56.860> not<00:02:57.070> because<00:02:57.370> it's<00:02:57.519> gonna<00:02:57.640> fix

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
and not because it's gonna fix

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.340
