crap there are many ways of approaching

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.650 
crap there are many ways of approaching
a<00:00:22.650> drawing<00:00:23.160> I'm<00:00:23.369> going<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.760> do<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.240> around

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
a drawing I'm going to do so around

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.160 
a drawing I'm going to do so around
scribbly<00:00:25.699> shapes<00:00:26.699> here<00:00:27.060> just<00:00:27.359> really<00:00:27.900> really

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
scribbly shapes here just really really

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.040 
scribbly shapes here just really really
roughly<00:00:28.740> working<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.970> shape<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.720> crab

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
roughly working in the shape of the crab

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.470 
roughly working in the shape of the crab
and<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.340> one<00:00:32.550> way<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.759> starting<00:00:33.239> a

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
and this is one way of starting a

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.560 
and this is one way of starting a
drawing<00:00:33.989> just<00:00:34.610> yeah<00:00:35.610> then<00:00:35.969> we<00:00:36.090> should<00:00:36.270> start

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
drawing just yeah then we should start

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.340 
drawing just yeah then we should start
refining<00:00:37.140> these<00:00:38.660> it's<00:00:39.660> gonna<00:00:39.809> be<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.989> claw

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
refining these it's gonna be a claw

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.750 
refining these it's gonna be a claw
there<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.040> claw<00:00:41.340> here<00:00:43.040> this<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.190> based<00:00:44.489> on

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
there and a claw here this is based on

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.750 
there and a claw here this is based on
the<00:00:44.910> crab<00:00:45.600> our<00:00:45.780> sketching<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.620> other<00:00:46.770> day<00:00:49.760> you

the crab our sketching the other day you
see<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.120> pincers<00:00:51.539> are<00:00:51.690> starting<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.110> come<00:00:52.260> in

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
see that pincers are starting to come in

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.260 
see that pincers are starting to come in
place<00:00:52.649> there<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:52.949> claws<00:00:55.190> now<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.610> here<00:00:57.030> my

the great thing about having a

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.580 
the great thing about having a
three-dimensional<00:01:33.540> object<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.110> can<00:01:34.290> turn

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
three-dimensional object is you can turn

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.520 
three-dimensional object is you can turn
it<00:01:34.890> turn<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.850> around<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.600> see<00:01:37.320> what's

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
it turn it around and so see what's

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.310 
it turn it around and so see what's
behind<00:01:37.710> things<00:01:38.360> gives<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> better<00:01:39.720> idea<00:01:39.840> of

behind things gives you a better idea of

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.380 
behind things gives you a better idea of
the<00:01:40.619> overall<00:01:41.159> shape<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.030> animal<00:01:44.180> so<00:01:45.180> this

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the overall shape of the animal so this

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.870 
the overall shape of the animal so this
is<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> drawing<00:01:46.200> I'm<00:01:46.979> going<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.399> try<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.759> do<00:01:47.850> a

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
is a drawing I'm going to try and do a

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.060 
is a drawing I'm going to try and do a
realistic<00:01:48.240> drawing<00:01:48.869> without<00:01:49.140> using<00:01:49.590> photos

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
realistic drawing without using photos

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.960 
realistic drawing without using photos
and<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:52.350> claws<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:53.340> crab<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
and the claws of this crab is the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.569 
and the claws of this crab is the
feature<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:55.170> I'm<00:01:55.259> making<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.649> big<00:01:55.799> feature<00:01:56.130> out

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
feature so I'm making a big feature out

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.469 
feature so I'm making a big feature out
of<00:01:56.759> these<00:01:56.880> claws<00:01:57.680> and<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.860> here<00:01:59.399> this<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.329> a

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
of these claws and in here this is a

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.700 
of these claws and in here this is a
fleshy<00:02:01.170> piece<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.159> muscle<00:02:02.430> inside<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:04.140> insula

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
fleshy piece of muscle inside the insula

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.709 
fleshy piece of muscle inside the insula
just<00:02:05.040> inside<00:02:05.369> each<00:02:05.520> claw<00:02:05.880> which<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.540> also

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
just inside each claw which I also

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.419 
just inside each claw which I also
noticed<00:02:07.350> when<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.530> was<00:02:07.649> sketching<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.310> other

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
noticed when I was sketching the other

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.540 
noticed when I was sketching the other
day

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
day

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.369 
day
so<00:02:11.550> through<00:02:11.819> sketch<00:02:12.120> pads<00:02:12.480> through<00:02:12.870> bits<00:02:13.140> and

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
so through sketch pads through bits and

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.850 
so through sketch pads through bits and
pieces

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
pieces

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.310 
pieces
that<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.100> find<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.910> can<00:02:15.510> make<00:02:15.690> up<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:16.020> drawing

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
that I find I can make up a drawing

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.360 
that I find I can make up a drawing
without<00:02:16.550> having<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.670> rely<00:02:17.820> on<00:02:18.000> photos<00:02:19.370> this

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
without having to rely on photos this

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.460 
without having to rely on photos this
here's<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.700> big<00:02:20.940> teardrop<00:02:21.600> shape<00:02:21.930> there<00:02:22.400> and

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
here's a big teardrop shape there and

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.930 
here's a big teardrop shape there and
there's<00:02:25.470> another<00:02:25.530> little<00:02:26.040> teardrop<00:02:26.400> shape

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
there's another little teardrop shape

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.570 
there's another little teardrop shape
here

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.820 

yeah<00:02:33.180> doing<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.930> underside<00:02:34.620> here<00:02:36.680> this<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:37.800> a

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
yeah doing the underside here this is a

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.790 
yeah doing the underside here this is a
boy<00:02:38.130> crab<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:39.140> it's<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.230> little<00:02:40.470> bit<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.710> a

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
boy crab so it's a little bit of a

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:49.140 
boy crab so it's a little bit of a
narrow<00:02:41.210> plate<00:02:42.210> there

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.620 

next<00:02:50.150> without<00:02:50.360> put<00:02:50.810> some<00:02:51.260> sockets<00:02:51.800> here<00:02:52.630> where

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
next without put some sockets here where

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.350 
next without put some sockets here where
the<00:02:53.750> legs<00:02:53.990> come<00:02:54.320> out<00:02:54.470> of<00:02:54.910> very<00:02:55.910> much<00:02:56.090> like<00:02:56.330> a

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
the legs come out of very much like a

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.950 
the legs come out of very much like a
spider<00:02:57.130> spiders<00:02:58.130> are<00:02:58.400> so<00:02:58.850> similar<00:02:59.570> to<00:02:59.810> these

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
spider spiders are so similar to these

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.000 
spider spiders are so similar to these
guys<00:03:00.320> Oh<00:03:00.760> quite<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:01.790> lot<00:03:02.000> of<00:03:02.260> arthropods<00:03:03.260> are

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
guys Oh quite a lot of arthropods are

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.990 
guys Oh quite a lot of arthropods are
like<00:03:04.280> this<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:06.650> crow<00:03:06.920> I<00:03:06.950> was<00:03:07.310> looking<00:03:07.640> at<00:03:07.700> only

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
like this the crow I was looking at only

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.130 
like this the crow I was looking at only
had<00:03:08.150> three<00:03:08.510> legs

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
had three legs

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.700 
had three legs
it's<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.160> tripod<00:03:10.730> crab<00:03:11.300> but<00:03:12.290> I'm<00:03:12.380> going<00:03:12.560> to

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
it's a tripod crab but I'm going to

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.760 
it's a tripod crab but I'm going to
stick<00:03:12.920> a<00:03:13.010> couple<00:03:13.340> more<00:03:13.490> legs<00:03:13.940> into<00:03:14.300> this

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
stick a couple more legs into this

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.640

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
can still use your imagination a little

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.060 
can still use your imagination a little
bit<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:35.480> there<00:03:35.660> are<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.900> three<00:03:36.170> legs<00:03:36.440> that<00:03:36.770> the

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
bit so there are the three legs that the

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.580 
bit so there are the three legs that the
crab<00:03:37.310> did<00:03:37.550> have<00:03:37.790> now<00:03:38.210> I'm<00:03:38.360> just<00:03:38.540> going<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:39.170> just

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
crab did have now I'm just going to just

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.390 
crab did have now I'm just going to just
throw<00:03:39.740> in<00:03:40.160> a<00:03:40.400> couple<00:03:40.670> of<00:03:40.790> extra<00:03:40.970> ones<00:03:42.400> so

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
throw in a couple of extra ones so

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.970 
throw in a couple of extra ones so
guessing<00:03:44.030> I<00:03:44.330> have<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.570> fairly<00:03:44.900> good<00:03:45.020> idea

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.520 

now<00:03:48.980> I'm<00:03:49.100> sketching<00:03:49.340> in<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.880> eye<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.530> I

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
now I'm sketching in the eye and I

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.310 
now I'm sketching in the eye and I
usually<00:03:51.980> like<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.580> do<00:03:52.730> this<00:03:52.940> first<00:03:53.270> animal<00:03:54.260> I

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
usually like to do this first animal I

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.800 
usually like to do this first animal I
usually<00:03:54.680> put<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:54.980> detail<00:03:55.459> in<00:03:55.910> on<00:03:56.270> the<00:03:56.780> eye

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
usually put the detail in on the eye

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.020 
usually put the detail in on the eye
first<00:03:57.320> because<00:03:57.860> if<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.130> eye<00:03:58.220> doesn't<00:03:58.640> work<00:03:58.790> I

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
first because if the eye doesn't work I

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.310 
first because if the eye doesn't work I
should<00:03:59.209> screw<00:03:59.450> up<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.660> piece<00:03:59.810> of<00:03:59.930> paper<00:04:00.080> and

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
should screw up the piece of paper and

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.150 
should screw up the piece of paper and
start<00:04:00.440> again

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
start again

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.060 
start again
but<00:04:02.120> once<00:04:02.330> the<00:04:02.510> eye<00:04:02.540> is<00:04:02.720> okay<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:03.709> gives<00:04:03.830> me

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
but once the eye is okay that gives me

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.180 
but once the eye is okay that gives me
the<00:04:04.190> confidence<00:04:04.520> to<00:04:05.030> move<00:04:05.420> on<00:04:05.690> and<00:04:05.980> just<00:04:06.980> add

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
the confidence to move on and just add

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.890 
the confidence to move on and just add
in<00:04:07.490> details<00:04:08.000> here<00:04:08.450> and<00:04:08.480> there<00:04:09.370> in<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:11.510> case<00:04:11.720> of

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
in details here and there in the case of

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.390 
in details here and there in the case of
this<00:04:12.050> one<00:04:12.230> I'd<00:04:12.350> want<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.620> know<00:04:12.709> that<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.190> eyes

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
this one I'd want to know that the eyes

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.030 
this one I'd want to know that the eyes
and<00:04:13.850> the<00:04:14.090> claws<00:04:14.270> are<00:04:14.780> right<00:04:14.990> after<00:04:15.350> that<00:04:15.830> you

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
and the claws are right after that you

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.720 
and the claws are right after that you
can<00:04:16.190> almost<00:04:17.380> guess<00:04:18.380> everything<00:04:18.890> else<00:04:19.070> fake<00:04:19.549> it

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
can almost guess everything else fake it

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.770 
can almost guess everything else fake it
almost

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.440 

gonna<00:04:24.650> found<00:04:24.980> little<00:04:25.490> bits<00:04:25.730> and<00:04:25.940> pieces<00:04:26.000> of

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
gonna found little bits and pieces of

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.410 
gonna found little bits and pieces of
crab<00:04:26.960> on<00:04:27.230> the<00:04:27.740> beach<00:04:27.950> which<00:04:28.580> certainly<00:04:29.180> is<00:04:29.389> a

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
crab on the beach which certainly is a

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:35.620 
crab on the beach which certainly is a
great<00:04:29.870> help<00:04:30.410> when<00:04:31.120> sketching<00:04:32.120> now<00:04:34.630> showing

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
great help when sketching now showing

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.879 
great help when sketching now showing
these<00:04:35.810> plates<00:04:36.200> under<00:04:36.560> here<00:04:36.860> if<00:04:37.010> you<00:04:37.160> notice<00:04:37.460> I

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
these plates under here if you notice I

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.320 
these plates under here if you notice I
am<00:04:39.889> leaving<00:04:40.370> it<00:04:40.460> a<00:04:40.520> little<00:04:40.820> bit<00:04:40.970> of<00:04:41.090> light<00:04:41.360> so

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
am leaving it a little bit of light so

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.510 
am leaving it a little bit of light so
I'm<00:04:44.330> darkening<00:04:45.139> in<00:04:45.560> probably<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.160> bottom

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
I'm darkening in probably the bottom

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.120 
I'm darkening in probably the bottom
left-hand<00:04:46.820> sides<00:04:47.210> being<00:04:47.510> darkened<00:04:47.990> in<00:04:48.260> and

it's<00:04:56.300> just<00:04:56.480> a<00:04:56.660> technique<00:04:57.470> that<00:04:57.950> I've<00:04:58.340> picked

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
it's just a technique that I've picked

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.590 
it's just a technique that I've picked
up<00:04:58.970> over<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.270> years<00:05:00.340> I'm<00:05:01.340> cross<00:05:01.640> hatching<00:05:02.180> and

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
up over the years I'm cross hatching and

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.750 
up over the years I'm cross hatching and
doing<00:05:03.020> dots<00:05:03.380> and<00:05:03.620> dimples<00:05:04.010> with<00:05:04.430> it

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
doing dots and dimples with it

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.470 
doing dots and dimples with it
I<00:05:04.790> don't<00:05:05.419> like<00:05:05.660> smooth<00:05:06.230> smudging<00:05:07.040> out<00:05:07.360> sort<00:05:08.360> of

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
I don't like smooth smudging out sort of

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.530 
I don't like smooth smudging out sort of
shade<00:05:08.810> some<00:05:09.200> people<00:05:09.500> do<00:05:09.710> I<00:05:09.950> like<00:05:10.910> to<00:05:11.090> see<00:05:11.330> that

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
shade some people do I like to see that

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.860 
shade some people do I like to see that
it's<00:05:11.690> actually<00:05:11.810> a<00:05:12.020> pencil<00:05:12.590> drawing<00:05:13.450> so<00:05:14.450> if<00:05:14.750> it

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
it's actually a pencil drawing so if it

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.170 
it's actually a pencil drawing so if it
looks<00:05:15.020> a<00:05:15.110> bit<00:05:15.140> rough<00:05:15.530> it<00:05:16.100> looks<00:05:16.310> like<00:05:16.970> it's

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
looks a bit rough it looks like it's

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.719 
looks a bit rough it looks like it's
being<00:05:17.450> done<00:05:17.720> by<00:05:18.080> a<00:05:18.110> pencil<00:05:18.919> it<00:05:19.400> doesn't<00:05:19.640> look

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
being done by a pencil it doesn't look

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.310 
being done by a pencil it doesn't look
like<00:05:19.790> a<00:05:19.910> photograph<00:05:20.540> it<00:05:20.900> doesn't<00:05:21.169> look<00:05:21.260> like

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
like a photograph it doesn't look like

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.469 
like a photograph it doesn't look like
it's<00:05:21.590> being<00:05:21.770> produced<00:05:22.070> by<00:05:22.430> a<00:05:22.460> computer<00:05:22.880> it

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
it's being produced by a computer it

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:24.640 
it's being produced by a computer it
looks<00:05:23.720> like<00:05:23.930> if<00:05:24.110> somebody's<00:05:24.470> actually

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
looks like if somebody's actually

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.860 
looks like if somebody's actually
physically<00:05:25.340> drawing<00:05:25.639> this<00:05:25.880> and<00:05:26.090> that's<00:05:26.660> the

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
physically drawing this and that's the

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.680 
physically drawing this and that's the
look<00:05:27.080> I'm<00:05:27.320> going<00:05:27.350> for

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
look I'm going for

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.290 
look I'm going for
so<00:05:29.690> these<00:05:29.870> claws<00:05:30.350> more<00:05:31.160> detail<00:05:31.640> on<00:05:31.669> the<00:05:32.000> claws

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
so these claws more detail on the claws

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.960 
so these claws more detail on the claws
as<00:05:32.600> I<00:05:32.750> say<00:05:32.960> these<00:05:33.290> are<00:05:33.680> the<00:05:34.040> feature<00:05:34.520> of<00:05:34.729> this

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
as I say these are the feature of this

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.110 
as I say these are the feature of this
guy<00:05:35.350> so<00:05:36.350> I'm<00:05:36.560> making<00:05:36.830> sure<00:05:37.310> that<00:05:37.640> the<00:05:37.820> claws

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
guy so I'm making sure that the claws

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.690 
guy so I'm making sure that the claws
really<00:05:38.870> stand<00:05:39.169> out<00:05:39.440> from<00:05:39.919> the<00:05:40.070> rest<00:05:40.250> of<00:05:40.520> the

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
really stand out from the rest of the

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.900 
really stand out from the rest of the
crabbit<00:05:41.530> just<00:05:42.530> here<00:05:42.890> I'm<00:05:42.979> shading<00:05:43.340> a<00:05:43.640> little

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
crabbit just here I'm shading a little

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.750 
crabbit just here I'm shading a little
bit<00:05:44.060> more<00:05:44.360> to<00:05:45.289> make<00:05:45.500> that<00:05:45.800> foot<00:05:46.160> that's<00:05:46.430> coming

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
bit more to make that foot that's coming

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.370 
bit more to make that foot that's coming
out<00:05:46.880> in<00:05:47.000> front<00:05:47.210> of<00:05:47.360> the<00:05:47.419> floor<00:05:47.690> to<00:05:47.720> stand<00:05:48.110> out<00:05:48.350> a

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
out in front of the floor to stand out a

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.920 
out in front of the floor to stand out a
little<00:05:48.620> bit<00:05:48.740> as<00:05:48.979> well<00:05:49.570> sometimes<00:05:50.570> in<00:05:50.810> the

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
little bit as well sometimes in the

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.640 
little bit as well sometimes in the
shading<00:05:51.440> if<00:05:52.400> you<00:05:52.610> do<00:05:52.820> it<00:05:53.030> like<00:05:53.990> only<00:05:54.260> even

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
shading if you do it like only even

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.460 
shading if you do it like only even
rough<00:05:54.950> lines<00:05:55.340> it<00:05:55.760> sort<00:05:56.030> of<00:05:56.120> makes<00:05:56.600> you<00:05:56.900> feel

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
rough lines it sort of makes you feel

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.550 
rough lines it sort of makes you feel
that<00:05:57.860> this<00:05:58.039> object<00:05:58.520> has<00:05:59.300> a<00:05:59.360> bit<00:05:59.810> of<00:05:59.930> a<00:05:59.990> texture

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
that this object has a bit of a texture

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.440 
that this object has a bit of a texture
like<00:06:00.880> a<00:06:01.880> rock<00:06:02.860> so<00:06:03.860> making<00:06:04.400> this<00:06:04.729> side<00:06:04.970> bone

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
like a rock so making this side bone

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.950 
like a rock so making this side bone
like<00:06:05.810> rock<00:06:06.169> like<00:06:06.440> texture<00:06:07.250> on<00:06:07.610> this<00:06:08.210> claw<00:06:08.600> here

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
like rock like texture on this claw here

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.159 
like rock like texture on this claw here
to<00:06:09.440> make<00:06:09.590> it<00:06:09.710> really<00:06:10.010> stand<00:06:10.310> out<00:06:10.520> a<00:06:11.020> lot<00:06:12.020> of

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169 
to make it really stand out a lot of

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.770 
to make it really stand out a lot of
drawing<00:06:12.950> with<00:06:13.100> pencil<00:06:13.700> was<00:06:13.940> to<00:06:14.180> be<00:06:14.300> sensitive

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
drawing with pencil was to be sensitive

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.630 
drawing with pencil was to be sensitive
and<00:06:14.900> try<00:06:15.140> and<00:06:15.320> feel<00:06:15.650> what<00:06:15.890> the<00:06:16.010> object<00:06:16.430> might

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
and try and feel what the object might

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.170 
and try and feel what the object might
feel<00:06:16.970> like<00:06:17.240> try<00:06:17.930> and<00:06:18.110> get<00:06:18.410> that<00:06:19.180> different

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
feel like try and get that different

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.880 
feel like try and get that different
dimension<00:06:20.690> to<00:06:20.720> your<00:06:20.990> drawing<00:06:21.440> so<00:06:21.650> you<00:06:21.680> can

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
dimension to your drawing so you can

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.800 
dimension to your drawing so you can
imagine<00:06:22.310> what<00:06:22.490> that<00:06:22.520> might<00:06:22.940> feel<00:06:23.240> like<00:06:23.510> if<00:06:23.690> you

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
imagine what that might feel like if you

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.190 
imagine what that might feel like if you
was<00:06:23.870> to<00:06:23.960> touch<00:06:24.229> it<00:06:24.530> so<00:06:25.840> making<00:06:26.840> the<00:06:26.930> bottom

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200 
was to touch it so making the bottom

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.770 
was to touch it so making the bottom
left<00:06:27.440> part<00:06:27.710> of<00:06:27.950> the<00:06:28.160> picture<00:06:29.030> very<00:06:29.270> heavy

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.020 

and<00:06:32.170> under<00:06:32.710> here<00:06:32.980> so<00:06:33.280> I<00:06:33.370> like<00:06:33.520> a<00:06:33.550> series<00:06:33.970> of

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
and under here so I like a series of

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.690 
and under here so I like a series of
brackets<00:06:34.600> to<00:06:35.160> just<00:06:36.160> laying<00:06:36.370> on<00:06:36.460> their<00:06:36.670> side

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700 
brackets to just laying on their side

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.620 
brackets to just laying on their side
just<00:06:37.270> to<00:06:37.389> give<00:06:37.570> that<00:06:37.750> sort<00:06:37.990> of<00:06:38.160> gravelly<00:06:39.630> sandy

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
just to give that sort of gravelly sandy

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.710 
just to give that sort of gravelly sandy
feel<00:06:41.100> there<00:06:42.100> so<00:06:42.280> I<00:06:42.310> like<00:06:42.580> to<00:06:42.730> draw<00:06:42.970> sand<00:06:43.330> but

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 
feel there so I like to draw sand but

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.590 
feel there so I like to draw sand but
because<00:06:44.320> the<00:06:44.500> crab<00:06:44.889> is<00:06:45.130> very<00:06:45.220> small<00:06:45.820> I<00:06:46.180> want<00:06:46.540> to

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:46.600 
because the crab is very small I want to

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.260 
because the crab is very small I want to
make<00:06:46.750> a<00:06:46.780> look<00:06:46.960> a<00:06:47.050> bit<00:06:47.200> more<00:06:47.350> like<00:06:47.410> gravel<00:06:48.270> so

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
make a look a bit more like gravel so

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.879 
make a look a bit more like gravel so
the<00:06:49.510> occasional<00:06:50.050> little<00:06:50.260> circle<00:06:50.740> the

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889 
the occasional little circle the

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:52.890 
the occasional little circle the
occasional<00:06:51.430> dot<00:06:51.669> the<00:06:51.910> occasion<00:06:52.419> also<00:06:52.600> have

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:52.900 
occasional dot the occasion also have

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.050 
occasional dot the occasion also have
curved<00:06:53.200> -<00:06:53.760> gives<00:06:54.760> me<00:06:55.060> that<00:06:55.270> feeling<00:06:55.810> it<00:06:56.710> also

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060 
curved - gives me that feeling it also

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.550 
curved - gives me that feeling it also
puts<00:06:58.060> the<00:06:58.330> crab<00:06:58.660> you<00:06:58.960> know<00:06:59.050> it<00:06:59.110> gives<00:06:59.290> a<00:06:59.350> bit<00:06:59.470> of

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
puts the crab you know it gives a bit of

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.530 
puts the crab you know it gives a bit of
weight<00:06:59.740> to<00:06:59.800> the<00:07:00.070> crab<00:07:00.310> or<00:07:00.550> a<00:07:00.820> bit<00:07:01.000> of<00:07:01.120> in<00:07:01.389> this

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:01.540 
weight to the crab or a bit of in this

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.170 
weight to the crab or a bit of in this
case<00:07:01.750> weightlessness<00:07:02.410> to<00:07:03.130> the<00:07:03.220> pro<00:07:03.460> because

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.180 
case weightlessness to the pro because
