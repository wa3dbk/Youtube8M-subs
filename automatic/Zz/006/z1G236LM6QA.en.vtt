00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.419 

if<00:00:00.599> you're<00:00:01.199> asked<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.439> land<00:00:01.740> a<00:00:01.860> number<00:00:02.100> off<00:00:02.220> to

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
if you're asked to land a number off to

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.269 
if you're asked to land a number off to
two<00:00:02.639> decimal<00:00:03.090> places<00:00:03.500> then<00:00:04.500> this<00:00:04.680> means<00:00:05.009> you

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
two decimal places then this means you

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.789 
two decimal places then this means you
only<00:00:05.430> want<00:00:05.759> two<00:00:06.060> numbers<00:00:06.299> after<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.649> decimal

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
only want two numbers after the decimal

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.650 
only want two numbers after the decimal
point<00:00:09.230> ready<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.469> two<00:00:10.650> decimal<00:00:10.980> places<00:00:11.099> is

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
point ready to two decimal places is

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.189 
point ready to two decimal places is
useful<00:00:12.660> if<00:00:12.929> you're<00:00:13.290> doing<00:00:13.590> money<00:00:14.370> problems

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199 
useful if you're doing money problems

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.810 
useful if you're doing money problems
because<00:00:16.199> all<00:00:16.350> money<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.430> nearest

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
because all money is to the nearest

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.939 
because all money is to the nearest
penny<00:00:18.119> or<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.480> nearest<00:00:18.690> cent<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.560> need<00:00:19.830> to

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
penny or the nearest cent so you need to

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.120 
penny or the nearest cent so you need to
round<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.279> off<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.640> two<00:00:20.820> decimal<00:00:21.240> places<00:00:22.130> let's

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
round it off to two decimal places let's

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.720 
round it off to two decimal places let's
take<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.460> look<00:00:23.580> at<00:00:23.670> example<00:00:24.180> one<00:00:25.430> so<00:00:26.430> we've<00:00:26.609> got

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
take a look at example one so we've got

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.130 
take a look at example one so we've got
around<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.029> number<00:00:27.300> fourteen<00:00:27.750> point<00:00:28.019> two

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
around this number fourteen point two

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.790 
around this number fourteen point two
eight<00:00:28.320> three<00:00:28.859> seven<00:00:29.670> two<00:00:29.699> two<00:00:29.910> decimal<00:00:30.510> places

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
eight three seven two two decimal places

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.200 
eight three seven two two decimal places
so<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:32.070> want<00:00:32.250> two<00:00:32.489> numbers<00:00:32.669> after<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.120> decimal

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
so we want two numbers after the decimal

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.280 
so we want two numbers after the decimal
point<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:34.020> our<00:00:34.140> answer<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.800> one<00:00:35.489> two<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:37.230> I'm

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
point in our answer so one two so I'm

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.299 
point in our answer so one two so I'm
going<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.559> cut<00:00:37.829> our<00:00:38.660> number<00:00:39.660> off<00:00:39.870> here<00:00:40.309> now

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
going to cut our number off here now

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.610 
going to cut our number off here now
I've<00:00:41.399> got<00:00:41.550> two<00:00:41.760> possibilities<00:00:42.300> now<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
I've got two possibilities now and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.040 
I've got two possibilities now and
either<00:00:43.829> be<00:00:44.219> an<00:00:44.430> answer<00:00:44.789> be<00:00:45.090> fourteen<00:00:45.719> point

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
either be an answer be fourteen point

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.170 
either be an answer be fourteen point
two<00:00:46.170> eight<00:00:46.379> plus<00:00:47.280> if<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.610> round<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> number

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
two eight plus if I round the number

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.170 
two eight plus if I round the number
down<00:00:48.390> or<00:00:48.930> fourteen<00:00:49.739> point<00:00:50.160> two<00:00:50.280> nine<00:00:50.760> if<00:00:51.090> I

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
down or fourteen point two nine if I

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.330 
down or fourteen point two nine if I
round<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.539> number<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:52.770> need<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.980> decide

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
round the number up so we need to decide

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.450 
round the number up so we need to decide
which<00:00:53.579> one<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.059> close<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.420> two<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:56.010> decide

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
which one it's close to two to decide

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.639 
which one it's close to two to decide
which<00:00:56.699> one<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.059> closest<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:58.230> look<00:00:58.410> at<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
which one is closest to just look at the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.959 
which one is closest to just look at the
number<00:00:59.100> after<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.359> line<00:01:00.690> which<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.170> three

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
number after the line which is a three

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.759 
number after the line which is a three
since<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.239> number<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.660> less<00:01:03.899> than<00:01:03.930> five

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
since that number is less than five

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.539 
since that number is less than five
we<00:01:05.220> ran<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> number<00:01:05.850> down<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:07.159> this<00:01:08.159> number

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
we ran the number down so this number

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.120 
we ran the number down so this number
will<00:01:09.420> stay<00:01:09.780> as<00:01:10.080> fourteen<00:01:10.770> point<00:01:11.250> two<00:01:11.369> eight<00:01:13.130> so

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
will stay as fourteen point two eight so

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.070 
will stay as fourteen point two eight so
let's<00:01:14.280> look<00:01:14.580> at<00:01:14.729> example<00:01:15.150> two<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.780> again<00:01:15.810> we're

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
let's look at example two so again we're

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.590 
let's look at example two so again we're
going<00:01:16.200> round<00:01:16.350> off<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.680> turn<00:01:16.890> Esper<00:01:17.189> places<00:01:17.700> so

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
going round off to turn Esper places so

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.850 
going round off to turn Esper places so
you<00:01:18.750> want<00:01:18.900> two<00:01:19.110> numbers<00:01:19.259> after<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.740> decimal

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
you want two numbers after the decimal

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.990 
you want two numbers after the decimal
point<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:20.670> one<00:01:21.150> two<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:23.490> we're<00:01:23.610> going<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.820> cut

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
point so one two so we're going to cut

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.330 
point so one two so we're going to cut
head<00:01:24.180> over<00:01:24.420> off<00:01:24.570> there<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.680> again<00:01:25.920> utility

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
head over off there so again utility

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.999 
head over off there so again utility
possible<00:01:26.729> answers<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> six<00:01:27.630> point<00:01:27.930> one<00:01:28.200> five<00:01:28.560> or

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
possible answers a six point one five or

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.899 
possible answers a six point one five or
six<00:01:29.820> point<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.420> six<00:01:31.250> so<00:01:32.250> again<00:01:32.460> look<00:01:32.670> at<00:01:32.790> your

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
six point one six so again look at your

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.770 
six point one six so again look at your
number<00:01:33.360> after<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.020> after<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.070> line<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:36.360> again

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
number after the after the line so again

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.050 
number after the after the line so again
this<00:01:37.170> number<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.829> 4<00:01:38.100> which<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.579> less<00:01:38.820> than

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
this number is a 4 which is less than

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.899 
this number is a 4 which is less than
five<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.710> means<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.310> ran<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> number

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
five so that means we ran the number

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.300 
five so that means we ran the number
down<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.990> number<00:01:43.409> will<00:01:43.710> stand<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.070> sign

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
down so the number will stand the sign

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.030 
down so the number will stand the sign
of<00:01:44.520> six<00:01:44.820> point<00:01:45.180> one<00:01:45.420> five<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:49.530> let's<00:01:49.560> move<00:01:49.829> on

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
of six point one five so let's move on

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.420 
of six point one five so let's move on
to<00:01:50.189> example<00:01:50.310> three<00:01:51.350> so<00:01:52.350> again<00:01:52.710> we're<00:01:53.130> doing<00:01:53.280> it

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
to example three so again we're doing it

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.670 
to example three so again we're doing it
to<00:01:53.520> two<00:01:53.670> decimal<00:01:53.700> places<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.600> turn<00:01:55.079> them<00:01:55.290> after

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
to two decimal places to turn them after

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.510 
to two decimal places to turn them after
the<00:01:55.799> decimal<00:01:55.979> point<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.770> two<00:01:58.770> possibilities

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
the decimal point so two possibilities

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.940 
the decimal point so two possibilities
again<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> seven<00:02:00.270> point<00:02:00.479> one<00:02:00.630> two<00:02:01.259> four<00:02:01.740> and

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
again a seven point one two four and

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.819 
again a seven point one two four and
down<00:02:02.189> or<00:02:02.790> seven<00:02:03.240> point<00:02:03.479> one<00:02:03.570> three<00:02:04.140> if<00:02:04.590> it

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
down or seven point one three if it

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:05.510 
down or seven point one three if it
rained<00:02:05.070> up

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
rained up

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.499 
rained up
so<00:02:06.270> let's<00:02:06.630> decide<00:02:06.930> which<00:02:07.170> one<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.469> closest<00:02:07.950> to

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
so let's decide which one is closest to

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.180 
so let's decide which one is closest to
just<00:02:09.509> need<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.840> look<00:02:09.959> at<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.739> first<00:02:10.950> number

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
just need to look at the first number

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.980 
just need to look at the first number
after<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.700> line

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
after the line

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.790 
after the line
this<00:02:13.410> time<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:14.190> 6<00:02:14.550> that's<00:02:15.210> 5<00:02:15.630> or<00:02:15.840> above<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.710> we

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
this time to 6 that's 5 or above so we

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.400 
this time to 6 that's 5 or above so we
ran<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.190> number<00:02:17.490> up<00:02:17.840> so<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:18.990> means<00:02:19.230> it's

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
ran the number up so that means it's

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.010 
ran the number up so that means it's
closest<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:19.980> 7<00:02:20.520> point<00:02:20.760> 1<00:02:20.910> 3

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.650 

let's<00:02:25.020> move<00:02:25.260> on<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.500> example<00:02:25.740> 4<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:27.330> this<00:02:27.390> time

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
let's move on to example 4 so this time

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.750 
let's move on to example 4 so this time
we<00:02:27.780> have<00:02:27.810> twelve<00:02:28.200> point<00:02:28.500> four<00:02:28.800> zero<00:02:28.860> five<00:02:29.490> one

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
we have twelve point four zero five one

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.010 
we have twelve point four zero five one
eight<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:31.080> again<00:02:31.830> read<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.220> off<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.490> 2dp<00:02:33.240> so<00:02:33.630> two

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
eight so again read it off to 2dp so two

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.790 
eight so again read it off to 2dp so two
numbers<00:02:34.200> after<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.710> decimal<00:02:34.800> point<00:02:36.260> so<00:02:37.260> two

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
numbers after the decimal point so two

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.680 
numbers after the decimal point so two
options<00:02:38.220> again<00:02:38.550> are<00:02:38.730> twelve<00:02:39.060> point<00:02:39.390> four<00:02:39.630> zero

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
options again are twelve point four zero

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.500 
options again are twelve point four zero
if<00:02:40.230> we<00:02:40.320> round<00:02:40.500> down<00:02:40.650> or<00:02:41.190> twelve<00:02:41.880> point<00:02:42.240> four

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
if we round down or twelve point four

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.320 
if we round down or twelve point four
one<00:02:42.810> if<00:02:42.990> we<00:02:43.110> round<00:02:43.290> up<00:02:43.700> so<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:44.850> look<00:02:45.060> at<00:02:45.240> the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
one if we round up so just look at the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.570 
one if we round up so just look at the
number<00:02:45.630> after<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.230> line<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:48.510> that's<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.840> five

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
number after the line so that's a five

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.250 
number after the line so that's a five
if<00:02:50.580> it's<00:02:50.760> 5<00:02:51.000> or<00:02:51.210> above<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.750> always<00:02:51.900> round<00:02:52.080> the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
if it's 5 or above you always round the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.210 
if it's 5 or above you always round the
number<00:02:52.590> up<00:02:53.330> so<00:02:54.330> our<00:02:54.660> final<00:02:55.110> answer<00:02:55.440> will<00:02:56.190> be

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
number up so our final answer will be

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.890 
number up so our final answer will be
twelve<00:02:56.970> point<00:02:57.510> four<00:02:58.050> one<00:02:59.420> so<00:03:00.420> one<00:03:00.660> fine

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
twelve point four one so one fine

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.200 
twelve point four one so one fine
example<00:03:01.470> then<00:03:01.650> so<00:03:01.950> this<00:03:02.100> time<00:03:02.400> we<00:03:02.580> looking<00:03:03.120> at

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
example then so this time we looking at

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.400 
example then so this time we looking at
three<00:03:03.570> point<00:03:03.930> two<00:03:04.230> four<00:03:04.590> seven<00:03:04.830> one<00:03:05.160> two<00:03:06.410> so

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
three point two four seven one two so

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.900 
three point two four seven one two so
again<00:03:07.770> two<00:03:08.160> numbers<00:03:08.460> after<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.820> decimal

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
again two numbers after the decimal

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.350 
again two numbers after the decimal
point<00:03:09.600> we<00:03:09.840> need<00:03:10.670> step<00:03:11.670> around<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.060> number

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
point we need step around the number

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.780 
point we need step around the number
down<00:03:12.540> it'll<00:03:12.840> be<00:03:12.960> three<00:03:13.230> point<00:03:13.530> two<00:03:13.800> four<00:03:14.220> if

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
down it'll be three point two four if

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.820 
down it'll be three point two four if
around<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:15.330> number<00:03:15.600> up<00:03:15.780> it'd<00:03:16.080> be<00:03:16.230> three<00:03:16.500> point

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
around the number up it'd be three point

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.050 
around the number up it'd be three point
two<00:03:17.100> five<00:03:17.450> so<00:03:18.450> which<00:03:18.690> one<00:03:18.900> is<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:19.050> class<00:03:19.380> is<00:03:19.620> to

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
two five so which one is it class is to

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.260 
two five so which one is it class is to
look<00:03:21.060> at<00:03:21.240> the<00:03:21.330> number<00:03:21.600> after<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.990> line<00:03:23.270> since

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
look at the number after the line since

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.020 
look at the number after the line since
it's<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.540> seven<00:03:25.050> that's<00:03:25.200> five<00:03:25.620> or<00:03:25.890> above<00:03:26.250> so

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
it's a seven that's five or above so

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.170 
it's a seven that's five or above so
we're<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.420> at<00:03:27.780> decimal<00:03:28.740> up<00:03:28.920> read<00:03:29.220> such<00:03:29.580> closer

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
we're and at decimal up read such closer

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.700 
we're and at decimal up read such closer
to<00:03:30.530> three<00:03:31.530> point<00:03:31.980> two<00:03:32.340> five
