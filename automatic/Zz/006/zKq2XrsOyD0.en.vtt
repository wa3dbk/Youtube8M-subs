points<00:04:52.650> these<00:04:53.650> will<00:04:53.979> stop<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.510> water<00:04:55.510> effect

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
points these will stop the water effect

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:02.650 
points these will stop the water effect
from<00:04:56.020> spilling<00:04:56.380> out<00:04:56.590> from<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:57.150> riverbed

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.040 

take<00:05:03.660> some<00:05:03.900> Elmer's<00:05:04.170> glue<00:05:04.530> or<00:05:04.860> wood<00:05:05.130> glue<00:05:06.050> prep
