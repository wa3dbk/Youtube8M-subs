alright guys I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:01.650> make<00:00:02.060> blending<00:00:03.060> soaps<00:00:03.830> these<00:00:04.830> are<00:00:04.980> used

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
to make blending soaps these are used

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.280 
to make blending soaps these are used
for<00:00:05.609> getting<00:00:05.670> soft<00:00:06.420> shading<00:00:06.720> when<00:00:07.140> you're

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
for getting soft shading when you're

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.970 
for getting soft shading when you're
working<00:00:07.620> with<00:00:07.940> graphite<00:00:09.349> it's<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.469> technique

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
working with graphite it's a technique

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.450 
working with graphite it's a technique
that<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.219> learned<00:00:11.370> from<00:00:11.580> working<00:00:12.150> in<00:00:12.840> the

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
that I learned from working in the

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.790 
that I learned from working in the
prison<00:00:14.460> system<00:00:14.820> as<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.780> correctional<00:00:16.230> officer

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
prison system as a correctional officer

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.740 
prison system as a correctional officer
the<00:00:17.160> inmates<00:00:17.430> do<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:17.880> that's<00:00:18.270> how<00:00:18.449> they<00:00:18.630> get

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
the inmates do it so that's how they get

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.650 
the inmates do it so that's how they get
there<00:00:19.020> they're<00:00:19.350> shading<00:00:20.000> really<00:00:21.000> really<00:00:21.330> fine

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
there they're shading really really fine

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.720 
there they're shading really really fine
and<00:00:21.689> precise<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.680> their<00:00:22.830> drawings<00:00:23.510> I<00:00:24.510> use<00:00:25.470> them

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
and precise in their drawings I use them

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.800 
and precise in their drawings I use them
I've<00:00:26.730> never<00:00:27.000> bought<00:00:27.240> them<00:00:27.420> because<00:00:27.660> they're

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
I've never bought them because they're

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.929 
I've never bought them because they're
really<00:00:27.840> expensive<00:00:28.439> for<00:00:29.220> what<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.490> get<00:00:29.699> and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
really expensive for what you get and

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.540 
really expensive for what you get and
you<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.269> make<00:00:30.390> them<00:00:30.510> yourself<00:00:30.869> for<00:00:31.109> cheap<00:00:31.349> um

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.990 
was a post-it paper and I cut the
adhesive<00:00:42.000> part<00:00:42.239> off<00:00:42.800> um<00:00:43.800> basically<00:00:44.579> what<00:00:44.879> you

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
adhesive part off um basically what you

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.650 
adhesive part off um basically what you
do<00:00:45.120> should<00:00:46.020> take<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.350> fold<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.309> down<00:00:47.489> about<00:00:48.180> a

do should take it fold it down about a
quarter<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.110> way<00:00:49.460> now<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.489> can<00:00:50.700> use<00:00:50.789> any

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
quarter of the way now you can use any

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.410 
quarter of the way now you can use any
paper<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.620> want<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.980> be<00:00:53.160> about<00:00:53.579> two

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
a little triangle it doesn't have to be

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.359 
a little triangle it doesn't have to be
perfect<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:36.560> don't<00:01:37.560> even<00:01:37.650> know<00:01:37.829> if<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.220> to

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
perfect I don't even know if you have to

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.969 
perfect I don't even know if you have to
use<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> triangle<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.110> want<00:01:40.290> an<00:01:40.409> angle<00:01:40.799> it

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
use a triangle but you want an angle it

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.630 
use a triangle but you want an angle it
makes<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.310> easier<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.670> roll<00:01:43.759> crease<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:46.640> tear

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
makes it easier to roll crease it tear

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.240 
makes it easier to roll crease it tear
it<00:01:47.670> off<00:01:50.570> then<00:01:51.570> what<00:01:51.630> you're<00:01:51.750> gonna<00:01:51.840> do<00:01:52.250> lick

work the edge back and forth until it

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.130 
work the edge back and forth until it
starts<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.319> roll<00:02:22.620> on<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.540> once<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.690> starts<00:02:24.959> to

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
starts to roll on you once it starts to

roll<00:02:25.349> just<00:02:30.680> start<00:02:31.680> twisting<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.489> in<00:02:33.019> now<00:02:34.019> if

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
roll just start twisting it in now if

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.880 
roll just start twisting it in now if
it's<00:02:35.040> not<00:02:35.250> rolling<00:02:35.700> at<00:02:35.849> an<00:02:35.970> angle<00:02:36.650> roll<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.799> out

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
it's not rolling at an angle roll it out

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.330 
it's not rolling at an angle roll it out
a<00:02:37.920> little<00:02:38.129> bit<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.430> then<00:02:39.030> force<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:40.049> roll

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
a little bit and then force it to roll

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.660 
a little bit and then force it to roll
out<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.400> little<00:02:41.790> bit<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.090> graduated<00:02:42.690> angle<00:02:43.080> I

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.839 

like<00:02:47.670> mine<00:02:48.680> start<00:02:49.680> off<00:02:49.799> with<00:02:50.099> a<00:02:50.130> fairly<00:02:50.670> decent

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
like mine start off with a fairly decent

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:57.890 
like mine start off with a fairly decent
point<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:53.569> taper<00:02:55.010> so<00:02:56.010> if<00:02:56.549> it's<00:02:57.120> not<00:02:57.299> quite

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
point and taper so if it's not quite

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.069 
point and taper so if it's not quite
where<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.290> want<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:59.510> push<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.690> in<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.870> little

and<00:04:26.880> heat<00:04:27.270> it<00:04:27.390> up<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:27.780> it<00:04:27.980> constricts<00:04:28.980> the

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
and heat it up and it constricts the

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.590 
and heat it up and it constricts the
paper<00:04:30.230> keeps<00:04:31.230> it<00:04:31.410> from<00:04:31.560> unrolling<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.600> way

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
paper keeps it from unrolling the way

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.820 
paper keeps it from unrolling the way
the<00:04:33.720> inmates<00:04:34.080> do<00:04:34.290> it<00:04:34.410> is<00:04:34.500> they'll<00:04:34.650> take<00:04:34.800> a

the inmates do it is they'll take a
bedsheet<00:04:35.130> strip<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.030> threads<00:04:36.060> out<00:04:36.840> of<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:37.080> and

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
bedsheet strip the threads out of it and

bedsheet strip the threads out of it and
they'll<00:04:38.010> wind<00:04:38.280> it<00:04:38.490> all<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.940> way<00:04:39.030> down<00:04:39.210> the

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
they'll wind it all the way down the

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.930 
they'll wind it all the way down the
core<00:04:39.740> and<00:04:40.740> then<00:04:40.830> they'll<00:04:40.980> take<00:04:41.160> a<00:04:41.370> pencil<00:04:41.610> or

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
core and then they'll take a pencil or

like<00:04:51.510> that<00:04:52.520> and<00:04:55.550> that<00:04:56.550> is<00:04:56.610> how<00:04:56.850> you<00:04:57.060> make<00:04:57.360> a

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
like that and that is how you make a

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.260 
like that and that is how you make a
blending<00:04:57.990> stone
