00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.399
 man is creativity this creativity 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.980
 novelty is moving forward and we 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.519
 most men are born military 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.499
 energy low energy is energy 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.869
 but at the same time when we 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:19.850
 we are in acceptance plus men are very 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.620
 strongly developed brain it sticks in it and 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.540
 becoming conservatives a man 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.730
 conservative 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.440
 he adjusts when he tries 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.280
 always he has either depression 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.460
 either the aggression of which he suppresses the cube or 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.420
 cigarettes 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.789
 either alcohol or some habits 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.140
 kind of billiards well i mean he starts 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:45.190
 creativity lead something that can 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.149
 compensate for withdraw energy work 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.940
 fishing trip 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.530
 he starts doing it first 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.420
 conservative second starts 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.399
 remember past and past achievements 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.559
 that were based on that potential 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.260
 which we call through which we are given 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.089
 for emergencies which means 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.760
 moving forward faster than 12 percent 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:07.070
 and turns into a man who only 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.430
 and lives its own memories and 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.950
 this again goes like its unavailability 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.840
 admit that he stopped being 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.820
 creative person and what we get 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.740
 We do not have a situation now 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.979
 a lot of very talk about what is not 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.659
 is important but at the same time it 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.450
 manifested here on physics because 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.340
 people just anytime and sticky 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.039
 as a man should be too 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.359
 willingness to develop a man he is not 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.250
 has potential 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:43.039
 he has only the opportunity to be honest 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.840
 the second is to be able not to adapt that is 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:50.030
 stay yourself in all situations 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.579
 and the important point is he does not justify he 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.640
 recognizes how to eat if a man 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.140
 begins to justify means he loses 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.600
 his personality begins to adapt 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.820
 under the legal framework of the one under 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.880
 it is completed therefore it is justified 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.340
 and it stops being low i mean i 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.500
 not very strongly suppressed he goes 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.290
 adjusting sticking in 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.810
 stability and loss of self as 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.790
 human therefore 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:21.420
 women men notice where you see 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.400
 men who adapt 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.190
 who are not being honest with themselves 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.860
 by yourself or with others who are in a hurry 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.840
 and they are trying to explain everything to everyone 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.060
 justifying itself and forming in the future those 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.819
 processes that lead 1 cam potency 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.599
 second to the fact that they begin closer 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.790
 to be gay than men and that's nice 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.730
 that doesn't mean gay is bad or 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.680
 well it's just the kind of energy that 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.819
 transform a man for that too 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.730
 to save him 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.470
 in the kind where he can normally 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.340
 engaging in creativity and realizing in 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.580
 society to feel alive such 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:05.080
 when a man stops making excuses 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.299
 when he is honest with himself when he is not 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.920
 adjusts and at the same time speaks and 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.170
 does when he speaks and doesn't he 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.170
 also reports and acknowledges that 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.000
 he could not do and is not trying 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.209
 embellish what's going on here 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.859
 that real man who 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.720
 draws to itself those women who 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:25.239
 will fill it with its harmony 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.220
 it's accepting yourself as acting 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.170
 and not always successfully remember we are not 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.950
 can always be successful otherwise then 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.079
 we will 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.489
 artificial not real or very 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.190
 quick windows remember when i 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.100
 said if everything goes perfectly 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.410
 our humble if u stay in their country 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.970
 stand in a dead end you are not going there but 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.410
 if you then it turns out that not 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.480
 it turns out it comes out and it does not go out 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.680
 at an altitude then somewhere you pierced everything 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.600
 ok you move right 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.709
 direction with the right speed and you are the one 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.709
 who should you be
