00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
that object link and I let it run here a

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:04.859 
that object link and I let it run here a
little<00:02:03.579> longer<00:02:03.789> so<00:02:04.119> you<00:02:04.210> can<00:02:04.329> see<00:02:04.509> that<00:02:04.539> the

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
object of interest today brightness

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.130 
object of interest today brightness
enhanced<00:02:24.510> you're<00:02:25.510> seeing<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.900> flash

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
enhanced you're seeing the flash

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.460 
enhanced you're seeing the flash
Locklear<00:02:26.769> now

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.560 

go<00:02:32.310> ahead<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:32.490> go<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.670> edge<00:02:32.880> detection<00:02:33.300> now

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
go ahead and go to edge detection now

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.700 
go ahead and go to edge detection now
this<00:02:33.750> makes<00:02:34.440> everything<00:02:34.710> bigger<00:02:36.500> but<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.590> is

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
this makes everything bigger but it is

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.650 
this makes everything bigger but it is
useful<00:02:38.190> in<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> lot<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.640> ways<00:02:38.880> especially<00:02:39.210> if

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
useful in a lot of ways especially if

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.120 
useful in a lot of ways especially if

we're<00:03:37.860> starting<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.220> get<00:03:38.340> somewhere<00:03:38.610> you

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
we're starting to get somewhere you

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.289 
we're starting to get somewhere you
start<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:40.860> see<00:03:41.010> some<00:03:41.209> contour<00:03:44.180> that's<00:03:45.180> a

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
start to see some contour that's a

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.190 
start to see some contour that's a
little<00:03:45.540> odd<00:03:45.690> but<00:03:45.989> that's<00:03:46.319> what<00:03:46.530> that<00:03:46.709> is<00:03:46.920> and

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
little odd but that's what that is and

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.390 
little odd but that's what that is and
this<00:03:49.200> course<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.860> edge<00:03:50.010> detection

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.420 

and<00:03:54.790> I'm<00:03:55.360> Brighton<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:55.959> too

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.970 

doesn't<00:04:01.150> show<00:04:01.239> us<00:04:01.390> a<00:04:01.510> lot<00:04:01.689> but<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:05.620> is<00:04:05.769> what<00:04:05.950> it

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
doesn't show us a lot but it is what it

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.599 
doesn't show us a lot but it is what it
is<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:07.890> a<00:04:08.890> couple<00:04:09.579> things<00:04:09.700> came<00:04:10.120> out<00:04:10.239> of<00:04:10.390> this

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
is so a couple things came out of this

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.490 
is so a couple things came out of this
for<00:04:12.609> those<00:04:12.730> who<00:04:12.909> are<00:04:13.060> looking<00:04:13.150> for<00:04:13.379> what<00:04:14.379> they

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
for those who are looking for what they

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.279 
for those who are looking for what they
were<00:04:14.560> calling<00:04:15.069> trailing<00:04:15.670> footage<00:04:16.229> of<00:04:17.229> that

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
were calling trailing footage of that

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.550 
were calling trailing footage of that
real<00:04:18.190> star<00:04:18.519> and<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:19.359> accompanying<00:04:19.660> fake<00:04:20.229> star

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
real star and the accompanying fake star

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.820 
real star and the accompanying fake star
have<00:04:21.130> provided<00:04:21.489> that<00:04:21.759> it's<00:04:22.410> fake<00:04:23.410> star<00:04:23.710> is

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
have provided that it's fake star is

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.810 
have provided that it's fake star is
gone<00:04:24.070> it<00:04:24.690> was<00:04:25.690> what<00:04:25.900> we<00:04:25.990> think<00:04:26.229> it<00:04:26.350> is<00:04:26.820> this

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
gone it was what we think it is this

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.620 
gone it was what we think it is this
object<00:04:28.300> here<00:04:29.310> it<00:04:30.310> appears<00:04:30.850> that<00:04:30.940> it<00:04:31.150> was<00:04:31.270> below

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
object here it appears that it was below

we're definitely above the clouds that
night<00:04:38.560> I<00:04:39.000> see<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.030> lot<00:04:40.210> of<00:04:40.270> things<00:04:40.509> here<00:04:41.130> I'm

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
night I see a lot of things here I'm

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.219 
night I see a lot of things here I'm
sure<00:04:42.370> there's<00:04:42.610> people<00:04:42.789> out<00:04:43.060> there<00:04:43.229> watching

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
sure there's people out there watching

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.189 
sure there's people out there watching
us<00:04:44.500> right<00:04:44.680> now<00:04:45.240> whoever<00:04:46.240> Washington<00:04:46.750> X<00:04:46.930> guys

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
us right now whoever Washington X guys

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.680 
us right now whoever Washington X guys
and<00:04:47.620> maybe<00:04:47.740> caught<00:04:48.070> a<00:04:48.310> brief<00:04:48.639> flash<00:04:49.210> of<00:04:49.419> light

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
and maybe caught a brief flash of light

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.779 
and maybe caught a brief flash of light
out<00:04:50.560> of<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:50.740> corner<00:04:51.099> there<00:04:51.250> I<00:04:51.280> and<00:04:51.729> they

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
out of the corner there I and they

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.300 
out of the corner there I and they
weren't<00:04:51.970> sure<00:04:52.180> what<00:04:52.330> it<00:04:52.479> was<00:04:53.070> this<00:04:54.070> is<00:04:54.190> the

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
weren't sure what it was this is the

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.029 
weren't sure what it was this is the
case<00:04:54.520> here<00:04:54.550> I<00:04:55.440> never<00:04:56.440> would<00:04:56.560> have<00:04:56.740> detected

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
case here I never would have detected

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.060 
case here I never would have detected
this<00:04:57.599> had<00:04:58.599> I<00:04:58.630> not<00:04:58.900> been<00:04:58.960> staring<00:04:59.470> directly<00:04:59.590> up

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
this had I not been staring directly up

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.360 
this had I not been staring directly up
into<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.729> sky<00:05:01.030> and<00:05:01.360> then<00:05:02.289> I<00:05:02.650> possibly<00:05:03.250> would

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
into the sky and then I possibly would

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.830 
into the sky and then I possibly would
have<00:05:03.490> dismissed<00:05:03.849> it<00:05:04.060> as<00:05:04.120> just<00:05:04.510> my<00:05:04.720> eyes

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
have dismissed it as just my eyes

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.409 
have dismissed it as just my eyes
playing<00:05:04.870> tricks<00:05:05.289> on<00:05:05.680> me<00:05:06.060> if<00:05:07.060> you<00:05:07.150> look<00:05:07.270> at<00:05:07.360> the

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
playing tricks on me if you look at the

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.969 
playing tricks on me if you look at the
stars<00:05:07.720> long<00:05:08.020> enough<00:05:08.580> you<00:05:09.580> play<00:05:10.180> tricks<00:05:10.570> on<00:05:10.720> you

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
stars long enough you play tricks on you

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.560 
stars long enough you play tricks on you
but<00:05:11.979> I<00:05:12.010> hope<00:05:12.190> you<00:05:12.310> enjoyed<00:05:12.580> this<00:05:12.820> if<00:05:13.270> you<00:05:13.449> have
