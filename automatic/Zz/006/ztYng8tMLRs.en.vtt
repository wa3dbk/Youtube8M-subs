really really well how you play this all
you<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.950> push<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.280> d-pad<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
you just have to push the d-pad in the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.869 
you just have to push the d-pad in the
direction<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.480> want<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.780> move<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.640> the<00:00:47.640> thing

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
direction you want to move and the thing

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.490 
direction you want to move and the thing
is<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.090> when<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.899> have<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.200> change

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
is that when you have to change

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.130 
is that when you have to change
directions<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.809> push<00:00:52.110> it

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
directions like this you have to push it

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.500 
directions like this you have to push it
a<00:00:52.320> different<00:00:52.620> direction<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:54.030> slow<00:00:54.300> down

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
a different direction and you slow down

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.270 
a different direction and you slow down
if<00:00:54.809> you're<00:00:54.989> not<00:00:55.199> pushing<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.800> proper

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
if you're not pushing in the proper

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.869 
if you're not pushing in the proper
direction<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:57.590> kind<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.680> yeah<00:00:59.219> I'm<00:00:59.399> doing<00:00:59.820> a

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
direction it kind of yeah I'm doing a

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.189 
direction it kind of yeah I'm doing a
really<00:01:00.030> nice<00:01:00.210> job<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.750> explain<00:01:01.020> how<00:01:01.170> that

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
really nice job to explain how that

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.439 
really nice job to explain how that
works<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:01.770> that's<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> really<00:01:02.969> important

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
works but that's like a really important

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.690 
works but that's like a really important
reflex<00:01:03.840> movement<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.769> if<00:01:05.220> you're<00:01:05.400> just<00:01:05.580> a

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
reflex movement and if you're just a

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.380 
reflex movement and if you're just a
tiny<00:01:06.000> tiny<00:01:06.210> tiny<00:01:07.080> bit<00:01:07.409> off<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.119> orb<00:01:09.119> will

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
tiny tiny tiny bit off the orb will

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.870 
tiny tiny tiny bit off the orb will
catch<00:01:09.600> up<00:01:09.869> with<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.140> quite<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> bit<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:11.640> you

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
catch up with you quite a bit like you

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.730 
catch up with you quite a bit like you
see<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.210> corner<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.540> took<00:01:12.630> really<00:01:12.990> fully<00:01:13.350> just

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
see that corner I took really fully just

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.520 
see that corner I took really fully just
a<00:01:13.830> little<00:01:14.040> while<00:01:14.189> ago<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.640> was<00:01:15.330> like<00:01:15.540> maybe<00:01:15.869> one

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
a little while ago I was like maybe one

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.609 
a little while ago I was like maybe one
tenth<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.009> second<00:01:17.430> off<00:01:17.580> at<00:01:17.939> most<00:01:18.439> but<00:01:19.439> that

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
tenth of a second off at most but that

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.320 
tenth of a second off at most but that
was<00:01:19.740> enough<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.070> get<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.280> right<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.640> my<00:01:20.670> ass<00:01:21.000> and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
was enough to get it right on my ass and

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.640 
was enough to get it right on my ass and
I'm<00:01:21.509> probably<00:01:21.659> going<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.080> die<00:01:22.110> here<00:01:22.470> any

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
I'm probably going to die here any

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.580 
I'm probably going to die here any
second<00:01:23.130> because<00:01:23.670> no<00:01:23.939> matter<00:01:24.270> how<00:01:24.509> well<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.140> try

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
second because no matter how well I try

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.780 
second because no matter how well I try
I'm<00:01:25.890> not<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.490> make<00:01:26.610> up<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:28.790> yeah

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
I'm not going to make up for that yeah

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.300 
I'm not going to make up for that yeah
you<00:01:30.689> just<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.380> know<00:01:31.500> push<00:01:31.799> right

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
you just have to you know push right

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.249 
you just have to you know push right
then<00:01:33.119> up<00:01:33.560> right<00:01:34.560> down<00:01:35.509> that's<00:01:36.509> all<00:01:36.750> I'm<00:01:36.900> doing

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
then up right down that's all I'm doing

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.929 
then up right down that's all I'm doing
there's<00:01:37.500> no<00:01:37.680> face<00:01:38.130> buttons<00:01:38.579> none<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.909> that

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
there's no face buttons none of that

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.260 
there's no face buttons none of that
stuff<00:01:39.329> it's<00:01:39.600> all<00:01:39.810> d-pad<00:01:40.350> movements<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.240> had<00:01:42.240> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
stuff it's all d-pad movements I had a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.730 
stuff it's all d-pad movements I had a
bit<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.570> discussion<00:01:42.840> about<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.409> level

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
bit of a discussion about this level

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.429 
bit of a discussion about this level
with<00:01:43.860> someone<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.310> thread<00:01:45.200> basically<00:01:46.200> his

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
with someone in the thread basically his

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.230 
with someone in the thread basically his
observation<00:01:47.310> was<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.729> level<00:01:48.060> looked

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
observation was that this level looked

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.179 
observation was that this level looked
really<00:01:48.689> easy<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.640> indeed<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.970> does<00:01:51.180> it's

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
really easy and indeed it does it's

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.639 
really easy and indeed it does it's
deceptively<00:01:53.189> hard<00:01:53.960> put<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.140> way<00:01:55.200> my

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
deceptively hard put it that way my

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.109 
deceptively hard put it that way my
statement<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.340> was<00:01:56.490> pretty<00:01:56.700> much<00:01:56.880> that

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
statement on it was pretty much that

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.910 
statement on it was pretty much that
it's<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.299> lot<00:01:57.479> harder<00:01:57.689> than<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.020> looks<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.590> I

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
it's a lot harder than it looks and I

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.740 
it's a lot harder than it looks and I
completely<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.610> totally<00:01:59.850> stand<00:02:00.329> by<00:02:00.509> that

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
completely and totally stand by that

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.789 
completely and totally stand by that
assessment<00:02:02.540> this<00:02:03.540> level<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.439> very<00:02:05.030> very

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
assessment this level is very very

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.919 
assessment this level is very very
reflex<00:02:07.799> heavy<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:09.420> need<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.810> be

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
reflex heavy and you need to be

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.110 
reflex heavy and you need to be
completely<00:02:10.440> precise<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.310> all<00:02:11.580> your<00:02:11.819> movements

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
otherwise you are going to get flattened

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.559 
otherwise you are going to get flattened

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
just not even trying at this point this

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.589 
just not even trying at this point this
is<00:02:35.040> totally<00:02:35.610> going<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.879> be<00:02:35.940> another<00:02:36.120> safe<00:02:36.629> job

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
is totally going to be another safe job

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.759 
is totally going to be another safe job
speaking<00:02:39.599> of<00:02:39.660> which<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:40.110> have<00:02:40.170> actually

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
speaking of which I have actually

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.290 
speaking of which I have actually
practiced<00:02:41.190> this<00:02:41.310> little<00:02:41.610> just<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:41.910> little<00:02:41.970> bit

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
practiced this little just a little bit

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.470 
practiced this little just a little bit
but<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:42.900> have<00:02:43.080> not<00:02:43.319> gotten<00:02:43.650> through<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:45.180> I

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
but I have not gotten through it so I

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.440 
but I have not gotten through it so I
have<00:02:45.750> no<00:02:46.200> clue<00:02:46.410> how<00:02:46.739> many<00:02:47.129> attempts<00:02:47.970> or<00:02:48.180> tries

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
have no clue how many attempts or tries

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.150 
have no clue how many attempts or tries
this<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:48.870> going<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.170> take<00:02:49.349> in<00:02:49.560> order<00:02:49.739> for<00:02:50.040> me<00:02:50.129> to

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
this is going to take in order for me to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.910 
this is going to take in order for me to
actually<00:02:50.400> get<00:02:50.819> through<00:02:51.120> but<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.349> predict<00:02:52.709> it's

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
actually get through but I predict it's

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.559 
actually get through but I predict it's
going<00:02:53.069> to<00:02:53.129> be<00:02:53.190> quite<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.430> few<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:53.970> I<00:02:54.150> don't

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
going to be quite a few and I don't

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:55.850 
going to be quite a few and I don't
think<00:02:54.810> save<00:02:55.019> states<00:02:55.290> are<00:02:55.440> really<00:02:55.680> going<00:02:55.800> to

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
think save states are really going to

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.890 
think save states are really going to
make<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.160> any<00:02:56.430> easier<00:02:56.599> so<00:02:57.599> I'm<00:02:57.750> probably

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
make this any easier so I'm probably

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.330 
make this any easier so I'm probably
going<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.349> have<00:02:58.409> to<00:02:58.470> get<00:02:58.650> clean<00:02:59.010> through<00:02:59.310> on

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
going to have to get clean through on

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.490 
going to have to get clean through on
one<00:03:00.060> life<00:03:00.300> like<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:03.090> that's<00:03:03.510> going<00:03:04.230> to

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
one life like that so that's going to

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.040 
one life like that so that's going to
really<00:03:04.800> fuck<00:03:05.220> himself<00:03:05.569> save<00:03:06.569> states<00:03:06.840> don't

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
really fuck himself save states don't

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.839 
really fuck himself save states don't
actually<00:03:07.409> make<00:03:07.530> this<00:03:07.800> level<00:03:08.159> or<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.370> last<00:03:08.640> one

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
actually make this level or the last one

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.720 
actually make this level or the last one
any<00:03:09.120> easier<00:03:09.810> which<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.920> why<00:03:11.099> my<00:03:11.280> safe<00:03:11.489> state

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
any easier which is why my safe state

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.880 
any easier which is why my safe state
usages<00:03:12.330> in<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:13.080> last<00:03:13.260> level<00:03:13.470> were<00:03:13.709> like

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
usages in the last level were like

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.670 
usages in the last level were like
absolute<00:03:14.400> rock<00:03:14.640> bottom<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:15.239> use<00:03:16.110> like<00:03:16.260> once<00:03:16.560> a

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
absolute rock bottom I use like once a

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.920 
absolute rock bottom I use like once a
day<00:03:16.980> which<00:03:17.370> was<00:03:17.550> right<00:03:18.120> beginning<00:03:18.510> of<00:03:18.599> a<00:03:18.690> third

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
day which was right beginning of a third

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.809 
day which was right beginning of a third
area<00:03:20.150> if<00:03:21.150> i<00:03:21.360> recall<00:03:21.510> correctly<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:22.400> that<00:03:23.400> was

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
area if i recall correctly and that was

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.580 
area if i recall correctly and that was
pretty<00:03:24.030> much<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.690> for<00:03:25.080> this<00:03:25.200> one<00:03:25.379> I<00:03:25.560> think

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
pretty much it and for this one I think

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.930 
pretty much it and for this one I think
I'm<00:03:25.890> just<00:03:25.920> going<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.459> have<00:03:26.580> the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
I'm just going to have the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.060 
I'm just going to have the
like<00:03:27.180> one<00:03:27.570> save<00:03:27.810> state<00:03:28.110> which<00:03:28.380> happens

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
like one save state which happens

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.690 
like one save state which happens
actually<00:03:29.340> after<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.750> section<00:03:31.350> right<00:03:31.380> here

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
actually after this section right here

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.030 
actually after this section right here
which<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.660> whole<00:03:33.810> vehicle<00:03:34.170> level<00:03:34.680> cart

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
which is the whole vehicle level cart

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.980 
which is the whole vehicle level cart
yeah<00:03:35.520> there's<00:03:35.880> another<00:03:36.240> part<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.600> this<00:03:36.750> level

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
yeah there's another part of this level

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.480 
yeah there's another part of this level
after<00:03:37.320> it's<00:03:37.770> a<00:03:37.830> vehicle<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:39.120> gets<00:03:39.540> worse

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
after it's a vehicle it gets worse

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.020 
after it's a vehicle it gets worse
slightly<00:03:41.990> ever<00:03:42.990> so<00:03:43.290> slightly<00:03:43.710> the<00:03:44.670> orb<00:03:44.850> is

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
slightly ever so slightly the orb is

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.610 
slightly ever so slightly the orb is
naturally<00:03:45.570> a<00:03:45.600> little<00:03:45.690> bit<00:03:46.050> faster<00:03:46.200> than<00:03:46.470> you

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
naturally a little bit faster than you

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.540 
naturally a little bit faster than you
and<00:03:46.800> it<00:03:46.890> catches<00:03:47.040> up<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.430> you<00:03:47.520> on

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
and it catches up to you on

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.220 
and it catches up to you on
straightaways<00:03:48.180> which<00:03:48.750> makes<00:03:48.990> it<00:03:49.110> even

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
straightaways which makes it even

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.230 
straightaways which makes it even
fucking<00:03:49.860> worse<00:03:50.040> because<00:03:50.580> there's<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:51.000> hell<00:03:51.210> of

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
fucking worse because there's a hell of

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.620 
fucking worse because there's a hell of
water<00:03:51.480> straightaways<00:03:52.250> so<00:03:53.250> yeah<00:03:53.630> quick

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
water straightaways so yeah quick

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.530 
water straightaways so yeah quick
reaction<00:03:55.080> time<00:03:55.370> straightaways<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:57.240> Orbis

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
reaction time straightaways the Orbis

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.260 
reaction time straightaways the Orbis
faster<00:03:57.900> than<00:03:58.020> you<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:59.310> entire<00:03:59.610> fucking<00:04:00.060> game

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
faster than you the entire fucking game

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.930 
faster than you the entire fucking game
is<00:04:00.540> coming<00:04:00.840> together<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.680> just<00:04:01.920> rape<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:02.700> in
