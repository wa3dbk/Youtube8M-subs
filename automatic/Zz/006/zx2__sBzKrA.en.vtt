00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.126
&gt;&gt; I did the culinary
arts associate degree,

00:00:03.296 --> 00:00:04.926
and it was absolutely great.

00:00:05.486 --> 00:00:06.686
To be completely
honest with you,

00:00:06.686 --> 00:00:08.016
if I would have went
anywhere else, I don't know

00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:09.886
if I would have even
completed culinary school.

00:00:10.526 --> 00:00:12.976
It was everything about the
experience in that place.

00:00:13.506 --> 00:00:15.716
I wouldn't be in the
role that I am in today

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:17.226
if I didn't have a
Penn College education.

00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:17.976
I mean, I'm the luckiest
girl in town.

00:00:18.516 --> 00:00:34.076
[Music]

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.936
&gt;&gt; Every item a part of
the day-to-day operations

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:37.966
at Greenleaf I'm in charge of.

00:00:38.136 --> 00:00:40.886
So we have two, currently we
have two restaurants, a

00:00:41.286 --> 00:00:43.566
wholesale business, where
we service over 20 locations

00:00:43.916 --> 00:00:45.436
and we have a full
service catering business.

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.836
All of that is under my realm.

00:00:48.516 --> 00:00:52.636
[Music]

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:55.326
&gt;&gt; Safe to say 6 a.m. is
usually start time for me.

00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.676
I'm the first one
in and last one out.

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.036
Some days are long days.

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:00.946
Sometimes it's crazy, chaotic
running between locations,

00:01:00.996 --> 00:01:02.826
but I wouldn't give
that up for anything.

00:01:06.356 --> 00:01:10.176
Greenleaf is all about healthy
lifestyles, so basically we try

00:01:10.176 --> 00:01:13.196
to bring you great flavors,
bring you a really great product

00:01:13.626 --> 00:01:15.746
that can fit into your
healthy lifestyle.

00:01:15.746 --> 00:01:17.226
So we're not trying
to put you on a diet.

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:19.166
Everyone thinks that if
it's good for you or healthy

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.796
that it doesn't taste
good and that it's bland,

00:01:21.126 --> 00:01:23.746
but our whole philosophy
is showing you

00:01:23.746 --> 00:01:26.376
that you can have a healthy
balance, so we layer the flavors

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:27.176
to really make you feel

00:01:27.176 --> 00:01:28.496
like you're not missing
out on anything.

00:01:29.516 --> 00:01:39.816
[Speaking Spanish]

00:01:40.316 --> 00:01:42.656
&gt;&gt; The majority of my
staff do speak Spanish

00:01:42.656 --> 00:01:46.266
as their primary language,
so I speak more Spanish

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.676
than English in a day.

00:01:48.836 --> 00:01:51.426
I have two great teams.

00:01:51.876 --> 00:01:54.316
Like these are the best
kitchen teams I've ever had,

00:01:54.936 --> 00:01:55.766
and they keep me going.

00:01:56.396 --> 00:01:58.776
They work six days, they work
long days just like I do,

00:02:00.096 --> 00:02:01.646
and they keep that
smile on their face,

00:02:01.646 --> 00:02:03.416
and that gives me the
energy to keep doing it.

00:02:04.516 --> 00:02:10.926
[Background sounds]

00:02:11.426 --> 00:02:13.176
&gt;&gt; I have a lot of
creativity in my job

00:02:13.276 --> 00:02:14.476
because Greenleaf
has been growing

00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:15.446
for the past three
and a half years.

00:02:15.516 --> 00:02:17.766
This restaurant started with
a menu that had ten salads

00:02:17.766 --> 00:02:18.336
on it and that was it.

00:02:19.076 --> 00:02:22.316
So from the menu aspect alone,
I have a lot of creativity.

00:02:22.636 --> 00:02:25.096
And then our catering menu is --

00:02:25.886 --> 00:02:28.186
there's no limit to
our catering side.

00:02:28.596 --> 00:02:32.136
But then on just as far as
expanding the company goes,

00:02:32.136 --> 00:02:38.006
I have the opportunity to really
develop things, create things.

00:02:39.216 --> 00:02:43.826
Our clientele is pretty
much everyone and anyone.

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:47.746
We have people that are here
because they are health freaks

00:02:47.806 --> 00:02:49.646
and they only will
eat Greenleaf product.

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:51.306
We have people that are
here because they're trying

00:02:51.456 --> 00:02:54.536
to do the right thing by a
health condition that they have,

00:02:54.536 --> 00:02:55.666
and we have people that are here

00:02:56.226 --> 00:02:57.336
because they're trying
to lose weight.

00:02:57.336 --> 00:02:58.616
And then we have people that
are here and they're like,

00:02:58.616 --> 00:02:59.976
I don't care that it's healthy
for me, it just tastes good.

00:03:00.516 --> 00:03:05.026
[Music]

00:03:05.526 --> 00:03:08.146
&gt;&gt; Each restaurant I
would say probably has

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:10.206
about 500 people walk
through its doors every day.

00:03:10.366 --> 00:03:12.506
That doesn't include any
caterings that we do,

00:03:12.506 --> 00:03:17.676
doesn't include the wholesale
program, because that program,

00:03:17.676 --> 00:03:18.636
that's 20 locations a day.

00:03:20.256 --> 00:03:23.536
I'm still every day amazed
at the amount of product

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:24.916
and production that goes on.

00:03:25.516 --> 00:03:29.576
[Music]

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:32.666
&gt;&gt; I actually can't express how
grateful I am for my education

00:03:32.666 --> 00:03:34.976
at Penn College, from the
professors to the classes

00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:36.966
to just the other students.

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.226
I couldn't guarantee I'd
still be a chef right now.

00:03:39.696 --> 00:03:41.806
Every single one of those
professors took me in

00:03:41.806 --> 00:03:43.026
and really helped
me get through --

00:03:43.026 --> 00:03:44.806
they saw something in me
that I didn't see in myself.

00:03:44.806 --> 00:03:47.666
I had zero self-confidence,
and those professors helped

00:03:47.806 --> 00:03:50.336
to start showing me that I was
capable of doing these things

00:03:50.916 --> 00:03:52.746
and helped to turn
me into the person

00:03:52.746 --> 00:03:54.266
that I could then
cross the country,

00:03:54.896 --> 00:03:57.556
walk into other kitchens
and go from there.

00:03:58.176 --> 00:04:00.096
I think the most important
thing that they taught me

00:04:00.096 --> 00:04:02.106
that I don't think I would find
anywhere else is the passion

00:04:02.106 --> 00:04:03.166
for what they do.

00:04:03.566 --> 00:04:06.086
They truly cared about every
single individual that came

00:04:06.086 --> 00:04:08.336
to their classes, and they
cared that they were trying

00:04:08.336 --> 00:04:09.256
to make a difference
every single day.

00:04:09.626 --> 00:04:11.366
That's the same philosophy
that I walk into my kitchen.

00:04:11.776 --> 00:04:13.166
So I know if I walk
in like that,

00:04:13.976 --> 00:04:14.996
we can make anything happen.

00:04:15.686 --> 00:04:19.976
My success today started by
me going to Penn College.
