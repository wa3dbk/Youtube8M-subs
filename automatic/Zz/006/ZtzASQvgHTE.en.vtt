00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.080

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.830
 children from groups 3 to 8 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.720

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.060

 mickey van de hart and ricardo van rhijn 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.540
 the visit to the morskring was mostly 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.129
 for the latter special because of 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.530
 Rhine times thus returned to his old 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.390
 primary school and so the afternoon preceded 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.520
 him also in the sign of retrieving 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.700

 best done when i have always done very well 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.390
 then we are aware that you are definitely another 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.120
 all the time since I was on the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.920
 elementary school was in with master herman 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.080
 the class 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.830
 good fun to meet again for a name 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.630
 For a long time I was the nice master 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.090
 that is certainly a nice thing if i do occasionally 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.640
 a little spray but no, I am sure 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.640
 had a nice time 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.140
 the year in they are in its class 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.229
 something more than good memories 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.450
 what I can remember from Ricardo was 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.240
 that was just a very quiet student 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.890
 little need to grumble and actually 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.869
 it naturally fell on the pier rube 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.110
 everything for his change and that made 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.900
 I don't know that anymore but according to 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.409
 little was wrong with you 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.759
 school performance good enough image 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.200
 of Rhine and nature were especially 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.420
 come to lead to the children of 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.500
 de bos kring their ajax streetwise diploma 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.180
 to reach out 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.520
 this diploma could be during the week 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.110
 earn during the lessons in the framework 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.030
 from ajax streetwise these were 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.890
 all in the sign of ajax 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.479
 that meant that the players of ajax 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.479
 all subjects served as an example 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.250
 that is of course a completely different one 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.830
 Then roll over early where you were used to 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.360

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.690

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.310

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.190

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.500

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.640
 times of ajax is that was 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.920
