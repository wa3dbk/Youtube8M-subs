00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.270 
review just on them and it's kind of
important<00:00:14.690> because<00:00:14.950> hopefully<00:00:15.950> we'll<00:00:16.100> save

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:16.280 
important because hopefully we'll save

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.900 
important because hopefully we'll save
you<00:00:16.370> some<00:00:16.430> money

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
you some money

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.240 
you some money
I<00:00:16.940> mean<00:00:17.690> is<00:00:17.780> all<00:00:17.900> just<00:00:18.080> my<00:00:18.200> opinion<00:00:18.590> but<00:00:18.800> yeah

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
I mean is all just my opinion but yeah

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.080 
I mean is all just my opinion but yeah
here<00:00:19.430> goes<00:00:19.870> so<00:00:20.870> this<00:00:20.990> is<00:00:21.170> a<00:00:21.200> smudge<00:00:21.500> guard<00:00:22.090> that

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
here goes so this is a smudge guard that

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.330 
here goes so this is a smudge guard that
higher<00:00:23.300> bar<00:00:23.600> I<00:00:23.840> believe<00:00:24.440> that<00:00:24.680> is<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:24.950> same<00:00:24.980> as

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
higher bar I believe that is the same as

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.580 
higher bar I believe that is the same as
the<00:00:25.880> one<00:00:26.030> you<00:00:26.120> get<00:00:26.210> off<00:00:26.330> the<00:00:26.420> actual<00:00:26.660> Wacom

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
the one you get off the actual Wacom

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.410 
the one you get off the actual Wacom
website<00:00:27.980> so<00:00:28.160> it's<00:00:28.280> the<00:00:28.370> official<00:00:28.550> one<00:00:28.760> a<00:00:29.150> few

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
website so it's the official one a few

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.490 
website so it's the official one a few
websites<00:00:29.600> sell<00:00:29.990> them<00:00:30.140> but<00:00:30.290> there<00:00:30.380> are<00:00:30.410> a

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
websites sell them but there are a

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.439 
websites sell them but there are a
similar<00:00:30.800> price<00:00:32.079> I<00:00:33.079> got<00:00:33.980> mine<00:00:34.160> on<00:00:34.309> Amazon<00:00:34.519> I'm

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
similar price I got mine on Amazon I'm

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.750 
similar price I got mine on Amazon I'm
in<00:00:35.629> the<00:00:35.719> UK<00:00:35.899> and<00:00:36.230> it<00:00:36.320> cost<00:00:36.530> me<00:00:36.589> about<00:00:36.710> 32<00:00:37.519> pounds

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
in the UK and it cost me about 32 pounds

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.540 
in the UK and it cost me about 32 pounds
which<00:00:38.149> it's<00:00:38.660> pretty<00:00:38.929> pretty<00:00:39.920> damn<00:00:40.129> ridiculous

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
which it's pretty pretty damn ridiculous

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.919 
which it's pretty pretty damn ridiculous
for<00:00:40.999> a<00:00:41.059> smudge<00:00:41.300> guard<00:00:41.570> but<00:00:43.449> you<00:00:44.449> do<00:00:44.600> need<00:00:44.780> it

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
for a smudge guard but you do need it

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.319 
for a smudge guard but you do need it
too<00:00:44.989> much<00:00:45.109> guard<00:00:45.379> if<00:00:45.530> you<00:00:45.559> use<00:00:45.859> in<00:00:46.039> a<00:00:46.460> Cintiq<00:00:47.030> or

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
too much guard if you use in a Cintiq or

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.090 
too much guard if you use in a Cintiq or
a<00:00:47.359> similar<00:00:48.019> tablet<00:00:48.409> where<00:00:48.559> it<00:00:48.649> has<00:00:48.800> your<00:00:48.920> hand

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
a similar tablet where it has your hand

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.599 
a similar tablet where it has your hand
pressing<00:00:49.519> on<00:00:49.609> the<00:00:49.730> screen<00:00:49.820> because<00:00:51.129> well<00:00:52.129> from

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
pressing on the screen because well from

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.130 
pressing on the screen because well from
what<00:00:52.789> people<00:00:52.969> have<00:00:53.089> told<00:00:53.239> me<00:00:53.449> the<00:00:53.659> oils<00:00:53.989> in

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
what people have told me the oils in

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.049 
what people have told me the oils in
your<00:00:54.170> skin<00:00:54.260> can<00:00:54.620> damage<00:00:54.949> this<00:00:55.100> damage<00:00:55.879> the

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.069 
it mucky especially me when I'm drawing
as<00:01:01.280> gross<00:01:01.729> as<00:01:01.760> it<00:01:01.940> is<00:01:02.030> I<00:01:02.239> get<00:01:02.479> like<00:01:02.629> my<00:01:02.899> hands

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
as gross as it is I get like my hands

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.410 
as gross as it is I get like my hands
get<00:01:03.260> its<00:01:03.409> way<00:01:03.640> after<00:01:04.640> a<00:01:04.670> while<00:01:04.880> it<00:01:05.300> sounds

get its way after a while it sounds

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.680 
get its way after a while it sounds
really<00:01:05.600> gross<00:01:05.810> but<00:01:06.110> so<00:01:07.330> it's<00:01:08.330> even<00:01:08.570> more

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
really gross but so it's even more

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.600 
really gross but so it's even more
important<00:01:09.530> if<00:01:09.620> you<00:01:09.920> know<00:01:10.040> like<00:01:10.190> me<00:01:10.340> you<00:01:10.460> get

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
important if you know like me you get

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.660 
important if you know like me you get
that<00:01:10.870> but<00:01:11.870> when<00:01:12.830> I<00:01:12.860> ordered<00:01:13.160> this<00:01:13.250> much<00:01:13.460> guard

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
that but when I ordered this much guard

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.860 
that but when I ordered this much guard
everywhere<00:01:14.390> it<00:01:14.510> looked

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
everywhere it looked

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.850 
everywhere it looked
I<00:01:15.050> had<00:01:15.380> like<00:01:15.590> a<00:01:15.620> 2<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:16.310> 3<00:01:16.550> weeks<00:01:16.580> delivery

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
I had like a 2 to 3 weeks delivery

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.290 
I had like a 2 to 3 weeks delivery
delivery<00:01:18.860> estimate<00:01:19.370> on<00:01:19.430> it<00:01:19.520> which<00:01:19.640> I<00:01:19.970> have<00:01:20.060> no

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
delivery estimate on it which I have no

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.760 
delivery estimate on it which I have no
idea<00:01:20.600> why<00:01:20.780> presumably<00:01:21.290> just<00:01:21.350> don't<00:01:21.590> sell

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
idea why presumably just don't sell

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.620 
idea why presumably just don't sell
around<00:01:21.890> here<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:22.520> you<00:01:23.150> know<00:01:23.270> I've<00:01:23.390> got<00:01:23.540> to

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
around here and you know I've got to

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.320 
around here and you know I've got to
send<00:01:23.750> him<00:01:23.870> from<00:01:24.020> afar<00:01:24.260> and<00:01:24.970> that<00:01:25.970> was<00:01:26.120> such<00:01:26.300> a

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
send him from afar and that was such a

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.030 
send him from afar and that was such a
pain<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:26.930> I<00:01:26.990> wouldn't<00:01:27.200> have<00:01:27.290> spent<00:01:27.470> a<00:01:27.620> 2-pound

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
pain and I wouldn't have spent a 2-pound

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.160 
pain and I wouldn't have spent a 2-pound
minute<00:01:28.250> but<00:01:28.610> I<00:01:28.850> had<00:01:29.300> some<00:01:29.480> Amazon<00:01:29.780> vouchers<00:01:29.900> so

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
minute but I had some Amazon vouchers so

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.570 
minute but I had some Amazon vouchers so
that's<00:01:30.320> why<00:01:30.440> I<00:01:30.470> did<00:01:30.620> it<00:01:30.650> but<00:01:30.740> whilst<00:01:31.430> I<00:01:31.550> was

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
that's why I did it but whilst I was

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.910 
that's why I did it but whilst I was
waiting<00:01:32.000> for<00:01:32.030> that<00:01:32.180> I<00:01:32.590> literally<00:01:33.590> went<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:33.800> the

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
waiting for that I literally went to the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.220 
waiting for that I literally went to the
pound<00:01:34.130> shop<00:01:34.460> and<00:01:35.390> bought<00:01:35.570> some<00:01:35.930> gloves

although I'm pretty sure this one's a

although I'm pretty sure this one's a
woman's<00:01:37.820> glove<00:01:37.940> but<00:01:38.240> you<00:01:38.360> know<00:01:38.450> I<00:01:38.660> guess
