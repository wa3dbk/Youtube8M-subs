00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.159 
assignments he racing school and that's
what<00:00:27.520> I<00:00:27.550> really<00:00:27.790> wanted<00:00:27.970> to<00:00:28.029> do<00:00:28.180> so<00:00:28.450> it<00:00:29.020> was

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
what I really wanted to do so it was

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.810 
what I really wanted to do so it was
really<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:29.529> big<00:00:29.710> inspiration<00:00:30.250> for<00:00:30.430> me<00:00:30.550> to<00:00:30.700> get

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
really the big inspiration for me to get

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.270 
really the big inspiration for me to get
started<00:00:31.390> see<00:00:31.480> racing

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.240 

I<00:00:34.750> think<00:00:35.750> it<00:00:35.960> you<00:00:36.469> know<00:00:36.590> only<00:00:36.800> happening<00:00:37.129> here

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
I think it you know only happening here

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.500 
I think it you know only happening here
before<00:00:37.489> years<00:00:37.670> part<00:00:37.940> of<00:00:38.000> it<00:00:38.090> but<00:00:38.149> I<00:00:38.210> think<00:00:38.239> it

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
before years part of it but I think it

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.200 
before years part of it but I think it
also<00:00:38.539> has<00:00:39.219> such<00:00:40.219> a<00:00:40.250> bigger<00:00:40.519> meaning<00:00:40.789> than<00:00:41.000> just

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
also has such a bigger meaning than just

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.700 
also has such a bigger meaning than just
the<00:00:41.300> sports<00:00:41.510> in<00:00:41.690> general<00:00:41.840> you<00:00:42.110> know<00:00:42.170> as<00:00:42.410> you

the sports in general you know as you

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.290

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
know it's always played some sort of

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.479 
know it's always played some sort of
role<00:00:44.510> outside<00:00:45.079> of<00:00:45.410> that<00:00:45.500> and<00:00:45.680> our<00:00:45.949> society<00:00:46.460> I

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
think really some of the best

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.540 
think really some of the best
preparation<00:02:14.230> for<00:02:14.560> olympics<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.130> get<00:02:15.250> lots<00:02:15.370> of

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
preparation for olympics to get lots of

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.590 
preparation for olympics to get lots of
Zeus<00:02:15.760> involved

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.360 

my<00:02:19.600> parents<00:02:19.990> have<00:02:20.110> him<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.410> hidden<00:02:20.770> away<00:02:20.920> they

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
my parents have him I hidden away they

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.420 
my parents have him I hidden away they
don't<00:02:21.520> trust<00:02:21.640> me<00:02:21.850> with<00:02:21.880> them

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.759 

no<00:02:26.329> I'm<00:02:26.569> just<00:02:26.719> really<00:02:26.959> looking<00:02:26.989> forward<00:02:27.409> to<00:02:27.439> be

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
no I'm just really looking forward to be

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.110 
no I'm just really looking forward to be
competitive<00:02:28.099> side<00:02:28.430> of<00:02:28.549> that<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.700> think<00:02:28.730> when

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
competitive side of that I think when

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.089 
competitive side of that I think when
you're<00:02:29.209> an<00:02:29.299> athlete<00:02:29.390> you<00:02:29.810> really<00:02:30.049> focus<00:02:30.709> on

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
you're an athlete you really focus on

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.500 
you're an athlete you really focus on
what<00:02:31.340> you're<00:02:31.400> trying<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.730> do<00:02:31.849> I<00:02:31.879> mean<00:02:32.239> I<00:02:32.269> think

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
what you're trying to do I mean I think

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.750 
what you're trying to do I mean I think
the<00:02:33.049> whole<00:02:33.200> exterior<00:02:33.829> side<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.430> it<00:02:34.519> what<00:02:34.670> the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
the whole exterior side of it what the

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.580 
the whole exterior side of it what the
games<00:02:34.939> are<00:02:35.120> all<00:02:35.239> about<00:02:35.269> it's<00:02:35.659> cool<00:02:36.109> but<00:02:36.349> you

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
games are all about it's cool but you

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.229 
games are all about it's cool but you
know<00:02:36.950> I'm<00:02:37.069> really<00:02:37.219> there<00:02:37.549> to<00:02:37.579> try<00:02:37.819> to<00:02:37.879> hook<00:02:38.120> the

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
know I'm really there to try to hook the

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.000 
know I'm really there to try to hook the
white<00:02:38.359> metals<00:02:38.689> that's<00:02:38.870> like<00:02:39.079> the<00:02:39.260> mango<00:02:39.439> color

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
white metals that's like the mango color

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.949 
white metals that's like the mango color
so<00:02:40.400> it'll<00:02:41.180> certainly<00:02:41.359> it's<00:02:41.659> going<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.900> be

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
so it'll certainly it's going to be

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.449 
so it'll certainly it's going to be
interesting<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.530> see<00:02:42.709> how<00:02:42.920> it's<00:02:43.129> all<00:02:43.250> come

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
interesting to see how it's all come

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.920 
interesting to see how it's all come
together<00:02:43.579> l<00:02:43.969> don't<00:02:44.180> have<00:02:44.389> been<00:02:44.719> there<00:02:44.900> a

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
together l don't have been there a

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.050 
together l don't have been there a
couple<00:02:44.959> times<00:02:45.170> now<00:02:45.469> but<00:02:46.189> you<00:02:46.459> know<00:02:46.519> every<00:02:46.939> time

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
couple times now but you know every time

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.550 
couple times now but you know every time
been<00:02:47.329> there<00:02:47.510> it's<00:02:47.599> been<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:48.049> far<00:02:48.260> away<00:02:48.500> from

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
been there it's been so far away from

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.500 
been there it's been so far away from
looking<00:02:48.980> like<00:02:49.010> they're<00:02:49.760> gonna<00:02:49.879> put<00:02:50.120> on<00:02:50.299> a<00:02:50.329> big

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
looking like they're gonna put on a big

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.539 
looking like they're gonna put on a big
event<00:02:50.659> but<00:02:51.129> you<00:02:52.129> know<00:02:52.189> we'll<00:02:52.340> see<00:02:52.370> how<00:02:52.519> it

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
event but you know we'll see how it

00:02:52.549 --> 00:03:05.309 
event but you know we'll see how it
turns<00:02:52.639> out

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.379
