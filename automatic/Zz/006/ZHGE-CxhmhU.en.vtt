doing<00:00:22.910> i'm<00:00:23.210> in<00:00:23.360> the<00:00:23.689> process<00:00:23.869> of<00:00:24.290> a<00:00:24.380> major

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529

doing i'm in the process of a major
project<00:00:24.860> i<00:00:25.369> have<00:00:25.759> a<00:00:26.000> lot<00:00:26.300> of<00:00:26.360> the<00:00:26.800> wooden

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
project i have a lot of the wooden

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.530 
project i have a lot of the wooden
mountains<00:00:28.250> wood<00:00:28.939> mounted<00:00:29.689> rubber<00:00:29.930> stamps<00:00:30.470> and

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
mountains wood mounted rubber stamps and

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.139 
mountains wood mounted rubber stamps and
i<00:00:32.540> wanted<00:00:33.110> to<00:00:33.140> convert<00:00:33.590> these<00:00:33.860> over<00:00:34.700> so<00:00:34.970> that<00:00:35.000> i

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
i wanted to convert these over so that i

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.799 
i wanted to convert these over so that i
can<00:00:35.300> use<00:00:35.480> them<00:00:35.840> with<00:00:35.960> my<00:00:36.140> acrylic<00:00:36.559> blocks<00:00:37.809> it

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
can use them with my acrylic blocks it

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.650 
can use them with my acrylic blocks it
just<00:00:38.989> seems<00:00:39.170> a<00:00:39.260> lot<00:00:39.440> easier<00:00:39.590> saves<00:00:40.399> on<00:00:40.660> storage

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
just seems a lot easier saves on storage

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.400 
just seems a lot easier saves on storage
space<00:00:42.020> and<00:00:42.050> everything<00:00:42.800> and<00:00:44.170> most<00:00:45.170> of<00:00:45.290> them

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
space and everything and most of them

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.170 
space and everything and most of them
have<00:00:45.470> already<00:00:45.920> got<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.340> rubber<00:00:46.520> removes<00:00:46.970> all

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
have already got the rubber removes all

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.610 
have already got the rubber removes all
the<00:00:47.240> wooden<00:00:47.570> blocks<00:00:47.810> and<00:00:48.170> i<00:00:48.260> even<00:00:48.380> have

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
the wooden blocks and i even have

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.490 
the wooden blocks and i even have
someone<00:00:48.980> to<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.160> foam<00:00:49.540> soft<00:00:50.540> foam<00:00:50.780> blocks<00:00:51.140> a

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
someone to the foam soft foam blocks a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.040 
someone to the foam soft foam blocks a
little<00:00:52.130> bit<00:00:52.340> of<00:00:52.370> a<00:00:52.490> cheaper<00:00:52.880> stamp<00:00:53.210> so<00:00:53.930> those

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
little bit of a cheaper stamp so those

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.390 
little bit of a cheaper stamp so those
ones<00:00:54.230> are<00:00:54.350> a<00:00:54.380> little<00:00:54.410> bit<00:00:54.650> more<00:00:54.800> difficult<00:00:55.010> to

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
ones are a little bit more difficult to

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.160 
ones are a little bit more difficult to
remove<00:00:56.320> but<00:00:57.340> what<00:00:58.340> i<00:00:58.370> did<00:00:58.640> is<00:00:59.030> i<00:00:59.060> just<00:00:59.329> easily

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
remove but what i did is i just easily

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.610 
remove but what i did is i just easily
worked<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:01.670> rubber<00:01:01.940> up<00:01:02.270> off<00:01:02.600> of<00:01:02.630> the<00:01:02.960> foam<00:01:03.200> pad

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
worked the rubber up off of the foam pad

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.660 
worked the rubber up off of the foam pad
underneath<00:01:04.009> and<00:01:05.020> peeled<00:01:06.020> it<00:01:06.140> right<00:01:06.380> off<00:01:06.670> if

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
underneath and peeled it right off if

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.520 
underneath and peeled it right off if
you<00:01:07.820> find<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:08.180> difficult<00:01:08.240> getting<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.290> rubber

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
you find it difficult getting the rubber

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.120 
you find it difficult getting the rubber
stamp<00:01:09.950> part<00:01:10.280> off<00:01:10.490> of<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:10.909> block<00:01:11.180> i<00:01:12.100> saw<00:01:13.100> a

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
stamp part off of the block i saw a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.950 
stamp part off of the block i saw a
video<00:01:13.460> where<00:01:13.820> they<00:01:14.030> said<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:14.300> can<00:01:14.479> put<00:01:14.750> it<00:01:14.840> in

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
video where they said you can put it in

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.140 
video where they said you can put it in
the<00:01:15.050> microwave<00:01:15.200> for<00:01:15.710> maybe<00:01:16.010> 10<00:01:16.220> or<00:01:16.250> 15<00:01:16.430> seconds

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
the microwave for maybe 10 or 15 seconds

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.870 
the microwave for maybe 10 or 15 seconds
it<00:01:17.570> softens<00:01:17.930> to<00:01:18.290> glue<00:01:18.530> up<00:01:18.740> then<00:01:19.310> you<00:01:19.490> can<00:01:19.670> pull

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
it softens to glue up then you can pull

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.870 
it softens to glue up then you can pull
it<00:01:20.030> off<00:01:20.150> or<00:01:20.680> you<00:01:21.680> can<00:01:21.860> hit<00:01:21.979> it<00:01:22.040> with<00:01:22.250> your<00:01:22.280> heat

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
it off or you can hit it with your heat

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.719 
it off or you can hit it with your heat
gun<00:01:22.909> to<00:01:24.610> try<00:01:25.610> to<00:01:25.670> soften<00:01:25.940> up<00:01:26.240> glue<00:01:26.510> up<00:01:26.690> also

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
gun to try to soften up glue up also

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.539 
gun to try to soften up glue up also
then<00:01:28.729> I<00:01:28.970> just<00:01:29.150> pause<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.600> wooden<00:01:29.870> block<00:01:30.049> aside

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
then I just pause the wooden block aside

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.160 
then I just pause the wooden block aside
you<00:01:31.549> want<00:01:31.700> to<00:01:31.790> take<00:01:31.940> a<00:01:31.970> very<00:01:32.299> sharp<00:01:32.630> pointy

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
you want to take a very sharp pointy

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.230 
you want to take a very sharp pointy
pair<00:01:33.440> of<00:01:33.530> scissors<00:01:33.890> these<00:01:34.400> must<00:01:34.640> make<00:01:34.850> clean

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
pair of scissors these must make clean

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.430 
pair of scissors these must make clean
because<00:01:35.420> they<00:01:35.570> got<00:01:35.720> glue<00:01:36.530> icky<00:01:36.920> on<00:01:37.100> them<00:01:38.080> but<00:01:39.080> I

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
because they got glue icky on them but I

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:52.360 
because they got glue icky on them but I
cut<00:01:40.100> very<00:01:40.909> close<00:01:41.920> to<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.070> image

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.520 

you<00:01:52.910> want<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.330> pair<00:01:53.870> of<00:01:53.960> scissors<00:01:54.350> are<00:01:54.500> sharp

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
you want a pair of scissors are sharp

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:02.380 
you want a pair of scissors are sharp
and<00:01:55.720> point<00:01:56.720> it<00:01:59.980> get<00:02:00.980> as<00:02:01.100> close<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.790> image

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
and point it get as close to the image

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:12.620 
and point it get as close to the image
as<00:02:02.540> you<00:02:02.660> can<00:02:05.080> to<00:02:06.080> get<00:02:06.200> around<00:02:06.440> those<00:02:06.590> corners

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.600 

I<00:02:12.690> chose<00:02:13.620> see<00:02:13.920> if<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.370> demonstration

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
I chose see if this is a demonstration

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.720 
I chose see if this is a demonstration
because<00:02:15.210> it's<00:02:15.390> pretty<00:02:15.630> much<00:02:15.720> just<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:16.140> square

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
because it's pretty much just a square

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.910 
because it's pretty much just a square
so<00:02:17.730> what<00:02:17.970> makes<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.810> video<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.140> lot<00:02:19.290> easier<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.710> do

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
so what makes a video a lot easier to do

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.010 
so what makes a video a lot easier to do
than<00:02:20.160> if<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.460> had<00:02:20.490> a<00:02:20.970> bunch<00:02:21.600> of<00:02:21.720> nooks<00:02:21.900> and

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
than if I had a bunch of nooks and

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.600 
than if I had a bunch of nooks and
crannies<00:02:23.540> okay<00:02:24.740> and<00:02:25.740> I<00:02:25.830> kind<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.130> remove<00:02:26.430> those

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
crannies okay and I kind of remove those

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.170 
crannies okay and I kind of remove those
pieces<00:02:27.020> then<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.140> have<00:02:28.290> your<00:02:28.700> stamp<00:02:29.700> all<00:02:29.910> nice

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
pieces then you have your stamp all nice

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.270 
pieces then you have your stamp all nice
and<00:02:30.360> cut<00:02:30.510> out<00:02:30.660> there<00:02:31.410> are<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.530> couple<00:02:31.680> ways<00:02:32.070> of

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
and cut out there are a couple ways of

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.240 
and cut out there are a couple ways of
mounting<00:02:32.640> these<00:02:33.530> one<00:02:34.530> way<00:02:34.770> is<00:02:36.890> what<00:02:37.890> they<00:02:38.010> call

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
mounting these one way is what they call

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.180 
mounting these one way is what they call
easy<00:02:38.670> mount<00:02:39.180> Stampin<00:02:39.720> store<00:02:40.020> I've<00:02:40.290> mounted<00:02:40.920> a

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
easy mount Stampin store I've mounted a

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.040 
easy mount Stampin store I've mounted a
few<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.490> my<00:02:41.610> stance<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:42.090> this<00:02:42.330> just<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.750> try<00:02:43.020> it

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
few of my stance on this just to try it

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.130 
few of my stance on this just to try it
out<00:02:43.230> I'm<00:02:43.830> not<00:02:44.460> sure<00:02:44.750> which<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.960> two

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
out I'm not sure which of the two

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.480 
out I'm not sure which of the two
methods<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.740> ideas<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.280> like<00:02:47.460> the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
methods to the ideas that I like the

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.660 
methods to the ideas that I like the
best<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:50.400> here<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.120> double<00:02:51.900> sided<00:02:52.310> one<00:02:53.310> side

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
best this here is double sided one side

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.060 
best this here is double sided one side
is<00:02:54.060> very<00:02:54.510> sticky<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.500> once<00:02:55.710> you<00:02:55.830> have<00:02:55.980> your

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
is very sticky so once you have your

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.700 
is very sticky so once you have your
stamp<00:02:56.370> cut<00:02:56.580> out<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:57.720> put<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.020> on<00:02:58.140> there<00:02:58.440> and

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
stamp cut out you put it on there and

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.360 
stamp cut out you put it on there and
then<00:02:58.770> you<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.670> you<00:03:00.420> cut<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:00.720> around<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:02.040> stamp

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
then you and you cut it around the stamp

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.920 
then you and you cut it around the stamp
and<00:03:04.310> this<00:03:05.310> side<00:03:05.640> over<00:03:06.630> here<00:03:07.170> peels<00:03:07.830> off<00:03:08.930> not

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
and this side over here peels off not

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.380 
and this side over here peels off not
really<00:03:10.320> tacky<00:03:10.650> as<00:03:11.010> smooth<00:03:11.340> as<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.520> clings<00:03:11.970> to

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
really tacky as smooth as it clings to

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.090 
really tacky as smooth as it clings to
your<00:03:12.990> acrylic<00:03:13.470> block<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:15.420> way<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:16.100> the
