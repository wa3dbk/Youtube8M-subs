who's<00:02:47.920> a<00:02:47.950> value<00:02:48.550> pick<00:02:48.820> where<00:02:49.300> he<00:02:49.420> was<00:02:49.570> drafted

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
who's a value pick where he was drafted

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.750 
who's a value pick where he was drafted
the<00:02:50.140> tackle<00:02:50.800> from<00:02:50.890> Southern<00:02:51.220> Miss<00:02:51.370> but<00:02:51.550> still

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
the tackle from Southern Miss but still

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.760 
the tackle from Southern Miss but still
a<00:02:51.790> project<00:02:52.390> so<00:02:52.570> I'm<00:02:52.720> sort<00:02:52.930> of<00:02:52.959> weighing<00:02:53.230> the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
a project so I'm sort of weighing the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.020 
a project so I'm sort of weighing the
fact<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.070> he<00:02:54.160> was<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.400> good<00:02:54.580> value<00:02:54.760> where<00:02:54.940> he

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
fact that he was a good value where he

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.550 
fact that he was a good value where he
was<00:02:55.120> taken<00:02:55.360> but<00:02:55.420> he<00:02:55.540> is<00:02:55.660> he<00:02:55.870> doesn't<00:02:56.020> need<00:02:56.260> work

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
was taken but he is he doesn't need work

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.530 
was taken but he is he doesn't need work
so<00:02:57.070> that<00:02:57.340> it's<00:02:57.670> sort<00:02:57.820> of<00:02:57.910> conflicting<00:02:58.390> in<00:02:58.480> my

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
so that it's sort of conflicting in my

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.510 
so that it's sort of conflicting in my
mind<00:02:58.750> Charles<00:02:59.080> Mitchell<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.440> safety<00:02:59.800> has<00:03:00.490> a

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
mind Charles Mitchell the safety has a

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.550 
mind Charles Mitchell the safety has a
chance<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.970> play<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.540> add<00:03:01.660> to<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.050> depth<00:03:02.350> in

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
chance to play and add to the depth in

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.110 
chance to play and add to the depth in
the<00:03:02.680> secondary<00:03:03.100> which<00:03:03.310> has<00:03:03.430> been<00:03:03.580> suspect<00:03:03.790> at

the secondary which has been suspect at

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.760 
the secondary which has been suspect at
times<00:03:04.150> what<00:03:04.570> they<00:03:04.630> do<00:03:04.780> add<00:03:04.959> Asante<00:03:05.410> Samuel

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
times what they do add Asante Samuel

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.260 
times what they do add Asante Samuel
which<00:03:05.920> i<00:03:06.010> think<00:03:06.070> is<00:03:06.220> important<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.700> note<00:03:06.880> you

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270

which i think is important to note you
know<00:03:07.330> that<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.660> secondary<00:03:08.170> is<00:03:08.410> something

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
know that the secondary is something
