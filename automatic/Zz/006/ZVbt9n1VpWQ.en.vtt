unagi now you cut at a 45 degree angle

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.070 
unagi now you cut at a 45 degree angle
to<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.010> board<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.790> 45-degree<00:01:15.540> angle<00:01:15.570> to

that masago just place it on the end it
won't<00:02:58.150> completely<00:02:58.720> seed<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.380> but<00:02:59.709> it<00:02:59.950> will<00:03:00.100> add

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
won't completely seed it but it will add

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.250 
won't completely seed it but it will add
some<00:03:00.610> moisture<00:03:00.820> and<00:03:01.120> that<00:03:01.299> will<00:03:01.540> help<00:03:01.690> the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
some moisture and that will help the

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.280 
some moisture and that will help the
nori<00:03:02.790> close<00:03:03.790> together<00:03:04.239> better<00:03:04.480> all<00:03:05.079> right<00:03:05.200> so

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
nori close together better all right so

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.050 
nori close together better all right so
if<00:03:05.380> you<00:03:05.500> roll<00:03:05.799> it<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.100> rest<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.579> over<00:03:06.910> that

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
if you roll it and rest it over that

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.970 
if you roll it and rest it over that
seal<00:03:07.329> okay<00:03:08.019> while<00:03:08.230> its<00:03:08.410> resting<00:03:08.739> I'm<00:03:08.860> just

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
seal okay while its resting I'm just

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.680 
seal okay while its resting I'm just
going<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.160> cut<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.430> edges<00:03:09.549> off<00:03:09.790> because<00:03:10.450> I

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
going to cut the edges off because I

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.330 
going to cut the edges off because I
don't<00:03:10.900> want<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.140> tempura<00:03:11.560> batter<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:12.130> get

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
don't want the tempura batter to get

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.330 
don't want the tempura batter to get
into<00:03:12.880> a<00:03:12.910> crevasse<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:14.049> then<00:03:14.200> have<00:03:14.799> a<00:03:14.829> big<00:03:15.130> lump

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
into a crevasse and then have a big lump

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.430 
into a crevasse and then have a big lump
uncooked<00:03:15.880> tempura<00:03:16.239> batter<00:03:16.480> so<00:03:17.079> I'm<00:03:17.200> cutting

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
uncooked tempura batter so I'm cutting

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.289 
uncooked tempura batter so I'm cutting
the<00:03:17.680> edges<00:03:18.070> of<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.459> roll<00:03:18.700> so<00:03:18.970> that<00:03:19.000> I<00:03:19.090> have<00:03:19.269> a

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
the edges of the roll so that I have a

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.750 
the edges of the roll so that I have a
flush<00:03:19.750> surface<00:03:20.109> all<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.620> way<00:03:20.799> around<00:03:21.130> but<00:03:21.640> the

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
flush surface all the way around but the

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.090 
flush surface all the way around but the
batter<00:03:21.970> can<00:03:22.090> just<00:03:22.359> evenly<00:03:22.750> cover<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.500> there's

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
batter can just evenly cover and there's

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.599 
batter can just evenly cover and there's
no<00:03:24.220> crevices<00:03:24.850> for<00:03:25.090> it<00:03:25.180> again<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:26.370> just<00:03:27.370> put<00:03:27.519> this

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
no crevices for it again I just put this

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:28.110 
no crevices for it again I just put this
to<00:03:27.730> one<00:03:27.820> side

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
to one side

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.720 
to one side
oh<00:03:28.299> it's<00:03:29.200> now<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:29.470> make<00:03:29.739> a<00:03:29.769> tempura<00:03:30.220> batter<00:03:30.280> mix

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
oh it's now to make a tempura batter mix

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.580 
oh it's now to make a tempura batter mix
first<00:03:31.090> we're<00:03:31.269> going<00:03:31.359> to<00:03:31.420> do<00:03:31.570> a<00:03:31.600> liquid<00:03:32.109> mix<00:03:32.350> and

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
first we're going to do a liquid mix and

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.840 
first we're going to do a liquid mix and
you're<00:03:32.859> going<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.010> put<00:03:33.160> this<00:03:33.250> into<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.519> fridge

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
you're going to put this into the fridge

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.039 
you're going to put this into the fridge
and<00:03:34.090> leave<00:03:34.420> it<00:03:34.540> overnight

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
and leave it overnight

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.949 
and leave it overnight
so<00:03:35.350> technically<00:03:35.739> use<00:03:36.100> day<00:03:36.430> before<00:03:36.760> just<00:03:37.000> to

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
so technically use day before just to

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.099 
so technically use day before just to
cool<00:03:38.140> down<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:39.070> first<00:03:39.310> thing<00:03:39.459> you<00:03:39.549> add<00:03:39.730> is<00:03:40.109> 110

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
cool down the first thing you add is 110

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.599 
cool down the first thing you add is 110
grams<00:03:41.470> of<00:03:41.769> water<00:03:42.040> or<00:03:42.190> hundred<00:03:42.459> ten

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
grams of water or hundred ten

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.150 
grams of water or hundred ten
milliliters<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.299> then<00:03:43.989> you<00:03:44.079> add<00:03:44.200> 20<00:03:44.620> grams<00:03:44.890> of

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
milliliters and then you add 20 grams of

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.599 
milliliters and then you add 20 grams of
vodka

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
vodka

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.240 
vodka
now<00:03:46.120> with<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.359> vodka<00:03:46.720> does<00:03:46.959> is<00:03:47.230> it<00:03:47.440> lowers<00:03:47.709> the

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
now with the vodka does is it lowers the

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.130 
now with the vodka does is it lowers the
boiling<00:03:48.519> point<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.630> mixture

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
boiling point of the mixture

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.830 
boiling point of the mixture
and<00:03:50.280> it<00:03:51.280> creates<00:03:51.640> a<00:03:51.730> bigger<00:03:51.940> reaction<00:03:52.180> in<00:03:52.750> the

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
and it creates a bigger reaction in the

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.420 
and it creates a bigger reaction in the
deep-fryer<00:03:53.200> so<00:03:53.890> that's<00:03:54.040> how<00:03:54.190> you<00:03:54.250> get<00:03:54.370> more

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
deep-fryer so that's how you get more

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.580 
deep-fryer so that's how you get more
puffiness<00:03:55.120> out<00:03:55.330> of<00:03:55.510> it<00:03:57.420> okay<00:03:58.420> so<00:03:59.290> once<00:03:59.470> you've

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
puffiness out of it okay so once you've

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.150 
puffiness out of it okay so once you've
added<00:03:59.710> that<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:00.550> add<00:04:00.700> 30<00:04:01.210> grams<00:04:01.660> of<00:04:02.500> sacking

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
added that you add 30 grams of sacking

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.420 
added that you add 30 grams of sacking
now<00:04:03.340> sake<00:04:03.820> is<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.110> sweet<00:04:05.110> Japanese<00:04:05.680> rice<00:04:06.400> wine

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
now sake is a sweet Japanese rice wine

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.640 
now sake is a sweet Japanese rice wine
and<00:04:07.000> it<00:04:07.900> also<00:04:08.050> has<00:04:08.230> a<00:04:08.260> little<00:04:08.470> bit<00:04:08.590> of

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
and it also has a little bit of

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.830 
and it also has a little bit of
alcoholic<00:04:09.130> content<00:04:09.310> which<00:04:09.790> also<00:04:10.090> lowers<00:04:10.720> the

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
alcoholic content which also lowers the

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.320 
alcoholic content which also lowers the
boiling<00:04:11.020> point<00:04:11.470> of<00:04:11.620> the<00:04:11.710> mixture<00:04:12.270> okay<00:04:13.270> so

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
boiling point of the mixture okay so

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.390 
boiling point of the mixture okay so
once<00:04:13.600> you've<00:04:13.720> done<00:04:13.900> that<00:04:13.960> you<00:04:14.410> mix<00:04:15.190> it<00:04:15.340> all

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
once you've done that you mix it all

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.039 
once you've done that you mix it all
together<00:04:15.580> and<00:04:15.940> you<00:04:16.269> leave<00:04:16.450> it<00:04:16.570> in<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.690> fridge

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
together and you leave it in the fridge

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.100 
together and you leave it in the fridge
to<00:04:17.079> cool<00:04:17.500> down<00:04:17.739> overnight<00:04:21.720> okay<00:04:22.720> so<00:04:22.870> now<00:04:23.050> I'm

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
to cool down overnight okay so now I'm

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.080 
to cool down overnight okay so now I'm
going<00:04:23.230> to<00:04:23.380> take<00:04:23.650> some<00:04:24.070> tempura<00:04:24.580> batter<00:04:24.790> mix

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
going to take some tempura batter mix

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.580 
going to take some tempura batter mix
which<00:04:25.330> I've<00:04:25.480> also<00:04:25.690> left<00:04:25.930> in<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.169> fridge<00:04:26.380> to

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
which I've also left in the fridge to

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.400 
which I've also left in the fridge to
cool<00:04:26.770> down<00:04:26.980> overnight<00:04:27.130> and<00:04:28.260> then<00:04:29.260> I'm<00:04:29.350> just

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
cool down overnight and then I'm just

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.630 
cool down overnight and then I'm just
going<00:04:29.560> to<00:04:29.650> place<00:04:29.830> it<00:04:29.860> into<00:04:30.130> a<00:04:30.250> bowl<00:04:30.460> now

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
going to place it into a bowl now

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.730 
going to place it into a bowl now
tempura<00:04:31.210> batter<00:04:31.450> makes<00:04:31.750> it<00:04:31.870> very<00:04:32.020> simple<00:04:32.290> it's

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
tempura batter makes it very simple it's

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.760 
tempura batter makes it very simple it's
just<00:04:33.040> rice<00:04:33.730> flour<00:04:34.120> flour<00:04:34.840> and<00:04:35.260> baking<00:04:35.620> powder

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
just rice flour flour and baking powder

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.650 
just rice flour flour and baking powder
but<00:04:36.160> it's<00:04:36.250> just<00:04:36.310> much<00:04:36.520> easier<00:04:36.700> to<00:04:37.000> buy<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.240> mix

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
but it's just much easier to buy the mix

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.030 
but it's just much easier to buy the mix
than<00:04:37.900> it<00:04:37.990> is<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:38.320> make<00:04:38.500> it<00:04:38.620> yourself

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
than it is to make it yourself

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.220 
than it is to make it yourself
to<00:04:39.370> get<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.610> same<00:04:39.760> result<00:04:40.060> okay<00:04:40.900> so<00:04:41.020> I'm<00:04:41.110> just

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
to get the same result okay so I'm just

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.650 
to get the same result okay so I'm just
going<00:04:41.350> to<00:04:41.410> add<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.680> liquid<00:04:41.860> into<00:04:42.190> it<00:04:42.480> you<00:04:43.480> want

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
going to add the liquid into it you want

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.080 
going to add the liquid into it you want
to<00:04:43.750> have<00:04:43.900> a<00:04:43.930> ratio<00:04:44.230> of<00:04:44.440> a<00:04:45.010> hundred<00:04:45.610> grams<00:04:45.820> of

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
to have a ratio of a hundred grams of

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.960 
to have a ratio of a hundred grams of
tempura<00:04:46.570> batter<00:04:46.810> mix<00:04:47.110> to<00:04:47.350> 125<00:04:48.310> grams<00:04:48.669> of

tempura batter mix to 125 grams of

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.560 
tempura batter mix to 125 grams of
liquid<00:04:49.810> mix<00:04:50.550> you<00:04:51.550> want<00:04:51.669> to<00:04:51.820> softly<00:04:52.240> mix<00:04:52.450> it

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
liquid mix you want to softly mix it

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.600 
liquid mix you want to softly mix it
together<00:04:52.900> you<00:04:53.080> don't<00:04:53.200> want<00:04:53.470> to<00:04:53.680> get<00:04:54.250> rid<00:04:54.490> of

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
together you don't want to get rid of
