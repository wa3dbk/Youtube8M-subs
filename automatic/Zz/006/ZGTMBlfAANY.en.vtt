00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
program out there the idea here isn't to

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.600 
program out there the idea here isn't to
build<00:01:34.350> as<00:01:34.439> much<00:01:34.560> muscle<00:01:34.829> mass<00:01:35.189> as<00:01:35.369> possible<00:01:36.060> um

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
build as much muscle mass as possible um

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.770 
build as much muscle mass as possible um
like<00:01:38.610> most<00:01:38.820> valuable<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.390> programs<00:01:39.659> out

like most valuable and programs out

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.780 
like most valuable and programs out
there<00:01:40.079> instead<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.100> idea<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.490> build

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
there instead the idea is to build

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.460 
there instead the idea is to build
muscle<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.390> way<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.960> really<00:01:43.170> enhances
