00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.410 
actually this is a micro here the
closest<00:01:00.140> one<00:01:00.289> I<00:01:00.320> had<00:01:00.590> to<00:01:00.800> me<00:01:00.980> so<00:01:01.789> you<00:01:02.239> can<00:01:02.390> see

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
closest one I had to me so you can see

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.410 
closest one I had to me so you can see
the<00:01:02.690> size<00:01:03.339> size<00:01:04.339> compare<00:01:04.789> so<00:01:04.970> let<00:01:05.119> me<00:01:05.210> try<00:01:05.390> to

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
the size size compare so let me try to

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.060 
the size size compare so let me try to
get<00:01:05.690> something<00:01:06.050> that<00:01:06.140> you<00:01:06.289> guys<00:01:06.440> are<00:01:06.710> more

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
get something that you guys are more

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.499 
get something that you guys are more
familiar<00:01:07.280> with<00:01:09.340> this<00:01:11.320> is<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.530> 30<00:01:12.830> 15<00:01:13.509> by

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
familiar with this is the 30 15 by

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.889 
familiar with this is the 30 15 by
jiancheng<00:01:15.580> so<00:01:16.580> you<00:01:16.640> can<00:01:16.880> see<00:01:17.060> it's<00:01:17.270> pretty

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
jiancheng so you can see it's pretty

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.029 
jiancheng so you can see it's pretty
much<00:01:18.170> a<00:01:18.229> micro<00:01:20.050> motor<00:01:21.050> pots<00:01:21.380> are<00:01:21.619> a<00:01:21.649> little

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
much a micro motor pots are a little

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.580 
much a micro motor pots are a little
closer<00:01:22.280> together<00:01:22.670> but<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.630> overall<00:01:23.899> size<00:01:24.319> is

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
closer together but the overall size is

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:32.370 
closer together but the overall size is
the<00:01:24.740> same<00:01:26.410> comparison<00:01:27.410> with<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.890> cyma<00:01:29.619> X<00:01:30.619> 11<00:01:31.130> C

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
the same comparison with the cyma X 11 C

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.609 
the same comparison with the cyma X 11 C
so<00:01:33.380> yeah<00:01:33.560> this<00:01:33.800> thing<00:01:34.069> flies<00:01:34.369> up<00:01:34.759> pretty<00:01:35.179> good

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
so yeah this thing flies up pretty good

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.370 
so yeah this thing flies up pretty good
if<00:01:36.619> it<00:01:37.149> hovers<00:01:38.149> pretty<00:01:38.450> well<00:01:38.690> it's<00:01:39.050> pretty

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
if it hovers pretty well it's pretty

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.020 
if it hovers pretty well it's pretty
stable

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
stable

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.499 
stable

it has headless mode on it and one key
return<00:01:44.840> I<00:01:44.899> haven't<00:01:45.440> been<00:01:45.560> able<00:01:45.679> to<00:01:45.830> get<00:01:46.039> the

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
return I haven't been able to get the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.109 
return I haven't been able to get the
one<00:01:46.340> key<00:01:46.580> return<00:01:46.940> to<00:01:47.179> work<00:01:47.330> on<00:01:47.539> it<00:01:47.750> yet<00:01:48.739> so<00:01:49.310> with

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
one key return to work on it yet so with

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.749 
one key return to work on it yet so with
the<00:01:50.239> detail<00:01:50.660> review<00:01:51.099> hopefully<00:01:52.099> I'll<00:01:52.310> be<00:01:52.340> done

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
the detail review hopefully I'll be done

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.050 
the detail review hopefully I'll be done
figured<00:01:53.660> out<00:01:53.810> how<00:01:53.989> to<00:01:54.020> do<00:01:54.289> the<00:01:54.610> one<00:01:55.610> key<00:01:55.880> we

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
figured out how to do the one key we

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.270 
figured out how to do the one key we
turn<00:01:56.300> on<00:01:56.479> here<00:01:56.690> but<00:01:56.840> I<00:01:56.869> have<00:01:57.170> figured<00:01:57.470> out<00:01:57.679> well

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
turn on here but I have figured out well

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.770 
turn on here but I have figured out well
the<00:01:58.399> headless<00:01:58.700> mode<00:01:58.880> is<00:01:59.119> pretty<00:01:59.330> easy<00:01:59.569> you

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
the headless mode is pretty easy you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.229 
the headless mode is pretty easy you
press<00:02:00.050> this<00:02:00.229> button<00:02:00.470> here<00:02:00.619> to<00:02:01.580> activate

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:02.239 
press this button here to activate

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:04.630 
press this button here to activate
headless<00:02:02.840> mode<00:02:03.050> and<00:02:03.380> when<00:02:04.009> you<00:02:04.130> activate<00:02:04.610> it

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
headless mode and when you activate it

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.699 
headless mode and when you activate it
headless<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.270> lights<00:02:05.509> flash<00:02:05.959> on<00:02:06.259> it<00:02:06.410> and<00:02:06.590> it

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
headless the lights flash on it and it

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.830 
headless the lights flash on it and it
automatically<00:02:07.459> starts<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.000> off<00:02:08.300> so<00:02:08.629> this

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
automatically starts the off so this

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.199 
automatically starts the off so this
thing<00:02:09.050> starts<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.500> Y<00:02:09.619> all<00:02:09.830> on<00:02:10.039> its<00:02:10.190> own<00:02:10.369> when<00:02:11.120> it

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
thing starts to Y all on its own when it

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.000 
thing starts to Y all on its own when it
goes<00:02:11.390> into<00:02:11.599> headless<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:12.440> can<00:02:12.590> control

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
goes into headless and you can control

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.449 
goes into headless and you can control
it<00:02:13.220> it<00:02:13.610> sets<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:15.020> headless<00:02:15.349> move<00:02:15.590> from<00:02:15.980> the

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
it it sets the headless move from the

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.580 
it it sets the headless move from the
fate<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:17.390> direction<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.200> quad<00:02:18.410> is

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
fate that the direction that the quad is

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.590 
fate that the direction that the quad is
facing<00:02:19.070> when<00:02:19.550> you

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
facing when you

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.120 
facing when you
activate<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.720> headless<00:02:22.050> mode<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:22.830> the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
activate the headless mode so the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.970 
activate the headless mode so the
headless<00:02:23.490> mode<00:02:23.820> works<00:02:24.060> pretty<00:02:24.300> well<00:02:24.420> but<00:02:25.260> then

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
headless mode works pretty well but then

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.740 
headless mode works pretty well but then
again<00:02:26.280> when<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.610> activate<00:02:27.180> headless<00:02:27.570> with

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
again when you activate headless with

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.190 
again when you activate headless with
this<00:02:27.900> thing<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:29.670> pitch<00:02:29.910> goes<00:02:30.240> to<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> crawl<00:02:30.870> is

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
this thing the pitch goes to a crawl is

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.960 
this thing the pitch goes to a crawl is
it<00:02:31.560> really<00:02:31.830> doesn't<00:02:32.160> pitch<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.520> much<00:02:32.760> when

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
it really doesn't pitch that much when

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.210 
it really doesn't pitch that much when
you<00:02:33.060> have<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.300> in<00:02:33.390> headless<00:02:33.890> so<00:02:34.890> it's<00:02:35.070> pretty

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
you have it in headless so it's pretty

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.190 
you have it in headless so it's pretty
docile<00:02:35.520> when<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.120> have<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:36.480> in<00:02:36.690> headless<00:02:37.050> I

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
docile when you have this in headless I

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.100 
docile when you have this in headless I
think<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.340> more<00:02:38.550> so<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:39.210> better<00:02:39.570> quad<00:02:39.900> to

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
think this is more so a better quad to

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.620 
think this is more so a better quad to
be<00:02:40.230> flown<00:02:40.500> indoors<00:02:41.130> because<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:42.210> quad<00:02:42.450> is

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
be flown indoors because this quad is

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.500 
be flown indoors because this quad is
really<00:02:42.900> sensitive<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.590> when<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:45.120> one<00:02:45.270> can

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
really sensitive to when the one can

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.120 
really sensitive to when the one can
push<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.810> around<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:46.170> lot<00:02:46.350> because<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.680> all<00:02:46.950> this

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
push it around a lot because of all this

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.000 
push it around a lot because of all this
surface<00:02:47.640> area<00:02:48.060> here<00:02:48.360> on<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.660> front<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.830> has

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
surface area here on the front it has

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.920 
surface area here on the front it has
nice<00:02:50.250> rubber<00:02:50.640> landing<00:02:51.120> feet<00:02:51.360> on<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.600> bottom

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
nice rubber landing feet on the bottom

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.500 
nice rubber landing feet on the bottom
the<00:02:52.110> rubber<00:02:52.320> landing<00:02:52.770> feet<00:02:53.040> pretty<00:02:54.030> nice<00:02:54.300> you

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
the rubber landing feet pretty nice you

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.950 
the rubber landing feet pretty nice you
can<00:02:54.660> see<00:02:54.780> this<00:02:54.900> game<00:02:55.110> bounces<00:02:55.590> around<00:02:56.960> the

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
can see this game bounces around the

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.820 
can see this game bounces around the
however<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.980> little<00:02:59.430> rubber<00:03:00.140> landing<00:03:01.140> feet

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
however the little rubber landing feet

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.520 
however the little rubber landing feet
can<00:03:02.070> actually<00:03:02.490> come<00:03:02.670> off<00:03:02.700> during<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.750> crash<00:03:04.230> if

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
can actually come off during a crash if

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.160 
can actually come off during a crash if
you<00:03:04.620> drop<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.130> or<00:03:05.490> if<00:03:06.210> it<00:03:06.360> hits<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.930> ground

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
you drop it or if it hits the ground

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.640 
you drop it or if it hits the ground
pretty<00:03:07.500> hard<00:03:08.060> moving<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:10.020> direction<00:03:10.200> that

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
pretty hard moving in the direction that

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.940 
pretty hard moving in the direction that
one<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.340> landing<00:03:11.820> rubber<00:03:12.750> feet<00:03:13.620> will

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
one of the landing rubber feet will

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.990 
one of the landing rubber feet will
probably<00:03:14.490> come<00:03:14.700> off<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:15.240> did<00:03:16.700> damage<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.820> motor

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
probably come off I did damage the motor

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.940 
probably come off I did damage the motor
with<00:03:18.330> this<00:03:18.510> thing<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.990> fell<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.500> don't<00:03:19.680> know<00:03:19.770> how

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
with this thing it fell I don't know how

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.580 
with this thing it fell I don't know how
it<00:03:20.130> fell<00:03:20.160> maybe<00:03:20.730> maybe<00:03:21.240> I<00:03:21.360> have<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:22.020> fella<00:03:22.380> my

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
it fell maybe maybe I have a fella my

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.850 
it fell maybe maybe I have a fella my
garage<00:03:23.460> in<00:03:23.880> my<00:03:24.090> storage<00:03:24.660> area<00:03:24.900> so<00:03:25.740> I'm

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
garage in my storage area so I'm

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.950 
garage in my storage area so I'm
guessing<00:03:26.280> something<00:03:26.610> it<00:03:27.120> probably<00:03:27.270> hit<00:03:27.750> one

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
guessing something it probably hit one

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.720 
guessing something it probably hit one
of<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.170> kids<00:03:28.380> bikes<00:03:28.710> or<00:03:28.980> something<00:03:29.010> something

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
of the kids bikes or something something

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.400 
of the kids bikes or something something
had<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.300> be<00:03:30.390> protruding<00:03:30.960> to<00:03:31.110> bend<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:33.140> post<00:03:34.140> on

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
had to be protruding to bend the post on

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.290 
had to be protruding to bend the post on
the<00:03:34.560> motor<00:03:34.770> because<00:03:35.220> this<00:03:35.790> thing<00:03:36.060> actually

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
the motor because this thing actually

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.110 
the motor because this thing actually
the<00:03:37.230> motors<00:03:37.560> are<00:03:37.740> pretty<00:03:38.070> well<00:03:38.280> protected<00:03:38.670> you

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
the motors are pretty well protected you

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.110 
the motors are pretty well protected you
know<00:03:39.270> from<00:03:39.480> all<00:03:39.630> around<00:03:39.780> it's<00:03:40.350> like<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:41.120> housing

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
know from all around it's like a housing

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.530 
know from all around it's like a housing
/<00:03:42.540> prop<00:03:42.960> guard<00:03:43.230> on<00:03:43.920> this<00:03:44.070> thing<00:03:44.340> even<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.330> top

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
/ prop guard on this thing even the top

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.120 
/ prop guard on this thing even the top
like<00:03:45.870> when<00:03:46.080> you<00:03:46.170> fly<00:03:46.410> this<00:03:46.470> thing<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:46.920> hit<00:03:47.010> the

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
like when you fly this thing and hit the

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.480 
like when you fly this thing and hit the
ceiling<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.760> head<00:03:48.330> hits<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.780> ceiling<00:03:49.490> the

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
ceiling the head hits the ceiling the

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.580 
ceiling the head hits the ceiling the
top<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:50.910> this<00:03:51.030> canopy<00:03:51.630> hits<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.050> ceiling<00:03:52.440> and

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
top of this canopy hits the ceiling and

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.530 
top of this canopy hits the ceiling and
you<00:03:52.770> don't<00:03:54.350> touch<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.530> motors<00:03:55.800> don't<00:03:55.920> touch

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
you don't touch the motors don't touch

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.380 
you don't touch the motors don't touch
so<00:03:57.540> yeah<00:03:58.500> it's<00:03:58.710> a<00:03:58.770> pretty<00:03:58.800> nice<00:03:59.220> quad<00:03:59.940> I<00:04:00.150> really

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
so yeah it's a pretty nice quad I really

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.760 
so yeah it's a pretty nice quad I really
like<00:04:00.570> it<00:04:00.780> so<00:04:00.990> far<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:03.120> lights<00:04:03.330> are<00:04:03.630> good<00:04:04.590> for

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
like it so far the lights are good for

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.770 
like it so far the lights are good for
orientation<00:04:05.310> because<00:04:05.820> this<00:04:05.970> whole<00:04:06.180> front<00:04:06.630> of

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
orientation because this whole front of

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.750 
orientation because this whole front of
the<00:04:06.960> quiet<00:04:07.230> lights<00:04:07.680> up<00:04:07.980> a<00:04:08.160> different<00:04:08.580> color

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
the quiet lights up a different color

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.210 
the quiet lights up a different color
than<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.000> back<00:04:09.300> because<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:10.140> guys<00:04:10.350> probably

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
than the back because you guys probably

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.760 
than the back because you guys probably
saw<00:04:11.400> already<00:04:11.820> I<00:04:12.270> mean<00:04:13.080> doesn't<00:04:13.260> have<00:04:13.500> an<00:04:13.620> on

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
saw already I mean doesn't have an on

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.880 
saw already I mean doesn't have an on
and<00:04:14.010> off<00:04:14.070> switch<00:04:14.130> it's<00:04:14.730> just<00:04:15.240> a<00:04:15.420> a<00:04:15.859> plug<00:04:16.859> you

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
and off switch it's just a a plug you

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.400 
and off switch it's just a a plug you
have<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.400> plug<00:04:17.640> in<00:04:17.850> on<00:04:18.150> it<00:04:18.299> once<00:04:18.900> you<00:04:19.049> plug<00:04:19.260> it

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
have to plug in on it once you plug it

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.320 
have to plug in on it once you plug it
in<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:19.650> got<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:19.830> go<00:04:20.040> right<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.520> flying<00:04:20.820> it

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
in you got to go right to flying it

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.480 
in you got to go right to flying it
actually<00:04:21.840> takes<00:04:22.109> a<00:04:22.320> large<00:04:22.620> battery<00:04:23.130> it<00:04:23.280> takes

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
actually takes a large battery it takes

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.700 
actually takes a large battery it takes
the<00:04:23.640> 500<00:04:24.270> milliamp<00:04:24.660> hour<00:04:24.840> batteries<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:25.650> you

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
the 500 milliamp hour batteries and you

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.460 
the 500 milliamp hour batteries and you
just<00:04:25.890> slide<00:04:26.130> it<00:04:26.340> in<00:04:26.490> sideways<00:04:27.060> there<00:04:27.470> I

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
just slide it in sideways there I

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.970 
just slide it in sideways there I
haven't<00:04:29.250> really<00:04:29.550> tried<00:04:30.060> to<00:04:30.530> see<00:04:31.530> if<00:04:31.560> it<00:04:31.770> flies

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
haven't really tried to see if it flies

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.280 
haven't really tried to see if it flies
well<00:04:32.370> with<00:04:32.700> a<00:04:33.030> regular-sized<00:04:33.720> battery

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
well with a regular-sized battery

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.130 
well with a regular-sized battery
while<00:04:34.650> smaller<00:04:35.100> batteries<00:04:35.580> like<00:04:35.960> 250<00:04:36.960> million

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
while smaller batteries like 250 million

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.820 
while smaller batteries like 250 million
i<00:04:37.500> world<00:04:37.830> 300<00:04:38.460> million<00:04:39.300> power<00:04:39.570> but<00:04:40.440> it<00:04:40.560> should

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
i world 300 million power but it should

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.930 
i world 300 million power but it should
fly<00:04:41.190> because<00:04:42.120> it's<00:04:42.270> basically<00:04:42.600> just<00:04:42.720> a<00:04:43.080> micro

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
fly because it's basically just a micro

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.760 
fly because it's basically just a micro
but<00:04:44.940> it'll<00:04:45.330> fly<00:04:45.570> pretty<00:04:45.900> short<00:04:46.230> I'm<00:04:46.380> pretty

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
but it'll fly pretty short I'm pretty

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.010 
but it'll fly pretty short I'm pretty
sure<00:04:47.040> because<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.670> 500<00:04:48.450> milliamp<00:04:48.840> hour

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
sure because the 500 milliamp hour

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.710 
sure because the 500 milliamp hour
battery<00:04:49.430> really<00:04:50.430> doesn't<00:04:51.060> last<00:04:51.240> that<00:04:51.420> long

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
battery really doesn't last that long

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.780 
battery really doesn't last that long
with<00:04:51.960> this<00:04:52.110> it<00:04:52.320> gives<00:04:52.950> you<00:04:53.070> about<00:04:53.190> a<00:04:53.370> six

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
with this it gives you about a six

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.980 
with this it gives you about a six
minute<00:04:53.970> flight<00:04:54.330> with<00:04:54.630> it<00:04:54.920> so<00:04:56.630> yeah<00:04:57.630> this<00:04:57.840> is

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
minute flight with it so yeah this is

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.390 
minute flight with it so yeah this is
the<00:04:58.140> chest<00:04:58.410> and<00:04:58.590> cx30<00:04:59.100> one<00:04:59.510> he<00:05:00.510> flips<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:01.560> loses

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
the chest and cx30 one he flips it loses

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.450 
the chest and cx30 one he flips it loses
altitude<00:05:02.580> on<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.210> flips<00:05:03.770> but<00:05:04.770> it<00:05:04.890> does<00:05:05.100> flip

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
altitude on the flips but it does flip

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.650 
altitude on the flips but it does flip
well<00:05:05.760> if<00:05:06.000> you<00:05:07.100> hit<00:05:08.100> the<00:05:08.250> turn<00:05:09.000> to<00:05:09.090> throttle<00:05:09.540> up

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
well if you hit the turn to throttle up

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.750 
well if you hit the turn to throttle up
a<00:05:09.840> little<00:05:10.020> and<00:05:10.650> give<00:05:10.920> it<00:05:11.010> a<00:05:11.070> little<00:05:11.220> throttle

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
a little and give it a little throttle

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.460 
a little and give it a little throttle
and<00:05:11.880> do<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.300> flip<00:05:12.570> before<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.050> flip<00:05:13.260> and<00:05:13.290> you

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
and do the flip before the flip and you

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.780 
and do the flip before the flip and you
should<00:05:13.620> be<00:05:13.710> fine<00:05:13.890> it<00:05:14.130> won't<00:05:14.280> lose<00:05:14.430> any

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
should be fine it won't lose any

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.790 
should be fine it won't lose any
altitude<00:05:14.970> I<00:05:15.480> have<00:05:15.690> taken<00:05:16.080> this<00:05:16.290> thing<00:05:16.470> apart

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
altitude I have taken this thing apart

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.230 
altitude I have taken this thing apart
and<00:05:17.420> it<00:05:18.420> looks<00:05:18.660> like<00:05:19.190> no<00:05:20.190> other<00:05:20.430> board<00:05:20.790> can<00:05:21.090> be

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
and it looks like no other board can be

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.390 
and it looks like no other board can be
swapped<00:05:21.540> out<00:05:21.780> in<00:05:22.020> here<00:05:22.260> except<00:05:22.680> for<00:05:22.950> maybe<00:05:23.250> a

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
swapped out in here except for maybe a

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.460 
swapped out in here except for maybe a
micro<00:05:24.330> or<00:05:25.050> maybe<00:05:25.920> the<00:05:26.100> junction

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
micro or maybe the junction

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.610 
micro or maybe the junction
3015<00:05:28.470> can<00:05:29.430> probably<00:05:29.760> uh<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.930> flight<00:05:31.380> board

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
3015 can probably uh the flight board

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.350 
3015 can probably uh the flight board
can<00:05:31.770> probably<00:05:31.980> fit<00:05:32.400> in<00:05:32.550> here<00:05:32.730> because<00:05:32.910> it's<00:05:33.240> a

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
can probably fit in here because it's a

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.490 
can probably fit in here because it's a
weird<00:05:33.570> shape<00:05:33.930> it's<00:05:34.230> actually<00:05:34.740> a<00:05:34.800> plus<00:05:35.670> shaped

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
weird shape it's actually a plus shaped

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.400 
weird shape it's actually a plus shaped
board<00:05:37.500> in<00:05:37.710> here<00:05:37.980> and<00:05:38.250> so<00:05:39.120> this<00:05:39.660> little<00:05:40.080> space

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
board in here and so this little space

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.460 
board in here and so this little space
right<00:05:40.680> here<00:05:40.860> can<00:05:41.040> be<00:05:41.070> occupied<00:05:41.460> by<00:05:41.670> the<00:05:42.440> 3015<00:05:43.440> I

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
right here can be occupied by the 3015 I

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.280 
right here can be occupied by the 3015 I
was<00:05:43.740> thinking<00:05:44.540> and<00:05:45.540> I'm<00:05:45.720> only<00:05:45.900> giving<00:05:46.230> you

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
was thinking and I'm only giving you

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.290 
was thinking and I'm only giving you
that<00:05:46.470> information<00:05:46.740> for<00:05:47.190> you<00:05:47.340> models<00:05:48.090> out

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
that information for you models out

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.810 
that information for you models out
there<00:05:48.360> who<00:05:48.810> probably<00:05:49.130> want<00:05:50.130> to<00:05:50.250> switch<00:05:50.640> the

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
there who probably want to switch the

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.030 
there who probably want to switch the
flight<00:05:51.030> board<00:05:51.330> in<00:05:51.510> here<00:05:51.690> like<00:05:52.380> I<00:05:52.560> was<00:05:52.740> thinking

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
flight board in here like I was thinking

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.530 
flight board in here like I was thinking
about<00:05:53.130> doing<00:05:53.460> I<00:05:53.760> was<00:05:53.910> thinking<00:05:54.150> about<00:05:54.330> putting

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
about doing I was thinking about putting

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.530 
about doing I was thinking about putting
the<00:05:54.660> flight<00:05:54.900> board<00:05:55.140> in<00:05:55.290> here<00:05:56.180> to<00:05:57.180> make<00:05:57.360> this

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
the flight board in here to make this

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.240 
the flight board in here to make this
thing<00:05:57.780> more<00:05:57.990> dynamic<00:05:58.560> or<00:05:58.650> whatever<00:05:58.920> because

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
thing more dynamic or whatever because

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.120 
thing more dynamic or whatever because
cheerson<00:05:59.670> actually<00:06:00.090> has<00:06:00.300> this<00:06:00.510> thing<00:06:01.130> seems

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
cheerson actually has this thing seems

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.180 
cheerson actually has this thing seems
dialed<00:06:02.700> down<00:06:02.910> because<00:06:03.630> uh<00:06:03.660> it<00:06:04.350> doesn't<00:06:04.830> pitch

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
dialed down because uh it doesn't pitch

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.490 
dialed down because uh it doesn't pitch
really<00:06:05.430> hard<00:06:05.790> with<00:06:06.150> the<00:06:06.390> stock<00:06:06.840> controller

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
really hard with the stock controller

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.160 
really hard with the stock controller
the<00:06:08.460> stock<00:06:08.730> controller<00:06:09.150> just<00:06:09.480> has<00:06:09.930> it

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.170 
the stock controller just has it

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.770 
the stock controller just has it
pitching<00:06:10.530> just<00:06:10.560> enough<00:06:11.130> to<00:06:11.340> move<00:06:12.030> forward<00:06:12.600> it

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
pitching just enough to move forward it

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.410 
pitching just enough to move forward it
doesn't<00:06:13.230> really<00:06:13.560> pitch<00:06:14.070> hard<00:06:14.400> so<00:06:15.060> you<00:06:15.120> can't

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420 
doesn't really pitch hard so you can't

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.330 
doesn't really pitch hard so you can't
do<00:06:15.630> really<00:06:15.840> tight<00:06:16.140> funnels<00:06:16.560> with<00:06:16.710> it<00:06:16.860> the<00:06:17.100> yar

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
do really tight funnels with it the yar

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.790 
do really tight funnels with it the yar
isn't<00:06:17.730> really<00:06:17.970> fast<00:06:18.270> they<00:06:18.510> are<00:06:18.690> kind<00:06:19.440> of<00:06:19.560> slow

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
isn't really fast they are kind of slow

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.820 
isn't really fast they are kind of slow
so<00:06:20.100> you<00:06:21.030> can<00:06:21.180> pitch<00:06:21.630> fly<00:06:21.900> it<00:06:21.960> though<00:06:22.260> but<00:06:22.590> I

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
so you can pitch fly it though but I

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.850 
so you can pitch fly it though but I
think<00:06:23.160> with<00:06:23.370> a<00:06:23.400> quiet<00:06:24.300> like<00:06:24.630> this<00:06:24.930> it<00:06:25.560> should

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
think with a quiet like this it should

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.980 
think with a quiet like this it should
be<00:06:25.980> able<00:06:26.130> to<00:06:26.370> yaw<00:06:26.610> fast<00:06:27.030> now<00:06:27.330> this<00:06:27.570> is<00:06:27.750> one<00:06:27.960> of

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
be able to yaw fast now this is one of

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.650 
be able to yaw fast now this is one of
the<00:06:28.460> few<00:06:29.460> quads<00:06:29.790> that<00:06:30.030> I<00:06:30.090> think<00:06:30.360> should<00:06:30.540> be

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 
the few quads that I think should be

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.900 
the few quads that I think should be
able<00:06:30.810> to<00:06:30.990> really<00:06:31.740> y'all<00:06:31.980> really<00:06:32.340> fast<00:06:32.610> being

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
able to really y'all really fast being

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.350 
able to really y'all really fast being
as<00:06:33.090> though<00:06:33.440> it's<00:06:34.440> supposed<00:06:35.040> to<00:06:35.100> be<00:06:35.280> a<00:06:35.310> UFO<00:06:35.850> it

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
as though it's supposed to be a UFO it

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.850 
as though it's supposed to be a UFO it
looks<00:06:36.570> really<00:06:36.840> cool<00:06:37.020> when<00:06:37.200> you're<00:06:37.380> flying<00:06:37.620> it

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
looks really cool when you're flying it

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.500 
looks really cool when you're flying it
because<00:06:38.100> you<00:06:38.220> can<00:06:38.370> hardly<00:06:38.670> even<00:06:38.760> see<00:06:39.300> the

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
because you can hardly even see the

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.720 
because you can hardly even see the
propellers<00:06:40.320> in<00:06:40.410> the<00:06:40.530> middle<00:06:40.800> because<00:06:41.580> it's

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:41.730 
propellers in the middle because it's

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.580 
propellers in the middle because it's
all<00:06:42.000> white<00:06:42.270> when<00:06:42.540> they're<00:06:42.720> spinning<00:06:43.020> it<00:06:43.380> just

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
all white when they're spinning it just

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.770 
all white when they're spinning it just
and<00:06:43.800> if<00:06:44.010> there's<00:06:44.280> kind<00:06:44.520> of<00:06:44.910> fat<00:06:45.150> it<00:06:45.360> just<00:06:45.570> looks

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 
and if there's kind of fat it just looks

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.930 
and if there's kind of fat it just looks
like<00:06:45.870> a<00:06:45.990> white<00:06:46.140> circle<00:06:46.860> the<00:06:47.160> in<00:06:47.310> all<00:06:47.550> this

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 
like a white circle the in all this

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.610 
like a white circle the in all this
but<00:06:48.060> so<00:06:48.330> you<00:06:48.390> don't<00:06:48.660> see<00:06:48.900> that<00:06:49.080> they're

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
but so you don't see that they're

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.550 
but so you don't see that they're
actually<00:06:49.830> props<00:06:50.670> turning<00:06:51.210> so<00:06:51.960> pretty<00:06:52.320> cool
