00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.779
 in this workshop we are aiming for 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.719
 decoration this decoration components 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.570
 that he engages the beading and the ribs of 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.370
 genève all of the manual operations on 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.529
 which we wish to preserve the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.490
 trades and not automate its 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.170
 different operations 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.460
 it's important vis-à-vis the punch of 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.050
 Geneva because actually it makes 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.300
 part of this whole process that there is 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.820
 had for 125 years that was to improve 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.150
 the piece after the machining makes the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.679
 ending pinault is important because 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.899
 it allows us to better protect our 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.230
 crates to oxidation attacks and 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.700
 especially to bring an aesthetic 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.410
 custom for each of the pieces on 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.000
 is at the assembly shop or 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.070
 the whole convention movements of 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.300
 Geneva is assembled 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.410
 it's important because already in the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.940
 case of the hallmark of geneva it must be 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.280
 to do on geneva a good thing as on 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.809
 our Geneva site and also 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.399
 the importance and the know-how we 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.899
 want to master because we have 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.160
 finished our pieces beforehand these 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.449
 last have no visible traces 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.280
 but must also not have 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.070
 traces of manipulation before all the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.780
 setting is to pass a 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.240
 mundane static elements an element 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.820
 dynamic she comes alive so very 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.670
 important is also what gives a 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.710
 precision of walking to the watch that we 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.130
 allows to have their exact when one 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.409
 longed for 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.880
 the setting can last between half 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.470
 hour that several hours following the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.799
 difficulty of the mechanism we have in 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.270
 return 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.430
 then we are in the workshop 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.860
 of casing here we come with a 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.960
 complete movement and movement 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.640
 punch of geneva we get a ride 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.900
 Geneva punch at the waist 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.970
 of casing it is important that they get 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.470
 also do on geneva because we 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.090
 keep control of the steps 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.650
 and aesthetic control 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.509
 of course of our movements not to 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.920
 to deteriorate the stakes of slaughter 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.110
 more important is to bring to 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.640
 customers a watch that respects all 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.590
 criteria and everything he expects from the name 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.119
 of constantin vacheron in the punch 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.930
 of Geneva standards have been introduced 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.210
 sealing 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.040
 these standards are very simple ie 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.229
 a first standards that says that a watch 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.450
 waterproof punch of Geneva must be at 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.180
 minimum waterproof at 3 bar which corresponds 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.590
 at 30 meters under water is also a 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.900
 new standard that says one must be 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.660
 controlled to me 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.330
 0 5 bar which corresponds to a climb to 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.890
 10000 m by plane Fish Department 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.740
 geneva for noah and and centralization 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.330
 control devices and 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.500
 different information that is 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.870
 during the assembly process 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.210
 of casing these elements allow us 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.950
 to obtain the punch certification of 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.930
 Geneva for each of our watches 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.960
 different devices are in this room 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.490
 that is to say, a simulator wearing which 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.750
 We stimulate import for seven days 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.880
 a sealing control machine 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.470
 check tightness is a machine of 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.650
 measures of walking which is a machine 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.730
 optical to actually check if 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.130
 we measure well can in a 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.140
 measured for seven days and we 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.880
 did not have a shift one greater than one 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.560
 minute a week 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.940
 it is a centralization of the means of 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.040
 control so for us the the 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.330
 department punch of geneva we see 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.370
 today is the culmination 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.830
 even of an evolution of the punch and 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.110
 its regulation which brought us from a 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.590
 historical value was the movement a 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.330
 a historical value that will be the watch 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.980
 very important the customer will be able 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.200
 perceive what is the quality of 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.450
 punch of Geneva will be able to understand 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.709
 also some of these points and for a 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.269
 to the most important eyes now 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.070
 it is that he must also measure a 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.870
 part of by lumen by its 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.720
 personal equipment of what they 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.209
 are the elements of the punch the fish 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.500
 may evolve in the future is not fixed 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.810
 the settlement is not something 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.640
 frozen in stone and this department 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.110
 will also allow us to evolve in the 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.209
 based on these criteria 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.700
 newly admitted or of these developments 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.830
 coming document will be the document handed 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.370
 to the customer this punch certification 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.769
 from Geneva 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.360
 this certificate for several elements 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.420
 which are a certificate number 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.200
 individual that is issued by the us 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.630
 hallmark of geneva 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.799
 this number we can not create it 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.900
 it's really them they receive 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.090
 when they have validation through 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.470
 the devices we see behind that the 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.660
 piece has met the criteria of 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.019
 operating market which are 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.840
 own 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.780
 as well as of course the number from to the 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.340
 box and the number of the movement these 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.890
 different numbers so far 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.300
 always been registered within 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.690
 geneva fish so there is 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.730
 an archive since 1886 that traces the 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.959
 all the pieces that had 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.770
 the name fishes of geneva and the 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.810
 certification 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.010
 it was the course focused on 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.750
 movements so far now 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.430
 it's at the level of the watch but these 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.000
 books are at bay time are the 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.000
 state possession
