oh<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:36.660> know<00:02:36.870> what<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.050> was<00:02:37.170> going<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.350> say<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.500> was

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
oh I know what I was going to say I was

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.580 
oh I know what I was going to say I was
going<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.360> say<00:02:39.360> there's<00:02:39.960> probably<00:02:40.020> not<00:02:40.470> going

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
going to say there's probably not going

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.699 
going to say there's probably not going
to<00:02:40.650> be<00:02:40.710> any<00:02:40.830> tag<00:02:41.220> team<00:02:41.520> matches<00:02:42.080> because<00:02:43.080> that

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
to be any tag team matches because that

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.340 
to be any tag team matches because that
gets<00:02:43.830> really<00:02:44.310> confusing<00:02:44.810> when<00:02:45.810> totaling<00:02:46.260> up

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
gets really confusing when totaling up

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.880 
gets really confusing when totaling up
the<00:02:46.410> points<00:02:47.450> I'd<00:02:48.450> either<00:02:48.690> have<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.959> award<00:02:49.350> both

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
the points I'd either have to award both

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.570 
the points I'd either have to award both
members<00:02:51.020> both<00:02:52.020> members<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.560> total<00:02:53.010> more<00:02:53.130> half

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
members both members a total more half

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.760 
members both members a total more half
so<00:02:53.910> that's<00:02:54.720> probably<00:02:54.959> gonna<00:02:55.140> be<00:02:55.260> all<00:02:55.350> singles

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
so that's probably gonna be all singles

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.110 
so that's probably gonna be all singles

this<00:03:48.140> is<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.319> little<00:03:48.560> bit<00:03:48.769> of<00:03:48.859> a<00:03:48.920> change<00:03:49.159> here

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
this is a little bit of a change here

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.330 
this is a little bit of a change here
and<00:03:50.379> it's<00:03:51.379> probably<00:03:51.769> it's<00:03:51.920> more<00:03:52.129> entertaining

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
and it's probably it's more entertaining

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.479 
and it's probably it's more entertaining
for<00:03:52.730> me<00:03:52.790> probably<00:03:53.180> for<00:03:53.480> you<00:03:53.569> guys<00:03:53.750> as<00:03:53.959> well<00:03:54.489> but

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
for me probably for you guys as well but

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.490 
for me probably for you guys as well but
um<00:03:55.760> yeah<00:03:56.540> so<00:03:56.569> the<00:03:56.930> winner<00:03:57.109> will<00:03:57.349> be

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
um yeah so the winner will be

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.069 
um yeah so the winner will be
implemented<00:03:58.430> into<00:03:58.640> my<00:03:58.879> universe<00:03:59.299> and<00:03:59.569> they'll

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
implemented into my universe and they'll

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.699 
implemented into my universe and they'll
also<00:04:00.319> get<00:04:00.650> an<00:04:00.890> immediate<00:04:01.670> title<00:04:02.239> shot<00:04:02.709> at

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
also get an immediate title shot at

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.640 
also get an immediate title shot at
probably<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:04.579> first<00:04:04.819> pay-per-view<00:04:05.090> of<00:04:05.650> the

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
probably the first pay-per-view of the

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.440 
probably the first pay-per-view of the
new<00:04:07.280> season<00:04:08.440> no<00:04:09.440> they<00:04:10.099> can<00:04:10.280> choose<00:04:10.730> any<00:04:10.940> title

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
new season no they can choose any title

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.220 
new season no they can choose any title
to<00:04:12.319> go<00:04:12.349> after<00:04:12.650> so<00:04:13.099> I'm<00:04:13.720> probably<00:04:14.720> going<00:04:14.959> to<00:04:15.049> put

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
to go after so I'm probably going to put

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.729

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260 
nail ah they'll be on either smack on a
raw<00:04:21.500> depends<00:04:22.370> on<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.789> what<00:04:22.910> title<00:04:23.180> ugh

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
raw depends on the what title ugh

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.029 
raw depends on the what title ugh
laughter<00:04:23.510> so<00:04:23.810> if<00:04:23.900> it's<00:04:24.020> raw<00:04:24.199> they'll<00:04:24.830> have<00:04:24.949> the

laughter so if it's raw they'll have the
wwetitle<00:04:25.639> if<00:04:26.360> it<00:04:26.510> smacked<00:04:26.780> down<00:04:26.900> they<00:04:27.139> left<00:04:27.349> a

a little glitter I think noble is trying
to<00:06:01.290> get<00:06:01.380> off<00:06:01.500> the<00:06:01.620> table<00:06:01.800> but<00:06:02.370> look<00:06:02.520> at<00:06:02.610> this

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
to get off the table but look at this

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.950 
to get off the table but look at this

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
kind of victory i think but noble still

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.700 
kind of victory i think but noble still
wants<00:06:10.320> more<00:06:11.660> facebuster<00:06:12.660> right<00:06:13.470> on<00:06:13.590> the
