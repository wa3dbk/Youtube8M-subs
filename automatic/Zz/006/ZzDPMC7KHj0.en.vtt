00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 Good evening, 100 fans, I 'm coming. 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.189
 teach you there how you installed it 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.150
 yesterday motorola razr 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.950
 they are simple steps, and nothing complicated 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.880
 first of all I would not like to come 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.560
 that in some screens it will have a 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.800
 a small difference compared to 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:36.329
 doc icons is installed here I already 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:38.340
 I will show you are listed here 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.649
 the sequence you must be there you 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.100
 is there but will not open any by 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.100
 While 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.700
 good people are trying to install, right? 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.310
 I would like to remember that I am 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.990
 using a galaxy s three mini with 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.510
 just great 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:29.740
 only she was and if there where not 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:31.930
 need to beat the home key it will me 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.790
 ask here the launcher wants to use 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.820
 to use the telecine if that of the 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.229
 Motorola is to start up a 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.300
 bit tricky but you guys are going 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.590
 to understand more or less, I'll put 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.100
 only once because I have 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.930
 set up all that black stripe that she 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.390
 will appear only at the beginning after they 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.920
 hour moving sometimes that luck 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.520
 here are the settings right 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.740
 as indicated by the three 11 and the new 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.170
 motorola leave 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.110
 the doc icon is what i showed you 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.360
 I said is this one it is well 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:15.760
 because it depends a lot on the 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:17.800
 screen resolution and also faster 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:23.739
 what the twizy of samsung 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:28.870
 good is my opinion a good time creating 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:31.260
 the system cache it improves the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.260
 performance 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.489

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.459

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:00.880
 internet to help improve something 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.820
