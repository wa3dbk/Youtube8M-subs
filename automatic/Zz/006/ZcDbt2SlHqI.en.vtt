00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:24.970 

I<00:00:21.500> know<00:00:22.500> when<00:00:22.800> people<00:00:22.830> think<00:00:23.610> of<00:00:23.849> Western<00:00:24.360> art

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
I know when people think of Western art

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.190 
I know when people think of Western art
immediately<00:00:25.980> its<00:00:26.340> Cowboys<00:00:27.149> wagon<00:00:27.869> trains

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
immediately its Cowboys wagon trains

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.609 
immediately its Cowboys wagon trains
things<00:00:28.649> like<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.360> but<00:00:30.360> that<00:00:30.660> doesn't<00:00:31.050> exist

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.240

in<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.850> fashion<00:00:33.270> today<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:34.170> think<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.890> show

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
in that fashion today I think the show

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.819 
in that fashion today I think the show
how<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.390> might<00:00:36.540> differ<00:00:36.809> from<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.469> traditional

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829

as<00:02:29.750> an<00:02:29.870> audience<00:02:30.170> engaged<00:02:30.790> some<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:31.909> the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
as an audience engaged some of the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.420 
as an audience engaged some of the
paintings<00:02:32.360> I'll<00:02:32.569> paint<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.349> very<00:02:33.530> complete

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
paintings I'll paint a very complete

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.880 
paintings I'll paint a very complete
realistic<00:02:35.209> horse<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.689> then<00:02:35.840> I<00:02:35.959> scrape<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:36.769> all

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
realistic horse and then I scrape it all

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.699 
realistic horse and then I scrape it all
off<00:02:36.939> and<00:02:37.939> then<00:02:38.060> go<00:02:38.209> back<00:02:38.569> on<00:02:38.599> top<00:02:39.049> of<00:02:39.079> it<00:02:39.349> so

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
off and then go back on top of it so

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:40.899 
off and then go back on top of it so
that's<00:02:39.920> why<00:02:40.069> you<00:02:40.129> have<00:02:40.340> layers<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:40.730> layers

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
that's why you have layers and layers

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.789 
that's why you have layers and layers
and<00:02:41.360> on<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.540> paintings<00:02:41.989> so<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.409> horse<00:02:42.620> is

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
and on the paintings so the horse is

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.830 
and on the paintings so the horse is
just<00:02:42.829> a<00:02:43.190> starting<00:02:43.579> point<00:02:43.819> it<00:02:44.299> allows<00:02:44.599> me<00:02:44.810> to

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
just a starting point it allows me to

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.930 
just a starting point it allows me to
explore<00:02:45.260> with<00:02:45.470> paint<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.310> horses<00:02:46.610> can

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
explore with paint and the horses can

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.699 
explore with paint and the horses can
change<00:02:47.299> -<00:02:47.599> I'll<00:02:47.750> keep<00:02:47.930> parts<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.379> it<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.620> that

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
change - I'll keep parts of it and that

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.979 
change - I'll keep parts of it and that
other<00:02:48.920> parts<00:02:49.220> go<00:02:49.400> so<00:02:50.269> in<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.629> end<00:02:50.750> the

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
other parts go so in the end the

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.550 
other parts go so in the end the
composition<00:02:51.680> is<00:02:51.799> what<00:02:52.159> really<00:02:52.310> matters

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560
