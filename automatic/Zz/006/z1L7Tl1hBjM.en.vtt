gold dis episode as I need to get you
said<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.340> myself<00:00:14.670> ever<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.299> market<00:00:15.660> is

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
said to myself ever the market is

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.990 
said to myself ever the market is
changing<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.139> so<00:00:16.560> much<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:16.980> it's<00:00:17.369> quite<00:00:17.760> hard

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
changing so so much and it's quite hard

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.640 
changing so so much and it's quite hard
to<00:00:18.090> predict<00:00:18.449> when<00:00:19.080> players<00:00:19.320> are<00:00:19.380> going<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.560> go

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
to predict when players are going to go

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.279 
to predict when players are going to go
up<00:00:19.680> or<00:00:19.890> down<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:20.760> potentially<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.480> bit<00:00:22.199> of

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
up or down so it's potentially a bit of

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.230 
up or down so it's potentially a bit of
a<00:00:22.350> chance<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.800> losing<00:00:22.949> their<00:00:23.340> albums<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.970> coins

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240
