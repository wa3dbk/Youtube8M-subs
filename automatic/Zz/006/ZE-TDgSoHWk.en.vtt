 the stuffing we mixed now it is necessary 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.909
 repel that is just take we lift and 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.770
 China 10 15 times at this time stuffing 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.630
 get enriched with oxygen and during 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.570
 baking roll we will have more 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.479
 dense and will not disintegrate stuffing 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.509
 ready now prepare the stuffing for 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:53.460
 this we need to trim the edges of the eggs 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:59.310
 until the yolk that is slightly the same with this 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:01.850
 sides also cut the edges of the eggs to 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.850
 yolk 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.170
 that way when we lay 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.140
 on roll when cut in our every 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.380
 a piece of yolk will appear on 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.500
 food film distribute two thirds 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.930
 minced meat 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.530
 it is one third for example so 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.170
 then leave to decorate stuffing 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:35.080
 distribute with thickness it's about 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:41.290
 centimeter into a flat rectangle further 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:44.050
 we lay tightly each other's eggs 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:49.209
 in this way using food film 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:54.450
 we will form a roll we bend the edge not 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.450
 in this way, pressing it down tightly 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.020
 but we twist and so my balls 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.110
 end here here that is somewhere 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:14.430
 retreating one and a half to two centimeters I clean 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:14.430
 too much in this way and also here 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.440
 So 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:34.510
 now once again swept to roll in 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:36.459
 we have no seam and half bake we will 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.519
 on baking paper so by 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.670
 food film transfer to paper for 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.430
 baking our roll now using 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:53.939
 the remaining stuffing make decorations for 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:53.939
 roll forming paws name patties 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:10.569
 my front legs will be about 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:15.060
 same back skin needs good 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.060
 repulse in her hands to keep her shape 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:28.050
 we form a muzzle to throw out and spout so 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:34.750
 we formed a sprawling face 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:38.760
 attach the tail tails 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.560
 sprinkle with baby breadcrumbs 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:48.610
 the bottom of the multicooker we grease with vegetable 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:56.590
 oiled and neatly shifted 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:05:00.550
 butyrate so that our ears during 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:04.000
 baking still stuck to the very 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:07.090
 steer y I stuck toothpicks and so we 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.009
 put the roll in a slow cooker 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.879
 baking paper so that it is plump 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:17.770
 lay to the bottom and stayed the final touch 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:20.159
 do over cool and using a fork to 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.090
 during baking we had juice and 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:27.729
 roll did not break up do deep 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:32.460
 delivering eggs by 5-6 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:38.620
 hanks will be enough on top of the roll 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:43.080
 put the pieces of butter 50 grams 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:47.159
 enough close the slow cooker 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.840
 we will cook on baking mode 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:51.180

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:57.250
 forty four degrees 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:59.770
 we will need 1 hour ok as we see on 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:04.089
 Multivarki also went to the countdown and 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:06.639
 specified baking program passed per hour 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:10.300
 that's what we did and now 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:16.300
 gently lift the baking paper 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:21.520
