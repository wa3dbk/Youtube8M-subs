00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.640 
rusev because I don't have the elite the
only<00:02:13.920> problem<00:02:14.280> though<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.790> his<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.650> a

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
only problem though is that his is a

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.300 
only problem though is that his is a
tire<00:02:17.190> when<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.730> move<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.630> rusev<00:02:19.470> rips

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
tire when you move it the rusev rips

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.790 
tire when you move it the rusev rips
apart<00:02:20.459> so<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.239> don't<00:02:21.450> know<00:02:21.540> on<00:02:22.050> there<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.380> then

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
apart so I don't know on there and then

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.800 
apart so I don't know on there and then
the<00:02:22.920> main<00:02:23.130> event<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.700> main<00:02:23.880> attraction<00:02:24.569> we

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
the main event the main attraction we

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.270 
the main event the main attraction we
got<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.890> liner<00:02:26.190> herself

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
got the liner herself

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.009 
got the liner herself
the<00:02:29.280> only<00:02:29.640> problem<00:02:30.090> I'm<00:02:30.239> seeing<00:02:30.450> here<00:02:30.840> is

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
the only problem I'm seeing here is

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.309 
the only problem I'm seeing here is
they're<00:02:31.500> using<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.069> new<00:02:32.670> type<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.480> plastic

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
they're using this new type of plastic

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.559 
they're using this new type of plastic
for<00:02:34.709> like<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.220> suits<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.670> stuff<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.209> I<00:02:36.480> know

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
for like the suits and stuff and I know

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.800 
for like the suits and stuff and I know
this<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:36.959> first<00:02:37.170> on<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.410> most<00:02:37.980> Matadors<00:02:38.810> elite

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
this is first on the most Matadors elite

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.610 
this is first on the most Matadors elite
and<00:02:40.110> it's<00:02:40.680> like<00:02:41.390> super<00:02:42.390> super<00:02:42.660> flimsy<00:02:43.440> and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
and it's like super super flimsy and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.350 
and it's like super super flimsy and
then<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.549> feels<00:02:44.900> like<00:02:45.900> rubber<00:02:46.799> or<00:02:47.360> them

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
then it feels like rubber or them

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.400 
then it feels like rubber or them
plastic<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:50.780> don't<00:02:51.780> know<00:02:51.930> what<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.170> point

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
plastic and I don't know what the point

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.330 
plastic and I don't know what the point
of<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.650> was<00:02:54.230> it's<00:02:55.230> stretching<00:02:55.590> her<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.130> can

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
of it was it's stretching her so you can

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.850 
of it was it's stretching her so you can
maybe<00:02:56.640> get<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:56.940> bit<00:02:57.150> more<00:02:57.360> articulation<00:02:58.200> she

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
maybe get a bit more articulation she

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.160 
maybe get a bit more articulation she
comes<00:02:59.099> with<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.459> fist<00:02:59.970> which<00:03:00.269> is<00:03:00.420> awesome<00:03:00.959> so

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
comes with a fist which is awesome so

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.030 
comes with a fist which is awesome so
she<00:03:01.230> can<00:03:01.500> do<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:02.000> sub<00:03:03.000> crush<00:03:03.569> and<00:03:03.959> is<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.980> the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
she can do a sub crush and is this the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.240 
she can do a sub crush and is this the
first<00:03:05.519> female<00:03:06.239> we<00:03:06.600> have<00:03:06.930> of<00:03:07.880> in<00:03:08.880> a<00:03:09.120> suit<00:03:10.250> it's

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
first female we have of in a suit it's

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.580 
first female we have of in a suit it's
quite<00:03:11.549> possible<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.570> I<00:03:12.630> do<00:03:12.690> want<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.320> point

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
quite possible and I do want to point

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.560 
quite possible and I do want to point
out<00:03:13.769> that<00:03:13.980> this<00:03:14.130> figure<00:03:14.489> is<00:03:14.670> amazing<00:03:15.390> because

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
out that this figure is amazing because

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
out that this figure is amazing because
it<00:03:15.810> has<00:03:15.930> more<00:03:16.230> articulation<00:03:16.980> then<00:03:18.590> regular

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
it has more articulation then regular

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.400 
it has more articulation then regular
divas<00:03:20.010> but<00:03:20.190> we<00:03:20.340> still<00:03:20.579> only<00:03:20.880> have<00:03:21.239> one<00:03:21.780> bend<00:03:22.109> at

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
divas but we still only have one bend at

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.310 
divas but we still only have one bend at
the<00:03:22.470> knee<00:03:22.950> because<00:03:23.519> apparently<00:03:24.060> women<00:03:24.630> can't

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
the knee because apparently women can't

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.640 
the knee because apparently women can't
completely<00:03:25.829> bend<00:03:26.250> their<00:03:26.430> knees<00:03:27.500> farther<00:03:28.500> than

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
completely bend their knees farther than

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.210 
completely bend their knees farther than
that<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.880> didn't<00:03:30.450> know<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.750> she<00:03:31.560> has<00:03:31.769> high

I'm woman she is not wearing under shirt
I<00:04:11.300> can<00:04:11.570> tell<00:04:11.990> you<00:04:12.110> that<00:04:12.260> and<00:04:12.880> so<00:04:13.880> I'd<00:04:14.120> say<00:04:14.150> for

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
I can tell you that and so I'd say for

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.490 
I can tell you that and so I'd say for
this<00:04:14.930> set

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
this set

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.420 
this set
you<00:04:16.489> drop<00:04:16.790> $20<00:04:17.600> it's<00:04:18.410> this<00:04:18.829> is<00:04:18.980> probably<00:04:19.310> a

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
you drop $20 it's this is probably a

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.360 
you drop $20 it's this is probably a
better<00:04:19.640> figure<00:04:20.000> than<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.600> elite<00:04:20.870> page

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
better figure than the elite page

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.150 
better figure than the elite page
honestly<00:04:22.370> it<00:04:22.520> has<00:04:22.670> more<00:04:22.940> articulation<00:04:23.740> so<00:04:24.740> for

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
honestly it has more articulation so for

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.970 
honestly it has more articulation so for
that<00:04:25.280> alone<00:04:25.990> I'd<00:04:26.990> say<00:04:27.260> pick<00:04:27.440> this<00:04:27.620> up<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:27.950> only

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
that alone I'd say pick this up the only

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.740 
that alone I'd say pick this up the only
trouble<00:04:28.430> I'm<00:04:28.730> finding<00:04:29.240> is<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.390> it's
