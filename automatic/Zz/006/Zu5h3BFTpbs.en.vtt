00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:23.200 

that's<00:02:59.210> where<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.510> get<00:02:59.750> dirt

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.260 

that's<00:03:24.210> pothead<00:03:25.130> I'm<00:03:26.130> all<00:03:26.370> set<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.700> dry<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.090> off

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
that's pothead I'm all set to dry it off

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.720

into the rain it's all set up with the

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.750 
into the rain it's all set up with the
all-weather<00:03:30.090> gear<00:03:30.270> ratio

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
all-weather gear ratio

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.450 
all-weather gear ratio
beside<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.940> cruise

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:50.089 

you<00:03:36.820> want<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.120> have

and what that means is when you engage

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.530 
and what that means is when you engage
the<00:03:54.129> system<00:03:54.580> see<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:57.370> automatically<00:03:58.120> starts

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
the system see it automatically starts

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.420 
the system see it automatically starts
the<00:03:58.629> engine<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:59.500> hear<00:03:59.920> that<00:04:00.099> mechanical

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
the engine and hear that mechanical

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.660 
the engine and hear that mechanical
governor<00:04:01.180> watch<00:04:01.720> this<00:04:02.049> I'm<00:04:02.620> just<00:04:02.860> gonna<00:04:03.069> hit

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.520 
governor watch this I'm just gonna hit
the<00:04:03.849> brake<00:04:04.090> now<00:04:04.480> watch

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
the brake now watch

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.430 
the brake now watch
see<00:04:06.860> how<00:04:07.070> the<00:04:07.130> mechanical<00:04:07.880> governor

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
see how the mechanical governor

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.300 
see how the mechanical governor
automatically<00:04:09.440> brings<00:04:09.710> me<00:04:09.860> right<00:04:10.040> up<00:04:10.160> to<00:04:10.280> a

automatically brings me right up to a
nice<00:04:10.550> cruising<00:04:11.120> speed<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:12.080> then<00:04:12.560> if<00:04:12.680> I<00:04:12.800> want

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
nice cruising speed and then if I want

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.340 
nice cruising speed and then if I want
to<00:04:13.100> just<00:04:13.310> be<00:04:13.490> in<00:04:13.610> neutral<00:04:14.080> well<00:04:15.080> then<00:04:15.230> I<00:04:15.320> just

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
to just be in neutral well then I just

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.120 
to just be in neutral well then I just
put<00:04:15.710> the<00:04:15.830> handle<00:04:16.160> back<00:04:16.280> up<00:04:16.579> see<00:04:17.390> and<00:04:17.720> now<00:04:18.380> I'm
