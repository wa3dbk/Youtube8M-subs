 final number 35 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.430
 and then during the first use 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.349
 whatever the motive will be 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.849

 for windows os x linux to ios and android 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.579
 too good to be true but no it's 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.359
 what new services offers you 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.730
 Chinese 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.530
 yoyo with dale being able to back up 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.269

 share online with others 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.260
 Internet users 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.760
 note that you know also offers 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.019
 some very practical functions like 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.280
 optimizing the quality of your 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.019
 pictures if you do not want classified 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.299
 in the cloud your originals too 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.650
 bulky or locking access 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.970
 to the application of call pin code 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.769
 so obviously all your data 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.519
 will be stored well away from you in 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.139
 China 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.690
 it's up to you to see if that puts you 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:21.370
 problem and then you have no 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.470
 guarantee as to the durability of this 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.669
 service better so probably have 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.410
 all the files you spend on 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.060
 the union also at another place 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.400
 and then avoid storing data 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.319
 too confidential but youzhny can 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.549
 certainly do you a favor 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.319
 especially since even if you have a 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.090
 windows phone you can access it with 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.310
 a simple browser window 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.349
 the application is free on iphone and 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.609
 on android to download it without 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.870
 more wait just scan it 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.879
 the qr code that is showing up right now at 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.040
 the screen and that will take you directly 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:52.510
 the application store your 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.829
 smartphone 30 minutes a day at 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.449
 daily physical activity sector 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.040
 recommended by all doctors for 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.909
 keep fit it's proven 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.310
 people practicing an activity 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.750
 regular physics are usually 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.819
 less exposed than others to obesity 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.620
 to heart attacks and cancers 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.540
 then you will tell me that the apps for 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.099
 to play sports are certainly not lacking 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.599
 but human is different from others 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.190
 since she is going to verify that 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.739
 you are doing well your thirty minutes 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.659
 daily and not just when 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.799
 your walks race and bike rides 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:20.810
 but also when you are at home 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.849
 to clean or move in 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.550
 rhythm on the music of beats music 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:27.289
 this is the novelty of this version 2.0 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.090
 each of your physical activities from to 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.069
 less than a minute will be recorded 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.620
 by the application which in addition will you 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:36.319
 warn when you reach 30 60 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.120
 or 90 minutes of activity in total 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:39.830
 more what is good with human is the 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.569
 simplicity of its interface in three 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.069
 screens and when by default is content 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:45.740
 to display your activity time from 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:46.879
 current day and previous days a 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.259
 second screen allows you to consult 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:49.699
 your average physical activity 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.979
 weekly the duration of your activity 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.509
 in progress and your activity time 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.490
 longest physics of the day 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.229
 the options screen allows you to 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.460
 just turn on or off the plaice 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.080
 exchange rate is the unit of measurement of 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.949
 distances traveled to recover all 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.889
 the data recorded by 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.469
 the application by mail and from you 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.210
 connect or disconnect from facebook 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:09.800
 simple to use practices even if 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.240
 she is in english you back constitutes 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.289
 so a great way to motivate yourself 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.030
 to keep fit 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:15.650
 especially as this application for 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.729
 iphone only and that's his only 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.039
 default is free 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.039
 to download it here 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.330
 otcqx the icm challenged on twitter to play 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:28.310
 to octagon for iphone without annoying me 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.539
 so I necessarily took the challenge and 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.650
 the fact is that with this game whose mode 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:32.360
 job description is not unlike the one 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.400
 tom curren for those who know 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.710
 there is enough to lose patience 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.539
 its principle is simple you are taken to 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.550
 trap in the octagon which is no other 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:42.110
 that a succession of octagonal corridors 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.969
 that must be crossed without falling 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.830
 that all this you can just a 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:47.659
 finger swipe to rotate or 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.069
 completely return his hallways to 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:51.199
 avoid holes and obstacles that 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:53.389
 if they wanted bumped make it tremble 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.229
 the octagon what you will see it makes the 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.330
 more complicated things 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:58.969
 so everything is done to actually 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.620
 you are stressed because more and more you 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:02.419
 progress in the same level then 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.159
 your speed increases and so more 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.889
 traps become difficult to avoid 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:08.150
 and then you are naturally 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.129
 timed your score depending on the 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.560
 time that you get to hold without 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:14.810
 to fall a very annoying game so I 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.430
 confirms your click but perfect when 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.810
 we just have time for a little break 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.909
 in front of you the parties do not 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.650
 generally only very little time to 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:23.270
 note in passing the fun function to 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.759
 octagon ripley that allows you to 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.469
 see your last part here but 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:28.430
 actually the most annoying in I know 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:29.750
 that it is not available at the moment 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.600
 only on iphone 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.510
 and then you have to know all the same 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.130
 costs 1 euro 79 so so convenient clicks 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.480
 you have favorite applications 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.520
 which you would like me to speak in a
