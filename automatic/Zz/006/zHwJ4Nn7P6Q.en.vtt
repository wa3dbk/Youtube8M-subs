00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.240
 I'm the slim captain fighter pilot 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.360
 f-18 and destined at the base of torrejÃ³n 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.980
 of ardoz in madrid before the question that 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.110
 you have to do to be a fighter pilot in 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.880
 the army of the Spanish air because what 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.700
 first we have to study bachelor 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.010
 in the scientific technical aspect a 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.270
 once we finished those two years with the 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.850
 note that we have in that bad bachelor 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.110
 selectivity note gives you the 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.130
 possibility of access to the academy 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.780
 of the air that is in taking out the 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.579
 murcia basically like any other 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.879
 university the only exception is that 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.660
 you have to do some small tests 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:53.000
 filter in both English psychotechnical 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.140
 physical evidence and past medical tests 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.469
 these filters and with your note of 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.420
 selectivity and bachelor you can access 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.960
 to the general academy of the air are five 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.430
 years like any other university 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.860
 and basically what you 're going to have are 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.950
 theoretical subjects 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.650
 own of any engineering then 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.290
 you are going to have some more subjects 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.320
 military proper military 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.180
 and then three flight courses which is what 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.470
 which specifies the difference with others 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.390
 military that are in other academies 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.820
 the phase of the flight phases are the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.560
 first course that takes place in the third 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.380
 academic year of the academy is realized 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.910
 in the pillan is a simple plane and 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.340
 it's basically going to determine if you're 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.800
 apt or not suitable for the flight the second 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.630
 most important flight course is performed 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.370
 in a 101 is a small reactor of 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.320
 Spanish manufacture and the note that 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.030
 serves in this course if enough 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.190
 important when it comes to power you 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.170
 choose between the different slopes 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.050
 that you have to be the attack fighter and 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.470
 transport and helicopters if that note you 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.960
 allows to choose to access the course 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.210
 of attack hunting then in your fifth year 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.600
 of academy and doing your third year of 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.200
 flight you will go to the base of Talavera 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.280
 the real badajoz and there in the f5 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.280
