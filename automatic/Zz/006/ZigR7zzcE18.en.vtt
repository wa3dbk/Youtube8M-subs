00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
I always prefer to cut around the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.139 
I always prefer to cut around the
outside<00:00:57.239> edge<00:00:57.800> tends<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.250> easiest<00:00:59.280> way

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
outside edge tends to be the easiest way

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.830 
outside edge tends to be the easiest way
to<00:01:00.210> do<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:01.969> that<00:01:02.969> way<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.149> don't<00:01:03.359> screw<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
to do it that way you don't screw in the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.490 
to do it that way you don't screw in the
packaging<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.790> you<00:01:05.790> also<00:01:06.500> don't

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
packaging and you also don't

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.780 
packaging and you also don't
accidentally<00:01:08.070> cut<00:01:08.250> something<00:01:08.640> important

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
okay so cut around the outside edging

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.440 
okay so cut around the outside edging
and<00:01:14.729> at<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.180> point<00:01:15.770> should<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.920> able<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.130> get
