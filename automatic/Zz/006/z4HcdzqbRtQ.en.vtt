00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.740
 ron vlaar to remain expensive in amsterdam at the latest 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.709
 as self of course 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:09.989
 a 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:13.089
 adds up to the sea itself 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.529
 tip is good between anderlecht big play a few good chances 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.909
 2 0 ultimately it is one of many free kick a telescope gets the honor 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.609
 yes who then but this time can fall so he was not good it is a fact that the 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.179
 cows with say maybe we are the official time, especially in mentality 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.860
 still have to make the necessary steps 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.040
 yes that's right that makes sense but that also comes through 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.820
 after ten years with experience but good 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.220
 if you like if you had wanted to be together then all but years more 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.940
 It became painfully the lead to win a competition that is that simple 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.610
 It's when consulting is that consulting that is a statement 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.710
 anyway 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.820
 it is not much more negative but it is true i think it is 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.380
 so that's how to make one 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:07.110
 we make many wrong choices bouman in good top sport is suffering and I can 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.530
 it is good to want to go that far every day, but developing everything every day 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.330
 a big hit with training hard only the sons of certain aspects for ourselves 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.020
 and the trainers themselves go i just have to improve Rome because it has to 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.680
 if you think that is a missed opportunity to enter the world you win this one and 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.509
 I would win injured then you will get a bit more 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.470
 and yes that offer opportunities at 11 am 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.570
 Yes that's right 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.610
 the Hague 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.650
 well that's right that we had to realize and and when you see how the 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.910
 contest expires 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.730
 And if you are one good then a short one can also be over the line 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.200
 draw yes there are not allowed 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.310
 what a strange moment in the competition maybe that is completely new there 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.380
 after having to turn yellow twice to the side that man 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.640
 at heerenveen but the moment is perhaps again above my dad 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.159
 yes I just heard about it also has no fixed but the agent could not be 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.150
 both jumping weekly 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.600
 beforehand was what I stood was yes in the own sixteen with additional 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.270
 benefits 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.199
 well that's for the linesman i think honestly was the deepest man 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:13.349
 and that lucas is great that it is very sp list so yes then in my eyes you must 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.339
 then I can see
