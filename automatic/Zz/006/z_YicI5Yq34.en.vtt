standard fifteen sixteenth grid system

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.090 
standard fifteen sixteenth grid system
you<00:00:17.580> see<00:00:17.789> here<00:00:18.150> how<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.960> edge<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.590> our<00:00:19.740> drop

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
you see here how the edge of our drop

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.000 
you see here how the edge of our drop
ins<00:00:20.369> have<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> little<00:00:21.060> 1/8<00:00:21.510> inch<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:22.080> tension

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
ins have a little 1/8 inch in tension

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.429 
ins have a little 1/8 inch in tension
that<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.789> from<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.060> special<00:00:24.510> dye<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:25.080> we<00:00:25.199> made

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
that is from a special dye that we made

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.790 
that is from a special dye that we made
so<00:00:25.740> we<00:00:25.859> have<00:00:25.980> one<00:00:26.730> extra<00:00:27.300> step<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:28.170> making<00:00:28.529> our

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
so we have one extra step in making our

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.450 
so we have one extra step in making our
droppings

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
droppings

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.730 
droppings
this<00:00:30.090> was<00:00:30.330> our<00:00:30.510> dropping<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.230> you'll<00:00:31.470> notice

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
this was our dropping and you'll notice

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.240 
this was our dropping and you'll notice
due<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> draw<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> metal<00:00:33.450> how<00:00:34.320> this

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
due to the draw of the metal how this

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.900 
due to the draw of the metal how this
edge<00:00:35.820> laid<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.870> top<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.649> grid<00:00:37.910> allowing

edge laid on top of the grid allowing

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.060 
edge laid on top of the grid allowing
you<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.180> see<00:00:39.390> gapping<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> lot<00:00:41.040> of

our drop edge have 22 and 7/8 inches

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.580 
our drop edge have 22 and 7/8 inches
we're<00:01:11.250> able<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.909> allow<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.450> drop<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.320> drop

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
we're able to allow the drop in to drop

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.410 
we're able to allow the drop in to drop
into<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.369> grid<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.020> fit<00:01:16.020> exactly<00:01:16.830> flush

into the grid and fit exactly flush

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.380 
into the grid and fit exactly flush
inside<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.930> even<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:20.310> will<00:01:20.520> now<00:01:20.670> not<00:01:21.090> lay

inside it and even it will now not lay
on<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.810> top<00:01:22.049> you'll<00:01:22.350> see<00:01:22.619> no<00:01:22.799> gapping<00:01:23.100> you

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
on the top you'll see no gapping you

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.060 
on the top you'll see no gapping you
lose<00:01:23.790> no<00:01:24.030> air<00:01:24.299> conditioning<00:01:24.869> or<00:01:25.170> heat<00:01:25.409> each

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
lose no air conditioning or heat each

lose no air conditioning or heat each
drop<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.759> panel<00:01:27.150> comes<00:01:27.840> with<00:01:28.110> two<00:01:28.500> clips<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
drop in panel comes with two clips the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.910 
drop in panel comes with two clips the
idea<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> clip<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.170> goes<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> back

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
idea of the clip is it goes on the back

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.450 
idea of the clip is it goes on the back
of<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> grid<00:01:32.490> system<00:01:32.729> putting<00:01:33.720> pressure<00:01:34.460> onto

of the grid system putting pressure onto
the<00:01:35.820> panel<00:01:36.119> which<00:01:36.780> absolutely<00:01:37.470> locks<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.100> down

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the panel which absolutely locks it down

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.060 
the panel which absolutely locks it down
into<00:01:38.490> place<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.119> keeps<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.450> nice<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.689> even<00:01:40.170> by
