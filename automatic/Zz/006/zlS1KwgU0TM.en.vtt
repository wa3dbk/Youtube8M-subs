00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
loss but my hormone balance is too

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.100 
loss but my hormone balance is too
important<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.730> sacrifice<00:00:44.730> for<00:00:45.210> weight<00:00:45.899> loss

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
important to sacrifice for weight loss

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.250

so<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.800> will<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.550> ended<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.059> doing<00:00:48.360> more<00:00:48.600> rounds

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
do to lose their total amount this is

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.830
