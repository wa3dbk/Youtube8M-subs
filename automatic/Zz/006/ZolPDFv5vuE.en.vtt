just<00:03:20.700> throw<00:03:21.270> in<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.450> towel<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:22.020> leave<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:22.650> is

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
just throw in the towel and leave so is

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.740

it<00:03:22.860> going<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.340> get<00:03:23.520> better<00:03:23.940> is<00:03:24.210> this<00:03:24.390> just<00:03:24.600> a

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
it going to get better is this just a

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.020 
it going to get better is this just a
bad<00:03:24.990> year<00:03:25.350> well<00:03:26.160> there<00:03:26.460> is<00:03:26.550> a<00:03:26.580> theory<00:03:26.940> that

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
bad year well there is a theory that
