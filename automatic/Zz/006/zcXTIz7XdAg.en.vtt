GPS<00:02:07.530> very<00:02:07.860> much<00:02:08.160> but<00:02:08.340> i<00:02:08.400> have<00:02:08.550> tested<00:02:08.820> it<00:02:09.060> and

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
GPS very much but i have tested it and

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.890 
GPS very much but i have tested it and
it<00:02:09.300> does<00:02:09.480> work<00:02:09.720> very<00:02:09.990> well<00:02:10.460> he's<00:02:11.460> now<00:02:11.900> looks

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
it does work very well he's now looks

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.050 
it does work very well he's now looks
fine<00:02:13.140> but<00:02:15.470> some<00:02:16.470> sometimes<00:02:17.280> what<00:02:17.460> I<00:02:17.490> do<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:17.910> I

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
fine but some sometimes what I do is I

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.500 
fine but some sometimes what I do is I
close<00:02:18.510> out<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.900> car<00:02:19.470> dock<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:20.180> then<00:02:21.180> as<00:02:21.360> you

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
close out the car dock and then as you

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.490 
close out the car dock and then as you
can<00:02:21.660> see<00:02:22.220> everything<00:02:23.220> goes<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:24.500> landscape

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
can see everything goes to landscape

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.800 
can see everything goes to landscape
mode<00:02:25.530> which<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.340> nice

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
mode which is nice

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.990 
mode which is nice
so

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.950 

you<00:02:32.330> can<00:02:32.480> see<00:02:32.690> I<00:02:33.160> wish<00:02:34.160> they<00:02:34.310> have<00:02:34.490> this<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:34.970> wish
