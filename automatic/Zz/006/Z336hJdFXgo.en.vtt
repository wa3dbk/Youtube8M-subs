so<00:00:00.480> welcome<00:00:00.989> to<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.140> lab<00:00:01.439> here<00:00:01.829> is<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:02.100> latest

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
so welcome to the lab here is the latest

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.309 
so welcome to the lab here is the latest
little<00:00:02.700> thing<00:00:02.939> crazy<00:00:03.240> Russians<00:00:03.750> been<00:00:03.929> working

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
little thing crazy Russians been working

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.230 
little thing crazy Russians been working
on<00:00:04.440> we've<00:00:04.650> actually<00:00:04.830> done<00:00:05.220> another<00:00:05.609> batch<00:00:05.940> of

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
on we've actually done another batch of

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.930 
on we've actually done another batch of
red<00:00:06.480> cases<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:07.230> this<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.680> for<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.069> new<00:00:08.610> special

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
red cases and this is for a new special

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.450 
red cases and this is for a new special
edition<00:00:09.540> system<00:00:09.990> so<00:00:10.559> once<00:00:10.920> again<00:00:11.070> we're<00:00:11.429> only

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
edition system so once again we're only

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.129 
edition system so once again we're only
going<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.820> be<00:00:11.910> building<00:00:12.120> five<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.750> these<00:00:12.870> but

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
going to be building five of these but

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.400 
going to be building five of these but
this<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.440> going<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.920> be<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.250> Vesta<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.940> one<00:00:15.630> so

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
this is going to be the Vesta a one so

video if you do see one of these systems
on<00:01:16.530> display<00:01:17.130> oh<00:01:17.310> yeah<00:01:17.610> one<00:01:17.850> thing<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.119> missed<00:01:18.360> is

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
on display oh yeah one thing I missed is

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.870 
on display oh yeah one thing I missed is
that<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.110> brand-new<00:01:19.290> corsair<00:01:20.100> h16

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
that we have the brand-new corsair h16

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.030 
that we have the brand-new corsair h16
here<00:01:21.150> it's<00:01:21.570> got<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> very<00:01:22.110> solid<00:01:22.680> looking

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
here it's got a very solid looking

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.010 
here it's got a very solid looking
mounting<00:01:23.400> system<00:01:23.820> overall<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.540> think<00:01:24.720> it'd<00:01:24.990> be

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
mounting system overall I think it'd be

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.170 
mounting system overall I think it'd be
pretty<00:01:25.259> much<00:01:25.470> impossible<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:26.880> remove<00:01:27.119> that

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
pretty much impossible to remove that

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.730 
pretty much impossible to remove that
from<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.570> cpu<00:01:27.810> socket<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.560> that's

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
from the cpu socket so that's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.980 
from the cpu socket so that's
outstanding<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:30.030> system<00:01:30.360> also<00:01:30.570> stays

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
outstanding and the system also stays

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.260 
outstanding and the system also stays
very<00:01:31.560> cool<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.009> very<00:01:32.310> quiet<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.150> noise

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
very cool and very quiet the noise

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.590 
very cool and very quiet the noise
signature<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.799> 6990<00:01:35.790> particularly<00:01:36.479> is

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
signature of the 6990 particularly is

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.690 
signature of the 6990 particularly is
dramatically<00:01:37.110> improved<00:01:37.619> from<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.280> original

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700

launch cards that we saw that got so

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.520 
launch cards that we saw that got so
loud<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.579> here<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.210> have<00:01:42.329> some<00:01:42.570> cooler<00:01:43.200> master

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530

are<00:01:43.649> for<00:01:43.920> fans<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.460> would<00:01:44.549> appear<00:01:44.820> not<00:01:45.049> yet

crazy<00:01:46.290> Russian<00:01:46.619> confirms<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.070> those<00:01:47.310> are

crazy Russian confirms that those are

crazy Russian confirms that those are

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
red LED fans and I suspect we'll get a
