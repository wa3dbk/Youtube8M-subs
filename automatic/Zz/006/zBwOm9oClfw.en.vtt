00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.450
 hi everyone my name is Diana and this is my 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.150
 mother block with the appearance of the baby 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.500
 often the question of young parents is about 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.960
 shopping strollers 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.320
 Well, of course some families give 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.510
 Stroller inherited from older children 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.519
 relatives in Georgia and if you are not from 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.580
 those people who are watching a gift 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:41.860
 I am very jealous of you 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.019
 but I chose the stroller myself 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.030
 I bought it therefore on this I am a dog 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.780
 I ate and I have something with you today 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.239
 share 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.190
 I would immediately like to apologize if this 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.050
 the video will be a little tight 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.829
 because the topic is extensive to say there is 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.480
 a lot of 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.700
 And in the next video, I will definitely 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.969
 I'll take a small review in my own way 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.680
 fleet but in this video will be 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.809
 theoretical part about what 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.320
 there are types of strollers and how to understand 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.570
 what exactly do you need so if 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.880
 leave all unnecessary types of the carriages 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.780
 there are three this cradle 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.289
 stroller transformer start with 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.990
 cradles 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:22.080
 the cradle is usually a strong highway 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.149
 good depreciation 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.580
 rubber wheels well and on top 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:30.940
 what about whole in which baby 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.399
 lies I will not describe all the advantages of this 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.140
 the stroller although a lot of them but the most 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.720
 the main thing and the minus is that it is not 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.910
 universally that is, the child will 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.160
 lying outside at best until 7 8 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.619
 months and many children start early 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.489
 sit and already at 4 do not want to use 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.030
 this stroller 

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:50.020
 but going to meet the buyer 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.840
 the manufacturer makes this stroller 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.690
 more or less universal convene more 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.009
 two subtypes they are called universal 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.069
 2 in 1 stroller 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.050
 or transport system 3 in one 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.630
 there is the same thing that's strong 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.599
 the highway is put a few blocks 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.509
 the next type is strollers and 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:13.209
 they differ from two species in 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.010
 depending on the folding mechanism then 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.129
 there can be a cane which is 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.160
 so decomposed or books so these 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:24.040
 Strollers are good because they have a light 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.050
 they have almost no depreciation 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.180
 some serious but anyway they 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.329
 very convenient for with 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.939
 my mom is there a little seat and again 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:35.459
 she is not universal because baby 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:37.439
 I can only sit a wheelchair is 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.689
 since birth you are not a stroller 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.730
 buy and again and to go 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.310
 towards the produced buyers 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.980
 the manufacturer does more or less 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.769
 universal this design and either 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.590
 creates an extra block cradle either 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.859
 makes the seat mats fold out to 90 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.829
 degrees and the last type is a transformer 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.659
 this is such a super versatile stroller 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.629
 which you can buy from birth to 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.430
 the very end of use but in every 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.250
 case in my opinion it is 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.099
 bulky not very pretty and not 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.010
 very convenient and this creation but not 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.049
 less many moms love him for being short 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.480
 cost despite the fact that she is like 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.870
 how combines all these types 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.790
 but in practice many moms wrote about 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.659
 that they used this stroller 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.519
 not for long 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.040
 and then all the same all go on 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.840
 stroller well now you 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.849
 know what strollers are 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.459
 and it remains only to understand which 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.729
 here, of course, everything is much 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.040
 harder but my advice to you before 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:43.260
 go choose a stroller to shop in front 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.530
 How to read reviews and choose a stroller 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.260
 on the internet I advise you to calm down 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.419
 sit down and soberly assess the current 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.879
 situation how will you use 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:56.430
 pram imagine where you will be 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.250
 keep it as you ride and and 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.709
 and how will you lower everything in general 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.079
 all all appreciate when comparing all 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.569
 these factors stroller she will 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:09.150
 your daily helper they are killers and 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.220
 your nerves in general that you should 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.900
 take into account 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.870
 if you have a lift like you will 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.259
 pull the stroller into the porch 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.540
 if ramps if where and store what 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:24.120
 asphalt around the house 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.030
 what is the size of the trunk if it is 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.700
 in general if he is generally in general when you 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.860
 match all these factors yourself 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.900
 understand that it can be so stroller 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.060
 whom he is so pretty she at all 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.230
 you do not fit you need some 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.080
 another stroller 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.990
 more comfortable is that which will be you 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.990
 that's just help so when you get it 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.210
 what kind of stroller do you need me 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.730
 I suggest to go in search but not in 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.160
 shop and the internet and 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:57.650
 but I suggest using services 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:04.430
 Yandex, we go to the Yandex market and 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:08.220
 We look the section children's goods of a carriage with 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.590
 left and cell data in which we can 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.520
 drive some parameters suitable for us 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.960
