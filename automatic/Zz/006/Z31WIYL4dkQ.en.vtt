for the most part I think we had ten one
day<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.770> might<00:00:20.430> be<00:00:20.580> overestimating<00:00:20.820> just<00:00:21.480> a

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
day I might be overestimating just a

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.980 
day I might be overestimating just a
little<00:00:22.609> just<00:00:23.609> five<00:00:23.850> or<00:00:24.029> six<00:00:24.210> area<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> got<00:00:24.960> a

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
little just five or six area so I got a

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.040 
little just five or six area so I got a

lot of them ready for upload this is the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.140 
lot of them ready for upload this is the
first<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.380> them<00:00:28.580> should<00:00:29.580> be<00:00:29.640> up<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.000> next

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150

few<00:00:30.359> days<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.810> might<00:00:30.960> upload<00:00:31.260> them<00:00:31.500> all<00:00:31.650> one<00:00:31.890> day

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
few days I might upload them all one day

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.709 
few days I might upload them all one day
today<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:34.520> only<00:00:35.520> time<00:00:35.820> will<00:00:35.880> tell<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.420> might

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
get too lazy I also have another I've

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.910 
get too lazy I also have another I've
two<00:00:40.730> no<00:00:41.730> three<00:00:42.239> special<00:00:42.870> videos<00:00:43.170> one<00:00:43.559> Ivan

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
two no three special videos one Ivan

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.299 
two no three special videos one Ivan
recorded<00:00:44.820> yet<00:00:45.000> but<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> other<00:00:45.510> two<00:00:46.100> I'm<00:00:47.100> gonna

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
recorded yet but the other two I'm gonna

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.850 
recorded yet but the other two I'm gonna
get<00:00:47.430> up<00:00:47.579> one<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.600> think<00:00:49.020> it's<00:00:49.410> definitely<00:00:49.829> a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
get up one is I think it's definitely a

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.139 
get up one is I think it's definitely a
world<00:00:50.010> record<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.489> other<00:00:50.610> one<00:00:50.789> might<00:00:50.969> be

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
world record and the other one might be

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.700 
world record and the other one might be
too<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:51.629> I'm<00:00:51.750> we're<00:00:52.020> breaking<00:00:52.320> our<00:00:52.559> own

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
too but I'm we're breaking our own

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.660 
too but I'm we're breaking our own
records<00:00:53.360> which<00:00:54.360> i<00:00:54.449> find<00:00:54.600> funny<00:00:55.280> ok<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.340> start

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.340 
and then he pulls off a nice three
minute<00:01:57.510> nuclear<00:02:01.340> starting<00:02:02.340> here<00:02:03.350> great

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
minute nuclear starting here great

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.730 
minute nuclear starting here great
three-minute<00:02:04.920> active<00:02:05.280> nuclear<00:02:06.560> this<00:02:07.560> Maps

three-minute active nuclear this Maps

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.469 
three-minute active nuclear this Maps
got<00:02:08.010> some<00:02:08.490> blood<00:02:08.610> work<00:02:08.760> I<00:02:08.940> think<00:02:09.180> this<00:02:09.270> might

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
got some blood work I think this might

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.840 
got some blood work I think this might
be<00:02:09.510> one<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.899> worst<00:02:10.020> spawning<00:02:10.470> maps

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
be one of the worst spawning maps

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.340 
be one of the worst spawning maps
because<00:02:11.850> if<00:02:12.120> your<00:02:12.240> teams<00:02:12.450> over<00:02:12.840> here<00:02:13.170> and

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
because if your teams over here and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.670 
because if your teams over here and
you're<00:02:14.310> on<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.640> other<00:02:14.790> side<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:16.260> hard<00:02:16.470> point

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
you're on the other side the hard point

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.910 
you're on the other side the hard point
is<00:02:17.000> you're<00:02:18.000> all<00:02:18.150> alone<00:02:18.530> they<00:02:19.530> will<00:02:19.710> actually
