00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:08.670
 today I present a different recipe 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.670
 bittersweet pig but molecular style 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.320
 let's start this recipe 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.810
 making the gelatin for it we have 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.540
 juice of an orange to which we add 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.750
 the agar agar in this case is little more than 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.270
 we will leave a gram over medium heat 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.070
 until it exceeds 80 degrees once 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.010
 that we have reached this temperature 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.989
 we have a metal source that I put in 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.420
 the freezer so it's cool and 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.430
 we will let it cool and see 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.070
 that the gelatin is made at the moment 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.730
 meanwhile we are going to prepare the 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.149
 portions of pork loin we cut them 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.250
 in pieces more or less that fit well into 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.120
 a mouthful and let's go through 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.890
 flour the beaten egg and then 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.890
 by bread crumbs 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.409
 once we have it 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.900
 passed through bread crumbs 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.340
 what we are going to do is to happen again 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.469
 once again for the egg 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.600
 to impregnate again 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:22.000
 again from the egg 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.830
 and then again for the bread 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.770
 grated in this way we have a double 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.759
 battered that will make us stay 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.759
 much more crispy 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.210
 we have a pan with oil prepared 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.630
 I have used sunflower oil because it is 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.439
 neutral and it will not give us much flavor to 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.240
 the food we are going to put our 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.340
 portions of pork tenderloin and once 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.500
 we have them golden on the one hand 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.530
 we are going to turn around so that we 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.319
 brown for the other and once we have 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.740
 the portions already well browned with a 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.210
 appetizing color we are going to remove it to a 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.670
 dish where we have put a little bit of 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.500
 Absorbent kitchen paper so that 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.500
 eliminate excess fat 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.160
 the gelatin as you can see we already have it 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.250
 made 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.400
 and what we are going to do is 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.060
 breaking pieces with the fork breaks 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.340
 we will easily put these pieces 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.050
 making a circle on a plate 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.810
 I used a circle if you use a 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.480
 you can put it on a rectangular plate 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.830
 making a line as you like already 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.780
 next I put the portions of 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:42.720
 pig that we have separated and we just 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.550
 putting the spheres of sweet and sour sauce 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.890
 that I teach you to do in a video 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.010
 previous and that you have the link there 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.280
 below and finish the plate with some 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.010
 sprigs of fresh chives and this is the 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.830
 result 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.599
 a modern kitchen dish that is 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.980
 I highly recommend it, I hope you 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.980
 have liked until another
