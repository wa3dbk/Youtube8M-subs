00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:59.770

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.270

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.800
 with bread with rice or just a small salad 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.800
 because the heat will be general will be 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.420

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.870
 more 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.690
 remembering that the country today's lawyer does not 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.080

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.740

 at the time it will enter more shares of the 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.980
 You decide now that this was mine. 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.530
 khaki 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.510
 you could use was medical cake or a 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.700
 great shape if you prefer but stay 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.080
 well prettier if you do this 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.900
 form that facilitates the portion of 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.600
 individual portions 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.480
 and we took our mold that is already 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.440
 different but to make sure that nothing 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.660
 will cross 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.420
 Let's get over you at home. 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.210
 whether or not it is an anti-adherent center in 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.710
 house spends a little oil that does not 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.710
 will be sure 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.800
 so we're going to talk about this 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.350
 mix here in our family of color 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.800
 khaki and let's bake the fire 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:56.550
 more or less 180 200 degrees per 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.680
 It took me about 30 minutes to go 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.540

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.630

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.280
 neighbor and he expects us to 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.300
 Crying up, that's the secret. 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.070
 behind the supletivo and now it's just eating 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.989

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.989
 You can call the guys to eat. 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:27.139
 very good and old 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:31.659
 I like the public a delight and then 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.659
 You start, you can already leaf. 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.400
