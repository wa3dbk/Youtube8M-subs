Glashow I found him and I wanted to find
out<00:03:05.490> what<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:05.730> buy<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:06.000> now<00:03:06.150> price<00:03:06.420> was<00:03:06.690> on<00:03:06.780> the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
out what is buy it now price was on the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.870 
out what is buy it now price was on the
market<00:03:07.080> I<00:03:07.560> think<00:03:07.830> it<00:03:07.950> comes<00:03:08.160> out<00:03:08.310> at<00:03:08.490> like<00:03:08.610> the

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
market I think it comes out at like the

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.120 
market I think it comes out at like the
lowest<00:03:09.060> value<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.510> could<00:03:09.660> find<00:03:09.870> was<00:03:10.040> 2,300<00:03:11.040> he

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
lowest value I could find was 2,300 he

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.760 
lowest value I could find was 2,300 he
still<00:03:11.430> wasn't<00:03:11.610> selling<00:03:11.970> after<00:03:12.240> half<00:03:12.450> an<00:03:12.570> hour

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
still wasn't selling after half an hour

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.229 
still wasn't selling after half an hour
so<00:03:13.770> i<00:03:14.280> decided<00:03:16.070> that<00:03:17.070> i<00:03:17.370> would<00:03:17.490> put<00:03:18.120> the

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
so i decided that i would put the

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.930 
so i decided that i would put the
selling<00:03:18.540> price<00:03:18.780> at<00:03:18.989> around<00:03:19.230> 2200<00:03:19.950> that's<00:03:20.760> what

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
selling price at around 2200 that's what

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.100 
selling price at around 2200 that's what
i<00:03:20.970> want<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.420> sell<00:03:21.570> him<00:03:21.600> for<00:03:21.720> because<00:03:22.019> it's

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
i want to sell him for because it's

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.920 
i want to sell him for because it's
below<00:03:22.350> market<00:03:22.709> price<00:03:22.739> and<00:03:23.480> then<00:03:24.480> people<00:03:24.750> were

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
below market price and then people were

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.120 
below market price and then people were
likely<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.290> buy<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.530> because<00:03:25.680> people<00:03:26.040> have

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
likely to buy it because people have

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.470 
likely to buy it because people have
when<00:03:26.280> people<00:03:26.519> do<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:26.670> by<00:03:26.790> now<00:03:26.970> search<00:03:27.269> they
