00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
all righty things that don't work that I

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.930 
all righty things that don't work that I
tried<00:00:12.230> first<00:00:13.230> one<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:14.190> mounting<00:00:14.550> the<00:00:14.580> servo

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
tried first one is mounting the servo

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.730 
tried first one is mounting the servo
over<00:00:15.600> on<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:15.809> side<00:00:15.870> somewhere<00:00:16.380> and<00:00:16.500> trying

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
over on this side somewhere and trying

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.100 
over on this side somewhere and trying
to<00:00:16.800> go<00:00:16.950> through<00:00:17.189> one<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.460> these<00:00:17.610> two<00:00:18.110> servo

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
to go through one of these two servo

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.600 
to go through one of these two servo
cable<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.560> not<00:00:19.710> long<00:00:19.920> enough<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.189> reach<00:00:20.369> the

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
cable is not long enough to reach the

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.150 
cable is not long enough to reach the
throttle<00:00:23.180> also<00:00:24.180> they<00:00:24.900> give<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.260> VSS<00:00:25.770> wire

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
throttle also they give you the VSS wire

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.939 
throttle also they give you the VSS wire
which<00:00:26.670> i<00:00:26.850> think<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.210> gray<00:00:27.480> one<00:00:27.949> it's

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
which i think is the gray one it's

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.189 
which i think is the gray one it's
wrapped<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.760> black<00:00:30.000> one<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.720> has<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
wrapped in this black one that has the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.400 
wrapped in this black one that has the
gray<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.770> black<00:00:31.920> one<00:00:32.190> for<00:00:33.199> magnet<00:00:34.199> kid

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
gray and the black one for magnet kid

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.689 
gray and the black one for magnet kid
enviousness<00:00:35.120> don't<00:00:36.120> use<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> VSS<00:00:37.610> there's<00:00:38.610> a

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
enviousness don't use the VSS there's a

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.910 
enviousness don't use the VSS there's a
panel<00:00:39.390> over<00:00:39.449> on<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.720> other<00:00:39.750> side<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.290> tried

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
panel over on the other side I tried

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.720 
panel over on the other side I tried
that<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.820> blew<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.090> brake<00:00:42.480> light<00:00:42.690> fuse<00:00:43.020> so

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
that and it blew the brake light fuse so

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.270 
that and it blew the brake light fuse so
didn't<00:00:44.730> work<00:00:44.850> don't<00:00:45.720> do<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.989> just<00:00:46.980> go<00:00:47.100> by<00:00:47.250> the

the breakline
how<00:01:03.550> it<00:01:03.640> was<00:01:03.730> there<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.000> brake<00:01:04.180> booster<00:01:04.360> hose

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 
how it was there the brake booster hose

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.380 
how it was there the brake booster hose
which<00:01:04.809> is<00:01:04.960> right<00:01:05.110> here<00:01:05.430> comes<00:01:06.430> out<00:01:07.120> of<00:01:07.330> the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
which is right here comes out of the

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.980 
which is right here comes out of the
brake<00:01:07.920> doodad<00:01:08.920> goes<00:01:09.700> around<00:01:09.910> comes<00:01:10.480> right

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
brake doodad goes around comes right

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.610 
brake doodad goes around comes right
into<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.260> engine<00:01:11.530> right<00:01:11.860> here<00:01:13.620> instructions

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
into the engine right here instructions

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.770 
into the engine right here instructions
say<00:01:14.800> don't<00:01:15.130> tap<00:01:15.370> into<00:01:15.520> that<00:01:15.700> but<00:01:16.420> I<00:01:16.450> talked<00:01:16.720> to

enough<00:01:29.979> power<00:01:30.190> and<00:01:31.200> happily<00:01:32.200> it<00:01:32.410> does<00:01:32.680> I

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
enough power and happily it does I

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.380 
enough power and happily it does I
haven't<00:01:33.700> had<00:01:33.820> any<00:01:33.970> problems<00:01:34.450> with<00:01:34.509> brakes<00:01:34.860> so
