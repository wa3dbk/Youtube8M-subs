00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.640
 Hello, how are we doing today? 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.850
 a necklace 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:20.140
 of chains and pearls 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:22.300
 and what we are going to do is unite the 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.210
 pearls to the string with these sticks 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.060
 that they have down like a tea with the 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.840
 candelita vale 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.440
 I have a big piece that is 33 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.449
 centimeters and 4 pieces of 7 but the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.329
 already measured a little to the taste of how 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.539
 you want long 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:45.100
 and what we are going to do is go putting 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.100
 the pearls in the sticks 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.860
 and we put it like that 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.820
 we do we are going to have to cut 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.820
 a piece 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.550
 and we are going to do it 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.670
 a ring 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.870
 let's put 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.430
 chain 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.950
 and close 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.880
 this we are going to do is open it 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.939
 or start another piece a piece of 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.939
 small chain 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.369
 let's go take another 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.829
 we put it 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.890
 one 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.350
 Let's put it like this to do better 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.140
 the little flag 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.120
 we put 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.780
 ask again 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.610
 we open you 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.610
 and we are going to do all 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.430
 or 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.430
 because this is the last 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.930
 that gets you out a lot 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:54.360
 and now what we are going to do is unite 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.620
 with the long part of the chain for 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:02.390
 close the necklace and so it is not necessary 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.390
 put a brooch or anything 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.959
 or 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.520
 our necklace finished 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.670
 d 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.420
 what simple 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.420
 and easy to do 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.239
