00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.270 
this video so yeah that's pretty cool we
got<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.610> guy<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:24.170> 185<00:01:25.170> k<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.530> he<00:01:25.680> doesn't

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
got this guy here 185 k and he doesn't

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.800 
got this guy here 185 k and he doesn't
look<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.549> he's<00:01:26.729> changed<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.090> price<00:01:27.270> at<00:01:27.540> all

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
look like he's changed in price at all

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.080 
look like he's changed in price at all
so<00:01:28.380> he<00:01:28.950> could<00:01:29.100> be<00:01:29.220> one<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.490> might<00:01:29.700> not<00:01:29.820> go<00:01:30.000> up

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
