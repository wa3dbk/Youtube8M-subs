00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:09.240
 Well in terms of the well 3 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:12.519
 Recently, I 'm pretty addicted to author or wine 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.010
 Wine and liquors are good with wine 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:19.300
 Because I give up 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:21.580

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:26.940
 In terms of food 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.940
 Gattsuri said in Well after all the meat meat F 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.350
 Manganese is 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.010

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.010
 Well, yes, I'm reading a jump . 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:45.210
 Whether the opposition is that there is sometimes this little novel 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.330
 10 I read sf's novels when I thought after 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.250
 Oh idol is a little 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.100
 It is not

 It is more of idle do not know at all 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:00.440
 I would like a pretty kind person 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:06.369
 It looks like a kind person looks like that and looks like that 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.369
 It is nice to have a nice person in the second town risk degree 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:16.810
 It means Tsu not lose to De' not lose to anyone 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:22.030
 I'm doing a little Rie at the convenience of my own growth. 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.960
 So I 'm studying to make a game a bit 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.650
 not really 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.250
 Te Well done little but is the state that do not have 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.330
 Blue and orange 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.540
 It's orange 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:39.820
 Kimono is 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:46.150
 Dismantling was also creatures a little I want to buy a Haa hamster recently 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.870
 Well, a few years ago a member of skype taught me a little bit and that's why 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.380
 started 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:55.990
 At first I thought it was boring at all, but I did it 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:02:02.170
 fuma It was addicted after one month to start without winning 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:06.369
 Yes it 's not a simple one-to-one but it's a place where you're going to do it with multiple people 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:10.690
 I was about to say car Well Naa do have a game nude little different until now 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:16.590
 I already bought something like mmo rpg. 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:22.290
 I liked it because it was a little new game 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:28.960
 To tell the truth and wanted to decide what if there is no ui Tteyuu derived from this 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:30.280
 Hey take it I'm being possibly display of image recognition when creating account 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:36.130
 Alphabet 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:39.380
 I really started with it after I felt good 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.100
 Well than the rival team so and so 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.050
 I 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.810
 Well if you do well 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.190
 Because I can win it 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:53.060
 I think it's okay to grow myself 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.959
 I'm only aware that I can play well 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.959
 I am not conscious 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:04.519
 Well this is a great personal thing but it was 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.000
 I like the defense player quite far ahead 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:10.410
 I like like a 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.550
 That year is like that but there is too much pressure 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.110
 I was doing alone in basically all the way solo 9 until now 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.190
 55 After getting to do 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:24.330
 It's a bit my own point or something to improve 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:29.510
 Because Toda Toma is found 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.510
 I came to play while conscious of such places 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:36.950
 This teammate is playing during the match 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:40.970
 By Toka Well do me Lucian Santo who is pointed out 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:44.230
 It was Well the same thing and that failure is when to do the next game 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.770
 I try to be conscious 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:53.410
 First of all 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:59.190
 By mitt stable in the win at the pros and jazz if brought into 1 or the like now stable 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.190
 Really and truly I win if correspondingly also Wow Rore I guess is a child that say 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:08.730
 I want little to do in the full-scale of masu Toma while ago of game production called Well Well target 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.600
 Than you think and 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.920
 Hey it 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:20.889
 I'm working hard and I 'm studying a little now 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:24.940
 All hen a little yourself say selfish and basically out in any tournament rather than yourself too much prohibited 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:29.680
 Nde believes only the fact that so play can be firmly 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.390
 Types that can not think of multiple things too often concentrate on one thing 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:37.110
 What 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.110
 I do not think too much than as Well Tsu much tournament Donokono 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.120
 It will probably not lose to anyone after another month
