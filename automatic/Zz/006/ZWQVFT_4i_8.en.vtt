00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello My name is Alexander's ecological 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.069
 some know me from common training and events 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.699
 Today I would like to invite you to video training for the new P 99 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:14.999
 LG Optimus Speed ​​to attend 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.730
 I'll also show him highlights »unitop features of this device 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.370
 And they convince that is the most powerful smartphone from LG 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.329
 currently on the 8th 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.539
 Director 4 990 Optimus Speed 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.000
 the world's first smartphone with dual-core processor 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.090
 as operating system we use this mobile phone 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.450
 that is stimulated and so the latest version 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.690
 we equipped it with a small camera with 1 2 by 3 megapixels 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.790
 and an outdoor camera with 8 megapixels and occupy the seats the Full 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:48.510
 makes hd video recordings 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.730
 Furthermore, it has an 8 gigabyte internal memory 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.850
 and continue to build memory and another 32 gigabytes 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.069
 how long the Lena Unheilig's connectivity 

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:04.749
 is of course with this smartphone this power and 

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:05.610
 speed 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.890
 Diddy is 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.369
 the single points 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.960
 we come in the course of this video shows 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.830
 instead of 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.830
 I would open a simultaneous for them 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.930
 I have decided 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.930
 for the ZDF 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.930
 we do it simply by typing www 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.460
 the home page 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.740
 this home concerts it is very diligently Halbig and you can see 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.260
 what speed 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.310
 The bobsleigh team needs to build this site 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.710
 and represents 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.430
 Of course we also had the opportunity to whisper another 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.060
 to show us this perspective I have as a favorite for me 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.480
 personally namely 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.880
 chosen our Angie blog page 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.320
 and if I give in it my favorites just one 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.369
 the body up 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.190
 select the DLC block 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.490
 then we have within seconds 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.830
 because in the world is the blog page 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.749
 with a complete presentation to the mill you know from the PC 

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.040
 Not 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.110
 instead of 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.309
 The computing power of an Optimus Speed ​​is enormous 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.740
 if that's what I'm going to portray on my Optimus Speed 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.659
 start a benchmark test now 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.659
 this benchmark test tested memory 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.299
 continuation 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.989
 2g animations doing the animations 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.579
 sign out of the internal memory 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.609
 after he has checked everything 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.989
 we will get results from the internet from the database of quadrant for 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.179
 By the way, we decided on this benchmark test 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:41.370
 if we get the results right now you can see 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.900
 A 3d maze is used to test the 3d animations and the 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.929
 be displayed accordingly 

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:50.109
 compared 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.889
 About processor performance 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.149
 By the way, a benchmark test is available for free on the android App Store 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.740
 as in life the other 190 breaks EPS 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.239
 the top times are available on the android App Store 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.489
 After the benchmark test is completed we get one 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.219
 message 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.360
 "That we can retrieve the results from the Portland 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.619
 Database 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:15.479
 we confirm the whole country 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:18.969
 and behold we have now 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.989
 the results of the benchmark leaves 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.229
 stand next to me 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:24.700
 SZ 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.390
 Instead of today we are using more and more applications 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.309
 also our smartphone 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:32.380
 that's why multitasking is 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.050
 and that with the Optimus provide delay-free absolutely essential 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.790
 "I can open several applications at the same time and very much 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.740
 fast between these applications 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.409
 back and forth 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:46.480
 I would like to demonstrate live in the here live I have some 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.969
 Applications opened 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:51.249
 and you here 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:54.469
 in which applications I can move back and forth when I estimate 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:55.339
 Calendar Wild 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:56.729
 this is not my calendar 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:58.699
 really fast back to the 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:01.389
 Photos would like then I am my gallery 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:02.299
 or 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.049
 I would like to quickly book a hotel for tonight here in Munich 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.209
 then I step on my hair grabbing it 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.209
 and can get started right away and like the hotel bay 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:17.329
 I have my phone right there the cables to the TV paddock 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.159
 and thus have the opportunity content 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:23.889
 directly from the phone to the TV with friends relatives and acquaintances too 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.949
 divide 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.639
 the advantage in front of us all is 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:29.930
 I am with Sell 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.840
 May in Berlin Optimus Speed 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.800
 as a mobile video player 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.689
 muffled 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:38.690
 play on the smartphone 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.439
 is absolutely nothing new 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:43.990
 but the combination dual-core processor LG Optimus Speed 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.660
 really fun and conveys the feeling 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.699
 as if I am playing on a game console 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.330
 and to demonstrate that, I'm starting on my Optimus Beat 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.650
 the Crisis Snowboards game 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.990
 and use 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.129
 No 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:03.029
 also this picture as 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:07.259
 By moving control I basically enjoy my avatar in the game 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:08.069
 easy 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:09.860
 the moments 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.860
 you play here with me 

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:23.669
 Cha the Optimus Speed ​​also with 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.800
 even and women are equipped with 1 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.599
 they have the opportunity at home 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.819
 to enjoy the sound properly r 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:35.680
 The camera function in a smartphone is becoming increasingly important 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.860
 in addition - they the videos the IEC one wants to have included also KMUs PID 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.419
 We have equipped the Optimus Speed ​​with an 8-megapixel camera with 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.180
 is done 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.439
 the special thing about this camera is 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:49.979
 that is the TSG came alone is a cell phone 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.320
 to record the full hd videos 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.309
 and again in Full HD 

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:59.929
 in a resolution with 1000 920 times breaks 80 pixels 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.099
 In addition to the 3 8-liter pixel camera, we also have the LG Optimus Speed 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:08.099
 with one in the camera accidentally with 1 2 times 3 megapixels 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.460
 the advantage that I have through it 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.339
 that Video Kors can make friends and relatives with my friends 

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:17.900
 I am very good friend independent of all people, namely ponds and 

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:19.650
 I want to call them now 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.979
 just stay up a bit longer video chorus run 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.610
 and off you go 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.879
 Estoril not built like NSN 

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:30.879
 or Skype 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:41.529
 Yes 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:44.559
 we have here 

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:47.869
 Alexander, I marriage to a human and thought I have to just go 

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:52.619
 I do not see it that way 

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:55.719
 Where are you, then 

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:59.289
 They even let us have Olga just grab them 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.440
 but I'm giving a video shoot for the LG Optimus Speed ​​and is doing so too 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.440
 I will be with you after the video shoot 

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:13.159
 every few Daguet 

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:19.719
 Aside from being so easy it is video cost recovery LG Optimus Speed ​​too 

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:19.999
 to lead
