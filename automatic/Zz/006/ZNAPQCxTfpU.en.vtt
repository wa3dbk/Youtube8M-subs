during my initial EMT course I was
introduced<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.509> concept<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.079> scene<00:00:22.320> safety

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
introduced the concept of scene safety

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.400 
introduced the concept of scene safety
it<00:00:23.550> seemed<00:00:23.759> like<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> very<00:00:24.060> simple<00:00:24.539> concept<00:00:24.689> to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
it seemed like a very simple concept to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.400 
it seemed like a very simple concept to
an<00:00:25.500> EMT<00:00:26.189> student<00:00:26.390> the<00:00:27.390> instructor<00:00:27.930> said<00:00:28.140> if

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
the end of every shift make sure the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.819 
the end of every shift make sure the
scene<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.460> safe<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.839> was<00:00:33.960> settled<00:00:34.170> for<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
scene is safe and it was settled for the

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
attacker by the end of the class we

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.710 
attacker by the end of the class we
usually<00:05:11.770> have<00:05:11.949> somewhere<00:05:12.220> between<00:05:12.340> 75<00:05:13.330> and<00:05:13.630> a

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
usually have somewhere between 75 and a

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.570 
usually have somewhere between 75 and a
hundred<00:05:14.229> percent<00:05:14.560> of<00:05:14.620> the<00:05:14.680> room<00:05:14.860> admitting

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
hundred percent of the room admitting

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.409 
hundred percent of the room admitting
the<00:05:15.639> fact<00:05:15.820> they've<00:05:16.030> been<00:05:16.060> criminally

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
the fact they've been criminally

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.629 
the fact they've been criminally
assaulted<00:05:16.840> on<00:05:16.930> the<00:05:16.990> job<00:05:17.370> so<00:05:18.370> it's<00:05:18.520> very

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
assaulted on the job so it's very

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:19.920 
assaulted on the job so it's very
interesting<00:05:18.940> when<00:05:19.210> you<00:05:19.300> start<00:05:19.360> to<00:05:19.600> look<00:05:19.750> at

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
interesting when you start to look at

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.080 
interesting when you start to look at
the<00:05:20.320> numbers<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:20.860> statistics<00:05:20.919> the<00:05:21.820> Bureau<00:05:22.060> of

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
the numbers the statistics the Bureau of

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.090 
the numbers the statistics the Bureau of
Labor<00:05:22.210> Statistics<00:05:22.330> back<00:05:23.050> in<00:05:23.320> 1999<00:05:24.510> said<00:05:25.510> that

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
Labor Statistics back in 1999 said that

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.960 
Labor Statistics back in 1999 said that
you<00:05:27.100> know<00:05:27.190> they<00:05:27.310> gave<00:05:27.430> a<00:05:27.490> whole<00:05:27.729> bunch<00:05:27.880> of

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
you know they gave a whole bunch of

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.700 
you know they gave a whole bunch of
numbers<00:05:28.270> and<00:05:28.690> so<00:05:28.840> there<00:05:28.960> was<00:05:29.080> a<00:05:29.110> white<00:05:29.500> paper

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
numbers and so there was a white paper

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.800 
numbers and so there was a white paper
written<00:05:30.160> on<00:05:30.400> that<00:05:30.430> and<00:05:30.880> that<00:05:31.389> white<00:05:31.599> paper

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810
