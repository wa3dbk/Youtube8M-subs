00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:25.140
 but in the forest if we now lie threshold 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:29.340
 and the hole remains sealed 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:33.830
 so it was decided to finish right away 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.830
 ass cut arch 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:51.830
 arch there are a couple i am from the old wing of the masses 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.860
 I have a key 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.860
 here to score a cutout also stellar here 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:04.640
 places of supply laugh than again 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.030
 trying to keep them store visible 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:13.600
 for now 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:19.720
 where she was bent not here i found 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:23.020
 old mask black bloodlines izuda 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.020
 I cut out 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:36.369
 on a bend that is what is not necessary such 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:44.450
 restoring the inside of the wing 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.830
 because this one is 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:52.369
 I will fall off then I will install 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:58.210
 sell on the bottom part to you then so 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.210
 little by little we 'll get up 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:27.710
 so part of the arch can be cooked and here is how 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:32.500
 weld here if there are no beacons right 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:38.150
 I will change all ours so we took all the same 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:41.720
 part of the mask is clear well, but here we are 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:47.260
 We drove a little thrown by arched 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:50.770
 which system is the new arch 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:57.500
 we said yes where are you with us 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:03:03.050
 books we fit and pour it all 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:10.270
 matter now this place we will pick up 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:17.080
 where we are conveniently made tidy up 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:17.080
 cut out here and fill 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:36.940
 so spoke here we are half 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:50.290
 the inner part of the arch 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:50.290
 to the narrow circle managed to set good and 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:03.110
 a little bit here this is an hour goal on just 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:11.569
 made cuts here this part too 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:15.160
 left speak speak here everyone 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.160
 until we meet again
