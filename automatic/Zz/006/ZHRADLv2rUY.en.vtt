that just comes with the bike and the
other<00:02:27.700> one<00:02:27.940> which<00:02:28.690> is<00:02:28.720> this<00:02:29.020> set<00:02:29.260> that<00:02:29.290> comes

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
other one which is this set that comes

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.610 
other one which is this set that comes
with<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.160> bike<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.790> figure<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:32.410> bikes

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
with the bike and the figure the bikes

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.550 
with the bike and the figure the bikes
are<00:02:32.920> actually<00:02:33.400> not<00:02:33.640> identical<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.320> one

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
are actually not identical and the one

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.560 
are actually not identical and the one
that<00:02:35.739> comes<00:02:35.920> by<00:02:36.100> itself<00:02:36.400> actually<00:02:36.730> has<00:02:36.940> extra

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
that comes by itself actually has extra

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.890 
that comes by itself actually has extra
paint<00:02:37.780> apps<00:02:37.959> around<00:02:38.769> the<00:02:39.010> headlights<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:40.510> I

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
paint apps around the headlights so I

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.920 
paint apps around the headlights so I
mean<00:02:41.260> if<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.500> want<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.799> get<00:02:41.980> both<00:02:42.280> versions<00:02:42.930> I

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
mean if you want to get both versions I

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.550 
mean if you want to get both versions I
guess<00:02:44.739> you<00:02:44.920> can<00:02:45.130> spend<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.790> money<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.470> get<00:02:47.470> an

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
guess you can spend the money and get an

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.720 
guess you can spend the money and get an
extra<00:02:47.830> bike<00:02:49.080> but<00:02:50.080> if<00:02:50.320> you<00:02:50.650> already<00:02:51.190> have<00:02:51.430> the

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
extra bike but if you already have the

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.600 
extra bike but if you already have the
Ichigo<00:02:52.299> you<00:02:52.959> can<00:02:53.110> just<00:02:53.500> get<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.890> version<00:02:54.519> of

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
Ichigo you can just get the version of

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.229 
Ichigo you can just get the version of
the<00:02:54.700> bike<00:02:54.880> with<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.350> extra<00:02:56.350> paint<00:02:56.560> apps<00:02:56.739> and

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
because your Kamen Riders cannot be your

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.050 
because your Kamen Riders cannot be your
writers<00:03:06.910> without<00:03:07.390> something<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:08.049> ride<00:03:09.060> so

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060
