conspiracies of who the villain could be
was<00:00:14.040> talking<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.490> dr.<00:00:14.639> Connors<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.949> have<00:00:16.949> three

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
was talking to dr. Connors I have three

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.929 
was talking to dr. Connors I have three
guesses<00:00:19.470> predictions<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.520> who<00:00:20.640> they<00:00:20.760> could<00:00:20.820> be

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
guesses predictions of who they could be

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.460 
guesses predictions of who they could be
the<00:00:21.689> first<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.320> Norman<00:00:22.949> Osborn<00:00:23.420> because<00:00:24.470> he's

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
the first is Norman Osborn because he's

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.730 
the first is Norman Osborn because he's
obviously<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.039> owner<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.609> Oscorp<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.740> he's

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
obviously the owner of Oscorp and he's

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.810 
obviously the owner of Oscorp and he's
supposed<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.010> be<00:00:29.099> very<00:00:29.130> sick<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.150> old<00:00:30.539> and

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
supposed to be very sick and old and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.139 
supposed to be very sick and old and
here<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:32.969> can<00:00:33.120> see<00:00:34.100> he's<00:00:35.100> very<00:00:35.190> fidgety<00:00:35.760> with

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
here we can see he's very fidgety with

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.030 
here we can see he's very fidgety with
that<00:00:36.270> hat<00:00:37.879> he's<00:00:38.879> shaky<00:00:39.390> with<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.829> much<00:00:40.829> good

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
that hat he's shaky with it much good

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.630 
that hat he's shaky with it much good
fell<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.579> person<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.149> sick<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.870> old<00:00:43.640> and

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
fell that the person is sick and old and

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.190 
fell that the person is sick and old and
that<00:00:44.969> leads<00:00:45.270> me<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.420> believe<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:45.809> Norman

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
that leads me to believe it's Norman

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.279 
that leads me to believe it's Norman
Osborn<00:00:46.910> my<00:00:47.910> second<00:00:48.390> guess<00:00:50.690> is<00:00:51.690> as<00:00:51.870> we<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.140> see

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
Osborn my second guess is as we can see

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:00.580 
Osborn my second guess is as we can see
here<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:54.329> thunders<00:00:55.879> and<00:00:56.989> he<00:00:57.989> appears<00:00:59.270> now

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
here the thunders and he appears now

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.930 
here the thunders and he appears now
thing--that<00:01:01.590> suspicious<00:01:02.100> about<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.670> I

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
thing--that suspicious about that I

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.630 
thing--that suspicious about that I
might<00:01:03.750> think<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.110> electro<00:01:04.619> because<00:01:05.430> he

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
might think it's electro because he

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.810 
might think it's electro because he
appears<00:01:06.000> when<00:01:06.180> there's<00:01:06.360> thunder<00:01:07.640> and<00:01:08.640> once

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
appears when there's thunder and once

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.620 
appears when there's thunder and once
again<00:01:09.000> when<00:01:10.310> it<00:01:11.310> thunders<00:01:11.490> again<00:01:11.939> he

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
again when it thunders again he

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.060 
again when it thunders again he
disappears<00:01:13.340> so<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> electro<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.299> don't<00:01:15.540> know

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
disappears so is a electro I don't know

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.350 
disappears so is a electro I don't know
and<00:01:17.070> my<00:01:17.189> third<00:01:17.490> guess<00:01:18.560> wouldn't<00:01:19.560> be<00:01:20.360> right

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
and my third guess wouldn't be right

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.200 
and my third guess wouldn't be right
here<00:01:23.090> now<00:01:24.200> you<00:01:25.200> guys<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.650> see<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:26.060> right<00:01:27.060> my

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
here now you guys can see this right my

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.219 
here now you guys can see this right my
mouse<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.890> there<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.549> bolt<00:01:30.890> now<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.070> all

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
mouse is there is a bolt now this all

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.780 
mouse is there is a bolt now this all
can<00:01:34.229> be<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.470> representation<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.549> Mysterio<00:01:36.270> and

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
can be a representation of Mysterio and

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.050 
can be a representation of Mysterio and
if<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.119> Mysterio<00:01:39.630> Marc<00:01:40.560> Webb<00:01:40.860> already<00:01:41.820> said

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
if it is Mysterio Marc Webb already said

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.649 
if it is Mysterio Marc Webb already said
that<00:01:42.210> he's<00:01:42.360> pretty<00:01:42.990> fond<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.590> Mysterio<00:01:44.329> so<00:01:45.329> it

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that he's pretty fond of Mysterio so it

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.120 
that he's pretty fond of Mysterio so it
could<00:01:45.840> be<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.990> glue<00:01:46.200> cat<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.590> we'll<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:46.829> him<00:01:47.009> in

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
could be a glue cat so we'll have him in

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.179 
could be a glue cat so we'll have him in
