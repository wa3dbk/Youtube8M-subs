00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:27.380
 in rural areas is second to none 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.460
 on the twelfth of June 2011 Wels of regional traffic on the diesel network in 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.900
 Upper Franconia completely restructured 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.860
 the Bavarian railway company on behalf of the Free State of

 Rail passenger transport in Bavaria plans Sky funded and controlled 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.570
 tendered as the traffic between Bamberg Coburg yard and pastures and one 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.970
 Improved timetable concept for the region is being developed 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.270
 it will be the railway company Agilis 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.180
 the bavarian railway company plans to give this project writes in the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.090
 international competition 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.730
 Ateliers has made the best offer both in terms of quality and price 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.530
 Her and the supplement can has the list we have let 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.930
 Tender go 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.330
 in Bavaria won the first e-network Regensburg and then watch 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.820
 Of course that should be more society not just standing on one leg Safer 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.009
 has a broader base 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.200
 and the next call can be read here is Upper Franconia at that time 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.289
 advertised and also submitted the most economical offer 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.390
 have been awarded the contract 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.130
 the focus of the new award of the diesel network Upper Franconia is 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.159
 completely new timetable concept 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.890
 The approximately 4 Kommer 5 million train kilometers per annum provides around a third 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.720
 more trains than before 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.960
 May decide the benefits timetable value be that where 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.160
 still driven every two hours today 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.750
 on our orders Agilis will offer an hourly rate in the future 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.710
 We will also order every hour of the week on an hourly basis that is one 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.510
 really love a clear improvement in the offer 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.100
 In addition, he has optimal connections in the node stations 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.350
 both for long-distance traffic but also for regional traffic we will also become one 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.609
 Connection to Born is getting from bed to mountain directions 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:15.389
 Another plus point for the passengers are the new vehicles 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:17.990
 the BI ideas called for the tender 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.430
 Agilis put 38 new regio-shuttle's in the first diesel railcar 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.000
 even the euro-norm four are happy that also has a very environmentally friendly 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.120
 vehicle 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.710
 then the modern air conditioned vehicles are handicapped accessible 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.340
 and accelerating everything that makes for a modern Eisenmann vehicle 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.429
 just heard 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:37.859
 to a modern transport offer 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.559
 First and foremost also a fast connection to metropolitan areas belongs 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:44.809
 now the metropolitan region of Nuremberg 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:49.379
 starting in December 2011, this is now Franken went to the start 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.799
 Again, a call for tenders of the DGG was ahead of the contract as the 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.419
 Preserved region 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:59.269
 The offer for Upper Franconia of course realized from a single source 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.759
 that is the connection between the diesel net below Ines 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:04.040
 Franken is together 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.679
 brings the complete benefit to the passenger 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:10.659
 We are improving the offer between Nuremberg and the Nuremberg conurbation 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.969
 Erlangen and Fürth 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:16.619
 Direction Würzburg direction Sonneberg and direction Jena 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:20.359
 The connections are then optimally linked to the diesel Metz 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.309
 so that much better connections arise throughout Upper Franconia 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:29.569
 so that the change of operator on June 12, 2011 also goes smoothly 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.209
 are currently undergoing extensive preparations for the routes in 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.079
 upper Franconia 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.849
 Of course, it is going to happen 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.129
 yes to prepare everything Jacmel Marktredwitzer workshop built 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.799
 Enno Park Kleinmichel finished doing it at the moment while staffing 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.109
 hire apprentice Sowieja 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.379
 are still looking for a few train drivers so Sanogo but us 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.579
 We would like to advertise from Amendt the landset shops 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.519
 and of course everything has to be trained and trained 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.370
 and at the moment there is so much to do for us at train stations and 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.379
 Tracks always stay the same 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.029
 because neither the goods Scheer railway company nor earnings are 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:10.949
 Responsible here is changing through the exhibition project at all 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:11.550
 Not 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.520
 but for Gleision for stations in federal companies are responsible that 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.340
 not even the Free State of Bavaria but that takes deep into the federal and Danny 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.220
 the PI network and DB station and service here will not change unfortunately 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.850
 "We all hope that the expansion will be finished on time 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.639
 but the then pulls responsibility for the infrastructure remains with the federal government 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.790
 in local passenger transport in Upper Franconia, an innovation boost is imminent 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.550
 which did not come first among the exhibits of the Museum in Neuenmarkt 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.300
 Wirsberg becomes clear 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.150
 the expectations are accordingly high 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.400
 we hope for a significantly improved offer 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.479
 but that is indeed a prime example of rural development 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.370
 Space with the local rail passenger transport represents that we together with the of 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.669
 us planned excellent offer on the one hand and optimal performance 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.710
 of the transport company 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.400
 that customers should be oriented and high quality that we offer here 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.600
 Really also achieve massive passenger growth "and therefore seen those 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.969
 high customer satisfaction in the Upper Franconia region is achieved 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.560
 best conditions so 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.300
 Thus, the flagship project Dieselnetz Upper Franconia a fast and before 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.210
 can lay all successful start
