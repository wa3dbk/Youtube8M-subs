 often a person cannot determine what 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.390
 his pet is sick 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.610
 and the more to make the correct diagnosis 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.980
 unfortunately animals cannot tell 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.199
 that we are concerned about them but our experts 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.949
 know how to help them today to us on 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.109
 reception brought the cat to him seven years old he 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.900
 I entered the reception such symptoms in 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.840
 He declined recently appetite 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.029
 the table began to consume more water 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.850
 periodically there were works last

 week celebrate frequent urination 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.809
 awards mixed with blood to 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.210
 make a diagnosis card and assign 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.160
 adequate treatment for a start we will take 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.920
 his blood count for biochemical 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.610
 urine analysis studies and will conduct him 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.289

 follow the most common 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.559
 weak veterinary laboratories is 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.140
 complete blood count which allows 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.320
 define the function and operation of the internal 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.850
 organ and general condition of the animal 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.790
 most diseases except also 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.110
 the dynamics of the inflammatory process 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.659
 effectiveness of children

 method using camera garyaeva 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.880
 thanks to which the total is calculated 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.110
 red blood cell and leukocyte count 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.030
 biochemical analysis of blood reflect 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.900
 functional

 work in the pancake organ system of animals 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.040
 urinalysis makes it possible to evaluate 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.650
 renal function and other organs 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.680
 also inflammatory process 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.259
 urinary tract and so analysis taken 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.460
 and follow the results for 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.369
 last 40 years 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.740
 ultrasound let's one 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.990
 of the most popular diagnostic methods 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.049
 due to its informative speed 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.430
 run opportunity multiple 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.000
 conducting research for one 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.560
 patient and safe from 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.070
 research has become one of the leading 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.780
 diagnostic method using ultrasound we can 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.200
 evaluate the structure of such abdominal organs 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.970
 cavities like bladder and kidneys 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.789
 prostate and uterus liver 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.890
 spleen ultrasound 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.500
 gives us the opportunity to understand how the body 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.790
 looks to carry out separately and 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.430
 either one or the other study 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.769
 it is impossible they should always from the complex 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.390
 to get correct results when 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.910
 conducting ultrasound 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.730
 animals he needs to prepare 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.799
 preparation includes eight o'clock 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.350
 starvation diet exception from the diet 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.440
 feed which results in elevated 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.510
 gas formation in the intestines 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.579
 cat tests are ready for the results 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.340
 tests we can already put him 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.829
 cat diagnosis inflammation in radial 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.440
 bladder kidney and urolithiasis 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.720
 after the survey 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.300
 what treatment can be prescribed 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.050
 will turn on the receiver itself realize 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.170
 about inflammatory drugs and prescription 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.170
 dietary feed 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.510
 if you notice that your pet has 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.200
 health deteriorated 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.310
 contact immediately 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.260
 veterinarian 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.950
 after all, to treat the disease early 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.950
 much easier
