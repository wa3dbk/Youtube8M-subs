00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.110 
I'm going for that big ball in the
middle<00:03:57.720> he<00:03:58.409> has<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.530> gimpy<00:03:58.980> leg<00:03:59.190> which<00:03:59.579> first<00:03:59.970> I

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
middle he has a gimpy leg which first I

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.430 
middle he has a gimpy leg which first I
thought<00:04:00.269> possibly<00:04:00.750> was<00:04:00.870> just<00:04:00.989> an<00:04:01.079> injury<00:04:01.379> at

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
thought possibly was just an injury at

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.190 
thought possibly was just an injury at
birth<00:04:01.680> maybe<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.099> crushed<00:04:02.930> ham<00:04:03.930> hock<00:04:04.170> but

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
birth maybe a crushed ham hock but

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.780 
birth maybe a crushed ham hock but
actually<00:04:04.769> we<00:04:04.920> found<00:04:05.340> out<00:04:05.519> later<00:04:05.640> that

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
actually that leg is about six inches

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.490 
actually that leg is about six inches
shorter<00:04:08.540> retarded<00:04:09.540> those<00:04:09.659> toes<00:04:10.019> into<00:04:10.379> that

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
shorter retarded those toes into that

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.440 
shorter retarded those toes into that
curled<00:04:10.769> back<00:04:10.920> position<00:04:11.400> he<00:04:11.549> actually<00:04:11.939> walks

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
curled back position he actually walks

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.380

halfway<00:04:13.049> on<00:04:13.230> that<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:13.799> developed<00:04:14.220> even

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
halfway on that and developed even

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.330 
halfway on that and developed even
different<00:04:15.390> muscles<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:16.560> account<00:04:16.889> for<00:04:16.979> that<00:04:17.190> as

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
different muscles to account for that as

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.800 
different muscles to account for that as
we<00:04:17.519> skinned<00:04:17.820> him<00:04:17.940> down<00:04:18.090> pretty<00:04:18.329> interesting
