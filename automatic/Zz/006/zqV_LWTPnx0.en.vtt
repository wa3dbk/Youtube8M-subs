00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
called point of no return on the size

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.100 
called point of no return on the size
where<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.060> won't<00:02:00.149> go<00:02:00.450> back<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.780> normal

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
where it won't go back to normal

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.170 
where it won't go back to normal
I've<00:02:01.619> read<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> lot<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.430> different<00:02:02.520> things<00:02:02.969> I've

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
I've read a lot of different things I've

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.459 
I've read a lot of different things I've
already<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.479> was<00:02:03.540> zero<00:02:03.810> I've<00:02:04.079> read<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.350> was

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
already it was zero I've read it was

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.980 
already it was zero I've read it was
double<00:02:04.799> zero<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.280> I've<00:02:05.630> heard<00:02:06.630> people<00:02:06.810> say

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
double zero and I've heard people say

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.719 
double zero and I've heard people say
that<00:02:07.229> they<00:02:07.320> went<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.560> an<00:02:07.740> inch<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.550> they

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
that they went to an inch and that they

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.130 
that they went to an inch and that they
were<00:02:08.789> able<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.179> go<00:02:09.300> back<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> regular

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
were able to go back to like a regular

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.230 
were able to go back to like a regular
person<00:02:10.470> his<00:02:10.709> eyes<00:02:10.830> but<00:02:11.520> then<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.760> know<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.910> guy

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
person his eyes but then I know a guy

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.730 
person his eyes but then I know a guy
I<00:02:12.300> went<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.690> an<00:02:12.780> inch-and-a-half<00:02:13.290> or<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.560> think

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
I went to an inch-and-a-half or I think

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.010 
I went to an inch-and-a-half or I think
bigger<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.310> his<00:02:15.000> ears<00:02:15.270> didn't<00:02:15.630> really<00:02:15.870> go

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
bigger and his ears didn't really go

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.450 
bigger and his ears didn't really go
back<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.380> normal<00:02:16.560> they<00:02:16.830> kind<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.070> stayed<00:02:17.310> at

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
back to normal they kind of stayed at

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.070 
back to normal they kind of stayed at
like<00:02:17.610> 3/4<00:02:18.240> or<00:02:18.360> like<00:02:18.510> one<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.750> those<00:02:18.840> type<00:02:19.050> of

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
like 3/4 or like one of those type of

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.650 
like 3/4 or like one of those type of
sizes<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:20.730> mean<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.090> guess<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.540> all<00:02:21.630> just

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
sizes so I mean I guess it all just

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.600 
sizes so I mean I guess it all just
depends<00:02:22.140> on<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.380> person<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:22.890> how<00:02:23.550> you

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
depends on the person and how you

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.800 
depends on the person and how you
stretched<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.330> how<00:02:24.450> long<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.720> were

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
stretched and how long you were

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.660 
stretched and how long you were
stretching<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.590> how<00:02:25.740> big<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.100> went<00:02:26.310> really

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
stretching and how big you went really

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.850 
stretching and how big you went really
but<00:02:26.940> zero<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:27.960> double<00:02:28.110> zeros<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.620> answer

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
but zero and double zeros the answer

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.190 
but zero and double zeros the answer
that<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.040> always<00:02:29.250> seem<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.550> stumble<00:02:29.940> upon

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
that I always seem to stumble upon

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.980 
that I always seem to stumble upon
Austin<00:02:31.200> Midkiff<00:02:31.890> said<00:02:32.490> I<00:02:32.520> am<00:02:32.820> only<00:02:33.090> at<00:02:33.270> 9/16

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
Austin Midkiff said I am only at 9/16

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.930 
Austin Midkiff said I am only at 9/16
but<00:02:34.230> filler<00:02:34.500> would<00:02:34.740> be<00:02:34.920> difficult<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.400> even<00:02:35.820> go

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
but filler would be difficult to even go

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.400 
but filler would be difficult to even go
five-eighths<00:02:36.450> because<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.870> didn't<00:02:37.110> loves<00:02:37.260> do

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
five-eighths because it didn't loves do

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.930 
five-eighths because it didn't loves do
you<00:02:37.470> feel<00:02:37.740> like<00:02:37.830> your<00:02:37.980> lips<00:02:38.160> are<00:02:38.280> too<00:02:38.430> thin<00:02:38.700> to

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
you feel like your lips are too thin to

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.310 
you feel like your lips are too thin to
stretch<00:02:39.210> to<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.450> next<00:02:39.690> size<00:02:39.810> when<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.170> were

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
stretch to the next size when you were

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.120 
stretch to the next size when you were
are<00:02:40.530> stretching

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
are stretching

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.370 
are stretching
yeah<00:02:41.820> when<00:02:42.120> before<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.600> got<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:42.930> an<00:02:43.110> inch<00:02:43.230> and

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
yeah when before I got to it an inch and

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.750 
yeah when before I got to it an inch and
a<00:02:43.410> half<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.680> felt<00:02:43.890> like<00:02:43.980> my<00:02:44.130> lobes<00:02:44.340> are<00:02:44.490> really

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
a half I felt like my lobes are really

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.070 
a half I felt like my lobes are really
thin<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.240> felt<00:02:45.570> like<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.810> was<00:02:45.900> kind<00:02:46.050> of

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
thin and I felt like I was kind of

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.390 
thin and I felt like I was kind of
pushing<00:02:46.380> my<00:02:46.500> luck<00:02:46.710> because<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:47.160> thought<00:02:47.340> that

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
pushing my luck because I thought that

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.870 
pushing my luck because I thought that
they<00:02:47.700> wouldn't<00:02:48.170> stretch<00:02:49.170> but<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.220> mean<00:02:50.490> I

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
they wouldn't stretch but I mean I

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.430 
they wouldn't stretch but I mean I
downsized<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:52.140> lot<00:02:52.350> not<00:02:53.010> really<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.340> lot<00:02:53.550> but<00:02:54.000> I

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
downsized a lot not really a lot but I

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.900 
downsized a lot not really a lot but I
downsized<00:02:55.440> quite<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.740> few<00:02:55.890> times<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.490> jojoba

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
downsized quite a few times and jojoba
