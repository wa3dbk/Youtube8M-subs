 hello my name is cork work hamadi corporation 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.420
 I am here to present you the new duel bec it pays itself cash his 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.980
 acts which for the first time welcomed the advantage to be exclusively in 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.049
 French 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.550
 so you can avoid for super 8 on the net is not worse 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.859
 for you as for me -30- I ask the usa 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:26.579
 she will obviously be as usual 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.639
 small% small cars allow to 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:32.770
 two rows of reading again that I concede the master 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.480
 under housing guard the work done by what we will see qatar 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:35.980
 yahia 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.950
 for men the most beautiful thing 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.920
 so good as usual we start to get used to the duel is for 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.920
 cent so there were different papers 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.430
 at each household a chief the chief denouncing a species 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.289
 very ominous that were worth 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.000
 who is going a lot and who could usefully distribute them like that 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.750
 at a lower price in this kind of match in the match 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.760
 and more in France with the illustration 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.510
 exclusive my very nice faith so we will open without further delay the 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.470
 first pack f so the debate contains some and that seems 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.680
 interesting especially 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.680
 abolition that will allow 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.010
 for the trulli ranking even to be able to destroy then de facto 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.030
 housing targeted percent crusade that's not bad it breaks me the heart of 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.380
 Turkish is out so 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.710
 in may 2011 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.880
 for the moment a real pleasure to see a map that has since 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.880
 since alfa-beta 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.950
 so the white hassle I'm gaining more and more to a vehicle a way 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.850
 exclusive found 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.120
 from above sounded the oman sea which we gave a good little hero is 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.950
 ephemeral that allows to put creature chips 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.460
 by laundering on August 20 the conflicts are there 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.170
 as a driver can also be a puzzle 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.800
 % and trips to nothingness 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.710
 % to a tad are very nice and for gold the best antidote 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.549
 power one of the best apprentices put of magic that was 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.200
 we made two copies of this return to the country 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.270
 with an exclusive illustration for 100 euros of fallout in a time already 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.890
 yes we can see 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.990
 five bishops these three cards there the poppy the blow one can have that another 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.520
 thing 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.900
 for open normand the force back home for those who have 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.309
 no culture 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:13.719
 the afp reporter 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.989
 but me who really thought certainly excellence misses 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.180
 even if they have a blank we still have a lot of things to manage the 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.710
 beasts 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.319
 we went leaving friendly game 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.839
 put the catapults so again on the theme 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:27.569
 soldiers still sent a few words 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.629
 by pacquiao three deaths is again something that has boosted the 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:31.729
 white fractures 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:33.009
 e then 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:35.829
 that's good also calabash and% 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.049
 % one of the first cards he had been released in series fillon to make 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.449
 an extension will be released 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:43.779
 in a month at the time I'm doing this video 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:48.010
 percent a small in a small station limit in one-two of steals for 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.600
 3 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.680
 when she arrives today from points of cause to melt our team has a 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.639
 good note we see that you like a lot of things to handle fractures 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.669
 and we looked quickly so that's nothing 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:01.549
 the little younes the little brother of one of the savannahs and who we can guarantee 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.879
 one of the clowns and acts 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.799
 the fair very interesting to play since and in europe and who holds 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.659
 really the shot ettori who live very good idea of ​​what we saw in 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:11.090
 the water 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.169
 a lot of Beninese is since 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.319
 for a long time so here we are before we can not wait 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:20.710
 we were once again 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.059
 new illustration does not feel priority 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:30.169
 so we go to the are not clear his way as I wanted as I you 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:33.559
 said a few moments ago to 10% for the viewer we put aside 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.089
 but it is obviously in this jungle to regain a foothold they could re 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:39.239
 Rajoelina 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.499
 monster that's interesting is that there are cards is 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:45.869
 obviously the spectrum of implants being% 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:48.549
 a ripple effect the particular factors allowed in 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.189
 the arena will exceed its theme obviously we wanted to understand the 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.029
 tart tatin contrary in the niro bowl in the world occurs throughout 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:57.140
 this novel today many in a few weeks 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.840
 % back with the 125 concept 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.249
 the moment also to make 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:04.249
 his stock to be ashamed surrender of a land this blue factor 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:06.929
 he liked the choices very interesting 

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:08.380
 a new 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.949
 it's the first time she's been shot in a pack 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.440
 the machined will be the trait to a very good ground 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.589
 who played with whom I once again he is quoted 

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:19.669
 who may have died so had samazan such talent his ratio core 40 fax 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.620
 aviation and thinking that allows picking and el-kaoutari depositors 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.750
 factory km 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.990
 play the same trick as his suspension against the artifacts 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.449
 % and not demagogic out of control thirst for knowledge of 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.960
 here again a very good card to play in 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.600
 the competitive player in the teeth and old formats that in effect 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.680
 a little bit son of many benefits that the return of the usa 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.460
 have ratified 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.240
 source of knowledge 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.759
 with them an illustration for the right to vote 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:49.939
 so weak that it takes value on contact 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:54.119
 small chickens because of artifacts and p then there it is super interesting 

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:58.199
 so that's the cost of contagion again so the second card does not have 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.749
 been still that is not out yet 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:02.749
 so it will be a sitting to stay in l1 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.120
 the very nice so the scrub during a conference bertossa when they 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.370
 will arrive i put you to the end in a month on creating a 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.689
 residence or in india the young creatures 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:12.780
 it is % 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.130
 but I can you can do that stayed there frozen for four days 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.480
 older they will proliferate 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.550
 it's an honor for me this stuff 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.690
 for 100 th so his marks in parentheses announced his intentions of 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.260
 permanent and for the player with markers on them 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.439
 I want to give everyone another marcum a kind already present 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:31.949
 It's really very far from it going very well itself since 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:34.870
 the marker in a role that put him on the creatures that we redoubled 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.870
 and suddenly for four chefs by committing 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.949
 it's going to be laferois remedy 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.300
 it can obviously for 100 euros I hope you will have understood by 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.970
 added 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.849
 markers after 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:45.849
 the surveyors 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:49.789
 obviously more boosted pointed out% and 6% at the player level 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.080
 you can to mount this poison marker 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.080
 % and 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:56.809
 in those cases 

00:05:56.809 --> 00:06:00.909
 for the vernissage by shortly antonius triskell lacie coat retain so much 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:03.849
 sharp will have creatures this factor is pretty friendly you 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:04.780
 let him discover 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:05.870
 good player 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.150
 either the game against the other night like that it can be games that are 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:13.559
 those who are quite viable we will inevitably tournament but in any case 

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:16.659
 improve his party nice world be improved either to recover the 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:17.710
 lands that interest you 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.400
 we tell you just now ukraine still played in the 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.379
 dender I could fictitious 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:26.129
 updated chronicler also for zep tories 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:30.159
 play in particular dh put feet forward and more at these times to do 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:33.779
 his stack a disc he is boosted this is a very very good card since 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:37.210
 shop and a sweetness the fact it is boosted by the artifacts 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.689
 if I sincerely deserve that the environment 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:42.389
 foaming anyway 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:45.659
 it's already a very good map that often combines with de facto ships 

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:46.379
 already 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:47.500
 already present 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.030
 for 100 th here we find rihanna sawn 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.460
 this is a little thing huot in May 2011 by the way mehdi ben attia in 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.119
 repeating puts aside because 

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:59.489
 because obviously this will be the new theme in this framework pointed out 

00:06:59.489 --> 00:07:02.560
 finally they come out like that for cheap 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.059
 so this is really the opportunity to 

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:07.749
 to actually prepare his friends star in your world sees well that these 

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:10.680
 two i know easter are quite viable 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.699
 for 100 th it takes up well-known themes 

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:17.940
 in competition is the minimum that the white band 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.030
 full of small white berries after rising crises for mosques and 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.639
 that the player the factor 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:27.020
 with notably the file hosts had laid down its technique and the modularity that 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.379
 by the constraints factors 

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:29.830
 booster hortefeux 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.030
 so I want to look forward to testing these games against 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:34.520
 the other 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.870
 and then most of all that allow you to recover 

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.310
 big cards as you like to spawn his gaming opinion that 

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.870
 who are once doing and for those who in addition allows you to recover from 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:44.689
 good cards 

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:47.100
 % april low and in France 

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.310
 so do not hesitate 

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.059
 luc but wait darker 

00:07:50.059 --> 00:07:53.809
 before the pam can not be found thank you for having followed us again 

00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:54.370
 time 

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.770
 % thank you all and have assisted 

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.310
 for the first time and I'm not telling you the next outing
