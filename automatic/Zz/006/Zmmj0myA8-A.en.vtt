00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.369 

I<00:00:03.950> had<00:00:04.950> picked<00:00:05.220> out<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:06.060> surface<00:00:07.020> for<00:00:07.290> the

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
I had picked out a a surface for the

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.860 
I had picked out a a surface for the
pool<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.010> gray<00:00:08.670> color<00:00:08.970> but<00:00:09.510> it<00:00:09.570> was<00:00:09.690> not

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
pool of the gray color but it was not

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.839 
pool of the gray color but it was not
awkward<00:00:10.290> but<00:00:10.740> then<00:00:10.980> they<00:00:11.130> came<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.490> me<00:00:11.639> a

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
awkward but then they came to me a

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.209 
awkward but then they came to me a
little<00:00:12.750> before<00:00:12.990> installation<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.009> said<00:00:14.130> they

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
little before installation and said they

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.950 
little before installation and said they
had<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> new<00:00:14.549> surface<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.389> warranty<00:00:15.809> was

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
had a new surface that the warranty was

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.529 
had a new surface that the warranty was
better<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.500> surface<00:00:16.890> lasts<00:00:17.640> longer<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.510> I

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
better the surface lasts longer so I

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.230 
better the surface lasts longer so I
went<00:00:18.810> with<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.960> Blue<00:00:19.260> Lagoon<00:00:19.439> color<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.220> like<00:00:21.029> it

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
went with a Blue Lagoon color I like it

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.390 
went with a Blue Lagoon color I like it
the<00:00:21.720> surface<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.289> feel<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.680> very<00:00:22.830> nice<00:00:23.100> it's

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
the surface the feel is very nice it's

the surface the feel is very nice it's
smooth<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:24.150> usually<00:00:24.869> use<00:00:25.019> an<00:00:25.199> algaecide<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
smooth I usually use an algaecide in the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.490 
smooth I usually use an algaecide in the
pool<00:00:26.609> probably<00:00:27.150> once<00:00:27.330> every<00:00:27.599> two<00:00:28.019> weeks<00:00:28.050> I

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
pool probably once every two weeks I

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.300 
pool probably once every two weeks I
haven't<00:00:28.650> used<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.039> yet

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
haven't used it yet

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.849 
haven't used it yet
since<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.269> pool<00:00:30.480> has<00:00:30.570> been<00:00:30.720> done<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
since the pool has been done the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.040 
since the pool has been done the
yellowing<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:33.180> might<00:00:33.360> get<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> little<00:00:33.809> in

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
yellowing and you might get a little in

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.440 
yellowing and you might get a little in
April<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.040> like<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.489> know<00:00:35.520> 80%<00:00:35.880> less

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
April but this is like you know 80% less

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.540 
April but this is like you know 80% less
than<00:00:36.690> what<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.840> would<00:00:37.050> normally<00:00:37.200> see<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
than what I would normally see the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.139 
than what I would normally see the
finish<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> pool<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.629> quite<00:00:40.559> unique

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
finish on the pool is quite unique

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.549 
finish on the pool is quite unique
originally<00:00:42.149> we<00:00:42.329> had<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.510> plastered<00:00:43.050> pool<00:00:43.320> a

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
originally we had a plastered pool a

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.799 
originally we had a plastered pool a
grey<00:00:44.100> plastered<00:00:44.640> finish<00:00:44.969> which<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:45.390> had<00:00:45.510> seen

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
grey plastered finish which we had seen

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.950 
grey plastered finish which we had seen
and<00:00:46.079> we<00:00:46.170> loved<00:00:46.440> because<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.969> lake<00:00:48.570> effect

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and we loved because of the lake effect

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.200 
and we loved because of the lake effect
that<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.260> gave<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.770> wasn't<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> classic<00:00:50.969> blue

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
that it gave it wasn't the classic blue

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.810 
that it gave it wasn't the classic blue
color<00:00:51.539> as<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.559> got<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.739> little<00:00:52.829> older<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
color as it got a little older the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.990 
color as it got a little older the
surface<00:00:54.329> changed<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.989> bit<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.579> Joe<00:00:56.579> told<00:00:56.820> me

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
surface changed a bit and Joe told me

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.970 
surface changed a bit and Joe told me
that<00:00:57.120> there<00:00:57.510> was<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.690> possibility<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.530> using<00:00:58.680> us

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
that there was a possibility of using us

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.889 
that there was a possibility of using us
a<00:00:59.219> new<00:00:59.699> technique<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.329> they<00:01:00.449> were<00:01:00.510> doing

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
a new technique that they were doing

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.250 
a new technique that they were doing
that<00:01:01.530> was<00:01:01.739> fired<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.699> with<00:01:03.600> that's<00:01:04.170> I

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
that was fired on and with that's I

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.590 
that was fired on and with that's I
think<00:01:04.439> it's<00:01:04.530> an<00:01:04.619> acrylic<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.250> some<00:01:05.460> kind<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.030> I

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
think it's an acrylic of some kind and I

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.330 
think it's an acrylic of some kind and I
saw<00:01:06.900> some<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.380> samples<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.159> very

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
saw some of the samples and I was very

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.580 
saw some of the samples and I was very
much<00:01:08.549> interested<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:10.170> can't<00:01:10.439> say

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
much interested in it and I can't say

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.859 
much interested in it and I can't say
enough<00:01:10.799> about<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.130> finish<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:12.270> it's

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
enough about that finish it's it's

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.230 
enough about that finish it's it's
really<00:01:13.229> awesome<00:01:13.710> because<00:01:14.580> they<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.909> feel

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
really awesome because they like to feel

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.330 
really awesome because they like to feel
the<00:01:15.900> sensation<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.740> gives<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> feet

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the sensation that it gives on the feet

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.359 
the sensation that it gives on the feet
it's<00:01:17.880> very<00:01:18.330> smooth<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:19.409> as<00:01:19.680> smooth<00:01:20.040> as<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
it's very smooth it's as smooth as the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.149 
it's very smooth it's as smooth as the
plastered<00:01:21.000> finish<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.900> unique<00:01:22.320> it's
