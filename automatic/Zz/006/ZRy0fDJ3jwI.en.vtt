00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:18.530
 speaks the computer class that the 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.380
 Our video lesson today will be about 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:27.349
 how to change and how to access 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.609
 notebook memories positive model z 6 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.369
 4 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:34.160
 So let's go to class procedure. 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:40.100
 Let's close a notebook here. 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:43.190
 let's turn to have access and we in 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:48.079
 first and remove the static from the 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:53.590
 body to draw stadium through the body 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:56.480
 just stick to some project is 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.239
 grounded for 10 seconds is already great 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.850
 for us to take the ground 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.760
 So we have to get the first one 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.000
 place remove the battery 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.760
 in this case we should have a 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.880
 A lever in which we push back. 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.610
 right now we should pull now to the 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.350
 left side of varzim and now we can 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.350
 remove it up 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:29.090
 we removed the notebook battery and 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.050
 now for us to have access to 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.450
 memoirs 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.770
 we have to unscrew these 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.530
 bolts here so let's start the 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.410
 shoot using that first one by remembering 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.210
 which has to be a suitable key to 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.910
 the screws so you can not 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.490
 here so you do not damage them, right? 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:02:01.340
 then they would go over to repair it 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:02:03.950
 fusad so lets remove here 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.079
 we take off all the screw we can 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.379
 open here with the fingernail 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:13.280
 The cover will leave the camera alone. 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:17.540
 then this lid will be removed and chanan 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.560
 here we have access to everything here half 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.060
 motherboard 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:26.330
 we have here on the board mih pc and mac 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.080
 mini pci express from board to board 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.170
 network 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.480
 we have both banks here and live in 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.590
 my case that only one 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.950
 memory is not 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.220
 that the ddr2 memory of 512 has another 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.569
 correct bank of memories 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.950
 the processor chipset the heatsink 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.250
 arugula 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.890
 here to open enjoy with a 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.790
 brush even very carefully you 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.660
 remove all your soul with dust that has 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.030
 in the whole notebook here on aquino in 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.790
 sink and do not eat even 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.370
 processor cooling 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.880
 always avoiding future 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.019
 problems with the overheating of your 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.930
 notebook 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.579
 that's it, let's just get the 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.329
 memory to show you how it is 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:23.420
 that you pull off your head here and have 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:26.900
 one another for me here then with one hand 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.920
 Here we pull my back and this 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.349
 there 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.970
 these locks so let's remove the 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:37.459
 memory to show you 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:41.150
 that's it we solve the memory 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:45.950
 we will be careful we are here 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.290
 with memory ddr2 ram of 512 mb 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.329
 so lets put here defeat with 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.519
 very careful 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:58.459
 fitting perfectly until all give 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:02.239
 all the contacts click into place and now that 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.280
 fit to find what slot we 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:08.959
 push down and it will make some 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:11.989
 klec stating that he signed the memory is 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.420
 This is what memory said then this is the 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.150
 end of our video lesson today let's 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.100
 drop 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.989
 the procedure to close the 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.440
 nÃ© notebook 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:28.830
 let's close it let's screw 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:31.259
 again we will put the battery of 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:36.630
 the same procedure returns 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:39.919
 we will put so fit 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:44.340
 now we must push her there she goes 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:47.430
 in dogs that straight through it 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.400
 the other way, that's it, let's turn 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:53.300
 he now here we are connecting to 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.300
 classic everything right 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:08.160
 Let's go from here on the notebook. 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:10.380
 Let's see if everything is ok, that's it. 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.470
 Okay, let's wait, it's just 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.979
 Here the system was to confirm 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.979
 all ok 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:28.770
 This is it, you just entered the system 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.110
 starts from here windows and services 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.630
 have enjoyed this class and do not forget 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.310
 to let your licks appraisal 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.510
 this helps a lot in the 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.860
 dissemination of our videos and also 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:44.010
 so that more people can come 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.169
 know our work does not stop 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.690
 follow our other videos on 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.750
 notebook with maintenance swap 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:54.479
 memory, and any 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.820
 any doubt you can comment here on 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:59.720
