00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.389 
and we're going to play as you can see
here<00:01:10.180> there<00:01:10.360> are<00:01:10.390> three<00:01:10.530> level<00:01:11.530> packs<00:01:12.130> right

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
here there are three level packs right

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.620 
here there are three level packs right
here<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:14.350> each<00:01:14.500> pack<00:01:14.800> I<00:01:14.979> think<00:01:15.160> there<00:01:15.280> are<00:01:15.630> 63

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
here in each pack I think there are 63

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.580 
here in each pack I think there are 63
levels<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:19.119> that's<00:01:19.300> like<00:01:19.360> a<00:01:19.420> total<00:01:19.750> of<00:01:19.869> 189

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
levels so that's like a total of 189

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.990 
levels so that's like a total of 189
like<00:01:20.950> I<00:01:21.039> said<00:01:21.280> if<00:01:22.030> I<00:01:22.149> didn't<00:01:22.390> say<00:01:22.539> whatever

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
like I said if I didn't say whatever

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.650 
like I said if I didn't say whatever

first<00:01:32.200> level<00:01:32.560> it's<00:01:33.250> really<00:01:33.549> easy<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:35.530> course

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
first level it's really easy of course

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.890 
first level it's really easy of course
it<00:01:35.920> is<00:01:36.040> because<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.430> first<00:01:36.640> level<00:01:36.970> but<00:01:37.000> um<00:01:37.420> you

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
it is because the first level but um you

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.289

know

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.620 

and<00:01:44.780> skip<00:01:45.110> by<00:01:45.260> just<00:01:45.440> tapping<00:01:45.560> homescreen<00:01:46.630> okay

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
played that you want to knock down this

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.770 
played that you want to knock down this
and<00:01:52.520> kill<00:01:52.760> the<00:01:52.940> thing<00:01:53.119> inside<00:01:53.300> I<00:01:53.510> don't<00:01:53.630> know

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
and kill the thing inside I don't know

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.609 
and kill the thing inside I don't know
what<00:01:53.900> it<00:01:53.990> is

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
what it is

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.520 
what it is
pig<00:01:55.159> bird<00:01:55.520> thing<00:01:55.820> on<00:01:55.990> stage<00:01:56.990> I<00:01:57.110> want<00:01:57.320> to<00:01:57.380> grab

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
pig bird thing on stage I want to grab

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.170 
pig bird thing on stage I want to grab
just<00:01:57.740> want<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.040> touch<00:01:58.130> that<00:01:58.190> um<00:01:58.580> little<00:01:59.000> bird

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
just want to touch that um little bird

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.649 
just want to touch that um little bird
pull<00:01:59.479> back<00:01:59.690> and<00:02:00.500> let<00:02:00.680> it<00:02:00.740> go<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:02.200> it<00:02:03.200> knocks<00:02:04.040> it

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
pull back and let it go and it knocks it

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.809 
pull back and let it go and it knocks it
apart<00:02:07.959> for<00:02:08.959> every<00:02:09.170> bird<00:02:09.350> that<00:02:09.530> you<00:02:09.679> don't<00:02:10.580> use

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
apart for every bird that you don't use

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.680 
apart for every bird that you don't use
you<00:02:11.000> get<00:02:11.090> 10,000<00:02:11.630> extra<00:02:11.840> points<00:02:13.630> next<00:02:14.630> level

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
you get 10,000 extra points next level

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.790 
you get 10,000 extra points next level
so<00:02:17.690> it's<00:02:17.840> probably<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.110> good<00:02:18.170> example<00:02:18.320> of<00:02:18.709> that

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
so it's probably a good example of that

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.770 
so it's probably a good example of that
I'll<00:02:19.700> use<00:02:19.880> all<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.150> birds<00:02:20.330> for<00:02:20.480> this<00:02:20.630> one

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
I'll use all the birds for this one

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.130 
I'll use all the birds for this one
because<00:02:21.019> I<00:02:21.140> suck<00:02:25.030> if<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.090> can<00:02:26.269> see<00:02:26.420> this<00:02:26.600> this

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
because I suck if you can see this this

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.880 
because I suck if you can see this this
white<00:02:27.350> dotted<00:02:28.250> line<00:02:28.519> right<00:02:28.700> here<00:02:28.880> that<00:02:29.410> is<00:02:30.410> the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
white dotted line right here that is the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.560 
white dotted line right here that is the
direction<00:02:31.220> that<00:02:31.459> your<00:02:31.670> last<00:02:31.820> bird<00:02:32.120> traveled

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
direction that your last bird traveled

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.170 
direction that your last bird traveled
or<00:02:32.900> hiked<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.260> trajectory<00:02:33.800> so<00:02:34.730> you<00:02:34.820> can<00:02:35.000> match

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
or hiked the trajectory so you can match

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.570 
or hiked the trajectory so you can match
it<00:02:35.209> if<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:35.600> bring<00:02:35.810> this<00:02:36.140> bird<00:02:36.470> onto<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.340> line

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
it if you bring this bird onto that line

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.880 
it if you bring this bird onto that line
and<00:02:37.880> let<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.300> go<00:02:38.420> but<00:02:39.350> I<00:02:39.380> wanted<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.739> go<00:02:39.860> a

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
and let it go but I wanted to go a

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.830 
and let it go but I wanted to go a
little<00:02:40.220> bit<00:02:40.489> lower<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:40.910> I'll<00:02:41.360> just<00:02:41.480> bring<00:02:41.690> it

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
little bit lower so I'll just bring it

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.340 
little bit lower so I'll just bring it
up<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:42.050> little<00:02:42.140> bit

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.030 

shoot<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:48.440> from<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.650> same<00:02:49.190> position<00:02:49.640> almost

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
shoot it from the same position almost

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.750 
shoot it from the same position almost
and<00:02:52.040> there<00:02:52.519> it<00:02:52.610> goes

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
and there it goes

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.110 
and there it goes
okay<00:02:53.950> so<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.010> think<00:02:55.160> these<00:02:55.220> two<00:02:55.459> birds<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:55.940> get

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
okay so I think these two birds I get

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.870 
okay so I think these two birds I get
20,000<00:02:56.989> points<00:02:58.810> alright<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.860> then<00:03:01.610> you<00:03:01.640> write

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
20,000 points alright and then you write

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.530 
20,000 points alright and then you write
the<00:03:01.940> menu<00:03:02.180> those<00:03:02.989> are<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.200> first<00:03:03.350> two<00:03:03.470> levels

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
the menu those are the first two levels
