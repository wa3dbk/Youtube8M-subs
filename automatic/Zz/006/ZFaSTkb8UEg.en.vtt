finding it - style and things like that

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.620 
finding it - style and things like that
especially<00:01:09.840> cuz<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.049> was<00:01:10.140> freeing<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:11.189> was<00:01:11.630> and

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
especially cuz it was freeing it was and

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:27.920 
especially cuz it was freeing it was and
then<00:01:12.810> my<00:01:13.080> hair<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.500> really<00:01:13.830> thick<00:01:26.600> 48<00:01:27.600> hours

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
then my hair is really thick 48 hours

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.600 
then my hair is really thick 48 hours
though<00:01:28.200> probably<00:01:28.799> she<00:01:29.040> was<00:01:29.250> like<00:01:29.369> dry<00:01:29.579> shampoo

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
though probably she was like dry shampoo

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.940 
though probably she was like dry shampoo
or<00:01:30.090> something<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.450> just<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:30.869> mess<00:01:31.829> it

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
or something like just to like mess it

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.030 
or something like just to like mess it
up<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.159> little<00:01:32.250> bit<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.700> not<00:01:33.540> look<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.049> much

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
up a little bit and not look so much

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.550 
up a little bit and not look so much
like<00:01:35.310> smooth<00:01:35.880> -<00:01:36.030> haven't<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.420> washed<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.500> she

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
like smooth - haven't I washed so she

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.810 
like smooth - haven't I washed so she
can<00:01:37.770> leave<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.040> for<00:01:38.100> at<00:01:38.189> least<00:01:38.220> 40<00:01:38.579> hours

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
can leave it for at least 40 hours

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.069 
can leave it for at least 40 hours
obviously<00:01:38.939> leave<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.390> as<00:01:39.540> long<00:01:39.689> as<00:01:39.810> she<00:01:39.960> can

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
obviously leave it as long as she can

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.690 
obviously leave it as long as she can
possibly<00:01:40.140> leave<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.920> without<00:01:41.009> washing<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.520> and

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
possibly leave it without washing it and

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.319 
possibly leave it without washing it and
she'll<00:01:42.299> probably<00:01:42.479> get<00:01:43.110> better<00:01:43.619> results<00:01:44.100> and

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
she'll probably get better results and

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.020 
she'll probably get better results and
we'll<00:01:45.329> do<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.930> follow-up<00:01:46.500> video<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:47.100> how<00:01:47.729> she's

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
we'll do a follow-up video on how she's

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.109 
we'll do a follow-up video on how she's
finding<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.049> how<00:01:49.619> she's<00:01:49.860> going<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.399> we

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
finding it and how she's going it we

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.999 
finding it and how she's going it we
might<00:01:51.299> do<00:01:51.540> something<00:01:51.720> on<00:01:52.049> how<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.770> could<00:01:52.860> make

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
might do something on how you could make

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.870 
might do something on how you could make
your<00:01:53.610> own<00:01:53.759> kind<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.299> beachy<00:01:55.610> wave<00:01:56.610> with

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
and it gives you that same kind of look

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.149 
and it gives you that same kind of look
as<00:02:02.490> when<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.149> come<00:02:03.930> out<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.200> sea<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:05.130> a
