00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.340
 My name is leandro Visotto in 38 years and 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.380
 I'm specialized in gastronomy 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.260
 I'm from a family of 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.149
 Italians it 's correct I like 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.899
 italian food like food 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.230
 italian 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.480
 I grew up always cooking 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.540
 is at the table around the table everybody 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.000
 sitting together and with that I leave 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.850
 ParaÃ­ba specializes in italy but 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.879
 more the Italian cuisine more than aromas 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.809
 a more modern thing focused on the 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.809
 our region here 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.880
 I intend to come back again 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.950
 new things look for new new scents 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.590
 ways to do my main job 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.960
 professional ambition is to put the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.960
 tastes of italy inside my land 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.140
 I like it when I get home that the 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.430
 staff stay they interact with me no 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.100
 You need to stay in the kitchen and hide 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.350
 I would like this kitchen to be a 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.479
 receptive to staff, do not they 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.410
 arrive when the world helps born 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.450
 because that is the one proposing the thing to 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.190
 positions it has to be practical for 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.090
 focus on what you enjoy doing the most 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.090
 because the kitchen 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.900
 from the first conversation that we 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.119
 we had with the adriano we tried 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.100
 translate your inspiration and a project 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.920
 that includes everything that is important 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.720
 for him for example we think of an island 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.770
 with equipment and accessories with the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.110
 practical bench access for ingredients 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.060
 cooktop a drawer we made sure to 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.319
 value this space because it passes 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.900
 a long time there 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.000
 we adopt elegant colors and a finish 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.880
 and natural wood veneer for the 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.430
 environment stay the same warm and 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.430
 modern all with state of the art technology 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.220
