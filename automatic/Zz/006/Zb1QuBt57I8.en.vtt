00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
replacing them so here's your brake

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.040 
replacing them so here's your brake
fluid<00:07:12.669> dot<00:07:13.669> three<00:07:14.090> let's<00:07:14.479> turn<00:07:14.690> it<00:07:14.779> and<00:07:14.900> take

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.050 
fluid dot three let's turn it and take

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.769 
fluid dot three let's turn it and take
it<00:07:15.139> off<00:07:15.550> get<00:07:16.550> a<00:07:16.580> maximum<00:07:17.090> at<00:07:17.210> a<00:07:17.240> minimum<00:07:17.569> level

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:17.779 
it off get a maximum at a minimum level

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:20.230 
it off get a maximum at a minimum level
so<00:07:18.229> these<00:07:18.560> we<00:07:18.830> can<00:07:19.009> use<00:07:19.430> a<00:07:19.460> clean<00:07:19.759> rag<00:07:19.969> or<00:07:20.210> a

so these we can use a clean rag or a

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.129 
so these we can use a clean rag or a
tricky<00:07:20.599> baster

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:21.139 
tricky baster

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:23.140 
tricky baster
some<00:07:21.919> kind<00:07:22.099> of<00:07:22.129> suction<00:07:22.400> device<00:07:22.759> take<00:07:23.000> some
