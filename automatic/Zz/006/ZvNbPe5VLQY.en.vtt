the<00:02:36.250> burner<00:02:36.430> continues<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:37.030> use<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.330> same<00:02:37.540> for

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
the burner continues to use the same for

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.570 
the burner continues to use the same for
engine<00:02:38.140> options<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.680> already<00:02:38.950> had<00:02:39.130> so

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
engine options that you already had so

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.300 
engine options that you already had so
you<00:02:39.670> have<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:40.000> 1.4<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:40.810> do<00:02:41.020> 1.6<00:02:41.740> liter<00:02:41.920> engines

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
you have to 1.4 and do 1.6 liter engines

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.610 
you have to 1.4 and do 1.6 liter engines
now<00:02:42.970> like<00:02:43.450> we<00:02:43.570> proved<00:02:43.840> in<00:02:43.990> our<00:02:44.110> engine<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.470> so

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
now like we proved in our engine and so

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.860 
now like we proved in our engine and so
on<00:02:44.710> these<00:02:45.310> are<00:02:45.670> durable<00:02:45.820> engines<00:02:46.390> but<00:02:46.840> for

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
on these are durable engines but for

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.840 
on these are durable engines but for
this<00:02:47.140> facelift<00:02:47.560> Hyundai<00:02:48.250> claims<00:02:48.580> that<00:02:48.730> they

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
this facelift Hyundai claims that they

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.730 
this facelift Hyundai claims that they
have<00:02:48.970> made<00:02:49.210> use<00:02:49.390> of<00:02:49.510> low<00:02:49.840> friction<00:02:50.020> components

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
have made use of low friction components

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.410 
have made use of low friction components
which<00:02:51.160> has<00:02:51.310> bumped<00:02:51.640> up<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.760> thermal<00:02:52.210> and<00:02:52.390> the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
which has bumped up the thermal and the

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.170 
which has bumped up the thermal and the
fuel<00:02:52.810> efficiency<00:02:53.370> but<00:02:54.370> we<00:02:54.520> will<00:02:54.700> have<00:02:54.850> to<00:02:54.970> put

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
fuel efficiency but we will have to put

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.700 
fuel efficiency but we will have to put
this<00:02:55.330> car<00:02:55.600> through<00:02:55.630> proper<00:02:56.200> row<00:02:56.350> tests<00:02:56.590> to

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
this car through proper row tests to

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.920 
this car through proper row tests to
really<00:02:57.070> make<00:02:57.880> sure<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:58.120> these<00:02:58.390> claims<00:02:58.660> are

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
really make sure that these claims are

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.740 
really make sure that these claims are
valid<00:02:59.700> but<00:03:00.700> as<00:03:00.820> of<00:03:00.970> now<00:03:01.000> Hyundai<00:03:01.390> claims<00:03:01.630> that

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
valid but as of now Hyundai claims that

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.300 
valid but as of now Hyundai claims that
the<00:03:01.900> fuel<00:03:02.110> economy<00:03:02.260> has<00:03:02.650> been<00:03:02.770> bumped<00:03:03.010> up<00:03:03.130> by

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
the fuel economy has been bumped up by

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.130 
the fuel economy has been bumped up by
about<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.730> kilometer<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:04.420> a<00:03:04.540> kilometer<00:03:04.600> and<00:03:05.050> a

isn't<00:03:16.030> as<00:03:16.150> unnerving<00:03:16.720> as<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.140> 2011<00:03:17.680> model<00:03:18.070> but

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
isn't as unnerving as the 2011 model but

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.520 
isn't as unnerving as the 2011 model but
if<00:03:18.850> you<00:03:18.880> have<00:03:19.060> driven<00:03:19.239> last<00:03:19.630> year's<00:03:19.900> car<00:03:20.140> then

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
if you have driven last year's car then

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.140 
if you have driven last year's car then
this<00:03:20.800> year's<00:03:21.040> car<00:03:21.280> is<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.430> small<00:03:21.850> improvement

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
this year's car is a small improvement

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.570 
this year's car is a small improvement
over<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:23.620> wall<00:03:23.800> we<00:03:23.920> feeling<00:03:24.280> has<00:03:24.430> been

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
over the wall we feeling has been

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.670 
over the wall we feeling has been
reduced<00:03:24.910> considerably<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.870> cutting<00:03:26.320> sounds

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
reduced considerably and cutting sounds

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.590 
reduced considerably and cutting sounds
on<00:03:26.770> sharp<00:03:27.070> bumps<00:03:27.400> aren't<00:03:27.730> as<00:03:27.880> audible<00:03:28.450> as

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
on sharp bumps aren't as audible as

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.970 
on sharp bumps aren't as audible as
before<00:03:31.020> that<00:03:32.020> they've<00:03:32.170> made<00:03:32.350> changes<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.770> the

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
before that they've made changes to the

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.340 
before that they've made changes to the
steering<00:03:33.340> setup<00:03:33.489> now<00:03:34.150> this<00:03:34.360> is<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.630> same<00:03:34.810> GPS

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
steering setup now this is the same GPS

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.600 
steering setup now this is the same GPS
unit<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:35.800> you've<00:03:35.950> been<00:03:36.100> getting<00:03:36.400> in<00:03:36.520> the

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
unit that you've been getting in the

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.789 
unit that you've been getting in the
water<00:03:36.790> since<00:03:37.060> 2011<00:03:37.570> but<00:03:38.080> the<00:03:38.260> tuning<00:03:38.680> is

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
water since 2011 but the tuning is

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.250 
water since 2011 but the tuning is
different<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:39.640> is<00:03:39.820> slightly<00:03:40.030> heavier<00:03:40.510> so<00:03:41.170> if

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
different this is slightly heavier so if

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.630 
different this is slightly heavier so if
you<00:03:41.350> like<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.769> one<00:03:41.950> offer<00:03:42.130> it's<00:03:42.370> light

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
you like the one offer it's light

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.640
