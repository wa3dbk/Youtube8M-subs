00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
that we're going to go ahead and lay

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.569 
that we're going to go ahead and lay
some<00:03:52.940> fertilizer<00:03:53.540> down<00:03:53.840> in<00:03:54.319> a<00:03:54.739> furrow<00:03:54.979> and<00:03:55.129> I'm

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
some fertilizer down in a furrow and I'm

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.939 
some fertilizer down in a furrow and I'm
going<00:03:55.819> to<00:03:56.000> plant<00:03:56.389> my<00:03:56.540> okra<00:03:57.019> and<00:03:59.739> you've<00:04:00.739> never

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:00.949 
going to plant my okra and you've never

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:06.479 
going to plant my okra and you've never
seen<00:04:01.220> okra<00:04:01.639> seeds<00:04:03.400> they<00:04:04.400> look<00:04:04.609> like<00:04:04.849> this

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
seen okra seeds they look like this

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.759 
seen okra seeds they look like this
can't<00:04:07.489> you<00:04:07.549> see<00:04:07.669> that<00:04:08.799> these<00:04:09.799> little<00:04:10.069> guys

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
can't you see that these little guys

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.259 
can't you see that these little guys
plant<00:04:12.769> them<00:04:12.859> about<00:04:12.949> in<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.579> little<00:04:13.939> less<00:04:14.060> than

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
plant them about in a little less than

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.420 
plant them about in a little less than
an<00:04:14.329> inch<00:04:14.479> deep<00:04:15.190> three-quarters<00:04:16.190> of<00:04:16.220> an<00:04:16.310> inch

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
an inch deep three-quarters of an inch

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.689 
an inch deep three-quarters of an inch
deep<00:04:16.699> and<00:04:17.769> put<00:04:18.769> them<00:04:18.889> about<00:04:19.099> eighteen<00:04:19.669> inches

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
deep and put them about eighteen inches

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:21.939 
deep and put them about eighteen inches
apart<00:04:20.299> so<00:04:20.959> actually<00:04:21.289> you<00:04:21.380> want<00:04:21.530> to<00:04:21.620> thin<00:04:21.829> them

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
apart so actually you want to thin them

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.170 
apart so actually you want to thin them
to<00:04:22.370> 18<00:04:22.729> inches<00:04:23.000> apart<00:04:24.909> I'll<00:04:25.909> put<00:04:26.120> them

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
to 18 inches apart I'll put them

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.770 
to 18 inches apart I'll put them
probably<00:04:26.690> closer<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:27.080> somewhere<00:04:27.860> around

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
probably closer to somewhere around

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.450 
probably closer to somewhere around
probably<00:04:29.780> spaced<00:04:30.440> them<00:04:30.650> out<00:04:30.740> about<00:04:30.860> every<00:04:31.220> six

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
probably spaced them out about every six

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.230 
probably spaced them out about every six
inches<00:04:31.610> and<00:04:32.090> then<00:04:32.870> fennel<00:04:33.500> mouth<00:04:34.060> so<00:04:35.060> there

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
inches and then fennel mouth so there

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.740 
inches and then fennel mouth so there
you<00:04:35.360> go

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
you go

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.430 
you go
we'll<00:04:36.740> cover<00:04:36.979> all<00:04:37.070> this<00:04:37.400> up<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:39.050> think

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
we'll cover all this up and I think

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.589 
we'll cover all this up and I think
we're<00:04:39.590> gonna<00:04:39.759> head<00:04:40.759> into<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.060> greenhouse<00:04:41.570> and

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
we're gonna head into the greenhouse and

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:44.700 
we're gonna head into the greenhouse and
start<00:04:42.440> working<00:04:42.740> on<00:04:42.860> my<00:04:42.889> Dutch<00:04:43.250> buckets<00:04:43.699> and

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
start working on my Dutch buckets and

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.700 
start working on my Dutch buckets and
we'll<00:04:45.710> have<00:04:45.889> another<00:04:46.190> video<00:04:46.580> on<00:04:46.639> that<00:04:47.680> when<00:04:48.680> I
