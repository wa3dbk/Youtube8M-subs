there's a net on top of you well if you

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.850 
there's a net on top of you well if you

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.370 
look closely right here at the front
there<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.210> nice<00:02:33.510> little<00:02:33.780> space<00:02:34.080> for

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
baseballs to plop on the net roll down

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.810 
baseballs to plop on the net roll down
and<00:02:37.110> drop<00:02:37.470> right<00:02:37.860> here<00:02:37.920> or<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.370> can<00:02:38.580> catch
