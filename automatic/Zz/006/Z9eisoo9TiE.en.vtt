I'm going to try to show you some more
advanced<00:00:04.710> blast<00:00:05.700> beat<00:00:06.029> exercises<00:00:09.019> this<00:00:10.019> is<00:00:10.110> a

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
advanced blast beat exercises this is a

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.200 
advanced blast beat exercises this is a
request<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:10.769> I've<00:00:10.920> had<00:00:11.130> months<00:00:11.730> ago<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.179> I

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
request that I've had months ago that I

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.589 
request that I've had months ago that I
just<00:00:12.570> now<00:00:12.750> have<00:00:12.929> gotten<00:00:13.200> around<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.620> doing<00:00:14.009> it

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599 
just now have gotten around to doing it

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.269 
just now have gotten around to doing it
some<00:00:15.599> ideas<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.020> I've<00:00:16.289> had<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.800> actually

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
some ideas that I've had I actually

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.179 
some ideas that I've had I actually
haven't<00:00:18.029> practiced<00:00:18.570> them<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.800> know<00:00:19.980> bear

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
haven't practiced them so you know bear

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.800 
haven't practiced them so you know bear
have<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.520> bear<00:00:20.760> with<00:00:20.789> me<00:00:21.119> if<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.390> kind<00:00:21.750> of

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
have to bear with me if I kind of

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.429 
have to bear with me if I kind of
screw-up<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:23.180> the<00:00:24.180> first<00:00:24.449> one<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:25.140> first<00:00:25.170> one

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
screw-up so the first one the first one

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.670 
screw-up so the first one the first one
that<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.710> thought<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.250> doing<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:27.680> variation

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
that I thought of is doing a variation

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.540 
that I thought of is doing a variation
between<00:00:29.599> 8th<00:00:30.599> notes<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:32.009> hands<00:00:32.399> and

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
between 8th notes on the hands and

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.700 
between 8th notes on the hands and
twelfth<00:00:33.480> notes<00:00:33.690> or<00:00:33.899> eighth<00:00:34.079> note<00:00:34.320> triplets

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
twelfth notes or eighth note triplets

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.950 
twelfth notes or eighth note triplets
however<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.100> want<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.280> call<00:00:35.340> them<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.870> I

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
however you want to call them and I

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.119 
however you want to call them and I
don't<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.200> my<00:00:37.290> metronome<00:00:37.620> with<00:00:37.829> me<00:00:37.950> either

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
don't have my metronome with me either

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.350 
don't have my metronome with me either
so<00:00:38.250> you're<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.910> have<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.030> go<00:00:39.239> i'll

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
so you're just going to have to go i'll

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.160 
so you're just going to have to go i'll
try<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.600> do<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> downbeat<00:00:40.710> with<00:00:40.980> my<00:00:41.129> head<00:00:41.309> so

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
try to do a downbeat with my head so

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.080 
try to do a downbeat with my head so
bear<00:00:43.170> with<00:00:43.200> me<00:00:43.379> i'm<00:00:43.590> going<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.820> this<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.940> going

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
bear with me i'm going to this is going

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.340 
bear with me i'm going to this is going
to<00:00:45.149> be<00:00:45.210> my<00:00:45.329> first<00:00:45.539> attempt<00:00:45.960> at<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.170> right<00:00:46.320> here

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
to be my first attempt at it right here

00:00:46.350 --> 00:01:13.460 
to be my first attempt at it right here
so

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.529 

so<00:01:14.470> I'm<00:01:14.619> not<00:01:14.799> you<00:01:14.920> can<00:01:15.100> see<00:01:16.090> what<00:01:16.240> i<00:01:16.270> did<00:01:16.329> there

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
so I'm not you can see what i did there

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:21.380 
so I'm not you can see what i did there
basically<00:01:17.170> it<00:01:17.500> was<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:20.560> was<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:20.770> slower

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
basically it was that was a slower

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.870 
basically it was that was a slower
slower<00:01:22.390> tempo<00:01:22.869> I<00:01:22.899> was<00:01:23.140> doing<00:01:23.439> at<00:01:23.860> eighth<00:01:24.580> notes

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
slower tempo I was doing at eighth notes

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.179 
slower tempo I was doing at eighth notes
eighth<00:01:25.570> note<00:01:25.810> bomb<00:01:26.049> blast<00:01:26.350> with<00:01:26.500> my<00:01:26.619> hands<00:01:27.009> and

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
eighth note bomb blast with my hands and

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:33.210 
eighth note bomb blast with my hands and
then<00:01:28.110> sixteenth<00:01:29.110> nose<00:01:29.289> with<00:01:29.470> my<00:01:29.590> feet<00:01:32.220> and

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
then sixteenth nose with my feet and

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:48.740 
then sixteenth nose with my feet and
then<00:01:33.820> same<00:01:34.390> time<00:01:34.780> signature<00:01:35.200> so<00:01:35.470> you<00:01:35.530> don't

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:02:16.830 

same<00:01:49.750> time<00:01:50.020> signature<00:02:15.090> get<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.209> idea<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.630> more

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
same time signature get the idea is more

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.569 
same time signature get the idea is more
of<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:18.660> just<00:02:19.660> just<00:02:20.019> basic<00:02:20.950> time<00:02:21.130> time

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
of a just just basic time time

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.640 
of a just just basic time time
variations<00:02:22.269> within<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.630> same<00:02:22.840> within<00:02:23.470> the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
variations within the same within the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.930 
variations within the same within the
same<00:02:23.859> tempo<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:26.280> then<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.400> could<00:02:27.549> do<00:02:27.760> it

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
same tempo and then you could do it

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.280 
same tempo and then you could do it
backwards<00:02:28.540> still<00:02:29.380> doing<00:02:29.680> still<00:02:30.400> doing<00:02:31.290> eighth

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
backwards still doing still doing eighth

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.490 
backwards still doing still doing eighth
notes<00:02:32.650> or<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.010> mean<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:34.030> triplets<00:02:34.500> but

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
notes or I mean that the triplets but

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.530 
notes or I mean that the triplets but
then<00:02:35.680> instead<00:02:36.069> of<00:02:36.130> doing<00:02:36.609> like<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.389> eighth

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
then instead of doing like the eighth

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.410 
then instead of doing like the eighth
notes<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:37.989> could<00:02:38.139> be<00:02:38.260> doing<00:02:39.209> sixteenth<00:02:40.209> notes

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
notes you could be doing sixteenth notes

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.539 
notes you could be doing sixteenth notes
so<00:02:40.810> maybe<00:02:41.560> it'd<00:02:41.950> be<00:02:42.069> like<00:02:42.190> this<00:02:42.370> you'd

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
so maybe it'd be like this you'd

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.250 
so maybe it'd be like this you'd
actually<00:02:42.730> be<00:02:43.000> slowing<00:02:43.329> down<00:02:43.630> for<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.959> triplet

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
actually be slowing down for the triplet

00:02:44.260 --> 00:03:00.560 
actually be slowing down for the triplet
part<00:02:44.470> so<00:02:44.739> one<00:02:45.010> two<00:02:45.489> three<00:02:46.150> four

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.150 

so<00:03:01.570> you<00:03:01.630> kind<00:03:01.900> of<00:03:01.960> kind<00:03:02.200> of<00:03:02.350> get<00:03:02.470> that<00:03:02.650> idea<00:03:02.770> a

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
so you kind of kind of get that idea a

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:21.450 
so you kind of kind of get that idea a
little<00:03:03.460> bit<00:03:03.580> slower<00:03:03.820> worthy<00:03:20.190> anyways<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.220> get

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
little bit slower worthy anyways you get

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.340 
little bit slower worthy anyways you get
this<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:22.060> basic<00:03:22.420> idea<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:22.990> works<00:03:23.140> better

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
this the basic idea it works better

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.890 
this the basic idea it works better
obviously<00:03:23.620> if<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.070> have<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:24.190> metronome<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.810> if

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
obviously if you have a metronome so if

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.430 
obviously if you have a metronome so if
you've<00:03:26.020> got<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:26.290> downbeat<00:03:26.710> you're<00:03:26.950> just<00:03:28.440> more

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
you've got the downbeat you're just more

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.770 
you've got the downbeat you're just more
and<00:03:29.500> then<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.430> just<00:03:30.640> do<00:03:30.790> different<00:03:31.300> blast

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
and then you just do different blast

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.930 
and then you just do different blast
beat<00:03:32.020> variations<00:03:32.680> within<00:03:32.890> that<00:03:33.220> but<00:03:33.580> within

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
beat variations within that but within

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.290 
beat variations within that but within
the<00:03:34.150> same<00:03:34.330> phrase<00:03:34.690> don't<00:03:35.050> dump<00:03:35.380> stop<00:03:35.710> so

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
the same phrase don't dump stop so

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.830 
the same phrase don't dump stop so
basically<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:39.400> could<00:03:39.550> you<00:03:39.820> justjust<00:03:40.330> more

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
basically you could you justjust more

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.550 
basically you could you justjust more
more<00:03:41.110> more<00:03:41.470> or<00:03:41.590> less<00:03:41.800> just<00:03:43.230> kind<00:03:44.230> of<00:03:44.260> keep<00:03:44.440> it

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
more more or less just kind of keep it

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.920 
more more or less just kind of keep it
keep<00:03:44.830> it<00:03:44.980> going<00:03:45.340> just<00:03:46.150> just<00:03:46.420> practice<00:03:46.780> all

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
keep it going just just practice all

keep it going just just practice all
your<00:03:47.080> different<00:03:47.230> kind<00:03:47.530> of<00:03:47.620> blast<00:03:47.770> beats<00:03:48.040> you

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
your different kind of blast beats you

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.190 
your different kind of blast beats you
bomb<00:03:48.370> blast<00:03:48.700> your<00:03:49.060> your<00:03:49.300> your<00:03:49.510> Oh<00:03:49.570> blast<00:03:49.900> or

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
bomb blast your your your Oh blast or

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.510 
bomb blast your your your Oh blast or
black<00:03:50.350> metal<00:03:50.650> glass<00:03:50.830> however<00:03:51.250> you<00:03:51.340> want<00:03:51.430> to

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
black metal glass however you want to

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.070 
black metal glass however you want to
describe<00:03:51.670> it<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:53.760> then<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:55.570> next<00:03:55.600> exercise

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
describe it and then the next exercise

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.260 
describe it and then the next exercise
was<00:03:56.620> was<00:03:57.010> kind<00:03:57.250> of<00:03:57.310> breaking<00:03:57.640> up<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:57.850> feet<00:03:58.090> and

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
was was kind of breaking up the feet and

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.100 
was was kind of breaking up the feet and
the<00:03:58.360> hands<00:04:00.120> basically<00:04:01.120> you're<00:04:01.510> doing<00:04:01.900> steady

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
the hands basically you're doing steady

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.040 
the hands basically you're doing steady
sixteenth<00:04:02.650> notes<00:04:02.830> with<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.010> bass<00:04:03.190> drums<00:04:04.050> but

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
sixteenth notes with the bass drums but

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.620 
sixteenth notes with the bass drums but
then<00:04:05.200> you're<00:04:05.320> going<00:04:05.440> to<00:04:05.500> be<00:04:06.360> breaking<00:04:07.360> up<00:04:07.480> your

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
then you're going to be breaking up your

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.240 
then you're going to be breaking up your
hands<00:04:07.840> a<00:04:07.990> little<00:04:08.020> bit<00:04:08.350> to<00:04:08.560> make<00:04:08.740> it<00:04:08.800> kind<00:04:09.100> of

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
hands a little bit to make it kind of

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.090 
hands a little bit to make it kind of
kind<00:04:09.850> of<00:04:10.000> different<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:10.480> then<00:04:10.930> also<00:04:11.140> doing

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
kind of different and then also doing

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.680 
kind of different and then also doing
straight<00:04:12.459> blasts<00:04:12.970> with<00:04:13.150> your<00:04:13.390> with<00:04:13.660> your

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
straight blasts with your with your

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.600 
straight blasts with your with your
hands<00:04:14.590> and<00:04:14.709> then<00:04:14.770> breaking<00:04:15.070> up<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.459> bass

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
hands and then breaking up the bass

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.229 
hands and then breaking up the bass
drums<00:04:15.910> so<00:04:16.290> basically<00:04:17.290> like<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:18.730> kind<00:04:19.120> of<00:04:19.150> a

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
drums so basically like the kind of a

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:45.830 
drums so basically like the kind of a
simple<00:04:19.480> pattern<00:04:19.930> would<00:04:20.049> be

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.659 

basically<00:04:46.840> that's<00:04:46.960> it<00:04:47.169> then<00:04:47.860> after<00:04:48.039> that<00:04:48.310> you

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
basically that's it then after that you

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.290 
basically that's it then after that you
would<00:04:50.099> keep<00:04:51.099> the<00:04:51.279> bass<00:04:51.430> drums<00:04:51.669> going<00:04:51.879> but<00:04:52.150> keep

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
would keep the bass drums going but keep

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.939 
would keep the bass drums going but keep
doing<00:04:52.659> this<00:04:52.749> to<00:04:53.080> do<00:04:53.259> the<00:04:53.379> pattern<00:04:53.710> on<00:04:53.800> your

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
doing this to do the pattern on your

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:55.140 
doing this to do the pattern on your
hand<00:04:54.159> that<00:04:54.279> you<00:04:54.370> were<00:04:54.490> doing<00:04:54.789> on<00:04:54.909> the<00:04:54.999> bass

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
hand that you were doing on the bass

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:33.550 
hand that you were doing on the bass
drum<00:04:55.300> so<00:04:55.689> maybe<00:04:58.349> yeah

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.749 

so<00:05:34.560> you<00:05:34.620> can<00:05:34.830> do<00:05:34.979> that<00:05:35.129> i<00:05:35.190> mean<00:05:35.370> you<00:05:35.610> can<00:05:35.729> come

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 
so you can do that i mean you can come

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.820 
so you can do that i mean you can come
up<00:05:36.030> with<00:05:36.150> any<00:05:36.300> pattern<00:05:36.690> you<00:05:36.780> want<00:05:36.960> that'll

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
up with any pattern you want that'll

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.740 
up with any pattern you want that'll
work<00:05:37.979> with<00:05:38.190> that<00:05:38.400> within<00:05:38.639> the<00:05:38.909> you<00:05:39.659> know

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
work with that within the you know

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.659 
work with that within the you know
within<00:05:39.960> just<00:05:40.500> doing<00:05:40.830> four<00:05:41.069> four<00:05:41.310> time

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
within just doing four four time

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.619 
within just doing four four time
signature<00:05:42.319> and<00:05:43.319> then<00:05:44.280> just<00:05:44.460> stay<00:05:44.639> stay<00:05:45.360> steady

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:45.629 
signature and then just stay stay steady

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:46.939 
signature and then just stay stay steady
on<00:05:45.810> that<00:05:45.960> but<00:05:46.139> then<00:05:46.289> come<00:05:46.530> up<00:05:46.560> with<00:05:46.830> different

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:46.949 
on that but then come up with different

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:48.730 
on that but then come up with different
patterns<00:05:47.490> and<00:05:47.639> stuff<00:05:47.789> it<00:05:47.940> sounds<00:05:48.180> really<00:05:48.330> cool

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
patterns and stuff it sounds really cool

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.860 
patterns and stuff it sounds really cool
you<00:05:49.740> know<00:05:50.520> it<00:05:50.699> works<00:05:50.879> works<00:05:51.240> really<00:05:51.449> well<00:05:51.569> if

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
you know it works works really well if

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.119 
you know it works works really well if
you've<00:05:51.990> got<00:05:52.169> a<00:05:52.199> guitar<00:05:52.409> and<00:05:52.770> you<00:05:52.889> want<00:05:53.069> to

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:53.129 
you've got a guitar and you want to

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:55.399 
you've got a guitar and you want to
match<00:05:53.310> up<00:05:53.550> like<00:05:53.759> a<00:05:53.789> certain<00:05:54.210> picking<00:05:55.020> pattern

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
match up like a certain picking pattern

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.570
