00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
with these lines here like that and

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.220 
with these lines here like that and
bolts<00:00:49.980> pace<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.329> easily<00:00:51.600> broke<00:00:51.809> off<00:00:51.989> this

shovel<00:01:38.490> speed<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.740> knocked<00:01:40.740> out<00:01:41.040> by<00:01:41.780> drawing

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
shovel speed and knocked out by drawing

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.679 
shovel speed and knocked out by drawing
a<00:01:42.960> line<00:01:43.079> across<00:01:43.350> here<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:44.100> there<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.689> then

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
a line across here just there and then

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.050 
a line across here just there and then
since<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.290> was<00:01:46.409> coming<00:01:46.560> up<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.649> their<00:01:47.060> drawing

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
since it was coming up to their drawing

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.319 
since it was coming up to their drawing
a<00:01:48.329> line<00:01:48.540> from<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.159> top<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.640> sort

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
a line from here up to the top and sort

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.340 
a line from here up to the top and sort
of<00:01:51.390> doing<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.250> line<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.180> top<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.689> like

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
of doing a line to the top of it like

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.850 
of doing a line to the top of it like
that<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.759> then<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.060> then<00:01:57.570> lining<00:01:57.960> off<00:01:58.290> where

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
that and then and then lining off where

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.429 
that and then and then lining off where
it<00:01:59.100> sort<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.520> made<00:01:59.729> this<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.240> shape<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.750> that

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
it sort of made this so shape and that

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.770 
it sort of made this so shape and that
line<00:02:01.590> here<00:02:01.890> there<00:02:02.310> was<00:02:03.210> going<00:02:03.630> obviously

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
line here there was going obviously

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.990 
line here there was going obviously
across<00:02:04.350> there<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.770> then<00:02:05.100> we<00:02:05.219> did<00:02:05.369> another

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
across there and then we did another

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.760 
across there and then we did another
line<00:02:06.180> here<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.659> separated<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.439> into<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
line here so separated it into the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.760 
line here so separated it into the
columns<00:02:08.569> now<00:02:09.569> i<00:02:09.599> just<00:02:09.720> chose<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.229> column<00:02:10.590> to

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
columns now i just chose this column to

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.480 
columns now i just chose this column to
make

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
make

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.200 
make
that<00:02:11.670> shape<00:02:13.100> as<00:02:14.100> sorry<00:02:14.520> fact<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.850> makes<00:02:15.000> sense

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
that shape as sorry fact it makes sense

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.540 
that shape as sorry fact it makes sense
it<00:02:15.660> didn't<00:02:16.170> make<00:02:16.290> sense<00:02:16.320> to<00:02:16.650> myself<00:02:17.040> what<00:02:17.340> I

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
it didn't make sense to myself what I

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.410 
it didn't make sense to myself what I
can't<00:02:17.940> really<00:02:18.180> explain<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.630> any<00:02:19.200> different

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
can't really explain it any different

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.320 
can't really explain it any different
yes<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.660> we<00:02:21.780> sort<00:02:21.960> it<00:02:22.050> down<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.530> then<00:02:23.210> with<00:02:24.210> the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
yes so we sort it down and then with the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.950 
yes so we sort it down and then with the
edges<00:02:27.380> we<00:02:28.380> sharpen<00:02:28.800> them<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:30.180> they're<00:02:30.450> easy<00:02:30.750> to

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
edges we sharpen them so they're easy to

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.130 
edges we sharpen them so they're easy to
go<00:02:31.110> through<00:02:31.380> things<00:02:32.130> like<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.690> sigh<00:02:36.690> loss<00:02:36.990> for

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
go through things like and sigh loss for

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.710 
go through things like and sigh loss for
words<00:02:37.230> it's<00:02:38.100> easy<00:02:38.280> for<00:02:38.460> it<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.060> go<00:02:39.270> through

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
words it's easy for it to go through

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.180 
words it's easy for it to go through
things<00:02:39.960> like<00:02:40.730> roots<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.560> get<00:02:43.560> bus<00:02:43.740> rocks<00:02:44.070> a

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
things like roots and get bus rocks a

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:52.550 
things like roots and get bus rocks a
bit<00:02:44.370> easier<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:48.200> thick<00:02:49.200> ground<00:02:50.270> and<00:02:51.290> I'll<00:02:52.290> try

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
bit easier and thick ground and I'll try

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.100 
bit easier and thick ground and I'll try
and<00:02:52.590> show<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:52.920> how<00:02:53.310> big<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.120> in<00:02:54.480> comparison

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
and show you how big it is in comparison

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.930 
and show you how big it is in comparison
to<00:02:55.230> me<00:03:00.140> that's<00:03:01.140> lean<00:03:01.740> it<00:03:01.950> up<00:03:02.070> against<00:03:02.700> water

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
to me that's lean it up against water

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.910 
to me that's lean it up against water
and<00:03:03.360> then<00:03:04.970> that's<00:03:05.970> sort<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.570> my<00:03:07.080> size<00:03:07.380> in<00:03:07.860> the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
and then that's sort of my size in the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:17.270 
and then that's sort of my size in the
mirror<00:03:09.080> so<00:03:10.080> you<00:03:10.620> can<00:03:10.650> see<00:03:10.800> it's<00:03:11.040> tiny<00:03:13.160> um<00:03:16.280> yeah

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280
