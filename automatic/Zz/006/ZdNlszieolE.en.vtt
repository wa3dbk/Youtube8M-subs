00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:10.850
 and kerzell and youth good 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:26.460
 hello you love i am right now 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.870
 in sintra in my portugal holiday and 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.300
 we're going through this right now 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.910
 a castle garden in any case you 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.260
 such a day is artificially created 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.210
 became a voted prince in different 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.160
 flora and fauna and I am real 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.780
 curious that is super warm, luckily 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.840
 because I was a bit afraid that 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.440
 bit cold but it is true and 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.440
 I'm curious 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.580
 right now the death summit is high 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.750
 so high people are out of breath 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.280
 Actually, I'm not that bad 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.770
 but probably through the heat 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.960
 protect the rightness and am happy 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.070
 when we reached the top because here 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.070
 The outlook is already really nice 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.299
 That's why I'm happy when we 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.439
 arrived at the top are believes open is on 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.990
 closed in the was against surcharge 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.299
 could come and what not do everything 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.110
 but we'll definitely see that 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.110
 give it differently and try it 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.220
 14 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.220
 Here we are 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:26.430
 has arrived worthwhile in any case 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:28.800
 my eyes and I am feeling the same again 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.120
 all the way down and that's why I would 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:46.050
 I 'll tell you right on the way 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:47.910
 was like as long trackside and 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.800
 garden was created 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.320
 that are somehow nice and here 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.690
 everywhere still such high forces and 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.790
 somehow walls and it is so cool 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.080
 to see was really good 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.790
 but now it's fine again 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.209
 long around 8 to the car now has clock 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.209
 continue 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:38.410
 2 Right now on the way 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.810
 have breakfast and that is a nice one 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.550
 loading is located directly on the sea and 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.500
 I hope that maybe there is one 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.510
 table is with sea view and me 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.130
 I'm really hungry 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.570
 I hope there are cookies and coffee 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.400
 easy if the breakfast is very good 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.610
 I will show something if not 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.610
 then not 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.540
 we have a wonderful view here 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.540
 on the beach 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.169
 I'm at the moment 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.360
 westernmost point of europe before the 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:50.550
 Continent ends and the endless Atlantic 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.840
 begins almost incredibly beautiful here we 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.990
 that can already see behind me 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.300
 So that's really a dream here 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.410
 everywhere so the face coasts ended 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.520
 for a bit of ireland where 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:05.070
 in fact, such important coastal rocks 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.110
 the coast so break and you so easy 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.000
 only looks so deep abyss and not 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.520
 this shallow beach from the songs 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.840
 usual from that really great weather 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.350
 a little bit crazy the 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.570
 Humidity is so high and if 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.260
 among you girls are among those 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.060
 hair because the humidity is just like that 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.570
 be a cotton ball as well as me 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.919
 they are just understanding the phase through the 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.110
 I have to go through it so it is 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.639
 awful but now and again come the 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.940
 sun out and that is okay then 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.530
 and now it goes on to the 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.630
 Lighthouse as I am here in the 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.260
 westernmost point is also shining and 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:48.720
 I'll see what's there 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:51.080
 there is still to be fetched and yes I am 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.080
 really excited 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:06:01.200
 It goes on is really nice so me 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:03.330
 am so I'm such a nature fell 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.930
 fanatics free no idea how to do it 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.750
 should call 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.160
 I like it just like so real in the 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.470
 to be nature and a little bit 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.650
 to have adventure and not so much 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:17.060
 to make city trips actually comes 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.060
 study his last tour 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:49.050
 So right off behind me nor the 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.759
 sea â€‹â€‹and it is so beautiful it is 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.479
