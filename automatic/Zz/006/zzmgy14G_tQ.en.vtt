00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
would drape and then the middle part

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.479 
would drape and then the middle part
right<00:03:51.239> here<00:03:51.630> you<00:03:51.959> can<00:03:52.140> just<00:03:52.350> put<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.830> little<00:03:53.130> I

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
right here you can just put a little I

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.979 
right here you can just put a little I
will<00:03:54.060> fold<00:03:54.269> it<00:03:54.420> in<00:03:54.510> half<00:03:54.540> like<00:03:54.959> this<00:03:55.459> and<00:03:56.989> then

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
will fold it in half like this and then

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.289 
will fold it in half like this and then
I<00:03:59.000> would<00:04:00.000> just<00:04:00.150> cut<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.510> little<00:04:01.970> curve<00:04:02.970> in<00:04:03.150> it

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
I would just cut a little curve in it

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.259 
I would just cut a little curve in it
just<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.600> give<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:04.049> better<00:04:04.230> design<00:04:05.269> like

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
just to give it a better design like

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.000 
just to give it a better design like
that<00:04:06.299> and<00:04:06.780> then<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:07.019> can<00:04:07.170> hem<00:04:07.410> that<00:04:07.440> bottom

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
that and then you can hem that bottom
