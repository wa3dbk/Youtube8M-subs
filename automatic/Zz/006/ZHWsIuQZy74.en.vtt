a very good location where Albert

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.099 
a very good location where Albert
Parker's<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.120> think<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> water<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
Parker's I think with the water in the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
three race stuff and do a lot of film in

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.649 
three race stuff and do a lot of film in
the<00:01:10.740> other<00:01:10.920> Beach<00:01:11.100> which<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.820> also<00:01:12.000> an<00:01:12.360> another

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
the other Beach which is also an another

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.440 
the other Beach which is also an another
unusual<00:01:12.990> thing<00:01:13.200> for<00:01:13.350> Grand<00:01:13.680> Prix<00:01:13.830> track

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
unusual thing for Grand Prix track

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.690 
unusual thing for Grand Prix track
melbourne<00:01:15.450> obviously<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> good<00:01:16.799> mix<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
melbourne obviously is a good mix of a

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.760 
melbourne obviously is a good mix of a
street<00:01:18.119> track<00:01:18.390> obviously<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.409> normal

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
street track obviously and a normal

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.920 
street track obviously and a normal
track<00:01:20.040> there<00:01:20.850> are<00:01:20.909> different<00:01:21.000> parts<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.780> I

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
track there are different parts of it I

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.710 
track there are different parts of it I
think<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.680> makes<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.430> lot<00:01:23.549> very<00:01:23.820> very<00:01:24.420> very

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
think that makes a lot very very very

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.740 
think that makes a lot very very very
good<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.860> have<00:01:26.009> both<00:01:26.610> aspects<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.270> look<00:01:27.450> at<00:01:27.630> in

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
good you have both aspects to look at in

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.140 
good you have both aspects to look at in
car<00:01:27.960> set<00:01:28.229> up<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.220> it's<00:01:29.340> quite<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.549> challenge<00:01:29.640> in

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
car set up so it's quite a challenge in

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.330 
car set up so it's quite a challenge in
that<00:01:30.180> sense<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.720> things<00:01:30.869> also<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.009> race<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.310> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
that sense of things also the race is a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.780 
that sense of things also the race is a
twilight<00:01:32.990> event<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.350> you're<00:01:35.220> almost<00:01:35.400> going

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
twilight event so you're almost going

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.600

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
getting the tire temperatures all these

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.620 
getting the tire temperatures all these
things<00:01:43.590> come<00:01:43.829> into<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.490> end<00:01:45.000> result<00:01:45.420> and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
it makes the engineering staff have to

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.550 
it makes the engineering staff have to
work<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> bit<00:01:48.149> harder<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.750> equal<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> driver

very good compounds and we can all take
advantage<00:02:15.689> from<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.109> I<00:02:16.310> enjoy<00:02:17.310> sector<00:02:17.879> 3

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120

Melbourne<00:02:18.629> I<00:02:19.200> think<00:02:19.859> there's<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.099> good

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:20.249 
Melbourne I think there's a good

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:22.520 
Melbourne I think there's a good
technical<00:02:20.999> aspect<00:02:21.389> of<00:02:21.569> it<00:02:21.719> is<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.200> end<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.469> the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
technical aspect of it is the end of the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.530 
technical aspect of it is the end of the
laps<00:02:22.769> or<00:02:23.099> depending<00:02:23.879> on<00:02:23.969> how<00:02:24.120> you've<00:02:24.269> done<00:02:24.450> at

the<00:02:24.599> beginning<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.109> lap<00:02:25.290> as<00:02:26.219> how

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
the beginning of the lap as how

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.940 
the beginning of the lap as how
committed<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:27.030> will<00:02:27.180> be<00:02:27.299> in<00:02:27.389> that<00:02:27.569> sector<00:02:27.950> but

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
committed you will be in that sector but

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.890 
committed you will be in that sector but
there's<00:02:29.099> a<00:02:29.159> lot<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.579> time<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.000> begin<00:02:30.150> an

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
there's a lot of that time to begin an

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.750 
there's a lot of that time to begin an
equally<00:02:31.620> last<00:02:31.920> corner<00:02:32.189> as<00:02:32.370> probably<00:02:32.670> the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
equally last corner as probably the

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.789 
equally last corner as probably the
biggest<00:02:32.939> challenge<00:02:33.420> once<00:02:34.109> your<00:02:34.260> tires<00:02:34.530> you've

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
biggest challenge once your tires you've

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.199 
biggest challenge once your tires you've
used<00:02:35.010> them<00:02:35.189> to<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.430> maximum<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:36.000> their

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
advantage throughout the lap that's

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.199 
advantage throughout the lap that's
whether<00:02:38.129> they'll<00:02:38.370> hold<00:02:38.549> on<00:02:38.730> through<00:02:38.939> the<00:02:39.060> last
