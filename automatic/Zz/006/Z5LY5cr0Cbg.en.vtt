00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
apparently toshiba and milky have just

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.190 
apparently toshiba and milky have just
figured<00:01:42.180> out<00:01:42.270> how<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.420> bring<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.899> into<00:01:43.079> a

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
but apparently what's even more

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.229 
but apparently what's even more
interesting<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.739> well<00:02:50.489> that's<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.030> only

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
interesting is that well that's the only

aesthetics because the UI is going to be

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.410 
aesthetics because the UI is going to be
