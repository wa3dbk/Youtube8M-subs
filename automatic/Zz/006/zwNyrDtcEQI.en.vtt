00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.610
 hello I am lis today I am going to 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.550
 present and I'll show you how to do 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.860
 a night look is a tuxedo but not 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.119
 it's the typical smoky eyes the black shadow 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.879
 but I put a twist of a shadow 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.980
 moradita not all smoky eyes have 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.110
 that being black then here I put them 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.050
 another alternative this look I would like 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.199
 much that comes out as to go out in the 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.120
 night in these hot seasons the 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.150
 lips are a little fainter so that 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:53.060
 the focus of attention is the eyes and good 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.730
 Well let's see it I hope you like it 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.450
 as a basis for the eye shadow the day 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.260
 today we are going to use the interim the 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.979
 mobile brown on black 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.930
 we put it on all the eyelid mobile 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.360
 it does not matter that it is a little bit wrong 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.390
 done nothing else try not to climb up 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.090
 above but counting a little bit to 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.009
 that comes in the basin and we do what 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.009
 same also down 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.890
 this time we are going to use the 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:29.360
 palette of shadows two minutes of 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:32.630
 volcanic and we will use 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.630
 the color rockstar the purple what helps 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.250
 to put the first black base is that 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.430
 when the simple shadow is put 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.420
 the color is as much stronger than if 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.820
 only to be right 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.530
 Now we are going to do the same but for 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.490
 down 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.780
 now from the same palette 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.780
 now let's explore a lot that is like 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.780
 silver 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.780
 and only 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.690
 we propose 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.690
 in the middle 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.410
 now with a little bit of black 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.349
 we put right over the basin 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:37.810
 the fixed eyelid we put a color 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.770
 almost white as they threw 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.770
 and here already 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.000
 a children with all the other shades 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.659
 for this look I know it's a tuxedo 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.879
 and that I would not need much delineated to 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.430
 I like to delineate how much is a 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.879
 tuxedo that is not black I like it 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.500
 delineate as you want to give 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.629
 as a more dramatic effect 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.500
 then we use the same eyeliner 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.500
 that we put the base 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.520
 let's look inside 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.460
 and now we put 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.200
 rival the one I'm going to use the day of 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:28.620
 today 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.620
 the turbo boy while the black 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.269
 I really like to accentuate the lashes in 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.269
 this look 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.270
 and now we're going with the proofreader 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.280
 we are going to use today is the most 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.290
 weird and we put it 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.600
 on the sheet of the table on some 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.600
 imperfection that could have 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.420
 the basis that we are going to use the day of 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:16.040
 today is the most to this cult 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.040
 I like this base a lot because 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:24.300
 It is of strong coverage 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.300
 and it lasts lasts all night 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.590
 the way to apply that taste of each 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.650
 who there are people who like to apply with 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.009
 hands 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:39.060
 with a brush with a sponge 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:41.960
 it is important what 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.960
 that we go 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.930
 we also apply a little bit of base in the 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.930
 lips because we're going to wear a look 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.740
 clarito 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.010
 so that the eyes in the center of 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.010
 Attention 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:10.820
 now with his corrector 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:13.590
 he is shown how to see with the 1350 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.880
 let's do the control we do not put 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.880
 a lot just a little 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.879
 just here 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:28.630
 and with a brush so 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.630
 that have white tips 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.020
 let's blur and spread 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:55.509
 and now we put translucent powder in 

00:05:52.959 --> 00:06:00.359
 whole face with this time I'm 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:00.359
 using the father rais of palladium 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:16.949
 as it was called cell 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:16.949
 the outline with glam bronze de l'orÃ©al 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:39.750
 now with an eyeliner that I'm 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.530
 using is the looks of brown line in 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.569
 colour 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:48.229
 burnett 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:48.229
 let's fill in a bit the eyebrow 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.840
 for the lips I will use the lipstick 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:00.360
 brand 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.360
 the color not what is 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:27.090
 I'm going to use a 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:30.040
 Mineral illuminator for purposes of 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:33.270
 color markings holding 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.270
 this only goes 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.060
 just above the congo 

00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:53.779
 a little 

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.260
 and that is the gift of today 

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.520
 Y
