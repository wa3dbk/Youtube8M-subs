00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.060 
thing I like about it and the thing I
really<00:02:06.700> really<00:02:06.969> like<00:02:07.090> about<00:02:07.240> you<00:02:07.570> know<00:02:07.749> the

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
really really like about you know the

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.150 
really really like about you know the
it's<00:02:09.070> the<00:02:09.160> car<00:02:09.429> handling<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:10.239> physics<00:02:10.630> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
it's the car handling the physics the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.789 
it's the car handling the physics the
sensation<00:02:12.160> of<00:02:12.250> speed<00:02:12.720> just<00:02:13.720> feels<00:02:13.989> so<00:02:14.290> spot-on

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
sensation of speed just feels so spot-on

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:20.099 
sensation of speed just feels so spot-on
um<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:17.470> for<00:02:17.680> some<00:02:17.829> reason<00:02:17.859> it<00:02:18.540> always<00:02:19.540> gets<00:02:19.900> my

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:20.109 
um and for some reason it always gets my

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:22.229 
um and for some reason it always gets my
adrenaline<00:02:20.200> going<00:02:20.680> in<00:02:21.519> every<00:02:21.850> single<00:02:22.030> race

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
you're talking about that that car

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.080 
you're talking about that that car
physics<00:02:26.739> on<00:02:26.920> having<00:02:27.340> stuff<00:02:27.579> like<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:27.790> even

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
physics on having stuff like that even

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.360 
physics on having stuff like that even
though<00:02:28.299> I'm<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.540> complete<00:02:29.019> and<00:02:29.200> utter<00:02:29.370> carnival

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370

I<00:02:30.519> don't<00:02:30.730> know<00:02:30.819> anything<00:02:31.060> i<00:02:31.989> have<00:02:32.500> read<00:02:33.220> other

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:33.639 
I don't know anything i have read other

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.099 
I don't know anything i have read other
people<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.090> actually<00:02:34.239> like<00:02:34.540> card<00:02:34.750> games<00:02:34.780> and

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
people that actually like card games and

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:36.509 
people that actually like card games and
it<00:02:35.410> seems<00:02:35.560> like<00:02:35.680> people<00:02:35.709> are<00:02:36.040> in<00:02:36.160> two<00:02:36.280> minds

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
it seems like people are in two minds

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.690 
it seems like people are in two minds
about<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:37.000> yes<00:02:37.209> yes<00:02:37.950> it's<00:02:38.950> an<00:02:39.069> arcade<00:02:39.370> racer

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
about that yes yes it's an arcade racer

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.180 
about that yes yes it's an arcade racer
with<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.060> cavalry<00:02:40.420> so<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.200> know<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.680> doesn't

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
with the cavalry so you know it doesn't

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.890 
with the cavalry so you know it doesn't
even<00:02:42.489> attempt<00:02:42.909> to<00:02:43.090> disguise<00:02:43.360> itself<00:02:43.690> as<00:02:43.840> being

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
even attempt to disguise itself as being

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.180 
even attempt to disguise itself as being
realistic<00:02:44.709> um<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:47.230> cars<00:02:47.440> might<00:02:47.620> feel<00:02:48.159> a

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
realistic um the cars might feel a

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.070 
realistic um the cars might feel a
little<00:02:48.310> heavier<00:02:48.819> at<00:02:49.390> first<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:49.870> what<00:02:49.989> you

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
little heavier at first and what you

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.809 
little heavier at first and what you
expect<00:02:50.440> but<00:02:50.890> once<00:02:51.069> you're<00:02:51.190> used<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:51.640> and

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
expect but once you're used to that and

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.460 
expect but once you're used to that and
you<00:02:51.879> will<00:02:52.090> be<00:02:52.209> used<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.599> by<00:02:52.659> two<00:02:52.840> races<00:02:53.319> or

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
you will be used to that by two races or

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.039 
you will be used to that by two races or
something<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:55.030> know<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.510> can<00:02:55.810> do

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
something it you know you can do

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.300 
something it you know you can do
