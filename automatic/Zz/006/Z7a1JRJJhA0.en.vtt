00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.490
 When you open it 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.860
 The battery 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.860
 The size of ad will be revealed to sin. 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:48.180
 More precise because it supports fans 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.180
 4 Adjustable 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.280

 You can reach the market by pressing the Start button 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.920
 Key case load increase 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.900
 I boldly got rid of it with the touchpad. 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:17.390
 There are a lot of donations, though . 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.390
 The lice are tiny touchpad is similar to O2 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.829
 Now, two turns to the game 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:29.610
 As part of being invited to do so will'm not so pop 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:33.030
 Because the torch is implanted, 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.880
 Corner was given a little moving type such 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:44.090
 As many times do I have some drawbacks that move ginhan 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:49.100
 This can also be useful when using without a mouse 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.000
 There segyeo the bottom of the left button click, right-click and right-click 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.390
 That's it. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.750
 The middle port is used for scrolling 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.859
 No, if you scroll this part, 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.640
 Press the middle button so my contact with John lowering down 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:04.640
 Up goes up 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.170
 Once you can see what's available 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:20.239
 It's all about standing and designing and making things. 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:25.819
 I think I'm finished. 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:27.080
 Yes, the interface now has the same partial d-sub terminal and sd memory 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.530
 And 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.530
 Head 3 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.400
 There's a heritage m4 in the back . 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:43.760
 There are two usb terminal 3.0 , hdmi terminal and full size terminal 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:47.530
 I exposed it. 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.530
 It's down here. There's a button. 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:56.930
 The day before yesterday, I was never approached've arranged to put up his hand down on top of eating 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:02.140
 Each one came down in volume and even down part is pretty 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.140
 It is also very good part of the screen rotation 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:15.140
 Note that what you do now on the left is the extension of the terminal part 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.920
 When I actually put on this part, it was too open because it was like a chicken. 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.660
 Softly 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:25.160
 There are some parts to get rid of the receiving part. 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:28.900
 It's all up there . 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.900
 I've made it available for you to request. 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.430
 I typed it so I thought it would be a little uncomfortable because it was small. 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.720
 Actually, 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:46.080
 I was able to type faster than I thought . 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:51.600
 The keyboard and the big station, 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:54.060
 Is not it a little camp watching nateot typos side rather than plunging still think 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.890
 It was easy to break out 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:02.750
 Kigam a key is depressed feelings and write a little company turning forest land 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.750
 Keyboard Not Ready 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.320
 You'll be able to hit it with recognition . 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:20.959
 And I still lost a lot more phrases to think a little more quiet, yet I 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.560
 I was surprised a lot , 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.980
 i would have liked to stop and not go back well. 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:33.290
 It works but it performs very corrective action 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.610
 It is not as much of a foreign language as it is , 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.790
 On the side 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.780
 And what was fun 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:44.070
 Abandonment 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.930
 So that you can control the noise in the North at the Observatory BioPhoton Center . 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:50.520
 If you have performance 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:52.110
 The factory is in the mode where the performance is made and choosing the insurance will optimize the noise 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.160
 Mode. 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:05:00.180
 So, you 'll have a lot of cotton . 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:03.510
 If you are high, you can work quite astonished at the end of the noise 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.870
 Jotgetjyo haneunge to halttaeneun performance mode game with water 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.870
 And 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.370
 Tangle tendeyo've seen him once briefly the planet jokes 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:32.490
 Step by step because the team coincidence 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:32.490
 It will be appointed so that the four-pole senior will be pressed 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:46.949
 The picture can also be freely turned off and more compact icons 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:51.360
 Even when you use the fan, you can type more comfortably. 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:53.810
 More fingers are able to do it, but I can do it more comfortably if I enter the fan again 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.810
 There is 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:01.700
 As a whole , 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:05.480
 Parts make laughing raised so high side control point went'm fine sieve gin 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:10.640
 I 'm afraid I'm not in control, but I 'm born better than I thought. 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:14.450
 I do not know when it's broken , but the silver hinge I received from the bookstore is the smoothest 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:17.140
 This model is the only model that climbs up and is the shortest. 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.140
 Knitting picked 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:24.910
 Oh, and 1 Aarritm is supported by a keyboard four-pack night. 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.460
 now 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:39.090
 Team button and subtracted support 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:41.900
 The keyboard can be used more comfortably when hitting the keyboard in the dark 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.900
 It is 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:47.669
 Yes 

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:47.669
 I'm trying to use numbers. 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.340
 It's a bit heavy to carry around. 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:58.000
 Still, 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:58.000
 You can carry it around and suddenly take it out and use it 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:07.419
 Also to keep improving I think, like a favorite model 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:10.360
 The disadvantages are a structured problematic 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:15.340
 Now that the angle is fixed 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:19.389
 When I use the keyboard and print it out , it becomes a room racist. 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:24.460
 When you want to receive when the number seven now able to sit as chair deseo 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:28.120
 There 's a bit of a nuisance that you can not make a shoot. 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:32.909
 That part is Keene's side, and declaration is okay. 

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:35.330
 Maturity also look like a decent side'm quite tall 

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:35.330
 It's more than four.
