00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
and get around that but I can't stop

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.030 
and get around that but I can't stop
feeling<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.630> sense<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.380> guilt<00:01:49.649> when<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.829> go<00:01:50.009> to

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
feeling that sense of guilt when I go to

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.160 
feeling that sense of guilt when I go to
a<00:01:50.159> dentist<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.850> obviously<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.930> most

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
a dentist and obviously it's the most

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.440 
a dentist and obviously it's the most
vulnerable<00:01:52.560> position<00:01:53.430> they<00:01:53.790> put<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.149> I

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
vulnerable position they put you in I

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.030 
vulnerable position they put you in I
mean<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.110> only<00:01:55.200> thing<00:01:55.320> worse<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.740> probably

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
mean the only thing worse is probably

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.620 
mean the only thing worse is probably
going<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.399> proctologist<00:01:57.270> which<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.509> don't

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
going to a proctologist which you don't

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.380 
going to a proctologist which you don't
really<00:01:57.719> have<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.200> England<00:01:58.670> we<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.820> just<00:02:00.030> bum
