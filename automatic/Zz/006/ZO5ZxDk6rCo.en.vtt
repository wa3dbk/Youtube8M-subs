00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.050 

so<00:00:01.290> today's<00:00:01.680> video<00:00:01.920> I<00:00:02.159> want<00:00:02.460> to<00:00:02.520> work<00:00:02.669> on<00:00:02.850> the

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
so today's video I want to work on the

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.720 
so today's video I want to work on the
exhaust<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.720> bit<00:00:03.899> and<00:00:04.080> today<00:00:05.040> you<00:00:05.220> get<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.520> see

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
exhaust a bit and today you get to see

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.880 
exhaust a bit and today you get to see
where<00:00:06.299> those<00:00:06.540> mufflers<00:00:07.020> go<00:00:07.259> on<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.560> machine

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
where those mufflers go on the machine

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.700 
where those mufflers go on the machine
so<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.639> right<00:00:08.790> side<00:00:09.090> here<00:00:09.450> it's<00:00:09.690> suspended<00:00:10.590> by

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
so the right side here it's suspended by

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.160 
so the right side here it's suspended by
some<00:00:10.980> wires<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.670> I'm<00:00:12.330> just<00:00:12.480> kind<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:12.780> mocking

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
some wires and I'm just kind of mocking

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.470 
some wires and I'm just kind of mocking
up<00:00:13.320> its<00:00:13.530> position<00:00:14.190> but<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:15.150> was<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.330> little

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
up its position but I was a little

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.170 
up its position but I was a little
concerned<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.289> maybe<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.340> suspension

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
concerned that maybe the suspension

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.179 
concerned that maybe the suspension
might<00:00:18.359> interfere<00:00:18.690> with<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.380> location<00:00:20.070> of

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
might interfere with the location of

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.460 
might interfere with the location of
where<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.369> wanted<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.820> muffler<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:21.930> just

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
where I wanted that muffler so I just

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.429 
where I wanted that muffler so I just
did<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.650> mock<00:00:23.070> up<00:00:23.310> here<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.990> the<00:00:24.990> right<00:00:25.170> side

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
did a mock up here and the right side

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.109 
did a mock up here and the right side
suspension<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.189> hanging<00:00:26.490> off<00:00:26.640> my<00:00:26.670> cherry

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
suspension is hanging off my cherry

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.919 
suspension is hanging off my cherry
picker<00:00:27.359> here<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.550> turns<00:00:29.550> out<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:30.000> got<00:00:30.539> plenty

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
picker here and turns out I got plenty

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.330 
picker here and turns out I got plenty
of<00:00:31.170> room<00:00:31.320> there<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.710> I'll<00:00:31.890> show<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.099> where

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
of room there and I'll show you where

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.370 
of room there and I'll show you where
I'm<00:00:32.430> talking<00:00:32.790> about<00:00:32.850> right<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:33.989> corner

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
I'm talking about right in that corner

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.530 
I'm talking about right in that corner
there<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.559> was<00:00:34.950> kind<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.640> looking<00:00:35.910> at<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.059> well

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
there I was kind of looking at that well

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.260 
there I was kind of looking at that well
maybe<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:37.050> AR<00:00:37.950> might<00:00:38.219> bump<00:00:38.730> up<00:00:38.940> underneath

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
maybe that AR might bump up underneath

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.830 
maybe that AR might bump up underneath
that<00:00:39.450> muffler<00:00:40.079> there<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:41.570> doesn't<00:00:42.570> seem<00:00:42.719> to

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
that muffler there but doesn't seem to

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.040 
that muffler there but doesn't seem to
be<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> problem<00:00:44.180> while<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> headers<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.809> this

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
be a problem while the headers on this

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.130 
be a problem while the headers on this
car<00:00:46.550> used<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.700> exit<00:00:48.390> underneath<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.960> vehicle

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
car used to exit underneath the vehicle

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.650 
car used to exit underneath the vehicle
and<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:50.250> created<00:00:50.640> quite<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.850> bit<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.120> fumes<00:00:51.390> for

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
and it created quite a bit of fumes for

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.220 
and it created quite a bit of fumes for
the<00:00:51.750> driver<00:00:52.399> so<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> fix<00:00:54.539> make<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
the driver so this is the fix make the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.930 
the driver so this is the fix make the
headers<00:00:55.530> dump<00:00:55.800> outside<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.399> vehicle<00:00:56.789> like

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
headers dump outside the vehicle like

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.450 
headers dump outside the vehicle like
that<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:58.350> built<00:00:58.590> these<00:00:58.800> headers<00:00:59.129> from<00:00:59.370> a

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
that and I built these headers from a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.340 
that and I built these headers from a
weld<00:00:59.670> up<00:00:59.850> kit<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.690> used<00:01:00.870> pretty<00:01:01.170> well

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
weld up kit and I used pretty well

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.189 
weld up kit and I used pretty well
everything<00:01:01.820> except<00:01:02.820> for<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.510> think<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.870> made<00:01:04.049> my

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
everything except for I think I made my

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.700 
everything except for I think I made my
own<00:01:04.229> flange<00:01:04.739> like<00:01:05.189> at<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> top<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.320> I<00:01:07.320> also

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
own flange like at the top and I also

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.210 
own flange like at the top and I also
used<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.430> different<00:01:08.850> collector<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:10.040> so<00:01:11.040> what<00:01:11.189> I

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
used a different collector and so what I

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.240 
used a different collector and so what I
did<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.640> make<00:01:11.820> these<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.750> first<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.260> fixed<00:01:13.740> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
did to make these is I first I fixed the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.700 
did to make these is I first I fixed the
collector<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> vehicle<00:01:16.170> temporarily

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
collector to the vehicle temporarily

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.149 
collector to the vehicle temporarily
exactly<00:01:17.490> where<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.670> wanted<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.330> then<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
exactly where I wanted it and then the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.300 
exactly where I wanted it and then the
rest<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.640> started<00:01:20.820> fitting<00:01:21.150> together<00:01:22.310> so

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
rest of it I started fitting together so

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.429 
rest of it I started fitting together so
that's<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.729> strategy<00:01:23.939> here<00:01:24.659> I'm<00:01:25.110> mounting

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
that's the strategy here I'm mounting

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.580 
that's the strategy here I'm mounting
the<00:01:25.799> muffler<00:01:26.189> first<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:27.869> engine<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.350> of

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the muffler first and the engine is of

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.469 
the muffler first and the engine is of
course<00:01:28.799> already<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.790> then<00:01:30.000> I've<00:01:30.180> got<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
course already in and then I've got the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.569 
course already in and then I've got the
exhaust<00:01:30.720> started<00:01:31.200> at<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.409> engine<00:01:31.799> side<00:01:32.250> and

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
exhaust started at the engine side and

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.219 
exhaust started at the engine side and
then<00:01:33.180> I'm<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.720> start<00:01:33.960> joining

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
then I'm just going to start joining

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.039 
then I'm just going to start joining
pieces<00:01:34.770> together<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.460> fit<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.270> together<00:01:36.540> like

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
pieces together and fit it together like

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.289 
pieces together and fit it together like
a<00:01:37.110> puzzle<00:01:37.369> all<00:01:38.369> right<00:01:38.610> well<00:01:38.790> I'm<00:01:38.909> starting<00:01:39.270> to

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
a puzzle all right well I'm starting to

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.090 
a puzzle all right well I'm starting to
cut<00:01:39.540> up<00:01:39.689> some<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.079> mandrel<00:01:40.500> bends<00:01:40.770> here

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
cut up some of the mandrel bends here

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.389 
cut up some of the mandrel bends here
and<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.560> cut<00:01:43.740> all<00:01:43.829> kinds<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.220> little

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
and so I can cut all kinds of little

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.760 
and so I can cut all kinds of little
pieces<00:01:44.579> up<00:01:44.939> sometimes<00:01:45.869> my<00:01:46.049> pieces<00:01:46.320> will<00:01:46.590> get<00:01:46.740> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
pieces up sometimes my pieces will get a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.289 
pieces up sometimes my pieces will get a
lot<00:01:46.979> shorter<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:47.579> maybe<00:01:47.759> only<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.149> little

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
lot shorter like maybe only a little

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.319 
lot shorter like maybe only a little
piece<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.840> corner<00:01:49.229> or<00:01:49.380> whatever<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.329> by

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
piece of a corner or whatever and by

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.539 
piece of a corner or whatever and by
fitting<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.780> stuff<00:01:52.020> together<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.340> make

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
fitting the stuff together you can make

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.639 
fitting the stuff together you can make

and look what I found so I got a couple
of<00:02:22.260> these<00:02:22.610> these<00:02:23.610> are<00:02:23.820> pipe<00:02:24.120> hangers<00:02:24.540> for<00:02:24.840> CR

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
of these these are pipe hangers for CR

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.460 
of these these are pipe hangers for CR
500<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.210> think<00:02:27.210> they're<00:02:27.390> going<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.570> be<00:02:27.780> nice

500 and I think they're going to be nice
and<00:02:28.680> sturdy<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.190> work<00:02:29.610> really<00:02:29.790> well<00:02:30.000> for<00:02:30.060> this

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
and sturdy and work really well for this

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.350 
and sturdy and work really well for this
project<00:02:30.530> so<00:02:31.530> I'm<00:02:31.620> thinking<00:02:32.270> something<00:02:33.270> about

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
project so I'm thinking something about

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.470 
project so I'm thinking something about
like<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:33.930> see<00:02:34.610> it<00:02:35.610> bolted<00:02:35.940> on<00:02:36.060> there<00:02:36.270> and

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
like this see it bolted on there and

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.170 
like this see it bolted on there and
then<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:36.600> could<00:02:36.810> whip<00:02:36.990> up<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.290> mount<00:02:37.530> on<00:02:38.220> the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
then I could whip up a mount on the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.710 
then I could whip up a mount on the
frame

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
frame

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.470

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
straight mark around a piece of tubing

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.000 
straight mark around a piece of tubing
just<00:03:02.340> use<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.550> piece<00:03:02.820> of<00:03:03.000> paper<00:03:05.600> and<00:03:06.800> line<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:07.830> up

just use a piece of paper and line it up

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.130 
just use a piece of paper and line it up
nice<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:11.030> then<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.150> can<00:03:12.330> slide<00:03:12.600> that<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.989> where

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
nice and then I can slide that to where

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.470 
nice and then I can slide that to where
my<00:03:13.650> mark<00:03:13.890> is<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.370> then<00:03:14.760> I'll<00:03:14.880> just<00:03:15.030> mark<00:03:15.239> all

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
my mark is and then I'll just mark all

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.330 
my mark is and then I'll just mark all
the<00:03:15.510> way<00:03:15.630> around<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.170> then<00:03:16.680> it'll<00:03:17.130> be<00:03:17.220> a

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
the way around and then it'll be a

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.430 
the way around and then it'll be a
straight<00:03:17.730> cut<00:03:18.030> if<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.330> stay<00:03:18.840> on<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.080> line<00:03:19.260> at

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
straight cut if I stay on the line at

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:33.949 
straight cut if I stay on the line at
least

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.900 

and<00:03:34.959> it's<00:03:35.739> cut<00:03:35.920> pretty<00:03:36.099> short<00:03:36.430> now<00:03:36.580> you<00:03:36.760> can

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
and it's cut pretty short now you can

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.420 
and it's cut pretty short now you can
see<00:03:37.120> how<00:03:37.660> much<00:03:37.900> or<00:03:38.319> how<00:03:38.500> little<00:03:38.530> of<00:03:39.099> that<00:03:39.250> I'm

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
see how much or how little of that I'm

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.280 
see how much or how little of that I'm
actually<00:03:39.640> going<00:03:39.879> to<00:03:39.940> be<00:03:40.030> using<00:03:40.390> so<00:03:41.019> and<00:03:41.200> it

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
actually going to be using so and it

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.680 
actually going to be using so and it
heads<00:03:41.470> off<00:03:41.680> through<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.129> frame<00:03:42.370> right<00:03:42.580> there

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.690 

so<00:03:46.690> I<00:03:46.720> took<00:03:46.840> some<00:03:47.230> flat<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:47.920> put<00:03:48.459> it<00:03:48.550> in<00:03:48.610> the

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
so I took some flat and put it in the

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.540 
so I took some flat and put it in the
vise<00:03:48.910> give<00:03:49.599> it<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.840> bit<00:03:49.959> of<00:03:49.989> a<00:03:50.140> tweak<00:03:50.430> drill<00:03:51.430> the

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
vise give it a bit of a tweak drill the

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.820 
vise give it a bit of a tweak drill the
hole<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:52.030> round<00:03:52.239> it<00:03:52.390> off<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.690> end<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:53.620> so

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
hole and round it off the end and so

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.860 
hole and round it off the end and so
it's<00:03:53.980> going<00:03:54.099> to<00:03:54.160> be<00:03:54.250> part<00:03:54.519> of<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.870> exhaust

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
it's going to be part of the exhaust

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.350 
it's going to be part of the exhaust
mount<00:03:56.349> bracket<00:03:56.920> here<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:58.150> little

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
mount bracket here and the little

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.420 
mount bracket here and the little
cardboard<00:03:58.629> pieces<00:03:59.200> that<00:03:59.349> have<00:03:59.470> to<00:03:59.500> cut<00:04:00.220> those

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
cardboard pieces that have to cut those

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.789 
cardboard pieces that have to cut those
out<00:04:00.610> of<00:04:00.760> steel<00:04:01.239> yet<00:04:01.420> so<00:04:02.260> that's<00:04:02.560> what<00:04:02.680> I'm

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
out of steel yet so that's what I'm

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.350 
out of steel yet so that's what I'm
working<00:04:03.099> on<00:04:03.190> now<00:04:03.250> I<00:04:03.430> think<00:04:03.549> I'm<00:04:04.000> going<00:04:04.090> to<00:04:04.150> make

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
working on now I think I'm going to make

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.660 
working on now I think I'm going to make
that<00:04:04.599> bracket<00:04:04.900> first<00:04:05.380> and<00:04:05.650> then<00:04:06.370> I'm<00:04:06.489> going<00:04:06.610> to

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
that bracket first and then I'm going to

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.550 
that bracket first and then I'm going to
start<00:04:06.849> working<00:04:07.060> on<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.450> tubing<00:04:08.110> for<00:04:08.500> the

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
start working on the tubing for the

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.569 
start working on the tubing for the
exhaust<00:04:10.560> so<00:04:11.560> after<00:04:11.829> I<00:04:11.860> make<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.069> cut<00:04:12.370> with<00:04:12.549> a

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
exhaust so after I make a cut with a

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.580 
exhaust so after I make a cut with a
chop<00:04:12.880> saw<00:04:13.120> I<00:04:13.390> like<00:04:13.720> to<00:04:13.870> get<00:04:13.989> in<00:04:14.170> here<00:04:14.410> with<00:04:14.440> a

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
chop saw I like to get in here with a

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:24.200 
chop saw I like to get in here with a
file<00:04:14.920> and<00:04:15.220> just<00:04:16.120> clean<00:04:16.359> up<00:04:16.389> that<00:04:16.720> cut<00:04:16.959> oh

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.790 

that's<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:25.360> lot<00:04:25.479> better<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:26.020> then<00:04:26.590> I'll<00:04:26.770> also

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
that's a lot better and then I'll also

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.129 
that's a lot better and then I'll also
clean<00:04:27.280> up<00:04:27.310> these<00:04:27.610> sides<00:04:27.940> I'll<00:04:28.720> take<00:04:28.960> that

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
clean up these sides I'll take that

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.870 
clean up these sides I'll take that
flashing<00:04:29.680> off<00:04:29.800> of<00:04:29.950> there<00:04:30.070> to<00:04:30.220> it<00:04:30.400> and<00:04:30.580> then

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
flashing off of there to it and then

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.760 
flashing off of there to it and then
this<00:04:31.060> little<00:04:31.360> piece<00:04:31.510> here<00:04:31.540> that<00:04:31.990> I<00:04:32.350> just<00:04:32.590> had

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
this little piece here that I just had

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.610 
this little piece here that I just had
at<00:04:32.889> the<00:04:32.979> bench<00:04:33.190> vise<00:04:33.430> I<00:04:33.930> had<00:04:34.930> planned<00:04:35.200> to<00:04:35.410> put

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
at the bench vise I had planned to put

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.850 
at the bench vise I had planned to put
that<00:04:35.800> one<00:04:36.010> right<00:04:37.710> in<00:04:38.710> over<00:04:38.860> here<00:04:40.650> see<00:04:41.650> now<00:04:41.680> I

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
that one right in over here see now I

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.879 
that one right in over here see now I
can<00:04:41.950> turn<00:04:42.250> that<00:04:43.200> you<00:04:44.200> can<00:04:44.380> turn<00:04:44.500> that<00:04:44.710> wherever

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
can turn that you can turn that wherever

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.600 
can turn that you can turn that wherever
I<00:04:45.070> want<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.430> and<00:04:45.780> position<00:04:46.780> it<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:47.310> once<00:04:48.310> I<00:04:48.400> got

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
I want to and position it and once I got

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.850 
I want to and position it and once I got
it<00:04:48.760> right<00:04:49.000> where<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:49.210> want<00:04:49.510> and<00:04:50.229> I'll<00:04:50.380> just<00:04:50.590> spot

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
it right where I want and I'll just spot

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.360 
it right where I want and I'll just spot
weld<00:04:51.070> it<00:04:51.250> you<00:04:52.240> know<00:04:52.360> at<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.690> joint<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.169> then<00:04:53.860> I

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
weld it you know at the joint and then I

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.670 
weld it you know at the joint and then I
can<00:04:54.789> continue<00:04:55.210> from<00:04:55.330> there<00:04:55.570> I'll<00:04:55.780> just<00:04:55.840> keep

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
can continue from there I'll just keep

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.190 
can continue from there I'll just keep
putting<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:57.160> pieces<00:04:57.340> together<00:04:57.669> and<00:04:58.120> make<00:04:59.050> the

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
putting the pieces together and make the

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
putting the pieces together and make the
puzzle<00:04:59.530> come<00:04:59.680> together

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
puzzle come together

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.890 
puzzle come together
so<00:05:00.760> the<00:05:00.940> muffler<00:05:01.210> has<00:05:01.300> got<00:05:01.419> a<00:05:01.450> little<00:05:01.600> bit<00:05:01.720> of

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
so the muffler has got a little bit of

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.700 
so the muffler has got a little bit of
cushion<00:05:02.080> in<00:05:02.320> it<00:05:02.610> from<00:05:03.610> that<00:05:03.729> rubber<00:05:03.940> mouth

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
cushion in it from that rubber mouth

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.650 
cushion in it from that rubber mouth
remember<00:05:05.710> I<00:05:05.860> was<00:05:06.010> using<00:05:06.160> that<00:05:06.310> CR<00:05:07.000> 500<00:05:07.479> pipe

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
remember I was using that CR 500 pipe

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.719 
remember I was using that CR 500 pipe
hanger<00:05:08.020> and<00:05:08.680> you<00:05:08.740> can<00:05:08.950> see<00:05:09.130> it<00:05:09.220> right<00:05:09.340> there

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
hanger and you can see it right there

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.550 
hanger and you can see it right there
and<00:05:09.820> you<00:05:09.970> can<00:05:10.090> see<00:05:10.270> also<00:05:10.479> how<00:05:10.750> that<00:05:10.960> bracket

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
and you can see also how that bracket

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.659 
and you can see also how that bracket
turned<00:05:11.919> out<00:05:12.539> pretty<00:05:13.539> simple<00:05:13.960> design<00:05:14.110> really

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
turned out pretty simple design really

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:19.800 
turned out pretty simple design really
so<00:05:16.050> these<00:05:17.050> flanges<00:05:17.940> when<00:05:18.940> I<00:05:18.970> welded<00:05:19.330> them<00:05:19.599> on

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
so these flanges when I welded them on

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.190 
so these flanges when I welded them on
there<00:05:20.050> I<00:05:20.789> well<00:05:21.789> like<00:05:22.060> all<00:05:22.270> of<00:05:22.389> this<00:05:22.479> welding<00:05:22.990> I

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
there I well like all of this welding I

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.020 
there I well like all of this welding I
did<00:05:23.590> off<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:24.010> machine<00:05:24.340> you<00:05:24.639> know<00:05:24.729> I<00:05:24.789> just

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
did off the machine you know I just

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.610 
did off the machine you know I just
tacked<00:05:25.360> it<00:05:25.539> all<00:05:25.660> together<00:05:25.930> piece<00:05:26.380> by<00:05:26.410> piece

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
tacked it all together piece by piece

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.390 
tacked it all together piece by piece
and<00:05:27.599> then<00:05:28.599> I<00:05:28.990> took<00:05:29.440> it<00:05:29.680> off<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:29.830> machine<00:05:30.099> to

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
and then I took it off the machine to

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.810 
and then I took it off the machine to
finish<00:05:30.669> it<00:05:30.820> you<00:05:30.910> know<00:05:31.169> but<00:05:32.169> these<00:05:32.950> flanges<00:05:33.340> I

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
finish it you know but these flanges I

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.420 
finish it you know but these flanges I
didn't<00:05:34.539> want<00:05:34.690> them<00:05:34.930> to<00:05:35.169> warp<00:05:35.919> on<00:05:36.099> me<00:05:36.250> as<00:05:36.400> I

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
didn't want them to warp on me as I

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.780 
didn't want them to warp on me as I
would<00:05:36.700> weld<00:05:36.909> them<00:05:37.090> onto<00:05:37.270> the

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
would weld them onto the

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.820 
would weld them onto the
the<00:05:37.940> tubing<00:05:38.330> so<00:05:38.960> what<00:05:39.140> I<00:05:39.170> would<00:05:39.380> do<00:05:39.500> is<00:05:39.680> I<00:05:39.800> would

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
the tubing so what I would do is I would

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.970 
the tubing so what I would do is I would
take<00:05:40.070> an<00:05:40.250> extra<00:05:40.550> couple<00:05:40.760> of<00:05:40.940> flanges<00:05:41.810> and<00:05:42.020> I

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
take an extra couple of flanges and I

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.800 
take an extra couple of flanges and I
would<00:05:43.130> just<00:05:43.310> stack<00:05:43.520> them<00:05:43.700> you<00:05:44.240> know<00:05:44.330> in<00:05:44.450> behind

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
would just stack them you know in behind

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.240 
would just stack them you know in behind
you<00:05:44.960> now<00:05:45.080> bolt<00:05:45.410> them<00:05:45.590> all<00:05:45.680> together

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
you now bolt them all together

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.610 
you now bolt them all together
so<00:05:46.640> that<00:05:46.820> extra<00:05:47.150> stock<00:05:47.480> you<00:05:48.080> know<00:05:48.200> would<00:05:48.380> help

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
so that extra stock you know would help

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.870 
so that extra stock you know would help
to<00:05:48.860> keep<00:05:49.370> that<00:05:49.550> flange<00:05:50.150> from<00:05:50.360> warping<00:05:50.690> on<00:05:50.960> me

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
to keep that flange from warping on me

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.430 
to keep that flange from warping on me
so<00:05:52.880> a<00:05:52.910> shot<00:05:53.210> from<00:05:53.420> the<00:05:53.600> bottom<00:05:53.930> of<00:05:54.050> the<00:05:54.140> machine

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
so a shot from the bottom of the machine

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.740 
so a shot from the bottom of the machine
this<00:05:54.620> is<00:05:54.680> the<00:05:54.890> factory<00:05:55.340> header<00:05:55.550> and<00:05:55.820> you<00:05:56.600> guys

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
this is the factory header and you guys

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.100 
this is the factory header and you guys
remember<00:05:56.930> a<00:05:57.170> I<00:05:57.500> cut<00:05:57.860> that<00:05:58.040> header<00:05:58.280> off<00:05:58.520> and<00:05:59.110> so

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
remember a I cut that header off and so

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.380 
remember a I cut that header off and so
then<00:06:01.010> I<00:06:01.040> welded<00:06:01.430> the<00:06:01.490> flanges<00:06:01.880> on<00:06:02.060> then<00:06:02.240> it's

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.390

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
ready to accept the exhaust system that

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.660 
ready to accept the exhaust system that
I'm<00:06:04.940> putting<00:06:05.420> together<00:06:05.570> for<00:06:05.900> it<00:06:05.990> now<00:06:06.670> so

here's<00:06:07.850> a<00:06:07.940> shot<00:06:08.240> from<00:06:08.420> the<00:06:08.600> engine<00:06:08.930> bay

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
here's a shot from the engine bay

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.820 
here's a shot from the engine bay
looking<00:06:09.440> down<00:06:09.650> and<00:06:09.950> then<00:06:10.670> you<00:06:10.820> can<00:06:10.940> see<00:06:11.210> that

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
looking down and then you can see that

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.670 
looking down and then you can see that
header<00:06:13.060> down<00:06:14.060> in<00:06:14.330> there<00:06:14.510> and<00:06:14.720> the<00:06:15.230> two<00:06:15.410> flanges

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
header down in there and the two flanges

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.610 
header down in there and the two flanges
you<00:06:16.520> can<00:06:16.700> kind<00:06:16.910> of<00:06:16.940> see<00:06:17.150> how<00:06:17.300> that<00:06:17.440> starts<00:06:18.440> to

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
you can kind of see how that starts to

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.030 
you can kind of see how that starts to
wrap<00:06:18.800> around<00:06:18.830> inside<00:06:19.610> there<00:06:20.680> so<00:06:21.680> anyways

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.040 
wrap around inside there so anyways

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.340 
wrap around inside there so anyways
that's<00:06:22.280> a<00:06:22.430> start<00:06:22.820> got<00:06:23.690> half<00:06:23.870> the<00:06:23.900> exhaust

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.350 
that's a start got half the exhaust

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.310 
that's a start got half the exhaust
system<00:06:24.530> done<00:06:24.920> and<00:06:25.420> left<00:06:26.420> side<00:06:26.630> to<00:06:26.810> do<00:06:26.900> yet<00:06:27.110> but

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
system done and left side to do yet but
