00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
okay so now we've got this propeller we

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.960 
okay so now we've got this propeller we
need<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:03.659> do<00:00:03.750> something<00:00:04.110> with<00:00:04.200> it<00:00:04.640> so<00:00:05.640> first<00:00:05.910> of

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
need to do something with it so first of

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.070 
need to do something with it so first of
all<00:00:06.029> we<00:00:06.120> need<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.299> bring<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.540> airplane<00:00:06.899> back

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
all we need to bring the airplane back

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.299 
all we need to bring the airplane back
so<00:00:07.230> we<00:00:07.319> can<00:00:07.410> position<00:00:07.589> this<00:00:07.890> so<00:00:08.099> we're<00:00:08.220> going

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
so we can position this so we're going

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.180 
so we can position this so we're going
to<00:00:08.370> go<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:09.380> display<00:00:10.460> show<00:00:11.460> all<00:00:13.009> airplane<00:00:14.009> comes

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
to go to display show all airplane comes

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.640 
to go to display show all airplane comes
back<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.670> then<00:00:15.330> we<00:00:15.480> need<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.660> position<00:00:16.109> and

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
back and then we need to position and

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.260 
back and then we need to position and
resize<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:18.000> first<00:00:18.390> repellent<00:00:19.310> so<00:00:20.310> we'll<00:00:21.150> do

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
resize this first repellent so we'll do

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.630 
resize this first repellent so we'll do
this<00:00:21.359> in<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.600> front<00:00:21.840> view<00:00:21.990> as<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.710> seems<00:00:23.430> to

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
this in the front view as that seems to

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.609 
this in the front view as that seems to
be<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:24.539> best<00:00:24.750> sort<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.050> place<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.439> do<00:00:25.590> this

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
be the best sort of place to do this

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.639 
be the best sort of place to do this
okay<00:00:28.619> I'm<00:00:28.890> just<00:00:29.099> gonna<00:00:29.279> move<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.929> here

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.930 

and<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.739> can<00:00:34.920> see<00:00:35.070> already<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.520> that's<00:00:35.670> way

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
and I can see already that that's way

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.330 
and I can see already that that's way
too<00:00:35.969> big<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.840> I'm<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:37.739> gonna<00:00:37.860> scale<00:00:38.309> this

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
too big so I'm just gonna scale this

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.510 
too big so I'm just gonna scale this
down<00:00:40.879> position<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.000> again<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:43.160> little<00:00:44.160> bit<00:00:44.280> too

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
down position it again a little bit too

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.979 
down position it again a little bit too
big<00:00:44.760> now<00:00:44.940> not<00:00:45.149> too<00:00:45.360> far<00:00:45.660> away<00:00:47.450> and<00:00:48.450> put<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.840> in

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
big now not too far away and put that in

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.010 
big now not too far away and put that in
place

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
place

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.660 
place
in<00:00:51.530> fact<00:00:51.740> I'm<00:00:51.890> gonna<00:00:51.980> scale<00:00:52.220> it<00:00:52.250> down<00:00:52.400> a<00:00:52.520> little

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
in fact I'm gonna scale it down a little

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.090 
in fact I'm gonna scale it down a little
bit<00:00:52.820> further<00:00:53.060> I<00:00:53.560> just<00:00:54.560> hope<00:00:54.680> it's<00:00:54.830> sticking

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
bit further I just hope it's sticking

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.820 
bit further I just hope it's sticking
out<00:00:55.280> a<00:00:55.340> little<00:00:55.610> bit<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.260> I'll<00:00:57.260> have<00:00:57.380> that<00:00:57.530> just

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
out a little bit so I'll have that just

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.570 
out a little bit so I'll have that just
like<00:00:57.980> that<00:00:58.160> so<00:00:59.030> that<00:00:59.060> is<00:00:59.390> now<00:00:59.660> propeller<00:01:00.170> one

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
like that so that is now propeller one

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.800 
like that so that is now propeller one
in<00:01:01.580> place<00:01:01.820> as<00:01:02.000> far<00:01:02.150> as<00:01:02.210> a<00:01:02.330> front<00:01:02.570> view<00:01:02.690> is

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
in place as far as a front view is

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.840 
in place as far as a front view is
concerned<00:01:03.200> anyway<00:01:03.530> we<00:01:04.280> just<00:01:04.430> need<00:01:04.550> to<00:01:04.640> sort

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
concerned anyway we just need to sort

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.170 
concerned anyway we just need to sort
out<00:01:04.910> the<00:01:05.059> side<00:01:05.300> view<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:05.780> Oh<00:01:06.820> undo<00:01:07.820> that<00:01:07.970> I

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
out the side view so Oh undo that I

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.360 
out the side view so Oh undo that I
don't<00:01:08.390> want<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:08.570> scale<00:01:08.810> to<00:01:08.990> alone<00:01:09.250> I'm<00:01:10.250> just

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
don't want the scale to alone I'm just

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.290 
don't want the scale to alone I'm just
gonna<00:01:10.520> move<00:01:10.790> that<00:01:11.120> to<00:01:11.990> here<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:13.460> that<00:01:14.060> seems

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
gonna move that to here and that seems

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.630 
gonna move that to here and that seems
to<00:01:14.390> be<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.540> right<00:01:14.690> place<00:01:14.810> there<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:15.550> there<00:01:16.550> we

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
to be the right place there so there we

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.050 
to be the right place there so there we
go<00:01:16.670> that<00:01:16.880> is<00:01:16.910> now<00:01:17.620> one<00:01:18.620> propeller<00:01:18.940> put<00:01:19.940> in

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
go that is now one propeller put in

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.300 
go that is now one propeller put in
place<00:01:20.270> if<00:01:20.990> we<00:01:21.110> have<00:01:21.260> a<00:01:21.290> look<00:01:21.440> at<00:01:21.560> it<00:01:21.650> here<00:01:21.830> we

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
place if we have a look at it here we

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.090 
place if we have a look at it here we
can<00:01:22.340> see<00:01:22.730> that<00:01:23.950> yeah

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
can see that yeah

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.530 
can see that yeah
that's<00:01:25.280> not<00:01:25.430> looking<00:01:25.550> too<00:01:25.850> bad<00:01:26.620> okay<00:01:27.970> so<00:01:28.970> it

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
that's not looking too bad okay so it

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.460 
that's not looking too bad okay so it
does<00:01:29.660> look<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.869> little<00:01:29.930> bit<00:01:30.080> at<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.410> moment

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
does look a little bit at the moment

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.740 
does look a little bit at the moment
we've<00:01:30.800> just<00:01:30.950> won<00:01:31.100> there<00:01:31.369> so<00:01:32.210> we'd<00:01:32.570> better

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
we've just won there so we'd better

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.660 
we've just won there so we'd better
duplicate<00:01:33.290> this<00:01:33.470> now<00:01:33.740> for<00:01:34.160> this<00:01:34.369> I'm<00:01:34.610> just

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
duplicate this now for this I'm just

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.760 
duplicate this now for this I'm just
gonna<00:01:34.880> hide<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.300> body<00:01:35.479> of<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.690> plane<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:36.229> they

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
gonna hide the body of the plane so they

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.730 
gonna hide the body of the plane so they
doesn't<00:01:37.040> get<00:01:37.130> in<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.220> way<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:37.400> ctrl<00:01:37.880> +<00:01:38.060> H<00:01:38.210> again

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
doesn't get in the way so ctrl + H again

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.620 
doesn't get in the way so ctrl + H again
and<00:01:39.740> then<00:01:39.950> I'm<00:01:40.160> gonna<00:01:40.280> select<00:01:40.520> this<00:01:40.850> propeller

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
and then I'm gonna select this propeller

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.780 
and then I'm gonna select this propeller
here<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:42.680> what<00:01:42.800> I<00:01:42.830> want<00:01:43.010> to<00:01:43.100> do<00:01:43.220> is<00:01:43.460> just<00:01:43.640> move

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
here and what I want to do is just move

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.640 
here and what I want to do is just move
the<00:01:43.970> pivot<00:01:44.210> point<00:01:44.600> which<00:01:44.960> is<00:01:45.110> a<00:01:45.140> point<00:01:45.440> around

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
the pivot point which is a point around

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.160 
the pivot point which is a point around
which<00:01:46.010> it<00:01:46.190> rotates<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:47.420> be<00:01:47.540> at<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.720> center<00:01:48.080> of

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
which it rotates to be at the center of

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.310 
which it rotates to be at the center of
this<00:01:48.290> cone<00:01:48.729> now<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:49.790> do<00:01:50.000> this<00:01:50.210> I'm<00:01:51.080> gonna<00:01:51.200> go

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
this cone now to do this I'm gonna go

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.530 
this cone now to do this I'm gonna go
into<00:01:51.470> my<00:01:51.530> front<00:01:51.830> view<00:01:51.890> where<00:01:52.729> I<00:01:52.760> can<00:01:52.970> see<00:01:53.180> a

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
into my front view where I can see a

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.240 
into my front view where I can see a
wireframe<00:01:54.229> which<00:01:54.619> is<00:01:54.890> going<00:01:54.979> to<00:01:55.039> be<00:01:55.160> very

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
wireframe which is going to be very

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.690 
wireframe which is going to be very
helpful<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:57.320> get<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:58.039> your<00:01:58.160> pivot<00:01:58.429> point

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
helpful and to get to your pivot point

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.029

okay<00:02:17.439> well<00:02:17.650> we<00:02:17.829> don't<00:02:17.860> we<00:02:18.220> don't<00:02:18.400> need<00:02:18.489> it<00:02:18.640> to

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
okay well we don't we don't need it to

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.910 
okay well we don't we don't need it to
do<00:02:18.819> that<00:02:19.000> although<00:02:19.480> that<00:02:19.780> should<00:02:19.989> work

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
do that although that should work

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.830 
do that although that should work
I'll<00:02:21.370> just<00:02:21.579> position<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.180> by<00:02:22.329> eye<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.540> the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
I'll just position it by eye to the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.020 
I'll just position it by eye to the
center<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.519> this<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:26.140> nose<00:02:26.379> count<00:02:27.030> it's

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
center of this this nose count it's

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.670 
center of this this nose count it's
important<00:02:28.480> really<00:02:28.689> that<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:28.840> get<00:02:29.049> as<00:02:29.200> close<00:02:29.470> as

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
important really that I get as close as

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.330 
important really that I get as close as
possible<00:02:31.079> so<00:02:32.079> that<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.319> rotations<00:02:32.950> will<00:02:33.159> work

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
possible so that the rotations will work

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.849 
possible so that the rotations will work
and<00:02:33.609> it<00:02:33.670> won't<00:02:33.819> look<00:02:33.970> odd<00:02:36.840> when<00:02:37.840> it's<00:02:37.989> animated

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
and it won't look odd when it's animated

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.540 
and it won't look odd when it's animated
later

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.020 

okay<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.110> takes<00:02:43.260> care<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.970> then

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
okay so that takes care of that and then

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.970 
okay so that takes care of that and then
just<00:02:45.450> press<00:02:45.840> insert<00:02:46.200> again<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.620> come<00:02:46.770> out<00:02:46.890> of

just press insert again to come out of

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.180 
just press insert again to come out of
that<00:02:47.100> tool<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.720> then<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:49.200> can<00:02:49.350> press<00:02:49.560> ctrl<00:02:49.620> +

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
that tool and then you can press ctrl +

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.180

D<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.370> duplicate<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.060> shape<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:52.020> then<00:02:52.920> move

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
D to duplicate the shape and then move

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.000 
D to duplicate the shape and then move
to<00:02:53.220> your<00:02:53.340> rotate<00:02:53.730> tool<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.870> rotate<00:02:55.110> out<00:02:55.620> a

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
to your rotate tool and rotate out a

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.200 
to your rotate tool and rotate out a
copy<00:02:56.490> of<00:02:56.670> that<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.230> it<00:02:58.230> needs<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.680> move<00:03:01.610> -<00:03:02.610> 90

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
copy of that and it needs to move - 90

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.090 
copy of that and it needs to move - 90
degrees<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.830> then<00:03:05.130> ctrl<00:03:05.640> D<00:03:06.680> do<00:03:07.680> that<00:03:07.860> again

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
degrees and then ctrl D do that again

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.740 
degrees and then ctrl D do that again
rotate<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.090> out<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.790> this<00:03:11.940> is<00:03:12.000> gonna<00:03:12.120> be<00:03:12.330> minus

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
rotate it out and this is gonna be minus

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.570 
rotate it out and this is gonna be minus
180<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:15.420> then<00:03:16.380> just<00:03:16.680> for<00:03:16.830> this<00:03:16.950> one<00:03:17.190> I'll

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
180 and then just for this one I'll

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.810 
180 and then just for this one I'll
duplicate<00:03:18.120> from<00:03:18.300> here<00:03:18.660> ctrl<00:03:19.440> D<00:03:19.800> go<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.760> other

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
duplicate from here ctrl D go the other

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.260 
duplicate from here ctrl D go the other
way<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.390> that's<00:03:22.380> going<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.740> be<00:03:22.890> just<00:03:23.220> if<00:03:24.180> I

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
way and that's going to be just if I

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.690 
way and that's going to be just if I
don't<00:03:24.420> do<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.720> that's<00:03:24.930> going<00:03:25.110> wrong<00:03:25.700> just

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
don't do that that's going wrong just

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.020 
don't do that that's going wrong just
this<00:03:26.850> one<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.480> on<00:03:27.990> the<00:03:28.140> z-axis<00:03:28.430> is<00:03:29.430> gonna<00:03:29.790> be

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
this one and on the z-axis is gonna be

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.380 
this one and on the z-axis is gonna be
90<00:03:31.490> there<00:03:32.490> we<00:03:32.550> go<00:03:32.670> I<00:03:32.700> now<00:03:32.940> have<00:03:33.180> four

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
90 there we go I now have four

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.470 
90 there we go I now have four
propellers<00:03:34.080> on<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.220> front<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.490> my<00:03:35.580> plane

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.180 

there<00:03:39.480> we<00:03:39.570> go<00:03:39.690> so<00:03:39.870> that's<00:03:39.990> now<00:03:40.170> looking<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.770> lot

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
there we go so that's now looking a lot

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.020 
there we go so that's now looking a lot
better<00:03:42.590> what<00:03:43.590> I'm<00:03:43.710> gonna<00:03:44.040> do<00:03:44.190> finally<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:44.910> I'm

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
better what I'm gonna do finally is I'm

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.360 
better what I'm gonna do finally is I'm
gonna<00:03:45.150> parent<00:03:45.720> these<00:03:46.530> propellers<00:03:47.070> to<00:03:47.100> the

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
gonna parent these propellers to the

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.250 
gonna parent these propellers to the
nose<00:03:47.550> cone<00:03:47.790> which<00:03:47.970> means<00:03:48.180> if<00:03:48.300> I<00:03:48.510> ever<00:03:48.690> animate

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
nose cone which means if I ever animate

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.910 
nose cone which means if I ever animate
the<00:03:49.350> nose<00:03:49.530> cone<00:03:49.830> which<00:03:50.550> I<00:03:50.670> will<00:03:50.820> do<00:03:50.970> later

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
the nose cone which I will do later

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.100 
the nose cone which I will do later
these<00:03:52.920> will<00:03:53.190> all<00:03:53.400> follow<00:03:53.940> it<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.720> will<00:03:54.930> work

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
these will all follow it and will work

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.740 
these will all follow it and will work
as<00:03:55.320> a<00:03:55.350> propeller<00:03:55.680> should<00:03:56.420> so<00:03:57.420> what<00:03:57.570> I'm<00:03:57.660> gonna

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
as a propeller should so what I'm gonna

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.430 
as a propeller should so what I'm gonna
do<00:03:57.990> is<00:03:58.200> just<00:03:59.420> shift<00:04:00.420> select<00:04:00.840> all<00:04:01.110> four<00:04:01.410> of

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
do is just shift select all four of

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.260 
do is just shift select all four of
these<00:04:01.790> to<00:04:02.790> make<00:04:02.880> sure<00:04:03.000> I've<00:04:03.090> got<00:04:03.120> them

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
these to make sure I've got them

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.630 
these to make sure I've got them
selected<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:03.900> then<00:04:04.590> shift<00:04:04.980> select<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.400> cone

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
selected and then shift select the cone

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.400 
selected and then shift select the cone
make<00:04:05.880> sure<00:04:06.000> I<00:04:06.060> get<00:04:06.180> that<00:04:06.330> last<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:06.959> press<00:04:07.170> P

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
make sure I get that last and press P

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.520 
make sure I get that last and press P
and<00:04:08.130> now<00:04:09.090> whenever<00:04:09.360> I<00:04:09.510> select<00:04:09.600> that<00:04:09.900> cone<00:04:10.260> I

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
and now whenever I select that cone I

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.390 
and now whenever I select that cone I
will<00:04:11.310> select<00:04:11.459> everything<00:04:11.959> yep<00:04:12.990> and<00:04:13.200> then<00:04:14.160> when

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
will select everything yep and then when

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.289 
will select everything yep and then when
I<00:04:14.490> use<00:04:14.610> my<00:04:14.760> rotate<00:04:15.090> tool<00:04:15.680> there<00:04:16.680> we<00:04:16.799> go

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
I use my rotate tool there we go

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.360 
I use my rotate tool there we go
I've<00:04:18.299> got<00:04:18.540> some<00:04:18.780> propellers<00:04:19.290> yeah<00:04:19.890> I'm<00:04:20.250> gonna

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
I've got some propellers yeah I'm gonna

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.599 
I've got some propellers yeah I'm gonna
go

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
go

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.869 
go
it<00:04:22.509> looks<00:04:22.659> like<00:04:22.780> it<00:04:22.900> could<00:04:23.020> really<00:04:23.199> fly

00:04:23.869 --> 00:04:23.879 
it looks like it could really fly

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.339 
it looks like it could really fly
awesomeness<00:04:24.879> okay<00:04:25.539> so<00:04:25.599> I<00:04:25.750> want<00:04:25.900> to<00:04:25.990> undo<00:04:26.229> that

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
awesomeness okay so I want to undo that

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.589 
awesomeness okay so I want to undo that
because<00:04:26.560> that's<00:04:26.710> now<00:04:26.800> a<00:04:26.830> messy<00:04:27.300> bring<00:04:28.300> back<00:04:28.479> my

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
because that's now a messy bring back my

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:34.670 
because that's now a messy bring back my
plane<00:04:28.860> display<00:04:29.860> show<00:04:30.580> all<00:04:31.110> tada<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:33.659> that

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
plane display show all tada and that

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.990 
plane display show all tada and that
he's<00:04:35.680> looking<00:04:35.710> damn<00:04:36.490> sexy<00:04:37.379> very<00:04:38.379> sexy<00:04:39.000> finally

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
he's looking damn sexy very sexy finally

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.209 
he's looking damn sexy very sexy finally
what<00:04:40.120> I'm<00:04:40.210> gonna<00:04:40.300> do<00:04:40.539> is<00:04:40.840> parent<00:04:41.650> everything

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:42.219 
what I'm gonna do is parent everything

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:44.969 
what I'm gonna do is parent everything
to<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.490> plane<00:04:42.729> so<00:04:43.110> that<00:04:44.110> if<00:04:44.319> I<00:04:44.469> want<00:04:44.740> to<00:04:44.830> move

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
to the plane so that if I want to move

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.080 
to the plane so that if I want to move
the<00:04:45.099> plane<00:04:45.280> around<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.610> propeller<00:04:45.909> will

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
the plane around the propeller will

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.670 
the plane around the propeller will
follow<00:04:46.300> that<00:04:46.509> so<00:04:46.840> select<00:04:47.259> the<00:04:47.349> propeller

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
follow that so select the propeller

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.730 
follow that so select the propeller
shift<00:04:48.520> select<00:04:48.759> the<00:04:48.909> plane<00:04:49.150> press<00:04:49.990> P<00:04:50.199> again<00:04:50.469> and

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
shift select the plane press P again and

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.749 
shift select the plane press P again and
we<00:04:51.550> are<00:04:51.789> in<00:04:52.120> action<00:04:52.689> so<00:04:52.840> I've<00:04:52.930> now<00:04:53.050> got<00:04:53.259> a<00:04:53.289> plane

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
we are in action so I've now got a plane

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.269 
we are in action so I've now got a plane
that<00:04:54.759> will<00:04:55.180> move<00:04:55.330> around<00:04:55.949> there<00:04:56.949> you<00:04:57.009> go<00:04:57.129> look

00:04:57.269 --> 00:04:57.279 
that will move around there you go look

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.689 
that will move around there you go look
at<00:04:57.400> that

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
at that

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.110 
at that
ha<00:04:57.939> like<00:04:58.270> real<00:04:58.479> life<00:04:58.689> undo<00:04:59.500> that<00:04:59.680> and<00:05:00.120> a

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
ha like real life undo that and a

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.119 
ha like real life undo that and a
propeller<00:05:01.539> that<00:05:02.199> when<00:05:02.349> I<00:05:02.379> have<00:05:02.529> my<00:05:02.560> rotate<00:05:03.009> to

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:03.129 
propeller that when I have my rotate to

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:05.999 
propeller that when I have my rotate to
alarm<00:05:03.400> there<00:05:04.300> you<00:05:04.360> go<00:05:04.479> now<00:05:04.930> I<00:05:04.960> rotate<00:05:05.379> looking

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
alarm there you go now I rotate looking

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.550 
alarm there you go now I rotate looking
pretty<00:05:06.279> damn<00:05:06.430> good<00:05:07.110> okay<00:05:08.110> I<00:05:08.139> suppose<00:05:08.379> that

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
pretty damn good okay I suppose that

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.550 
pretty damn good okay I suppose that
muddling<00:05:08.860> goes<00:05:09.099> then<00:05:09.990> these<00:05:10.990> videos<00:05:11.379> have

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
muddling goes then these videos have

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.469 
muddling goes then these videos have
done<00:05:11.710> there<00:05:12.340> are<00:05:12.490> still<00:05:12.729> some<00:05:12.939> details<00:05:13.389> that

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
done there are still some details that

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.820 
done there are still some details that
I've<00:05:13.659> not<00:05:13.870> put<00:05:14.050> on<00:05:14.169> if<00:05:14.379> you<00:05:14.529> look<00:05:14.650> at<00:05:14.770> the

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
I've not put on if you look at the

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.119 
I've not put on if you look at the
pictures<00:05:15.250> we've<00:05:15.460> got<00:05:16.379> let's<00:05:17.379> have<00:05:17.860> a<00:05:17.889> look<00:05:18.039> at

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:18.129 
pictures we've got let's have a look at

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:21.749 
pictures we've got let's have a look at
one<00:05:18.219> of<00:05:18.250> one<00:05:18.639> of<00:05:18.669> these<00:05:18.819> pictures<00:05:20.550> we've<00:05:21.550> still

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
one of one of these pictures we've still

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.390 
one of one of these pictures we've still
got<00:05:21.909> some<00:05:22.180> details<00:05:22.860> these<00:05:23.860> little<00:05:24.189> things

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
got some details these little things

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.279 
got some details these little things
here<00:05:24.789> I've<00:05:25.330> not<00:05:25.479> modelled<00:05:25.719> on<00:05:25.779> little<00:05:26.020> spikes

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
here I've not modelled on little spikes

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:27.360 
here I've not modelled on little spikes
on<00:05:26.500> the<00:05:26.620> wings<00:05:26.800> I<00:05:26.949> don't<00:05:27.099> know<00:05:27.159> if<00:05:27.219> they're

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
on the wings I don't know if they're

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.579 
on the wings I don't know if they're
guns<00:05:27.580> little<00:05:28.210> engineer<00:05:28.779> chaps<00:05:29.050> here<00:05:29.259> think

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:29.589 
guns little engineer chaps here think

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:31.439 
guns little engineer chaps here think
they're<00:05:29.710> exhaust<00:05:30.129> a<00:05:30.580> little<00:05:30.879> air<00:05:31.210> wheel<00:05:31.330> on

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
they're exhaust a little air wheel on

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.420 
they're exhaust a little air wheel on
top<00:05:31.690> so<00:05:32.259> there<00:05:32.379> are<00:05:32.500> some<00:05:32.650> details<00:05:33.069> that<00:05:33.370> you

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
top so there are some details that you

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.010 
top so there are some details that you
could<00:05:33.610> put<00:05:33.729> on<00:05:33.759> your<00:05:33.849> version<00:05:34.449> and<00:05:35.319> I<00:05:37.020> might

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
could put on your version and I might

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.329 
could put on your version and I might
put<00:05:38.229> those<00:05:38.379> on<00:05:38.560> before<00:05:38.830> I<00:05:38.860> go<00:05:39.039> on<00:05:39.159> to<00:05:39.190> the

00:05:39.329 --> 00:05:39.339 
put those on before I go on to the

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.700 
put those on before I go on to the
texturing<00:05:39.789> section<00:05:40.150> of<00:05:40.240> this<00:05:40.330> exercise<00:05:40.839> we've

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
texturing section of this exercise we've

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.649 
texturing section of this exercise we've
got<00:05:41.830> some<00:05:42.069> air<00:05:42.279> intakes<00:05:42.849> here<00:05:43.150> one<00:05:43.449> on<00:05:43.479> the

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:43.659 
got some air intakes here one on the

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:45.600 
got some air intakes here one on the
bottom<00:05:43.810> I'm<00:05:44.440> gonna<00:05:44.680> leave<00:05:44.860> those<00:05:45.039> off<00:05:45.069> just<00:05:45.279> to

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
bottom I'm gonna leave those off just to

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.490 
bottom I'm gonna leave those off just to
keep<00:05:45.729> it<00:05:45.909> simple<00:05:46.089> but<00:05:46.990> you<00:05:47.080> could<00:05:47.259> put<00:05:47.379> those

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
keep it simple but you could put those

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.779 
keep it simple but you could put those
in<00:05:47.740> if<00:05:47.979> you<00:05:48.069> feeling<00:05:48.339> ambitious<00:05:50.219> other<00:05:51.219> than

in if you feeling ambitious other than

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:53.790 
in if you feeling ambitious other than
that<00:05:51.969> I'd<00:05:52.389> like<00:05:52.599> to<00:05:52.629> see<00:05:52.870> what<00:05:53.080> you<00:05:53.169> create<00:05:53.349> so
