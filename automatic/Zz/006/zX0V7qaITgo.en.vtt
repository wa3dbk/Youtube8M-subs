 It is featured in the

 With the background of declining and aging fishermen, Miyakejima is calling for fishermen's successors from outside the island 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:18.049
 I started trying 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.049

 And drawn a great interest to those of feeling that make a living by selling it to eat taking the nature of things 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:55.110
 The referee is fond of being treated because it was a pity 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:57.260
 I thought I wanted to graduate from university and become a fisherman 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.220
 But it's not a game that was gone in the phone 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.730
 Pfizer 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.070
 Get a little bit drunk a

 In Miyakejima, an artificial 2,700 people or more, both of them are 36 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.760
 Hmm 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.659
 Nearly 40% of them are over 70 years old and the average age is 62 years old 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.990
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.380
 Long material 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.970
 Ika to be whether the previous 10 years in 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.720
 Nde do not know really 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:53.740

 Miyakejima fishery is as one of the initiatives launched in July measures Executive Committee 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.880
 We carried out short-term training 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.550
 After all , the work of Miyakejima 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.780

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.970
 Anyway today 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:16.319
 Doing bottom fishing has been doing doing the Ocycrius japonicus spawn of Miyake of catch 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:21.230
 It accounts for a good proportion of time 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:23.940
 So to go Yappa eat and use in Miyake of this woman Large 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:29.160
 I think that is a great teacher 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:34.760
 Find a school of fish with a detector while the captain is reading the tide 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.410
 We will drop the device for opening a store about 400 meters below 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.280
 Various 6 doors 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.370
 Do you not know the details coming? 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.440
 Kabuki immediately, such wonder his high Saka' 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.620
 Japan's best 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.620
 The trainee challenged to raise this 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.190
 It looks simple at first glance, but in practice 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:05.470
 There are not many slippery slimy three 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:09.190
 Sapana falls into the battlefield while struggling 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:13.240
 A hook was caught in driving 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:17.970
 It's hard to get wet when I give something 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:21.060
 It's interesting so it's hard to come back from there, but a little 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.220
 I have taken care of that 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.890
 After work and play 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.480
 You are increasing 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.640
 Thats different sister's how to make one at all 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.990
 me 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:37.030
 Also lifting the fish pull the the running speed and the wisdom ship 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.370
 I also experienced Okinawa 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:46.150
 5 catch the fish while moving the full 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.150
 It seems that these tasks are usually done alone 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:55.560
 Mr. Nakamura and Mr. Yokoyama are in fourth graders 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:58.490
 Do not you think about employment to private enterprise ? 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.920
 Unofficial decision also a little one one one one one one one 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.200
 I can say it's a shame 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.290
 No matter 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.030
 By'm the better was Kotoya' you want to do 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.370
 After all 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.160
 Receiving company 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.370
 3 years when I thought 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:20.209
 I wonder if 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:22.460
 After all, in not a motivation Magara also progressed selection if there are eight 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.380
 Taken had little and worrying endlessly 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:29.340
 Because it was 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:35.780
 Making a living as a fisherman is not so easy 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:41.960
 About 6 hours of fishing this day and about 70 kg of landing 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:44.200
 It means that it is about 22,000 yen that the fisherman's hand-in-hand is deducted the commission and the shipping cost etc. 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:52.860
 is 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:52.860
 On the other hand, if it hits, it is also said that it may earn one year's worth of other fishermen by a single amount . 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:03.550
 Many of Miyakejima's fishermen work side by side like tourism and agriculture 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:06.480
 Evacuation everywhere I went to nationwide it's seaweed I mean fisherman if Nai' is 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.480
 Can love 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.100
 I think this is attractive 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.230
 By inclination 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.580
 Discussions in the interior 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:20.120
 Well if the person is motivated, it is best if I try it, but I received a personal cabin 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:25.600
 If you don't feel like you're at work 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.600
 I 'm a person who is going to set up for nothing 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:36.569
 Entertained 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:38.600
 The fishermen's cooperative will continue to provide one to three years of long-term training for fishermen 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:45.110
 is 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:50.110
 By learning technology under the two parents who aim to become independent in the future 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.110
 We provide support in housing and daily life 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.860
 me 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:56.860
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:06.639
 The bar b que was held in the harbor last night of the training 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:12.669
 Looking at the fishermen 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:14.590
 I can see how I work with great energy and I can work forever with this kind of feeling 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.990
 Say be nice Once 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.660
 The thought was necessary 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.860
 One person 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:26.080
 Aiming for the day to be 2 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:31.129
 And I wonder if I do go to do a thing called fishing 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:35.409
 I heard that I could only earn what I did if I did it 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:40.300
 I think it would not be possible in a year, but on the boat 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:42.550
 If you're looking at it like that, that moth 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.770
 I think that a return will come 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.200
 Fisherman 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:50.060
 I want to be a color 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:55.160
 And this experience is more than anything 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:59.320
 I was thought Naa both City also or burn that you are not doing this 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:07.890
 I think I want to do it by all means if there is an opportunity 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:07.890
 MAY fisherman is born responsible for the work of Miyakejima from among them future
