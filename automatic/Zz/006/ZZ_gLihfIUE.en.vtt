three they've run out of plot points we
get<00:01:40.330> a<00:01:40.390> little<00:01:40.540> backstory<00:01:41.170> maybe<00:01:41.439> we<00:01:41.560> have

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
get a little backstory maybe we have

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.230 
get a little backstory maybe we have
sympathy<00:01:42.159> for<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.400> villain<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:42.820> he<00:01:42.880> says<00:01:43.090> how

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
sympathy for the villain and he says how

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.789 
sympathy for the villain and he says how
he<00:01:43.360> started<00:01:43.689> out<00:01:43.780> in<00:01:43.960> his<00:01:44.020> relationship<00:01:44.650> he

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
he started out in his relationship he

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:45.929 
he started out in his relationship he
thought<00:01:45.009> he<00:01:45.159> was<00:01:45.280> always<00:01:45.430> gonna<00:01:45.610> be<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.909> guy

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
thought he was always gonna be the guy

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.850 
thought he was always gonna be the guy
that<00:01:46.090> was<00:01:46.420> faithful<00:01:47.140> in<00:01:47.200> his<00:01:47.229> relationship

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
that was faithful in his relationship

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.460 
that was faithful in his relationship
that<00:01:48.040> lasts<00:01:48.280> maybe<00:01:48.579> like<00:01:48.880> two<00:01:49.150> years<00:01:49.540> and<00:01:49.750> it

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
that lasts maybe like two years and it

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.960 
that lasts maybe like two years and it
maybe<00:01:50.619> it<00:01:50.740> would<00:01:50.829> be<00:01:50.860> different<00:01:50.950> if<00:01:51.490> he<00:01:51.790> was

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
maybe it would be different if he was

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.330 
maybe it would be different if he was
excited<00:01:52.329> to<00:01:53.020> go<00:01:53.200> home<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.740> this<00:01:53.860> person<00:01:54.280> he

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
yourself into situations where it's a

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.820 
yourself into situations where it's a
