00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
little bit differently um sometimes the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.490 
little bit differently um sometimes the
sound<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.579> knowledge<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.119> same<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:37.350> it's

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
sound of knowledge the same so it's

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.260 
sound of knowledge the same so it's
important<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.549> gives<00:01:38.850> your<00:01:38.970> team<00:01:39.030> the
