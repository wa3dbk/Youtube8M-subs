00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.989
 live it 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.600
 but wim delvoye was not limited 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:08.519
 pigs meanwhile the Belgian has 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:18.570
 expanded his mammal collection 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:21.089
 tattooed of a specimen with two legs I 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.499
 am the support of a work of art but 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.409
 when I'm dressed nobody will 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:26.490
 doubt and this is not to displease me 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:28.109
 it's not written on my face 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.060
 but as soon as people see my back 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.820
 in its entirety then most 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.260
 understand what it's all about and that's 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.800
 sometimes a little heavy never 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.800
 to be able to get rid of it 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.809
 at the beginning, however, nothing predestined 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.750
 team steiner to become a work of art 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.489
 in 2006 because he knows 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.170
 well the middle of the tattoo in zurich 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.609
 he had been instructed to find a 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.030
 volunteer for an artistic project 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.989
 unusual launched by wim delvoye 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.699
 but the young man was so 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.589
 excited about the concept he has 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.179
 decided to put his own body to the 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:05.040
 arrangement of the artist visit at the 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:09.079
 tattoo artist who transposed the drawings of 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.079
 wim delvoye on the back of tim steiner 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:15.270
 it was not a fun part of 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.740
 tattoo process was very long that 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.780
 lasted hours of days of weeks 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.319
 whole and the pain was very 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.020
 intense 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:23.250
 it was really very unpleasant in 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.719
 done i was confronted to myself 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.950
 for a long time and I have 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:27.950
 found it really painful 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.670
 the tattoo imagined by wim delvoye 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.650
 had to cover the entire back of steam 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.390
 the young man has spent tens 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.390
 hours in the salon demat power 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.960
 during the first mata sessions first 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.970
 stitch outlines 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.720
 for tim steiner this tattoo has been a 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.460
 extreme experience against the tattoo artist and 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.290
 me a very strong intimacy was created 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.780
 and also a huge confidence 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.100
 the tattoo lasted almost 40 hours and 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.570
 during all this time I did not see 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.680
 what was happening in my back I did not 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.600
 did not know what he was doing 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.980
 do I trust him I 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.210
 counted on him to be in a good 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.430
 day and do a good job 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.110
 at the end of the session had always been 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.170
 relief when they told me this is 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.520
 well it's over look what it's like 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.920
 but the pain was really intense 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.540
 and I'm proud to have arrived there even though 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.070
 proud is probably not the right term 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.870
 because many times I had 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.410
 afraid not to hold on 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.180
 go to the end but eventually I have 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.100
 successful and it's really cool I'm 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.590
 happy 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.470
 June 2006 is the last straight line 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.820
 for wim delvoye 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.260
 the artist presents his performance in 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.960
 a zurich art gallery 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.890
 the tattoo of steam is over under 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.370
 the eyes of the public 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:01.240
 the young man is then exposed examined 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.590
 admire wim delvoye was successful 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.240
 his living work of art is all the rage 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.310
 yet the motive that adorns the back of 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.290
 steam is the same as that of sybille 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.290
 a sow today in payet 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.819
 the work of art he wears on his back and 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.489
 baptized like him team 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.819
 he is then 31 years old and from that 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.140
 moment 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.140
 his life changes dramatically 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.700
 normally if things had 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.530
 stopped the team would have stayed all his 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.100
 life a good musician with a pretty 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.690
 tattoo but it happened something 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.870
 thing that made him a work of art 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.040
 and that's what's interesting this is 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.140
 no less than they did team 9 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.560
 hrs of trees but the market car tim has 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.000
 been sold by her friend stÃ©phanie 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.590
 at the time the young woman works at the 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.720
 art gallery participating in the project 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.240
 and it is she who finds the buyer a 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.190
 German collector a contract in 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.440
 due process rules the formalities 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.170
 of the transaction is also its price 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.940
 one hundred and fifty thousand euros a sum that 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.150
 share the art gallery and wim 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.959
 Delivered on his side for 30 thousand 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.280
 euros 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.960
 tim steiner has to stand at the 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.900
 collector's layout four 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.300
 weeks a year the contract states that 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.890
 the team owner has the right to 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.990
 expose them all their life in 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.640
 museums of fairs where demonstrations 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.260
 private 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:40.030
 he can also resell the back of 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.030
 steam or bequeath it to his heirs 

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:47.409
 when exhibited in museums 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.359
 team must sit facing a wall 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:53.199
 for hours and let yourself 

00:04:49.359 --> 00:04:55.359
 examine in those moments there thanks to his 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.729
 tattoo it actually becomes a 

00:04:55.359 --> 00:05:00.479
 work of art is perhaps finally this 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:03.149
 that he has always dreamed of being 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.619
 this job opened doors for me 

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:10.389
 since I was young I'm fascinated by the 

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:12.999
 world of art by his daring but 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.589
 before I did not even have a foot in 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:18.189
 I admired the works exhibited in 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:20.079
 museums and galleries and that's all 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:22.089
 work and especially the gallery and 

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:23.669
 Stephanie gave me the opportunity 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:25.989
 to enter the world of art 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.439
 today I'm not justin of 

00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:30.149
 zurich 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:30.149
 my very existence to a sense 

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:35.079
 the work of art will continue beyond the 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.479
 tim's death 

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:39.579
 because even after his death the tattoo 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:41.379
 will belong to the buyer a 

00:05:39.579 --> 00:05:43.839
 dermatologist will then be in charge of the 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:46.239
 take off on his team back so will 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:50.849
 skinned and tattooed tense in a 

00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:50.849
 framework he committed himself by testament 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.460
 the young man concluded a pact with the 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.690
 art market impact that some 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.690
 would call them macabre 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:13.140
 in this work death is an element 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.910
 omnipresent permanent I have death in 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.080
 the back and for many it's excessive 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.520
 because there is no more difference 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.520
 between art and reality
