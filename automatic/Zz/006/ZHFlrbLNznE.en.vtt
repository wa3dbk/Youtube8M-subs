 small game for the nintendo ds 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.770
 although so small that it is not because 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.630

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.880

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.220
 it looks from the outside yes it is one 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.690

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.360

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.659
 Continuation of it but I would say 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.170

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:14.580
 it is our story the book long 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:19.040
 before the rub osas there was a book 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.040
 of life the design of the creator 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:28.770
 creation of the creator created everything in 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:30.600
 which he drew in this book planet 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.500
 in the beginning, the creator made one 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.670
 circle and drew our world yes there 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.380
