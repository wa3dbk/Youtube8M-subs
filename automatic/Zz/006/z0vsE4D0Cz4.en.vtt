00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
week oh I'll keep it short this time so

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.590 
week oh I'll keep it short this time so
the<00:00:53.809> tip<00:00:54.079> of<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.409> week<00:00:54.620> is<00:00:54.940> don't<00:00:55.940> just<00:00:56.269> listen

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
the tip of the week is don't just listen

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.439 
the tip of the week is don't just listen
to<00:00:56.839> other<00:00:57.019> guitar<00:00:57.559> players<00:00:57.890> for<00:00:58.449> inspiration

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
to other guitar players for inspiration

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.530 
to other guitar players for inspiration
it<00:00:59.690> could<00:00:59.870> be<00:00:59.989> really<00:01:00.229> good<00:01:00.500> sometimes<00:01:00.769> to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
it could be really good sometimes to

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.210 
it could be really good sometimes to
listen<00:01:02.540> to<00:01:02.689> players<00:01:03.140> that<00:01:03.619> play<00:01:03.860> other

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
listen to players that play other

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.240 
listen to players that play other
instruments<00:01:04.879> like<00:01:05.560> saxophone<00:01:06.560> players<00:01:06.890> or

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
instruments like saxophone players or

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.880 
instruments like saxophone players or
piano<00:01:08.240> players<00:01:08.630> for<00:01:08.869> example<00:01:08.960> many<00:01:09.650> of<00:01:09.799> those

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
piano players for example many of those

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.179 
piano players for example many of those
instruments<00:01:10.840> use<00:01:11.840> arpeggios<00:01:12.650> a<00:01:12.680> lot<00:01:12.950> more

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
instruments use arpeggios a lot more

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.010 
instruments use arpeggios a lot more
because<00:01:13.369> it's<00:01:13.610> just<00:01:13.759> easier<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.720> play

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
because it's just easier to play

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.830 
because it's just easier to play
arpeggios<00:01:15.380> on<00:01:15.770> those<00:01:15.920> instruments<00:01:16.580> while<00:01:17.509> on

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
arpeggios on those instruments while on

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.280 
arpeggios on those instruments while on
a<00:01:17.900> guitar<00:01:18.170> it's<00:01:18.799> a<00:01:18.890> lot<00:01:19.040> easier<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:19.490> play

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
a guitar it's a lot easier to play

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.130 
a guitar it's a lot easier to play
scales<00:01:21.290> than<00:01:21.860> arpeggios<00:01:22.520> so<00:01:23.329> that's<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.960> tip

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
scales than arpeggios so that's the tip

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.640 
scales than arpeggios so that's the tip
of<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:24.320> week<00:01:24.409> check<00:01:25.040> out<00:01:25.220> other<00:01:25.549> players<00:01:26.240> on

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
of the week check out other players on

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.819 
of the week check out other players on
other<00:01:27.650> instruments<00:01:28.130> on<00:01:28.700> to<00:01:29.119> today's<00:01:29.450> lesson

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
other instruments on to today's lesson

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.039 
other instruments on to today's lesson
here's<00:01:30.829> some<00:01:31.070> four<00:01:31.400> string<00:01:31.850> sweeping<00:01:32.600> action

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
here's some four string sweeping action

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.020 
here's some four string sweeping action
for<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:33.530> I'm<00:01:34.069> going<00:01:34.249> to<00:01:34.340> skip<00:01:34.759> the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
for you I'm going to skip the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.260 
for you I'm going to skip the
neoclassical<00:01:35.929> approach<00:01:36.560> here<00:01:37.159> and<00:01:37.340> I'm<00:01:38.119> going

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
neoclassical approach here and I'm going

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.690 
neoclassical approach here and I'm going
to<00:01:38.299> use<00:01:38.479> the<00:01:38.689> video<00:01:39.439> game<00:01:39.710> approach<00:01:40.100> instead

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
to use the video game approach instead

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.969 
to use the video game approach instead
so<00:01:41.420> I'm<00:01:41.630> going<00:01:41.780> to<00:01:41.810> play<00:01:42.020> something<00:01:42.439> weird

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
so I'm going to play something weird

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:54.789 
so I'm going to play something weird
like<00:01:43.189> this

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.310 

now<00:01:55.789> that<00:01:55.969> sounds<00:01:56.390> pretty<00:01:56.539> different<00:01:56.899> from

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
now that sounds pretty different from

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.279 
now that sounds pretty different from
all<00:01:57.469> the<00:01:57.710> triad<00:01:58.340> base<00:01:58.729> torpedo<00:01:59.509> sweeps<00:01:59.960> you're

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
all the triad base torpedo sweeps you're

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.969 
all the triad base torpedo sweeps you're
used<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.039> hearing<00:02:01.250> but<00:02:01.969> all<00:02:02.270> it<00:02:02.539> is<00:02:02.570> is<00:02:02.899> a<00:02:02.979> sweep

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
used to hearing but all it is is a sweep

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.940 
used to hearing but all it is is a sweep
power<00:02:04.939> cords<00:02:05.539> actually<00:02:06.079> so<00:02:06.500> I<00:02:06.530> was<00:02:06.679> playing

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
power cords actually so I was playing

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:14.080 
power cords actually so I was playing
over<00:02:07.189> a<00:02:07.399> B<00:02:08.110> D<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:11.420> E<00:02:12.200> chord<00:02:12.440> all<00:02:13.190> power<00:02:13.640> cords

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
over a B D a and E chord all power cords

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.380 
over a B D a and E chord all power cords
and<00:02:14.269> what<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.260> did<00:02:15.530> was<00:02:16.069> take<00:02:16.310> each<00:02:16.580> power<00:02:17.060> chord

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
and what I did was take each power chord

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.759 
and what I did was take each power chord
here<00:02:17.599> and<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:19.730> move<00:02:20.360> these<00:02:20.629> notes<00:02:20.989> up<00:02:21.980> an<00:02:22.489> octave

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
here and I move these notes up an octave

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.339 
here and I move these notes up an octave
so<00:02:24.769> these<00:02:25.040> are<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.580> same<00:02:25.760> notes<00:02:26.030> B<00:02:26.900> F<00:02:27.079> sharp

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
so these are the same notes B F sharp

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.970 
so these are the same notes B F sharp
and<00:02:28.299> then<00:02:29.299> I<00:02:29.420> double<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:29.989> in<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.500> next<00:02:30.799> octave

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
and then I double it in the next octave

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.289 
and then I double it in the next octave
too<00:02:31.430> so<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:33.260> F<00:02:33.440> sharp<00:02:33.579> so<00:02:34.579> this<00:02:34.790> is<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.060> shape

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
too so the F sharp so this is the shape

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.819 
too so the F sharp so this is the shape
so<00:02:38.299> we<00:02:38.390> have<00:02:38.510> root<00:02:38.920> fifth<00:02:40.000> root<00:02:41.110> fifth<00:02:42.110> and

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
so we have root fifth root fifth and

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.620 
so we have root fifth root fifth and
that's<00:02:43.220> all<00:02:43.519> there<00:02:43.880> is<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.269> it

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
that's all there is to it

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.870 
that's all there is to it
then<00:02:45.079> you<00:02:45.620> just<00:02:45.890> follow<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.549> chord

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
then you just follow the chord

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.210 
then you just follow the chord
progression<00:02:47.480> you're<00:02:47.630> playing<00:02:47.930> over<00:02:48.319> so<00:02:48.739> over

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
progression you're playing over so over

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:56.520 
progression you're playing over so over
B<00:02:49.459> we<00:02:49.849> play<00:02:50.090> here<00:02:50.360> find<00:02:50.959> B<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:54.230> then<00:02:54.829> we<00:02:54.950> find<00:02:55.220> D

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
B we play here find B and then we find D

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.449 
B we play here find B and then we find D
we<00:02:57.530> have<00:02:57.650> another<00:02:57.890> D<00:02:58.129> here<00:02:58.340> so<00:02:59.120> this<00:02:59.450> is<00:02:59.600> D<00:03:00.459> and

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
we have another D here so this is D and

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.129 
we have another D here so this is D and
then<00:03:02.060> we'll<00:03:02.150> find<00:03:02.359> a<00:03:02.620> here<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:05.060> then<00:03:06.019> we'll

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.139 
then we'll find a here and then we'll

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.300 
then we'll find a here and then we'll
find<00:03:06.380> e<00:03:06.530> up<00:03:06.950> here<00:03:07.370> fourteenth<00:03:08.269> fret<00:03:08.450> D<00:03:08.780> string

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
find e up here fourteenth fret D string
