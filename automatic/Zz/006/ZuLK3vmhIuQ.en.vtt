00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
earlier today I'm going to show you how

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.420 
earlier today I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:02.250> cook<00:00:02.460> Hertz<00:00:03.210> Chinese<00:00:03.810> herbs<00:00:04.140> so<00:00:04.830> there's<00:00:05.339> a

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
to cook Hertz Chinese herbs so there's a

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.030 
to cook Hertz Chinese herbs so there's a
few<00:00:05.730> simple<00:00:05.970> steps<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.740> it'll<00:00:07.740> take<00:00:07.890> you

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
few simple steps and it'll take you

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.860 
few simple steps and it'll take you
probably<00:00:08.189> about<00:00:08.340> two<00:00:08.610> hours<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:09.389> do<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.630> full

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
probably about two hours to do the full

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.270 
probably about two hours to do the full
boiling<00:00:10.290> process<00:00:12.019> now<00:00:13.019> when<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:13.950> come<00:00:14.130> in

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
boiling process now when you come in

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.120 
boiling process now when you come in
I'll<00:00:14.370> give<00:00:14.519> your<00:00:14.670> bag<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:15.059> there<00:00:15.920> isn't<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> bad

I'll give your bag of there isn't a bad
paper<00:00:17.310> bag<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:20.150> usually<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.510> get<00:00:21.779> rid<00:00:22.199> of

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
paper bag and usually I get rid of

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.200 
paper bag and usually I get rid of
boilies<00:00:22.680> three<00:00:23.250> times<00:00:23.550> would<00:00:23.760> be<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.939> little

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
boilies three times would be a little

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.390 
boilies three times would be a little
tick<00:00:24.359> box<00:00:24.600> at<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.840> top<00:00:24.869> we<00:00:25.109> shape<00:00:25.410> sometimes

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
tick box at the top we shape sometimes

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.630 
tick box at the top we shape sometimes
we<00:00:26.550> just<00:00:26.699> prepare<00:00:27.180> for<00:00:27.900> one<00:00:28.890> day<00:00:29.130> one<00:00:29.460> bag

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
we just prepare for one day one bag

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.010 
we just prepare for one day one bag
today<00:00:30.060> but<00:00:30.869> generally<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:32.160> do<00:00:32.369> three<00:00:33.059> boils<00:00:33.480> at

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
today but generally we do three boils at

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.200 
today but generally we do three boils at
the<00:00:34.290> one<00:00:34.440> bag<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.280> one<00:00:35.430> bag<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.670> gonna<00:00:35.790> last<00:00:36.059> you

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
the one bag so one bag is gonna last you

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.790 
the one bag so one bag is gonna last you
a<00:00:36.270> week<00:00:36.510> you're<00:00:37.140> going<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.320> boil<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.620> three

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
a week you're going to boil it three

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.069 
a week you're going to boil it three
times<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.489> then<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.450> can<00:00:39.570> drink<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.899> over

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
times and then you can drink it over

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.479 
times and then you can drink it over
three<00:00:40.260> days<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.739> then<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.950> remaining<00:00:41.219> four

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
three days and then the remaining four

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.420 
three days and then the remaining four
days<00:00:41.640> Jim<00:00:41.969> we<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.210> pills<00:00:42.710> so<00:00:43.710> I'll<00:00:44.190> take<00:00:44.370> you

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
days Jim we have pills so I'll take you

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.850 
days Jim we have pills so I'll take you
through<00:00:44.670> step<00:00:44.879> by<00:00:44.910> step<00:00:45.059> how<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.539> boil<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
through step by step how to boil so the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.130 
through step by step how to boil so the
first<00:00:47.100> step<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:48.180> take<00:00:48.210> one<00:00:48.570> bag<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.809> purse

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
first step is you take one bag of purse

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:58.310 
first step is you take one bag of purse
and<00:00:49.920> empty<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.550> into<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:51.000> pot<00:00:56.989> those<00:00:57.989> are<00:00:58.109> yummy

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
and empty it into a pot those are yummy

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.650 
and empty it into a pot those are yummy
looking<00:00:58.559> herbs<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.100> there<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> pot<00:00:59.699> now<00:01:00.329> I

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
looking herbs in there in a pot now I

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.110 
looking herbs in there in a pot now I
use<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> clay<00:01:01.410> pot<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:02.010> played<00:01:02.640> an<00:01:02.879> earthenware

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
use a clay pot I played an earthenware

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.260 
use a clay pot I played an earthenware
pot<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.640> specifically<00:01:05.640> designed<00:01:05.939> for

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
pot this is specifically designed for

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.020 
pot this is specifically designed for
Chinese<00:01:06.720> herbs<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:09.080> mean<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:11.400> huge<00:01:11.640> difference

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
Chinese herbs I mean the huge difference

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.050 
Chinese herbs I mean the huge difference
but<00:01:12.240> basically<00:01:12.750> they<00:01:12.990> recommend<00:01:13.439> not<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.590> use

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
but basically they recommend not to use

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.480 
but basically they recommend not to use
steel<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:15.869> aluminium<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:17.159> change

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
steel like aluminium as it can change

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.130 
steel like aluminium as it can change
the<00:01:17.670> properties<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> herbs<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.020> it's

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the properties of the herbs so it's

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.590 
the properties of the herbs so it's
preferable<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.560> use<00:01:19.680> an<00:01:19.890> earthenware<00:01:20.220> pot

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
preferable to use an earthenware pot

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.700 
preferable to use an earthenware pot
after<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.780> probably<00:01:21.990> like<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:23.630> glass<00:01:24.630> kind<00:01:25.530> of

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
after that probably like a glass kind of

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.080 
after that probably like a glass kind of
saucepan<00:01:26.430> or<00:01:26.750> a<00:01:27.750> cast<00:01:28.680> iron<00:01:28.950> saucepan<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.729> okay

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
saucepan or a cast iron saucepan is okay

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.330 
saucepan or a cast iron saucepan is okay
otherwise<00:01:30.600> stainless<00:01:31.290> steel<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:31.770> not<00:01:32.310> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
otherwise stainless steel but not a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.539 
otherwise stainless steel but not a
lavinia<00:01:32.900> so<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.650> we've<00:01:34.770> got<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> pot<00:01:35.250> full<00:01:35.280> of

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
lavinia so then we've got a pot full of

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.100 
lavinia so then we've got a pot full of
herbs<00:01:35.759> then<00:01:36.390> we're<00:01:36.479> going<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.659> add<00:01:36.750> three<00:01:37.079> cups

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
herbs then we're going to add three cups

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.280 
herbs then we're going to add three cups
of<00:01:37.500> water<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.610> bag<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.810> feel<00:01:40.079> like<00:01:40.110> this

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
of water to that bag so I feel like this

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.469 
of water to that bag so I feel like this
cup<00:01:40.530> three<00:01:40.770> times<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.670> pour<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.360> then

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
cup three times and pour it in and then

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.360 
cup three times and pour it in and then
I'm<00:01:42.630> going<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.780> later<00:01:42.960> so

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
I'm going to later so

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:53.300 
I'm going to later so
okay<00:01:45.370> so<00:01:45.430> we<00:01:45.880> just<00:01:47.040> get<00:01:48.040> three<00:01:48.310> cups<00:01:48.580> of<00:01:48.730> water

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.070 

now<00:01:54.310> it<00:01:54.400> says<00:01:54.610> warm<00:01:54.970> water<00:01:55.240> on<00:01:55.570> this<00:01:55.810> sheet<00:01:56.050> but

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
now it says warm water on this sheet but

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.050 
now it says warm water on this sheet but
you<00:01:56.710> know<00:01:56.800> cold<00:01:57.100> what<00:01:57.250> is<00:01:57.340> it<00:01:57.430> okay<00:01:57.640> -<00:01:57.700> it

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
you know cold what is it okay - it

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.360 
you know cold what is it okay - it
doesn't<00:01:58.240> really<00:01:58.390> matter<00:01:58.720> too<00:01:58.900> much<00:01:59.250> and<00:02:00.250> then

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
doesn't really matter too much and then

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.700 
doesn't really matter too much and then
just<00:02:00.580> let<00:02:00.760> it<00:02:00.850> soak<00:02:01.060> for<00:02:01.720> maybe<00:02:02.290> about<00:02:02.440> ten

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
just let it soak for maybe about ten

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.120 
just let it soak for maybe about ten
minutes<00:02:02.830> you've<00:02:03.280> got<00:02:03.430> time<00:02:04.830> okay<00:02:05.830> so<00:02:05.890> we've

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
minutes you've got time okay so we've

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.500 
minutes you've got time okay so we've
got<00:02:06.160> a<00:02:08.369> medium<00:02:09.369> sized<00:02:09.580> burner<00:02:09.850> on<00:02:10.090> high<00:02:10.119> flame

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
got a medium sized burner on high flame

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.240 
got a medium sized burner on high flame
there<00:02:10.900> we<00:02:11.410> just<00:02:11.530> want<00:02:11.710> to<00:02:11.770> bring<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:12.010> up<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.160> the

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
there we just want to bring it up to the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.370 
there we just want to bring it up to the
boil<00:02:12.460> now<00:02:13.300> what<00:02:13.510> we<00:02:13.600> want<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.810> do<00:02:13.960> is<00:02:14.110> we<00:02:14.230> want

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
boil now what we want to do is we want

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.070 
boil now what we want to do is we want
to<00:02:14.410> we<00:02:14.590> want<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.860> reduce<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.520> three<00:02:15.960> cups<00:02:16.960> of

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
to we want to reduce the three cups of

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.560 
to we want to reduce the three cups of
water<00:02:17.290> down<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.010> one<00:02:18.310> cup<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.640> herbs<00:02:18.910> that's

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
water down to one cup of herbs that's

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.330 
water down to one cup of herbs that's
going<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.780> take<00:02:19.960> around<00:02:20.200> about<00:02:20.470> 30<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.040> 40

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
going to take around about 30 to 40

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.240 
going to take around about 30 to 40
minutes<00:02:21.430> so<00:02:21.850> just<00:02:22.590> keep<00:02:23.590> an<00:02:23.740> eye<00:02:23.800> on<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:24.040> keep<00:02:24.070> a

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
minutes so just keep an eye on it keep a

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.370 
minutes so just keep an eye on it keep a
timer<00:02:24.490> on<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:25.150> just<00:02:25.330> check<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.720> after<00:02:25.930> about

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
timer on and just check it after about

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.140 
timer on and just check it after about
half<00:02:27.010> an<00:02:27.190> hour<00:02:27.280> just<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.610> make<00:02:27.730> sure<00:02:27.760> it's<00:02:28.030> not

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
half an hour just to make sure it's not

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.310 
half an hour just to make sure it's not
boil<00:02:28.390> dry<00:02:29.790> but<00:02:30.790> what<00:02:31.060> we<00:02:31.180> essentially<00:02:32.020> what<00:02:32.230> we

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
boil dry but what we essentially what we

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.050 
boil dry but what we essentially what we
want<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.500> do<00:02:32.590> is<00:02:32.740> reduce<00:02:32.890> three<00:02:33.520> down<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.880> one

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
want to do is reduce three down to one

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.020 
want to do is reduce three down to one
but<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:34.870> sell<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.710> for<00:02:35.800> about<00:02:35.920> 30<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.790> 40

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
but and sell it for about 30 to 40

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.190 
but and sell it for about 30 to 40
minutes<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.390> check<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.630> after<00:02:37.720> 30<00:02:38.020> minutes

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
minutes to check it after 30 minutes

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.920 
minutes to check it after 30 minutes
definitely<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.010> doesn't<00:02:39.280> doesn't<00:02:40.270> boil

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
definitely so it doesn't doesn't boil

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.880 
definitely so it doesn't doesn't boil
dry<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.560> burn<00:02:41.860> okay<00:02:42.790> so<00:02:43.110> that's<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.500> four<00:02:44.770> you

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
dry and burn okay so that's a four you

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.400 
dry and burn okay so that's a four you
need<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.190> pass<00:02:45.400> now<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:46.000> I've<00:02:46.750> checked<00:02:46.960> Italy

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
need to pass now and I've checked Italy

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.410 
need to pass now and I've checked Italy
looks<00:02:48.160> like<00:02:48.310> I've<00:02:48.459> got<00:02:48.490> about<00:02:48.790> as<00:02:48.940> much<00:02:48.970> lift

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
looks like I've got about as much lift

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.630 
looks like I've got about as much lift
as<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.690> want<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:50.050> so<00:02:50.980> now<00:02:51.130> what<00:02:51.220> I'm<00:02:51.310> going<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.490> do

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
as I want to so now what I'm going to do

00:02:51.640 --> 00:03:05.160 
as I want to so now what I'm going to do
is<00:02:52.080> I'll<00:02:53.080> spread<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.560> up<00:02:53.740> into<00:02:53.920> a<00:02:54.010> bowl

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.860 

so<00:03:06.069> I<00:03:06.100> should<00:03:06.340> have<00:03:06.430> bet<00:03:06.580> 1<00:03:06.790> 1<00:03:07.240> cup<00:03:07.480> left<00:03:07.690> of

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
so I should have bet 1 1 cup left of

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.949 
so I should have bet 1 1 cup left of
liquid<00:03:08.260> in<00:03:08.350> there<00:03:10.860> no<00:03:12.209> also<00:03:13.209> will<00:03:13.510> put<00:03:13.840> aside

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
liquid in there no also will put aside

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.800 
liquid in there no also will put aside
is<00:03:14.350> probably<00:03:14.770> a<00:03:15.209> container<00:03:16.209> or<00:03:16.360> a<00:03:16.510> jar

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
is probably a container or a jar

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.340 
is probably a container or a jar
something<00:03:17.440> that's<00:03:17.590> gonna<00:03:17.830> hold<00:03:18.100> about<00:03:18.550> 3<00:03:19.510> 3

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
something that's gonna hold about 3 3

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.810 
something that's gonna hold about 3 3
cups<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.770> liquid<00:03:20.920> so<00:03:21.400> I'm<00:03:21.459> going<00:03:21.580> to<00:03:21.610> boil<00:03:21.790> it

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
cups of liquid so I'm going to boil it

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.990 
cups of liquid so I'm going to boil it
three<00:03:22.060> times<00:03:22.360> so<00:03:22.770> I<00:03:23.770> won't<00:03:24.490> pull<00:03:24.670> up<00:03:24.760> strained

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
three times so I won't pull up strained

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.160 
three times so I won't pull up strained
the<00:03:25.120> glass<00:03:25.300> cause<00:03:25.510> it'll<00:03:25.660> probably<00:03:25.840> cracked

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
the glass cause it'll probably cracked

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.110 
the glass cause it'll probably cracked
so<00:03:26.380> I'll<00:03:26.440> just<00:03:26.590> put<00:03:27.250> into<00:03:27.520> a<00:03:27.550> ceramic<00:03:28.000> bowl

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
so I'll just put into a ceramic bowl

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.780 
so I'll just put into a ceramic bowl
first<00:03:28.540> let<00:03:29.020> it<00:03:29.140> cool<00:03:29.320> down<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.860> then<00:03:30.490> I'll<00:03:30.580> put

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
first let it cool down and then I'll put

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.970 
first let it cool down and then I'll put
it<00:03:30.880> inside<00:03:31.180> there<00:03:31.540> okay<00:03:32.350> so<00:03:32.410> I've<00:03:32.800> done<00:03:32.920> my

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
it inside there okay so I've done my

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.309 
it inside there okay so I've done my
first<00:03:33.280> boil<00:03:33.580> and<00:03:33.910> so<00:03:34.840> now<00:03:34.959> what<00:03:35.080> I'm<00:03:35.170> going<00:03:35.260> to

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
first boil and so now what I'm going to

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.979 
first boil and so now what I'm going to
do<00:03:35.500> is<00:03:35.819> put<00:03:36.819> another<00:03:36.910> two<00:03:37.270> cups<00:03:37.480> of<00:03:37.570> water<00:03:37.630> in

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.630 

now<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.050> reason<00:03:41.350> I<00:03:41.440> do<00:03:41.680> 2<00:03:41.950> cups<00:03:42.130> of<00:03:42.340> water<00:03:42.489> this

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
now the reason I do 2 cups of water this

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.030 
now the reason I do 2 cups of water this
time<00:03:42.700> is<00:03:43.030> because<00:03:43.380> all<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.560> heads<00:03:44.739> are<00:03:44.890> wet

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
time is because all the heads are wet

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.580 
time is because all the heads are wet
and<00:03:45.280> we<00:03:46.180> want<00:03:46.360> to<00:03:46.420> bore<00:03:46.570> them<00:03:46.690> again<00:03:47.110> 2<00:03:47.350> cups

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
and we want to bore them again 2 cups

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.259 
and we want to bore them again 2 cups
down<00:03:47.709> to<00:03:47.830> 1<00:03:47.980> cup<00:03:48.220> now<00:03:48.400> I'm<00:03:48.940> going<00:03:49.060> to<00:03:49.120> pop<00:03:49.239> that

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
down to 1 cup now I'm going to pop that

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:57.270 
down to 1 cup now I'm going to pop that
on<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.720> stove<00:03:49.930> again<00:03:53.760> check<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:54.880> out<00:03:56.220> okay<00:03:57.220> so

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
on the stove again check it out okay so

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.910 
on the stove again check it out okay so
I<00:03:57.459> finished<00:03:57.670> my<00:03:57.850> second<00:03:58.269> ball<00:03:58.420> now<00:03:58.739> that<00:03:59.739> took

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
I finished my second ball now that took

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.380 
I finished my second ball now that took
another<00:04:00.220> half<00:04:00.670> now<00:04:00.910> so<00:04:01.660> let's<00:04:01.810> drain<00:04:02.050> that<00:04:02.230> off

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
another half now so let's drain that off

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:10.830 
another half now so let's drain that off
so<00:04:04.390> I've<00:04:04.480> got<00:04:04.690> more<00:04:07.500> yummy<00:04:08.500> herbs<00:04:08.890> and<00:04:09.730> then<00:04:10.450> I

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
so I've got more yummy herbs and then I

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.530 
so I've got more yummy herbs and then I
wait<00:04:11.650> that's<00:04:11.920> a<00:04:12.010> call<00:04:12.220> again<00:04:12.579> and<00:04:13.150> then<00:04:13.420> woke

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
wait that's a call again and then woke

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.440 
wait that's a call again and then woke
up<00:04:13.750> so<00:04:13.900> I've<00:04:13.989> got<00:04:14.140> my<00:04:14.230> first<00:04:14.440> boil<00:04:14.829> in<00:04:15.579> then<00:04:15.820> my

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450

combine them I've got 2 cups of liquid
in<00:04:22.750> there<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.560> then<00:04:24.280> I<00:04:24.310> want<00:04:24.490> to<00:04:24.520> do<00:04:24.610> a<00:04:24.640> third

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270
