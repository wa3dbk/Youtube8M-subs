00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
the 501 a with a 15.6 inch screen so

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.470 
the 501 a with a 15.6 inch screen so
it's<00:00:21.510> not<00:00:21.689> too<00:00:22.170> bad<00:00:22.199> but<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.710> little<00:00:22.920> tricky

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
the power button a couple times just to

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.030 
the power button a couple times just to
drain<00:00:33.630> any<00:00:33.840> residual<00:00:34.320> power<00:00:34.590> out<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040

have the screws removed it's not over
yet<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.570> still<00:01:21.869> need<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.259> find<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.580> gift<00:01:24.030> card

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
yet you still need to find a gift card

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.109 
yet you still need to find a gift card
of<00:01:24.479> some<00:01:24.689> type<00:01:24.900> or<00:01:25.340> some<00:01:26.340> card<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.729> don't<00:01:26.880> care

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
of some type or some card you don't care

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.749 
of some type or some card you don't care
about<00:01:27.390> now<00:01:28.049> guitar<00:01:28.530> pick<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.460> something

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
about now guitar pick it's something

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.219 
about now guitar pick it's something
where<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.119> get<00:01:30.329> underneath<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.990> plastic

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
where you can get underneath the plastic

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.340 
where you can get underneath the plastic
without<00:01:31.860> damaging<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.570> plastic<00:01:34.110> edge

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
without damaging the the plastic edge

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.760 
without damaging the the plastic edge
which<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.189> critical<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.299> first<00:01:37.110> step<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.590> find

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
which is critical so first step I find

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.280 
which is critical so first step I find
easiest<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.369> remove<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.909> corner<00:01:39.479> right<00:01:40.229> here

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
easiest to remove this corner right here

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.740 
easiest to remove this corner right here
and<00:01:41.450> just<00:01:42.450> kind<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.350> grab<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:44.329> enough<00:01:45.329> where

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
and just kind of grab it enough where

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.639 
and just kind of grab it enough where
you<00:01:45.840> get<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.470> edge<00:01:46.939> out<00:01:48.049> and<00:01:49.049> then<00:01:50.060> you<00:01:51.060> can

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
you get this edge out and then you can

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.590 
you get this edge out and then you can
want<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.710> apply<00:01:52.920> pressure<00:01:53.189> slight<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.270> slight

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
want to apply pressure slight and slight

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600 
want to apply pressure slight and slight
pressure<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.770> don't<00:01:55.799> want<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.100> bend

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
pressure you don't want to bend

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.459 
pressure you don't want to bend
yeah<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.210> keyboard<00:01:57.689> will<00:01:57.780> Bend<00:01:58.020> if<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.229> apply

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
yeah the keyboard will Bend if you apply

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.660 
yeah the keyboard will Bend if you apply
too<00:01:58.530> much<00:01:58.649> pressure<00:01:59.070> then<00:01:59.280> they'll<00:01:59.369> end<00:01:59.490> up

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
too much pressure then they'll end up

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.969 
too much pressure then they'll end up
with<00:01:59.880> potentially<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.869> damaged<00:02:01.229> keyboard<00:02:01.710> who

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
with potentially a damaged keyboard who

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.530 
with potentially a damaged keyboard who
knows<00:02:02.159> what<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:02.579> very<00:02:02.850> fragile

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
knows what it's very fragile

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.140 
knows what it's very fragile
so<00:02:04.159> you<00:02:05.159> want<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.460> kind<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.030> apply<00:02:06.270> pressure

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
so you want to kind of apply pressure

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
so you want to kind of apply pressure
this<00:02:07.330> thing<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:08.619> can<00:02:08.770> put<00:02:09.040> a<00:02:09.780> screwdriver<00:02:10.780> in

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
this thing you can put a screwdriver in

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.820 
this thing you can put a screwdriver in
there<00:02:11.410> to<00:02:11.560> hold<00:02:12.010> it<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:16.930> kind<00:02:17.440> of<00:02:17.470> want<00:02:17.800> to

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
there to hold it and I kind of want to

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
there to hold it and I kind of want to
go<00:02:17.980> all<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.100> way<00:02:18.130> around<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:21.750> in<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.870> middle

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
go all the way around and in the middle

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.590 
go all the way around and in the middle
make<00:02:24.850> sure<00:02:25.030> this<00:02:25.240> is<00:02:25.450> this<00:02:25.960> areas<00:02:26.380> fold<00:02:26.740> up

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
make sure this is this areas fold up

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:35.520 
make sure this is this areas fold up
we'll<00:02:28.600> rotate<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:32.520> probably<00:02:33.520> want<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:34.530> put

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
we'll rotate it and probably want to put

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.950 
we'll rotate it and probably want to put
these<00:02:35.710> clips<00:02:36.160> just<00:02:36.330> peel<00:02:37.330> them<00:02:37.480> up<00:02:37.570> very

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
these clips just peel them up very

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.870 
these clips just peel them up very
carefully<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.950> will<00:02:39.130> usually<00:02:39.370> break<00:02:39.610> free

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
carefully that will usually break free

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.280 
carefully that will usually break free
this<00:02:40.060> side<00:02:40.330> you<00:02:40.660> can<00:02:40.780> actually<00:02:40.870> start<00:02:41.230> with

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
this side you can actually start with

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.930 
this side you can actually start with
this<00:02:41.440> side<00:02:41.620> too<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:41.920> doesn't<00:02:42.610> really<00:02:42.700> matter

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
this side too it doesn't really matter

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.440 
this side too it doesn't really matter
whatever<00:02:43.209> sine<00:02:43.630> is<00:02:43.810> easiest<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.970> just<00:02:46.150> kind

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
whatever sine is easiest you just kind

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.990 
whatever sine is easiest you just kind
of<00:02:46.510> want<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.720> want<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.200> pull<00:02:47.410> up<00:02:47.440> there<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.280> go

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
of want to want to pull up there and go

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.730 
of want to want to pull up there and go
along<00:02:53.820> once<00:02:54.820> you<00:02:54.940> have<00:02:55.120> those<00:02:55.360> out<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:56.530> will<00:02:56.680> be

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
along once you have those out it will be

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.330 
along once you have those out it will be
loose<00:02:57.130> now<00:02:57.430> don't<00:02:58.120> lift<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.540> very<00:02:58.750> much

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
loose now don't lift it very much

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.120 
loose now don't lift it very much
because<00:03:00.340> what<00:03:00.490> we<00:03:00.610> need<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.820> do<00:03:00.970> then<00:03:01.270> is

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
because what we need to do then is

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.340 
because what we need to do then is
rotate<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.250> laptop<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:04.120> you're<00:03:04.300> looking<00:03:04.660> at

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
rotate the laptop so you're looking at

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.500 
rotate the laptop so you're looking at
it<00:03:05.890> kind<00:03:06.250> of<00:03:06.280> at<00:03:06.400> an<00:03:06.490> angle<00:03:06.520> here<00:03:07.240> and<00:03:08.220> slowly

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
it kind of at an angle here and slowly

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.930 
it kind of at an angle here and slowly
lift<00:03:10.510> up<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.870> lid<00:03:11.310> now<00:03:12.310> what<00:03:13.090> you'll<00:03:13.239> see<00:03:13.600> are

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
lift up the lid now what you'll see are

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.310 
lift up the lid now what you'll see are
two<00:03:15.940> connectors<00:03:16.360> one<00:03:16.600> for<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.870> keyboard

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
two connectors one for the keyboard

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.259 
two connectors one for the keyboard
which<00:03:17.500> is<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:18.070> bigger<00:03:18.519> one<00:03:18.640> and<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.000> small

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
which is the bigger one and the small

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.780 
which is the bigger one and the small
white<00:03:19.480> one<00:03:19.660> for<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.870> touchpad<00:03:20.250> now<00:03:21.250> there's

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
white one for the touchpad now there's

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.630 
white one for the touchpad now there's
two<00:03:22.150> little<00:03:22.300> plastic<00:03:23.130> pieces<00:03:24.130> here<00:03:24.430> I'll<00:03:24.489> show

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
two little plastic pieces here I'll show

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.240 
two little plastic pieces here I'll show
you<00:03:24.670> in<00:03:24.760> a<00:03:24.820> moment<00:03:24.940> just<00:03:25.870> lift<00:03:26.560> those<00:03:26.709> up<00:03:26.769> and

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
you in a moment just lift those up and

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.780 
you in a moment just lift those up and
the<00:03:27.400> cable<00:03:27.940> should<00:03:28.180> come<00:03:28.450> right<00:03:28.630> out<00:03:29.550> if<00:03:30.550> not

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
the cable should come right out if not

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.479 
the cable should come right out if not
just<00:03:30.850> give<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.390> little<00:03:31.450> nudge<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:32.140> then<00:03:32.680> pull

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
just give a little nudge and then pull

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.470 
just give a little nudge and then pull
this<00:03:33.640> out<00:03:33.820> of<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.030> way<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:36.310> I'll<00:03:36.790> zoom<00:03:37.030> in<00:03:37.180> here

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
this out of the way so I'll zoom in here

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.199 
this out of the way so I'll zoom in here
well<00:03:37.980> don't<00:03:38.980> have<00:03:39.070> a<00:03:39.130> zoom<00:03:39.370> feature<00:03:39.550> really

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
well don't have a zoom feature really

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.350 
well don't have a zoom feature really
but<00:03:40.570> I<00:03:40.920> will<00:03:41.920> bring<00:03:42.459> this<00:03:42.670> closer<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.239> the

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
but I will bring this closer to the

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.390 
but I will bring this closer to the
camera<00:03:43.690> so<00:03:44.790> I'll<00:03:45.790> see<00:03:46.120> if<00:03:46.239> we<00:03:46.390> can<00:03:46.540> focus

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.940 

as<00:03:51.180> far<00:03:51.390> as<00:03:51.420> these<00:03:51.569> connectors<00:03:51.989> go<00:03:52.260> that's<00:03:52.739> the

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
as far as these connectors go that's the

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.020 
as far as these connectors go that's the
closed<00:03:53.220> position<00:03:54.019> that's<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.200> open<00:03:55.530> position

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
closed position that's the open position

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.229 
closed position that's the open position
so<00:03:57.030> closed<00:03:57.890> open<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:59.489> want<00:03:59.580> to<00:03:59.700> have<00:03:59.790> it<00:03:59.879> open

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
so closed open you want to have it open

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.110 
so closed open you want to have it open
until<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:01.110> cable<00:04:01.349> is<00:04:01.620> pushed<00:04:01.920> in<00:04:02.190> all<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.640> way

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
until the cable is pushed in all the way

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.089 
until the cable is pushed in all the way
now<00:04:03.690> you<00:04:03.720> can<00:04:03.989> tell<00:04:04.260> it's<00:04:04.560> pushed<00:04:04.830> it<00:04:04.980> all<00:04:05.069> the

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
now you can tell it's pushed it all the

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:10.729 
now you can tell it's pushed it all the
way<00:04:05.629> by<00:04:06.629> looking<00:04:07.470> at<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.620> cable<00:04:08.299> and<00:04:09.590> see<00:04:10.590> that

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
way by looking at the cable and see that

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.979 
way by looking at the cable and see that
you<00:04:11.069> see<00:04:11.220> that<00:04:11.370> white<00:04:11.580> line<00:04:11.819> that<00:04:12.629> needs<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.959> be

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
you see that white line that needs to be

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.350 
you see that white line that needs to be
covered<00:04:13.590> when<00:04:13.890> you<00:04:14.010> push<00:04:14.250> down<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.940> white

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
covered when you push down the white

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.870 
covered when you push down the white
plastic<00:04:15.660> lock<00:04:16.229> and<00:04:17.040> on<00:04:17.130> this<00:04:17.310> one<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.729> have<00:04:17.820> a

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
plastic lock and on this one you have a

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.569 
plastic lock and on this one you have a
black<00:04:18.120> line<00:04:18.419> that<00:04:19.260> needs<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.590> be<00:04:19.620> covered<00:04:20.010> push

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
black line that needs to be covered push

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.860 
black line that needs to be covered push
straight<00:04:20.940> in<00:04:20.970> while<00:04:21.780> you<00:04:21.959> push<00:04:22.139> that<00:04:22.350> down<00:04:22.620> so

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
straight in while you push that down so

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.770 
straight in while you push that down so
kind<00:04:24.870> of<00:04:24.960> like<00:04:25.050> this<00:04:25.350> I<00:04:29.060> find<00:04:30.060> it<00:04:30.150> easiest<00:04:30.570> to

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
kind of like this I find it easiest to

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.840 
kind of like this I find it easiest to
start<00:04:30.840> with<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:32.040> white<00:04:32.220> one<00:04:32.460> is<00:04:32.669> it's

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
start with the the white one is it's

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.140 
start with the the white one is it's
smaller<00:04:33.150> but<00:04:33.419> it's<00:04:33.630> up<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.780> you<00:04:34.430> so<00:04:35.430> it's<00:04:36.000> a

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
smaller but it's up to you so it's a

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.030 
smaller but it's up to you so it's a
little<00:04:36.300> tricky<00:04:36.780> because<00:04:37.110> sometimes<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.860> kid

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
little tricky because sometimes the kid

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.750 
little tricky because sometimes the kid
wants<00:04:38.310> to<00:04:38.340> go<00:04:38.430> underneath<00:04:38.790> the<00:04:39.720> connector<00:04:40.169> so

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
wants to go underneath the connector so

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.570 
wants to go underneath the connector so
once<00:04:41.760> the<00:04:42.030> touchpad<00:04:42.419> is<00:04:42.780> lined<00:04:42.960> up<00:04:43.460> line<00:04:44.460> up

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
once the touchpad is lined up line up

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.129 
once the touchpad is lined up line up
the<00:04:44.669> keyboard<00:04:45.120> and<00:04:46.580> those<00:04:47.580> are<00:04:47.729> both<00:04:48.139> pushed

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
the keyboard and those are both pushed
