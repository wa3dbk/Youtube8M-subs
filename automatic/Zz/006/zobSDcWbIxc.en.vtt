00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.710 
balls they just keep rolling into good
good<00:02:17.930> position<00:02:18.349> this<00:02:18.530> doesn't<00:02:19.480> look<00:02:20.480> too<00:02:20.690> bad

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
good position this doesn't look too bad

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.199 
good position this doesn't look too bad
because<00:02:21.200> he<00:02:21.680> can<00:02:21.950> just<00:02:22.190> better<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.819> red<00:02:23.000> go

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
because he can just better the red go

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.330 
because he can just better the red go
around<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.540> table<00:02:23.569> I<00:02:24.140> don't<00:02:24.650> think<00:02:24.860> he'll<00:02:25.040> try

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
around the table I don't think he'll try

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.830 
around the table I don't think he'll try
to<00:02:25.400> keep<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.819> red<00:02:25.970> in<00:02:26.120> that<00:02:26.150> corner<00:02:26.569> I<00:02:26.629> think

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
to keep the red in that corner I think

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.180 
to keep the red in that corner I think
he'll<00:02:26.959> bring<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:27.260> over<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.739> left<00:02:27.950> long

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
he'll bring it over to the left long

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.030 
he'll bring it over to the left long
rail<00:02:28.459> if<00:02:28.640> he<00:02:28.730> can<00:02:29.590> couldn't<00:02:30.590> quite<00:02:30.680> hit<00:02:30.920> it

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
rail if he can couldn't quite hit it

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.070 
rail if he can couldn't quite hit it

here um it's been a very position you
know<00:02:50.480> sometimes<00:02:50.810> tempting<00:02:51.530> in<00:02:51.650> this<00:02:51.769> position

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
know sometimes tempting in this position

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.539 
know sometimes tempting in this position
you<00:02:53.120> can<00:02:53.299> you<00:02:53.720> can<00:02:53.900> do<00:02:54.140> this<00:02:54.380> and<00:02:54.709> still<00:02:55.310> come

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
you can you can do this and still come

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
will not even get close enough to begin

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.020 
will not even get close enough to begin
the<00:03:07.480> pack<00:03:07.690> how<00:03:08.260> they<00:03:08.470> ever<00:03:08.620> moved<00:03:08.950> yeah<00:03:09.490> it

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.610 
might be busy too short and the nice
thing<00:03:11.920> I<00:03:12.160> got<00:03:12.190> it<00:03:12.580> is<00:03:12.670> perfect<00:03:13.390> is<00:03:13.620> probably

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.230 
we'll just do it again up he went a
little<00:03:17.650> too<00:03:17.770> far<00:03:18.100> to<00:03:18.160> go<00:03:18.460> around<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.180> table

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
little too far to go around the table

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.180 
little too far to go around the table
again<00:03:21.120> however<00:03:22.120> he's<00:03:22.540> got<00:03:22.750> a<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:23.860> know<00:03:23.980> he

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.790 
again however he's got a you know he
just<00:03:24.610> might<00:03:24.760> holiday<00:03:25.030> this<00:03:25.330> reverse<00:03:25.870> shot<00:03:26.200> is

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
just might holiday this reverse shot is

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.220 
just might holiday this reverse shot is
able<00:03:29.910> what<00:03:30.910> about<00:03:31.060> against<00:03:31.720> his<00:03:31.900> trolley

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
able what about against his trolley

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.270 
able what about against his trolley
could<00:03:32.470> pull<00:03:32.620> it<00:03:32.650> all<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:32.890> way<00:03:32.980> up<00:03:33.130> to<00:03:33.250> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
could pull it all the way up to the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.830 
could pull it all the way up to the
other<00:03:33.550> corner<00:03:33.730> I<00:03:34.030> think<00:03:34.300> they<00:03:34.390> reversed<00:03:34.750> a

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
other corner I think they reversed a

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.300 
other corner I think they reversed a
little<00:03:35.050> more<00:03:35.170> natural<00:03:35.620> in<00:03:35.710> this<00:03:35.830> position

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
little more natural in this position

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.920 
little more natural in this position
you're<00:03:36.700> right<00:03:36.940> you<00:03:37.450> notice<00:03:37.840> guys<00:03:38.080> shooting
