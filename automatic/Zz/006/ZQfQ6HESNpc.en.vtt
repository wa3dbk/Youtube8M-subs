00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 each layer of soil is well compacted 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.779
 so that in the zone of roots we do not have 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.779
 no emptiness 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:19.600
 and to stimulate this tillering 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.619
 all remaining elevated parts we 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.650
 we cut off 34 buds don't regret it 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.990
 do if dear friends is not 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.860
 make oh many gardeners really 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.739
 sorry for what you get its planting 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.420
 vertically obtained next year 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.269
 small tree which is bad 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.440
 develops as a result of the harvest wait not 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:46.440
 have our piece set right 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.440
 watering 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.670
 well in the karni zone please don't 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.520
 make a swamp after all the young roots 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.320
 for development for so that they 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:11.020
 well build up needed air if 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.780
 excessive watering arrange that air 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.030
 the water of Vlada is being forced out but also 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.280
 respectively, the roots grow poorly and 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.270
 last operation to be done 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.390
 after planting this is mulching so 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.720
 Our moisture does not evaporate 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.270
 and on the surface will not form 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.090
 crust here in the spring let's see what we have 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.979
 here grew marinka hope that instead 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.830
 currant face you grow up 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.630
 orange tree well with ours 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.180
 seedlings that are now selling on 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.460
 the market is all possible this is true 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.460
 therefore it is best to buy seedlings 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.470
 either tested in garden centers in 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.140

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.689
