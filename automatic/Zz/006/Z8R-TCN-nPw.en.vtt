00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
little bit on my finger and just sort of

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.850 
little bit on my finger and just sort of
massage<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.130> make<00:01:57.060> sure<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.390> go<00:01:57.860> fairly

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.820 

then<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.210> take<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.420> little<00:02:22.570> step<00:02:22.870> back<00:02:23.110> because

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
then I take a little step back because

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.890 
then I take a little step back because
my<00:02:24.100> bags<00:02:24.340> tend<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.120> come<00:02:25.270> down<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.480> little<00:02:25.720> bit

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
my bags tend to come down a little bit

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.010 
my bags tend to come down a little bit
further<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.850> I<00:02:28.090> died<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.390> little<00:02:28.660> bit<00:02:28.840> more

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
further so I died a little bit more

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.900 
further so I died a little bit more
further<00:02:29.350> down<00:02:31.770> again<00:02:32.770> I'm<00:02:33.460> sure<00:02:33.610> I'm<00:02:33.670> supposed

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
further down again I'm sure I'm supposed

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.370 
further down again I'm sure I'm supposed

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.300 
to be blotting or using a brush or
something<00:02:35.680> but<00:02:37.200> just<00:02:38.200> can't<00:02:38.350> be<00:02:38.530> faster<00:02:40.020> and

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
something but just can't be faster and

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.400
