00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
one of the things I'm gonna do is set my

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.530 
one of the things I'm gonna do is set my

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.840 
ISO low so I know that I'm gonna be
shooting<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:34.590> bright<00:00:34.980> light<00:00:35.219> up<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.550> shoot<00:00:35.760> of

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.619 
gonna look to shoot in the shade because
I<00:00:43.379> want<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.829> mitigate<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.879> direction<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.510 
I want to mitigate the direction of the
light<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.140> shoot<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.590> shade<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.190> can

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
light and if I shoot in the shade I can

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.090 
light and if I shoot in the shade I can
get<00:00:47.640> softer<00:00:48.149> more<00:00:48.270> even<00:00:48.329> light<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.469> these<00:00:49.890> are

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
get softer more even light so these are

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.410 
get softer more even light so these are
the<00:00:50.160> kind<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.489> areas<00:00:50.640> I'm<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.120> look<00:00:51.270> to

here<00:01:31.170> running<00:01:32.009> up<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.369> building<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> side

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
here running up the building on the side

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.960 
here running up the building on the side
of<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.360> door<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.650> shoot<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.220> I'm<00:01:35.520> gonna

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
of the door and to shoot this I'm gonna

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.590 
of the door and to shoot this I'm gonna
start<00:01:36.360> with<00:01:36.720> an<00:01:37.020> aperture<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.950> f9<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.299> reason

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
start with an aperture of f9 the reason

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.390 
start with an aperture of f9 the reason
for<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.140> want<00:01:40.350> decent<00:01:40.650> enough<00:01:41.040> depth

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
for that is I want decent enough depth

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.179 
for that is I want decent enough depth

okay<00:01:50.510> so<00:01:50.570> here's<00:01:50.900> basically<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.590> first<00:01:51.830> shot

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
okay so here's basically the first shot

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.490 
okay so here's basically the first shot
I'm<00:01:52.160> gonna<00:01:52.280> take<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:52.820> I'm<00:01:53.750> interested<00:01:54.170> in

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
I'm gonna take and I'm interested in

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.960 
I'm gonna take and I'm interested in
this<00:01:54.740> right<00:01:55.010> here<00:01:55.220> I<00:01:55.250> kind<00:01:55.490> of<00:01:55.550> liked<00:01:55.760> this

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
this right here I kind of liked this

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.120 
this right here I kind of liked this
detail<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:56.690> I<00:01:56.960> like<00:01:57.200> this<00:01:57.410> pattern<00:01:57.830> over<00:01:58.100> here

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
detail and I like this pattern over here

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.550 
detail and I like this pattern over here
and<00:01:58.460> I<00:01:58.490> want<00:01:58.670> to<00:01:58.760> try<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:58.940> compose<00:01:59.360> that<00:01:59.780> I'm<00:02:00.320> at

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
and I want to try to compose that I'm at

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.980 
and I want to try to compose that I'm at
f9<00:02:01.130> as<00:02:01.490> I<00:02:01.580> mentioned<00:02:01.940> I<00:02:02.000> wanted<00:02:02.270> some<00:02:02.480> depth<00:02:02.750> I

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
f9 as I mentioned I wanted some depth I

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.500 
f9 as I mentioned I wanted some depth I
already<00:02:03.530> told<00:02:03.710> you<00:02:03.890> that<00:02:03.920> I'm<00:02:04.100> at<00:02:04.220> ISO<00:02:04.670> 100<00:02:05.210> the

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
already told you that I'm at ISO 100 the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.180 
already told you that I'm at ISO 100 the
only<00:02:05.840> thing<00:02:06.020> I<00:02:06.140> needed<00:02:06.320> to<00:02:06.470> bring<00:02:06.650> in<00:02:06.800> line<00:02:06.980> was

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
only thing I needed to bring in line was

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.030 
only thing I needed to bring in line was
my<00:02:07.340> shutter<00:02:07.610> speed<00:02:07.700> which<00:02:08.180> I<00:02:08.300> set<00:02:08.600> at<00:02:08.810> 60<00:02:09.500> to

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
my shutter speed which I set at 60 to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.280 
my shutter speed which I set at 60 to
get<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.250> zero<00:02:10.640> exposure<00:02:11.120> so<00:02:11.660> here's<00:02:11.870> my<00:02:12.020> first

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
get a zero exposure so here's my first

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.200 
get a zero exposure so here's my first
shot<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.710> the<00:02:12.860> first<00:02:13.160> shot<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.580> always<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:13.880> test

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
shot and the first shot is always a test

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.540 
shot and the first shot is always a test
shot<00:02:14.480> not<00:02:15.230> worried<00:02:15.410> about<00:02:15.530> composition<00:02:16.310> here

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
shot not worried about composition here

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.160 
shot not worried about composition here
what<00:02:17.060> I'm<00:02:17.180> doing<00:02:17.210> is<00:02:17.480> evaluating<00:02:18.140> the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
what I'm doing is evaluating the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.320 
what I'm doing is evaluating the
exposure<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.010> first<00:02:19.310> thing<00:02:19.520> I<00:02:19.610> see<00:02:19.880> is

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
exposure and the first thing I see is

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.110 
exposure and the first thing I see is
that<00:02:20.720> I<00:02:21.110> want<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.650> brighten<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.220> shot<00:02:22.460> up<00:02:22.670> so<00:02:23.090> I

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
that I want to brighten the shot up so I

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.150 
that I want to brighten the shot up so I
actually<00:02:23.360> want<00:02:23.630> to<00:02:23.780> overexpose<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.680> because

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
actually want to overexpose it because

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.520 
actually want to overexpose it because
when<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:25.340> set<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.880> shutter<00:02:26.060> speed<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:26.750> set<00:02:27.380> it

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
when I set the shutter speed I set it

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.740 
when I set the shutter speed I set it
for<00:02:27.740> a<00:02:27.800> zero<00:02:28.220> exposure<00:02:28.700> what<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.120> camera

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
for a zero exposure what the camera

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.780 
for a zero exposure what the camera
indicated<00:02:30.500> was<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.770> correct<00:02:31.250> amount<00:02:31.640> of

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
indicated was the correct amount of

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.650 
indicated was the correct amount of
light<00:02:32.470> but<00:02:33.470> my<00:02:34.460> shutter<00:02:34.790> speed<00:02:34.880> remember<00:02:35.510> was

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
light but my shutter speed remember was

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.350 
light but my shutter speed remember was
at<00:02:35.780> one<00:02:36.020> sixtieth<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.710> second<00:02:37.130> so<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:38.240> adjust

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
at one sixtieth of a second so to adjust

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.800 
at one sixtieth of a second so to adjust
I'm<00:02:38.990> gonna<00:02:39.170> turn<00:02:39.530> my<00:02:39.740> ISO<00:02:40.400> up<00:02:40.700> one<00:02:41.180> stop<00:02:41.570> to

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
I'm gonna turn my ISO up one stop to

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.470 
I'm gonna turn my ISO up one stop to
double<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.260> amount<00:02:42.290> of<00:02:42.560> light<00:02:42.800> because<00:02:43.730> if<00:02:44.120> I

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
double the amount of light because if I

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.840 
double the amount of light because if I
drop<00:02:44.720> my<00:02:44.870> shutter<00:02:45.110> speed<00:02:45.200> down<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:46.310> one

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
drop my shutter speed down to one

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.940 
drop my shutter speed down to one
thirtieth<00:02:47.360> of<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.630> second<00:02:48.110> I'm<00:02:48.440> going<00:02:48.860> to

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
thirtieth of a second I'm going to

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.070 
thirtieth of a second I'm going to
introduce<00:02:49.160> camera<00:02:49.790> shake<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.240> I<00:02:50.540> don't<00:02:50.600> want

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
introduce camera shake and I don't want

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.110 
introduce camera shake and I don't want
that<00:02:51.290> because<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:51.680> want<00:02:51.860> to<00:02:51.920> sharp<00:02:52.160> photo<00:02:52.459> okay

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
that because I want to sharp photo okay

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.430 
that because I want to sharp photo okay
now<00:02:53.270> here<00:02:53.600> is<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.989> adjusted<00:02:54.500> shot<00:02:54.739> shot<00:02:55.250> at<00:02:55.430> f9

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
now here is the adjusted shot shot at f9

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.670 
now here is the adjusted shot shot at f9
one<00:02:57.440> sixtieth<00:02:58.040> of<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.280> second<00:02:58.700> ISO<00:02:59.270> 200<00:03:00.230> to

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
one sixtieth of a second ISO 200 to

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.650 
one sixtieth of a second ISO 200 to
brighten<00:03:01.130> it<00:03:01.190> up<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.580> I<00:03:01.640> like<00:03:01.910> this<00:03:02.150> exposure

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
brighten it up and I like this exposure

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.009 
brighten it up and I like this exposure
now<00:03:03.470> what's<00:03:03.890> left<00:03:04.130> to<00:03:04.250> do<00:03:04.430> is<00:03:04.880> a<00:03:05.019> compositional

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
now what's left to do is a compositional

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.290 
now what's left to do is a compositional
approach<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:06.739> this<00:03:07.160> test<00:03:07.430> shot<00:03:07.730> shows<00:03:08.090> that

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
approach and this test shot shows that

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.540 
approach and this test shot shows that
I'm<00:03:08.450> too<00:03:08.660> far<00:03:08.989> out<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:09.709> I'm<00:03:09.830> going<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.100> zero<00:03:10.459> in

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
I'm too far out so I'm going to zero in

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.820 
I'm too far out so I'm going to zero in
on<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.150> subject<00:03:11.840> what<00:03:12.230> I<00:03:12.260> want<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.620> do<00:03:12.709> with

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
everything works and that very simply is

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.229 
everything works and that very simply is
how<00:03:42.650> you<00:03:42.709> build<00:03:42.920> a<00:03:43.070> shot<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.850> went<00:03:44.060> pretty

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
how you build a shot it went pretty

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.630 
how you build a shot it went pretty
quick<00:03:44.570> for<00:03:44.840> me<00:03:44.959> it<00:03:45.709> took<00:03:45.920> a<00:03:45.980> bit<00:03:46.220> of<00:03:46.250> time<00:03:46.489> to

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
quick for me it took a bit of time to

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.970 
quick for me it took a bit of time to
explain<00:03:47.000> it<00:03:47.209> but<00:03:47.480> that's<00:03:47.930> basically<00:03:48.800> the

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
explain it but that's basically the

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.220 
explain it but that's basically the
process<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.580> if<00:03:49.640> use<00:03:49.850> that<00:03:50.390> flow<00:03:50.810> chart<00:03:51.170> that

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
process and if use that flow chart that

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.290 
process and if use that flow chart that
