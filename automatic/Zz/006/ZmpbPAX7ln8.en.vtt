and carrying over we will work on

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.900 
and carrying over we will work on

car but not there'll be a lot more the
basic<00:02:14.080> groundwork<00:02:14.500> of<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.190> build<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.580> done<00:02:15.900> so

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
basic groundwork of the build is done so

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.200 
basic groundwork of the build is done so
it's<00:02:17.050> now<00:02:17.140> just<00:02:17.310> development<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.970> only

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
it's now just development the the only

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.120 
it's now just development the the only
issue<00:02:19.270> with<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:19.600> is<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:19.960> up<00:02:20.470> at<00:02:20.680> home<00:02:20.860> the

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
issue with that is a up at home the

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.480 
issue with that is a up at home the
tracks<00:02:21.730> are<00:02:21.940> covered<00:02:22.090> in<00:02:22.360> snow<00:02:22.630> so<00:02:23.310> it's<00:02:24.310> going

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
tracks are covered in snow so it's going

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.390 
tracks are covered in snow so it's going
to<00:02:24.550> be<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.730> lot<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:24.970> kind<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:26.020> computer<00:02:26.400> looking

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
to be a lot of kind of computer looking

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.070 
to be a lot of kind of computer looking
at<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:27.850> know<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.120> engineer<00:02:28.540> is<00:02:28.630> looking<00:02:28.930> over

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
at you know the engineer is looking over

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.140 
at you know the engineer is looking over
things<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.590> figure<00:02:30.220> out<00:02:30.400> what<00:02:30.640> we<00:02:30.730> need<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:31.000> do

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
things to figure out what we need to do

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.940 
things to figure out what we need to do
to<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.750> come<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.050> daytona<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.530> be<00:02:32.800> more

to to come to daytona and be more

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.310
