00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.400
 I'm going to ask you a simple question 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:09.500
 between two foods one original and another 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.709
 modified in the laboratory so that 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.529
 lose one of your best properties 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:17.869
 which one to choose and aix sure that all 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:21.189
 you will think that the first but the 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.550
 reality tells us that the second 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:27.490
 welcome to the reef 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.980
 It may seem crazy but it 's like that 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.010
 More and more people are buying 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.660
 watermelon seedless variety that also 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.559
 It is usually more expensive than normal watermelon 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.260
 when we talk about modified products 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.350
 genetically or transgenic foods 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.610
 we automatically think of soybeans or 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:52.960
 corn and we are not aware that they are not 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:57.129
 the only ones the watermelon without seeds can 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.469
 be one of them many will say no 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.809
 that seedless watermelons carry 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.629
 occurring in Japan since the 1930s 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.260
 and that it will be enough to cross several plants to 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.840
 get it 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.910
 and this is true enough to cross a 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.630
 diploid watermelon plant that is to say with 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:17.090
 two sets of chromosomes with another 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.480
 tetraploid that is with four games 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.500
 of chromosomes the result will be a 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.170
 watermelon without seeds or triploids what 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.380
 we have not that that is viable 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.450
 small scale is feasible but for 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.030
 agricultural holdings is more 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.370
 complicated a large exploitation of 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.920
 watermelon in which we want to obtain fruits 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.950
 no seeds would have to be shared 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.710
 with normal plants that is to say sow 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.260
 one row with normal watermelon and another with 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.540
 watermelon without seeds since you do not do this 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.510
 would imply that the latter are not 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.920
 politicize with which simply not 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.110
 I would have fruits 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.750
 for that reason and so that there is no confusion 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.740
 they usually plant two varieties together 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.330
 some stripes and the other typical dark green 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.460
 so they can control which ones are 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.220
 they have seeds and what is the variety 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.410
 without seeds 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.230
 but as if this was little complicated 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.240
 already in itself there is also to apply to the 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.850
 flower of the seedless variety 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.730
 chemicals that work like 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.310
 aux-in as since the hybrid pollen does not 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.500
 is fertile so first of all 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.170
 is that you need more staff 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.480
 you have to divide half the land in 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.810
 the variety with pips and the other half 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.290
 without seeds you have to dedicate more staff 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.400
 paris flower to flower applying by hand you are 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:45.280
 absÃ­n as and also you have to spend 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.800
 money in buying liquids some 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.530
 quite dangerous as is the case with 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.069
 toxic isopropyl acetate by 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.579
 inhalation 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.319
 therefore it is becoming more common 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.280
 avoid the problem by modifying 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:04.060
 genetically the plant 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.800
 and all this mess for not taking some 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.930
 simple nuggets 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.140
 whatever it is or we have to face 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.960
 with watermelons genetically modified or 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:19.330
 well with crosses of watermelons to which of 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:22.750
 pollinate by hand with chemicals 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.750
 any of the solutions 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.370
 but the most curious thing about this story 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:30.349
 comes all this effort all this 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.430
 genetic manipulation and all this 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:38.390
 chemistry to remove from the watermelon one of 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.700
 its best components the seeds 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.580
 Watermelons rich in beta-carotene 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.590
 lycopene and a long etcetera but it is the 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.150
 nugget the most interesting 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.550
 I'm not going to talk about proteins 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.650
 vitamins or minerals that contain 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.709
 these seeds nor their usefulness 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.990
 against intestinal parasites but from 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.420
 something even more amazing 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.760
 the curcumin 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.220
 this terpenoid found in the 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.959
 watermelon seeds is being 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.060
 investigated as therapy against 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.350
 cancer because it has properties 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.020
 antitumor 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.270
 In vitro tests of this substance gave 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.160
 as a result a differential toxicity 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:23.070
 in certain types of tumors 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.400
 especially melanomas 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.770
 once again all the effort all the 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.100
 industry's effort to remove from the 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.050
 watermelon one of its best properties and 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.120
 all because people do not want to do the 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:41.610
 effort to remove a few simple seeds 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:45.070
 seeds that also hide a possible 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.890
 cancer shock therapy 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.740
 and the most ridiculous of all to remove 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:53.500
 these antitumor seeds we do 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.500
 either with genetic engineering or a 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.170
 base of chemical pollinators that since 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.020
 then far from avoiding cancer they could 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.780
 even induce 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.900
 once again the industry's effort 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:11.139
 at the service of watermelon marketing without 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.330
 square watermelon seeds with less 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.120
 amount of water or new colors 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.580
 yellow watermelons rejecting the already very 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.729
 seen red red he keeps in his 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:25.089
 lycopene interior 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:28.240
 are or added to this absurdity a 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:30.610
 final reflection is curious the harmony of 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.009
 nature with man one of the 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.349
 most consumed fruits when the sun 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:38.860
 heats many times responsible for 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:41.949
 melanomas is precisely a fruit that 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.729
 inside keeps the secret against 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:47.789
 this type of cancer 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.830
 but the fashion expelled from the fruit the 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:54.470
 secret that you have been saving for 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:56.750
 centuries the watermelon inside 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.550
 and we still wonder how it is that 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.980
 years ago people will sunbathe without 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:04.050
 protection and nothing will happen to them 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:08.000
 and that is that every time we put more 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:10.670
 Complicated things to nature 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.390
 in our next video we'll talk about 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.849
 the nutritional and healing properties 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.219
 of watermelon 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:21.369
 I hope to see you in that next video and I 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:23.969
 I encourage you to subscribe here to
