00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.559
 very good and we are again for 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.299
 bring you a new mode for minecraft 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.189
 17.2 called dimensional pocket is another 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.990
 mocha mode and works with forked 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.660
 so do not forget not to install it 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.919
 first of all the mod consists of this 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.470
 in this block that we have here that 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.360
 It's pretty cool and do not panic 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.430
 guys that although I say that the mode 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.710
 consists of a block consists of a lot 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.780
 more than is the inner world that has 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.399
 the block or is it a pass because 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.809
 when we give right click we enter 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.390
 inside the block there are fixed the 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.070
 particles that cool and as you see 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.109
 we are inside the block we are inside 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.999
 from an area of ​​16 x 16 in a new 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:49.030
 dimension as you see we have pocket 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:51.219
 dimension and here we can really put 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.539
 what we want as we 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.789
 You see, it 's because many repeaters 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.079
 then I will tell you why but we are going to 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.449
 start by fiddling all the 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.210
 things that are four castles of nothing 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.519
 they are very easy and the first one would be this 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.040
 worth a book more leather would not be the guide 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.780
 of the mod is worth the one of the module that we 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.030
 going to say is how can we use it and 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.950
 but of course I read the guide of the 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.120
 mod I have seen that there is one thing one 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.560
 feature that is not yet 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.479
 developed in the mod because because 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.730
 this mode was developed in 48 hours and not 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.190
 gave time 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.290
 to create the form surely in the 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.050
 future or really in a few weeks 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.610
 surely that will be so guys 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.800
 this is the castle of the guide after 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.210
 we have the crafter of the under glass 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.090
 this is what we need at least 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.980
 one to be able to create a block after 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.480
 we have the crystal cne crater 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.580
 of the circus we need you like 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.670
 forces of the en and the cne of the two 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.380
 together and finally we have the crafter 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.060
 of the dimensional pocket that is this 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.920
 block that we have here not then 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.780
 we need four bricks of 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.290
 stone two iron the leander and the 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.380
 never crystal and a block of diamond 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.270
 then I think it is expensive but the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.250
 true that the truth is that it is 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.350
 quite good because we have a 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.200
 area where they will not expose any 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.120
 way in which we can create what 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.250
 we want and in the future this is 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.110
 something that should have explained but 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.130
 that I have not done it because he is still 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.830
 the characteristic still in a 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.440
 developed not because it can be introduced 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.450
 rest systems and compact the inside 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.920
 of the block is worth this is that 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.930
 we put a circuit of remains 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.420
 within this area it is worth and for example 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.700
 we take the circuit to 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.110
 and using this repeated for example we 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.330
 We carry the rest signal out 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.410
 of the block and we are looking towards the 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.540
 West 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.480
 Well, if we left this block 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.130
 example is worth what this is 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.959
 is that for example I'm going 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.930
 looking to the west that will be 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.200
 there and when I know the repeater 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.120
 then it will get the rest signal according to how 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.709
 be within the block means that if 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.989
 for example we have a clock or we have 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.090
 a super complex system of Reston 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.040
 we need then I do not know maybe 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.130
 we also have like in blogs and others and 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.310
 It all depends on these blogs as commas 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:05.459
 this system puts everything inside this 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.640
 just block this block just that there's 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.100
 2000 as I'm talking no and then I 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.580
 I think it would be a very easy way and 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.709
 very simple to be able to reduce in size 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.690
 minus the rest systems then 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:23.310
 let's go back in because even 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.870
 within this block between 16 by 16 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.480
 we can also put other blocks or 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.190
 we can reduce this until the end 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.200
 so then for example has put here 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.080
 one 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.090
 the so-called house and when we entered 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.489
 we are inside one another 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.080
 we enter a small base is that I 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.120
 I have been left quite out 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.810
 It is also inside another 16 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.300
 x 16 and I have decorated it as I wanted 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.580
 not then the outside wall I have not 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.920
 broken as you see is still here but 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.630
 I have created my little personal area 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.610
 in which I put the chests now that 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.540
 I have set the table settling the 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:02.360
 anvil the kilns and so on and over here 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.730
 I've also made a very cool hole that 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.799
 also because it has entered me inside 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.209
 this area and I think it pretty cool 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.579
 apart from the chests that I have also 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.829
 put not then which surprises do not 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:15.470
 we need light because this is self 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.180
 illuminate these blocks light up so 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.609
 we do not need to put a torch or anything 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.919
 that and I think it's pretty cool 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.720
 let's go back down and I'll show you 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.060
 to wii I have to close this door 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.669
 because if I do not stay calm for 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.940
 to be able to go out we need to give him more 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.650
 right click is ok but to press shift 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.530
 maquinter that is not valid in any area 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.940
 ok good we have to point out at least 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.460
 some of the blocks 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.460
 in this way it is worth then we do shift 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.080
 Right click we go to the bona outside the 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.330
 block and if we want to get out of here 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.190
 we put to press shipman right click and 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.830
 we went to lover world, which is the 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.090
 normal dimension and so ends we are 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.070
 guys, so I do not expect anything 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.690
 liked a lot I think it's cool 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.390
 quite if well press like and favorites 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.050
 see you in the next video 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.050
 see you later
