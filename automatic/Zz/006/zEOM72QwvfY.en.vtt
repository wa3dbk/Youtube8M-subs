00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.210
 so why in chief easy for them several cases 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.760
 scratch pad 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.050
 to appreciate the wheel of the mouse see see one side so many 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.159
 deposits 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.199
 however in case of failure we need that 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.199
 at the bottom we have organ donation 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.300
 the city 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.060
 a script on mac cdm so I do the time on the spot the pressure was a little 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.080
 and I move in person 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.340
 like these 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.340
 move it after 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.960
 I press the door to solve 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.240
 so be careful 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.600
 in hand for their fees as best as possible 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.160
 necib thiney points behind 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.280
 like this case 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.030
 these vegetables removed 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.840
 these artifices 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.840
 it's better to put a little bit on the side it's like that 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.780
 so I'm going to delete these three civil parties 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.780
 but the police 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.480
 during the whole week 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.710
 and the safest 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.710
 remove knight bertille 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.660
 we will wait under the bridges and in the basements 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.660
 so there we did fly that is much bigger 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.300
 and we have one who knows that he is very quickly swiss 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.300
 french this effect the eu 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.360
 in the mirror a fall when he goes on foot must not break the effect 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.080
 mirror above 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.850
 I am on facebook 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.640
 on the little arrow 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.930
 we pass slightly above the average it's a whole range 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.430
 we move from his target 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.450
 why now 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.480
 if the dogs 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.480
 disaster 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.150
 I will try here opacity 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.610
 so I select his four points 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.869
 by pressing nantes the rights of a people on shift of course 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:13.389
 I press tf1 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:15.739
 to create a dark side 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.409
 so if you do not remember what often happens that shortcuts 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.059
 keyboard he came here who are there 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:23.009
 ph for example if if 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.009
 but he is disputed 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:29.269
 in the whole world 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.989
 in selecting these two points m 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.389
 it's my worst 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:35.769
 no 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.019
 the five divisions 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.019
 so I pe-cho doubled just lisbon 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:42.599
 he presses on the spot 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.599
 which allows to have 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:49.769
 without notice 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.539
 little character 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.539
 we will stand in front of the profile goal of m 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.669
 rather warfare 3 3 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.469
 and we're going here you're the mirror effect 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:06.439
 who to what 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.439
 finally we will be able to work in the station 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:12.279
 in the center 3 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:15.279
 I support following revelations 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:20.719
 but I will be able to select 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.789
 all points of view 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:26.139
 you probably do not know 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.449
 I am a fan 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:31.449
 law 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:40.559
 or against 3 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:43.149
 and then especially the Aleppo pine 

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:46.149
 and put them in the heart 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.989
 but it's very very ugly 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.169
 is replacing itself in the edition investors fear that in my bed 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.169
 with a bowl 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.599
 but moving second point 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.669
 I do not get tired 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:22.630
 to understand 3
