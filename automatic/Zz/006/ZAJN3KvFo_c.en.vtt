proud of how party she came out last out
here<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.640> I'll<00:00:54.629> show<00:00:54.899> you

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
here and I'll show you

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.540 
here and I'll show you
we've<00:00:56.969> got<00:00:57.120> LEDs<00:00:57.600> here<00:00:57.960> as<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.230> see

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
we've got LEDs here as you can see

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.889 
we've got LEDs here as you can see
regular<00:00:59.550> light<00:00:59.730> bulbs<00:01:00.120> up<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> other

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
regular light bulbs up in the other

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.630 
regular light bulbs up in the other
spots<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:03.559> reflow<00:01:04.559> solder<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.280> all<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
spots but reflow solder and all the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.380 
spots but reflow solder and all the
displays<00:01:06.600> we<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:08.490> original<00:01:08.880> logic<00:01:09.000> for

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
displays we have the original logic for

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.090 
displays we have the original logic for
we<00:01:09.540> took<00:01:09.689> all<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.409> chips<00:01:10.680> out<00:01:10.920> and

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
we took all this and chips out and

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.910 
we took all this and chips out and
cleaned<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:12.090> silver<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:13.290> legs<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
cleaned the silver the legs on the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.080 
cleaned the silver the legs on the
eeproms<00:01:15.020> they<00:01:16.020> get<00:01:16.340> tarnished<00:01:17.340> because<00:01:17.729> it's

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
eeproms they get tarnished because it's

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.999 
eeproms they get tarnished because it's
real<00:01:18.270> silver<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.930> we<00:01:19.020> clean<00:01:19.320> them<00:01:19.439> carefully

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
real silver so we clean them carefully

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.460 
real silver so we clean them carefully
with<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> fiberglass<00:01:20.640> eraser<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:22.170> put<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
with a fiberglass eraser we put the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.410 
with a fiberglass eraser we put the
battery<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:23.070> here<00:01:23.100> lithium<00:01:23.820> battery<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.360> it

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
battery in here lithium battery so it

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.700 
battery in here lithium battery so it
won't<00:01:24.540> leak<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.869> had<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> little<00:01:25.320> bit<00:01:25.590> of

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
won't leak we had a little bit of

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.679 
won't leak we had a little bit of
battery<00:01:26.009> damage<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:26.430> cleaned<00:01:26.729> up<00:01:26.850> but<00:01:27.509> now<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
battery damage we cleaned up but now the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.660 
battery damage we cleaned up but now the
battery<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.290> be<00:01:28.409> changed<00:01:28.860> easily<00:01:29.009> down<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
battery can be changed easily down the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.800 
battery can be changed easily down the
road<00:01:30.079> we<00:01:31.079> also<00:01:31.700> change<00:01:32.700> some<00:01:32.790> transistors<00:01:33.420> on

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
road we also change some transistors on

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.740 
road we also change some transistors on
lamp<00:01:34.140> driver<00:01:34.439> board<00:01:34.799> new<00:01:35.460> capacitor<00:01:36.210> up<00:01:36.390> here

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
lamp driver board new capacitor up here

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.580 
lamp driver board new capacitor up here
I'll<00:01:37.680> also<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.340> here<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.150> few<00:01:39.689> transistors<00:01:40.229> we

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
I'll also have here a few transistors we

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.609 
I'll also have here a few transistors we
changed<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.700> bridge<00:01:42.270> rectifiers<00:01:42.960> have<00:01:43.439> been

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
changed the bridge rectifiers have been

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.429 
changed the bridge rectifiers have been
changed<00:01:44.070> here<00:01:44.490> we<00:01:45.060> got<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.420> new<00:01:45.540> heavier<00:01:45.960> duty

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
changed here we got the new heavier duty

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.520 
changed here we got the new heavier duty
ones<00:01:47.090> with<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> big<00:01:48.360> thick<00:01:48.630> leg<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.380> to

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
ones with a big thick leg so you have to

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.230 
ones with a big thick leg so you have to
slightly<00:01:49.890> drill<00:01:50.310> out<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.640> holes<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.090> make

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
slightly drill out the holes to make

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.330 
slightly drill out the holes to make
them<00:01:51.390> fit<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.409> makes<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.890> light<00:01:53.070> see<00:01:53.280> a

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
them fit but it makes the light see a

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.010 
them fit but it makes the light see a
little<00:01:53.729> bit<00:01:53.939> brighter<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.689> we're<00:01:54.869> really

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
little bit brighter so we're really

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.260 
little bit brighter so we're really
happy<00:01:55.320> at<00:01:55.590> how<00:01:55.740> well<00:01:56.250> they<00:01:56.430> work<00:01:58.430> game<00:01:59.430> looks

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
happy at how well they work game looks

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.900 
happy at how well they work game looks
great<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:01.200> plays<00:02:01.500> great

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
great and plays great

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.810 
great and plays great
we<00:02:03.450> are<00:02:03.570> actually<00:02:03.810> gonna<00:02:04.580> bring<00:02:05.580> this<00:02:05.760> back

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
we are actually gonna bring this back

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:14.510 
we are actually gonna bring this back
out<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.450> man<00:02:06.660> who<00:02:06.690> owns<00:02:12.710> chime<00:02:13.710> coils<00:02:14.220> as<00:02:14.400> you

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
out the man who owns chime coils as you

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.660 
out the man who owns chime coils as you
can<00:02:14.670> hear<00:02:15.830> you<00:02:16.830> know<00:02:16.920> what<00:02:17.070> else<00:02:17.250> we<00:02:17.370> have<00:02:17.400> to

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
can hear you know what else we have to

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.690 
can hear you know what else we have to
change<00:02:20.240> we're<00:02:21.240> broken<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.320> know<00:02:22.440> why

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
change we're broken and you know why

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.890 
change we're broken and you know why
this<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:24.030> that<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:24.690> much<00:02:24.870> applies<00:02:26.420> just<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.600> huge

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
this is that so much applies just a huge

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:35.120 
this is that so much applies just a huge
huge<00:02:28.050> hit<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:31.500> was<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.280> big<00:02:33.950> response<00:02:34.950> if

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
huge hit so that was a big response if

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:47.480 
huge hit so that was a big response if
you<00:02:35.220> can<00:02:35.400> see<00:02:35.610> how<00:02:35.820> well<00:02:46.070> you<00:02:47.070> could<00:02:47.310> have

those endless special games but every

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.670 
those endless special games but every
time<00:03:03.239> you<00:03:03.300> as<00:03:03.630> long<00:03:03.870> as<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.080> don't<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.470> ball

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680
