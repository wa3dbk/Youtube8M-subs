00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.820
 friends of the fake 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.860
 hello amx2 the passionate shop 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.070
 shows you how to make a 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.070
 pinhole with a can 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:23.180
 for that we will need plastic 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:26.810
 darkening black and and a bomb of 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:31.250
 matte black paint a can of 33 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:34.610
 centilitres empty a box opener a 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.489
 elastic tape of electrician and 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.820
 peace and dark colors and a 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.600
 very fine pin eventually we 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.680
 can also bring us a felt 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.720
 to load the bobbin 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.560
 we will need photo paper 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.560
 silver 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.400
 at first with 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.530
 the can opener we remove the top 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.760
 of the can, being careful 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.760
 not to cut oneself 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.830
 we must remove the dust and 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.310
 smooth the edge to remove any 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.380
 sharp part 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.690
 then with the black paint spray 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:53.810
 we cover the whole interior of the 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:55.070
 can and we let it dry a 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.560
 dry paint 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.740
 we take our fine needle and we 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.020
 making a net hole halfway up the 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.730
 duckling 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.910
 it is possible to mark the circumference 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:11.900
 hole with felt to facilitate 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.430
 the manipulation thereafter we 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.890
 then cut a piece of Scotch 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.230
 of electrician that we are bent 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.260
 to be able to detach him later 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.260
 easily 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.380
 we apply scotch 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.580
 the hole 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.120
 laughing at not folding him because he 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.530
 could let some light 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.690
 to check that the tape and well 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.700
 positioned we can look at 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.700
 inside if the light does not pass 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:57.360
 we will now load our 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.940
 cans for those ci we put ourselves 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.360
 in a dark room with a light 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.930
 in actinic it must be spotted 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.590
 tape that hides the lens and take 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.500
 silver paper 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:17.540
 we open the paper and taking out a 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:21.270
 leaf we fold the leaf in half 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.390
 to be able to cut on paper 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.930
 the bigger we multiply it 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:33.630
 pieces to get a paper 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:37.830
 about 10 by 7 cm we close 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.200
 well the remaining paper and put it to 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.680
 away from light 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:47.340
 when we illuminate to load the 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.010
 bobbin we spot the face of the paper 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.960
 who is brilliant 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:58.320
 this is the sensitive side the other side 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:01.680
 not being sensitive to light we 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.620
 so let's put the paper in the can 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.520
 putting the shiny side 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:12.270
 the opposite of the pinhole we 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:15.270
 check that the hole is well 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.270
 the other side of the paper and let's do 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:21.020
 so that the paper is balanced 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.790
 two sides of the hole compared to 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:26.190
 the opposite of the younger 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:31.830
 to finish we cover the can 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.930
 with the thick plastic that will prevent 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.910
 the entrance light and we close with 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.800
 elastic 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.310
 we check that there is no 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.990
 plastic on the lens 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.520
 when you remove the tape you do not need 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.620
 not that there is a piece of plastic 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.000
 who come g 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.590
 the light to take a picture there 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.440
 just take off the tape the time 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.010
 needed to fix the light it takes 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:01.430
 count 15 to 20 seconds outside 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:03.470
 25 to 30 seconds inside as he 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.710
 do not move that time we 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.020
 can help us with a tripod for 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:13.729
 finish just close the goal 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:15.380
 with the tape to shoot the photo 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:19.130
 have to dive into a developer 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.160
 and then a stop bath in a fixer and 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.760
 to finish rinse with water 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:28.010
 but this will be the subject of our guide 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.910
 good photos and see you soon for a 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.910
 new tutorial
