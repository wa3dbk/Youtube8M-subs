00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
feet now both of these look pretty good

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.660 
feet now both of these look pretty good
from<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.150> hip<00:01:21.390> hinge<00:01:21.740> standpoint<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:23.070> there

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
from a hip hinge standpoint but there

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.960 
from a hip hinge standpoint but there
are<00:01:23.820> definitely<00:01:24.030> not<00:01:24.630> what<00:01:25.020> we<00:01:25.259> want<00:01:25.970> there

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
are definitely not what we want there

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.370 
are definitely not what we want there
there's<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.390> big<00:01:27.570> difference<00:01:27.780> between<00:01:28.200> what's

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
there's a big difference between what's

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.200 
there's a big difference between what's
happening<00:01:28.829> there<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.460> when<00:01:29.790> you're<00:01:29.909> tipping

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
happening there so when you're tipping

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.460 
happening there so when you're tipping
forward<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.689> you're<00:01:30.990> placing<00:01:31.200> way

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
forward like this you're placing way

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.200 
forward like this you're placing way
more<00:01:31.680> strain<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.220> lower<00:01:32.400> back<00:01:32.670> you're<00:01:33.090> not

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
more strain on the lower back you're not

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.210 
more strain on the lower back you're not
quite<00:01:33.450> getting<00:01:33.600> into<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> hips<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.439> well<00:01:34.619> when

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
quite getting into the hips as well when

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.410 
quite getting into the hips as well when
you're<00:01:35.340> keeping<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.759> shoulders<00:01:36.090> moreover

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
you're keeping the shoulders moreover

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.179 
you're keeping the shoulders moreover
the<00:01:36.600> feet<00:01:36.900> we're<00:01:37.320> getting<00:01:37.619> back<00:01:37.799> into<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the feet we're getting back into the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.190 
the feet we're getting back into the
hips<00:01:38.400> taking<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.119> strain<00:01:39.450> off<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> lower

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.899 
hips taking that strain off of the lower
back<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:41.250> make<00:01:41.430> sure<00:01:41.460> you're<00:01:41.729> keeping

engaged and get tall and thin at the top
okay<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.900> then<00:03:22.140> you're<00:03:22.290> just<00:03:22.320> going<00:03:22.590> to

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
okay and then you're just going to

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.060 
okay and then you're just going to
repeat<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.600> that<00:03:24.600> movement<00:03:24.840> there<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:25.650> but

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
repeat that that movement there so but

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.620 
repeat that that movement there so but
the<00:03:26.220> start<00:03:26.579> it's<00:03:26.820> very<00:03:26.970> important<00:03:27.480> it's<00:03:27.600> a

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
the start it's very important it's a

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.300 
the start it's very important it's a
couple<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:27.959> different<00:03:28.200> ways<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.380> start<00:03:29.130> it

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
couple of different ways to start it

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.069 
couple of different ways to start it
fact<00:03:29.820> I've<00:03:29.970> got<00:03:30.150> some<00:03:30.329> videos<00:03:30.630> that<00:03:30.660> show

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
fact I've got some videos that show

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.560 
fact I've got some videos that show
different<00:03:31.920> ways<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.070> start<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:32.670> but<00:03:32.850> in<00:03:33.120> my

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
different ways to start it but in my

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.960 
different ways to start it but in my
many<00:03:34.260> years<00:03:34.350> of<00:03:34.709> teaching<00:03:35.160> this<00:03:35.400> exercise

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
many years of teaching this exercise

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.170 
many years of teaching this exercise
this<00:03:36.600> is<00:03:36.750> by<00:03:37.049> far<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.920> best<00:03:38.489> way<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.790> start

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
this is by far the best way to start

start doing your reps the two things

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.230 
start doing your reps the two things
that<00:04:21.079> I<00:04:21.169> found<00:04:21.410> really<00:04:21.560> help<00:04:21.949> people<00:04:22.240> again

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
that I found really help people again

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.409 
that I found really help people again
get<00:04:23.479> more<00:04:23.630> out<00:04:23.750> of<00:04:23.780> this<00:04:23.900> exercise<00:04:24.289> is

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
get more out of this exercise is

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.540 
get more out of this exercise is
focusing<00:04:26.419> on<00:04:26.630> you<00:04:27.470> know<00:04:27.530> talk<00:04:27.800> about<00:04:28.039> but<00:04:28.310> back

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
focusing on you know talk about but back

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.640 
focusing on you know talk about but back
shuts<00:04:28.940> down<00:04:29.150> you<00:04:29.600> definitely<00:04:29.810> want<00:04:30.289> that<00:04:30.350> you

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
shuts down you definitely want that you

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.499 
shuts down you definitely want that you
want<00:04:30.830> to<00:04:30.889> push<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.100> butt<00:04:31.430> back<00:04:31.669> and<00:04:31.970> let<00:04:32.389> the

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 
want to push the butt back and let the

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:34.330 
want to push the butt back and let the
choughs<00:04:32.780> come<00:04:33.050> down<00:04:33.320> but<00:04:33.889> like<00:04:34.010> I<00:04:34.130> mentioned

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
choughs come down but like I mentioned

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.279 
choughs come down but like I mentioned
earlier<00:04:34.639> more<00:04:35.060> than<00:04:35.210> that<00:04:35.419> you<00:04:35.840> really<00:04:36.139> want

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
earlier more than that you really want

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:38.790 
earlier more than that you really want
to<00:04:36.380> focus<00:04:36.560> on<00:04:36.889> trying<00:04:37.160> to<00:04:37.310> keep<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.669> shoulders

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
to focus on trying to keep the shoulders

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.460 
to focus on trying to keep the shoulders
over<00:04:39.800> your<00:04:40.130> base<00:04:40.610> of<00:04:40.850> support<00:04:41.320> instead<00:04:42.320> of

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
over your base of support instead of

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.520 
over your base of support instead of
tipping<00:04:43.010> forward<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:43.789> this<00:04:44.180> is<00:04:44.389> very<00:04:44.960> common

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
tipping forward and this is very common

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.340 
tipping forward and this is very common
with<00:04:46.310> people<00:04:46.550> that<00:04:46.820> do<00:04:47.030> swings<00:04:47.510> is<00:04:47.870> this

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
with people that do swings is this

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.550 
with people that do swings is this
tipping<00:04:49.010> motion<00:04:49.220> right<00:04:49.639> here<00:04:50.240> as<00:04:50.419> opposed<00:04:51.289> to

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
tipping motion right here as opposed to

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.860 
tipping motion right here as opposed to
sitting<00:04:51.949> the<00:04:52.190> hips<00:04:52.220> back<00:04:52.610> and<00:04:53.060> keeping<00:04:53.750> the

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
sitting the hips back and keeping the

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.900 
sitting the hips back and keeping the
solar<00:04:54.139> so<00:04:54.410> if<00:04:54.470> you<00:04:54.590> focus<00:04:54.949> on<00:04:55.130> that<00:04:55.310> if<00:04:55.490> you

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
solar so if you focus on that if you

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.939 
solar so if you focus on that if you
kind<00:04:56.300> of<00:04:56.360> keep<00:04:56.510> that<00:04:56.690> in<00:04:56.810> mind<00:04:56.990> you'll<00:04:57.590> find

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
kind of keep that in mind you'll find

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.740 
kind of keep that in mind you'll find
