00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:17.830
 where it does not take shila from this thin and 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.830

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:47.739

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:23.510
 further interesting wedge 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.510
 caches

 and the last item 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.920
 this opener st-1 must be noted that 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.460
 Soviet-era openers were 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.550
 quite peculiar reduce grab 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.220
 Crescent this very often met 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.430
 on knives somewhere in the seventies there 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.590
 sixties after that 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.800
 Soviet manufacturer switched all the same 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.370
 on standard openers western 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.390
 to sample 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.380
 but I think so in the western way 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.040
 note that 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.350
 what is kai here not small that is 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.510
 if we take an ordinary swiss knife 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.540
 that is, you can see that in the headquarters and 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:18.530
 here is much less I 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.480
 asked the older generation for 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.780
 what could be exactly such 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.330
 small what on with so small 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.400
 hibernating for which he received an answer that 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.150
 Soviet times were really 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.160
 bottles with narrower folders on like 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.070
 it is not Russian butts and paws 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.970
 narrower diameter nothing could 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.460
 to target 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:46.280
