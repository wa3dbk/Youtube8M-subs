00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.580
 we have a super vitamin juice and 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.480
 energetic before going to the track 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.489
 dancing this unloaded juice player is 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.489
 dynastic you have to try this smoothie 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.540
 of seaweed here you have fruits of the forest 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.160
 spooky it seems that doing these 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.720
 so sophisticated smoothies it takes quite 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.489
 I work frank and I go out to your 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.489
 measure and if you do not like you stick us 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.800
 and that I have suddenly entered from so much 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.800
 dance 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:03.170
 the law when violated hosted 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.420
 frankness that's why we've come as 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.690
 feline but static with a hint of 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.690
 mint 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.390
 but how am I going to enjoy 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.380
 This has slightly less selling 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.380
 tuna 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.560
 this theme a bit of lemon zest 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.560
 then I remove it cools what 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
 orange 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.140
 these oranges are not but the winds 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.560
 carriers 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.560
 two 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.539
 what is that 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:54.149
 it's not bad I'd love to hate it 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.149
 but look now 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.240
 and I will take what they have taken from 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.240
 give me a friend 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.500
 I raised 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.500
 souls 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.970
