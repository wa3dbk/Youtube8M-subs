studies<00:04:05.870> that<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:06.590> rainbow<00:04:07.069> is<00:04:07.250> merely<00:04:07.730> a

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
studies that a rainbow is merely a

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.979 
studies that a rainbow is merely a
collection<00:04:08.750> of<00:04:09.230> many<00:04:09.769> drops<00:04:10.160> of<00:04:10.430> water<00:04:10.989> the

collection of many drops of water the

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.440 
collection of many drops of water the
sunlight<00:04:12.530> shines<00:04:12.980> through<00:04:13.610> it<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:13.970> creates

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
colors it is one of nature's miracles I

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.949 
colors it is one of nature's miracles I
do<00:04:18.410> not<00:04:18.769> think<00:04:19.130> in<00:04:19.430> reality<00:04:19.669> we<00:04:20.419> could<00:04:20.630> slide

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
do not think in reality we could slide

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.409 
do not think in reality we could slide
upon<00:04:21.530> it<00:04:21.739> because<00:04:22.310> it<00:04:22.550> is<00:04:22.850> but<00:04:23.180> over

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
upon it because it is but over

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.070 
upon it because it is but over
reflection<00:04:24.290> of<00:04:24.440> light<00:04:24.950> I<00:04:25.310> believe<00:04:25.930> sliding<00:04:26.930> on

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
reflection of light I believe sliding on

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.670 
reflection of light I believe sliding on
a<00:04:27.110> rainbow<00:04:27.410> is<00:04:27.770> like<00:04:27.950> believing<00:04:28.550> in<00:04:28.700> a<00:04:28.850> dream

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
a rainbow is like believing in a dream

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.360 
a rainbow is like believing in a dream
the<00:04:30.790> possibilities<00:04:31.790> are<00:04:31.820> endless<00:04:32.090> a<00:04:33.250> pot<00:04:34.250> of

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
the possibilities are endless a pot of

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.060 
the possibilities are endless a pot of
gold<00:04:34.540> that<00:04:35.540> would<00:04:35.690> depend<00:04:36.050> on<00:04:36.290> how<00:04:36.680> we<00:04:36.740> define

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
gold that would depend on how we define

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.110 
gold that would depend on how we define
bold<00:04:37.760> I<00:04:38.000> think<00:04:38.479> if<00:04:38.810> we<00:04:39.650> allow<00:04:40.220> ourselves<00:04:40.550> to
