 the transfer of the graphic part to 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.380

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.390
 transfer of 176 gigabytes per 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.000
 second its storage capacity 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.040

 also a motion sensor the 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.190
 conditions of abuse of playstation 4 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.840
 is that it does not have a regional limit 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.060
 you need to connect the internet you can 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.000

 Year to Spain and its price will be 3 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.870
 99 that does not include the playstation 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.019
 camera that has to be purchased separately 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.780
 for the recommended price of 49 euros and 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.540
 we have one Xbox console 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.290
 new generation of microsoft also 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.870
 has new accessories kinect 2.0 and a 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.209
 new wireless controller the xbox one 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.670
 it has an amd 8 processor inside 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:47.409
 cores and an amd radeon graphics card 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.299
 of last generation his memory is 8 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:52.209
 gb ddr3 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:55.569
 and it has a transfer rate between 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.090
 the graphic part and the 68 processor 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.120
 gigabytes per second its capacity to 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.310
 storage is 500 gigabytes the x 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.230
 one not only premieres concept for 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.780
 microsoft since it stops being just one 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.790
 console to become a center of 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.280
 home entertainment but that 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.980
 also launches new design a design 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.510
 more square with duality finishes the 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.550
 part more mate and another part more 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.380
 bright in the 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.360
 ahead we can see the slot 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.250
 blu-ray that will be where they are introduced 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.880
 the game discs here we can see 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:30.450
 also kinect 2 that has a very design 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.400
 similar to that of the xbox one and that now 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.220
 allows us to use it in conditions of 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.860
 low light is more accurate and it is also more 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.200
 angular on the other hand we have the command 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.290
 which is the design very similar to 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.930
 previous xbox driver and that has 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.210
 now vibrating triggers in the part 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.070
 from behind we have all the connections the 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.900
 connection to plug into the network 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:58.020
 electric an output hdmi an input 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:02.790
 optical audio we also have an input 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:05.190
 hdmi two usb ports 3.0 the connection 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.170
 kinect we also have a port 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.850
 infrared that is not going to 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.900
 use but that would be for futures 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.670
 accessories we have the ethernet connection 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.040
 gb 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.680
 on the other side we have another 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.530
 usb port the conditions of use of the 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.210
 xbox one require a connection to 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.820
 internet because the console will have to 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.500
 connect once at least every 24 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.100
 hours the games will not be retro 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.200
 compatible with the xbox 360 plus the 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.750
 game loan can be made only 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.730
 only once to a single person and 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.889
 neither will the market be accessible 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.290
 second hand except in establishments 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.790
 authorized to do so 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.919
 games will have a regional limit is 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.200
 say a game from the us can not play 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.479
 in a European console the catalog of 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.370
 games will have 32 focuses exclusively as 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.310
 for example quantum break and force 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.070
 motosport or 5 also rise are the 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.410
 bronze and of course will also have 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.780
 of halo but to play we will have it 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.880
 to wait for 2014 one of the great 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.950
 attractive of xbox one is its improved 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.600
 smart glass that allows us to see in a 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.000
 mobile device for example in this 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.860
 tablet additional information e 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.180
 interact not only with the contents 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.400
 multimedia but of course with 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.440
 videogames the xbox one will be 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.199
 available in the Spanish market 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:26.070
 from the month of November at a price 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:28.970
 recommended of 499 euros within this 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.970
 price is included
