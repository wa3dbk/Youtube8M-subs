00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.119
 home 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.780
 noticed that here she seemed to be 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.740
 here you can make a new one from any side 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.080

 I also want to say that this year 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.430
 something I wanted something I was 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.369
 so much so that I decided 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.920
 take a Russian history about yourself 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.710
 then re strat kim and so i took 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:31.939

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:43.619
 Russian language society like this 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.979
 decided this year out of pain and decided that 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.619
 until this year I had notebooks 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.049
 inscriptions more than once have not been 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.190

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.550

 I liked it so much 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.230
 notebook is so simple but it seems 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.119
 will be rendered salad and also found in this 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.660
 year why I never thought 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.300
 and always fold any notebook 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.650
 in the cell like a sling she was learning herself 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.010
 in such a convenient way 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.870
 like the transcription word translation in this 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.210
 year found such an English dictionary and 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.960
 I think that we are learning English 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.490
 by the way in unfashionable mouse whether in my class 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.150
 so a notebook for writing English 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.070
 words and the last notebook is such 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.150
 But with the national team in Italy 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.740
 I really liked it here as if 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.520
 full team full squad here 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.340

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.920
 understood yes finally I liked her too 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.410
 and basically everything now 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.470
 I will tell you about the diary and me 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.150
 such a diary situation was that their 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.730
 a huge huge amount of these 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.360
 a lot of diaries but for example 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.650
 if you like from the outside I absolutely do not 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.900
 like what's inside 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.450
 I always want to have a diary inside 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.580
 was more than some cool therefore 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.250
 I showed my dad here and found 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.500
 not red I decided that yes how would 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.080
 red i like the color okay 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.280
 let it be such a diary and inside me 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.959
 really liked 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.959
 inside it looks like this 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.250
 I really liked it because there are such 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.590
 flowers on such a girly inside 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.120
 so nice 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.519
 because of this they took them though i know that he 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.010
 by the next by the end of the year I have 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.739
 will begin to fall apart but I don't care 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.840
 I want to do anything with any lines 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.420
 tell you about such an album 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.220
 For drawing , I want to say right away that I am 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.560

 I'll draw something at home 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.500
 I just want to say that I have no idea 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.260

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.540
 I want to fix everything in history 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.269

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.819

 knows i had penang like 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.190

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.229
 given like everything absolutely 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.840
 same material same style only 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.419
 man is a little bit different here 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.580
 I really liked him and this is the most 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.250
 cool penang which i found at all 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.950

 he will be well and good, and let him be 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.010
 so now it's time to talk about 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.350
 crayons 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.290
 I really took this set of pencils 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.870
 This year I do not know my dad would 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.790
 he doesn’t say such a pencil specialist 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.280
 what is the principle of a good set of Odessa 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.090
 some kind of soft and hard semi-soft 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.430
 horde regiments 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.530
 I'm here for now for a second if we have 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.510
 will this year drawing then here 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.100
 I hope I need that time 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.500
 tell about their favorite 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.169
 gel pens that look like this 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.870
 here's the way I want you all this all their 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.360
 advise you because pens in general 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.560
 cool I enjoy them every year 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.280
 I take from elementary school xs class 3 they 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.410
 Very cool 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.150
 they have a lot of colors we have here are 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.520
 there is and more straight set but they 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.620
 I do not need anything for the whole year 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.350
 truth unfortunately not very fast 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.200
 spent but they smell delicious and such 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.150
 shiny I did not like also want 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.979
 to say that my mother took me in fix price 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.320
 seems to be such a gel set 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.360
 pens and she just a set of pens 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.760
 but I absolutely didn’t like them 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.979
 interfere with the application I will wear them with 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.020
 myself if they ask me for a pen 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:47.090
 was let it and them on the fact that to me 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.520
 writing is inconvenient for me pen is what 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.379
 such a person I will tell you in detail 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.930
 she told you a little bit wrong 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:55.759
 about the fact that the pen is somehow personally I 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.669
 I meant that I am very reverent 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:06:00.650
 treat this because pens for 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:03.949
 i don't know if i do n't like 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.199
 pen all this red handwriting absolutely 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:08.449
 so let's show you the pens which 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:11.000
 I love this here 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:13.639
 ordinary they seem to be 2 rubles 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.490
 worth or 4 in general they are completely 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.229
 cheap but i love them they get lost they 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.479
 end but I'm so comfortable and 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:22.759
 write that but it is for me happiness 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:24.380
 I found my pens last year 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:26.870
 I did not write a year to carry this year 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.150
 procured as much as ten pieces of this 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.460
 believe a little first time for a month 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:35.389
 two, I think I have enough here such as 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:38.199
 here are the pens I limit two such 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:41.090
 and one such because of the first time we try 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:42.949
 let's see something to highlight or I wanted 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.409
 by the way take the green pink 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:47.060
 but they were not and probably to my happiness 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:49.849
 It was not because I annually 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.860
 for some reason yellow pink and somehow 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:54.409
 check green pink so here's 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.479
 this year blueberries and orange ector here 

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:58.210
 such corrector I have the text corrector 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:00.759
 written not some 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.690
 and the crawler is true but what is the same 

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:04.539
 pretty 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:07.360
 last year exactly the same was almost 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:08.800
 year enough and this year I decided to 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.300
 try this one 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.680
 pen proofreader or krauser film 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.330
 first time I honestly try not 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.759
 I know whether I will like it 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.440
 convenient and polished 

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:25.090
 stop showing this 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:27.250
 I do not know ordinary pencil glue 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.110
 what about him you can still say two here 

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.729
 There are such an eraser, too, I love very much 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.970
 these erasers are not very strong for me 

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:35.560
 Artist Here's a line at least 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.800
 I have a lot of people to care for some reason 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.560
 you took just in case the 15-meter 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:45.039
 to fit my pencil case and 

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.900
 ordinary sharpener everything is basically everything 

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:49.240
 I finished tell he asked 

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.849
