00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.330 
game is basically what the whole puffle
app<00:01:54.479> game<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.200> it's<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.590> candy<00:01:55.920> crush<00:01:56.040> but

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
app game is is it's like candy crush but

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.270 
app game is is it's like candy crush but
it's<00:01:56.490> for<00:01:56.670> Club<00:01:56.969> Penguin<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:58.280> basically

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
it's for Club Penguin and basically

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.190 
it's for Club Penguin and basically
there's<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.060> whole<00:02:00.240> bunch<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.810> wild

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
there's a whole bunch of like wild

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.230 
there's a whole bunch of like wild
puffles<00:02:01.560> going<00:02:01.740> around<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.310> by<00:02:02.969> completing

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
puffles going around and by completing

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.270 
puffles going around and by completing
the<00:02:03.479> levels<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.899> think<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.380> somehow<00:02:04.649> level<00:02:05.130> up

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
the levels I think you somehow level up

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.770 
the levels I think you somehow level up
for<00:02:05.640> each<00:02:05.880> puffle<00:02:06.329> or<00:02:06.390> something<00:02:06.630> like<00:02:06.719> that

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
for each puffle or something like that

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.270 
for each puffle or something like that
so<00:02:07.140> that's<00:02:07.619> how<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:08.009> going<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.190> be

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
so that's how it's going to be

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.999 
so that's how it's going to be
intertwines<00:02:08.789> insert<00:02:09.420> into<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.140> game<00:02:10.319> is

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
intertwines insert into the game is

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.220 
intertwines insert into the game is
through<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.550> puffle<00:02:11.849> wild<00:02:12.090> app<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.480> these

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
through the puffle wild app and these

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.760 
through the puffle wild app and these
guys<00:02:13.379> are<00:02:13.410> all

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
guys are all

guys are all
gonna<00:02:13.920> be<00:02:14.010> released<00:02:14.540> during<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:16.080> during<00:02:16.890> on

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
the online game during some time within

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.650 
the online game during some time within
the<00:02:19.920> next<00:02:19.980> few<00:02:20.310> months<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:20.640> that's<00:02:21.270> all<00:02:21.540> week

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
the next few months so that's all week

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.450 
the next few months so that's all week
so<00:02:21.750> look<00:02:21.870> forward<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.170> now<00:02:22.410> in<00:02:22.620> my<00:02:22.920> opinion<00:02:23.040> I

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
so look forward to now in my opinion I

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.490 
so look forward to now in my opinion I
like<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.090> raccoon<00:02:24.480> puffles<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.990> most<00:02:25.200> I

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
like the raccoon puffles the most I

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.110 
like the raccoon puffles the most I
think<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.190> bunny<00:02:26.340> profiles<00:02:26.670> are<00:02:26.760> cool<00:02:26.970> and

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
think the bunny profiles are cool and

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.180 
think the bunny profiles are cool and
the<00:02:27.210> reindeer<00:02:27.420> profiles<00:02:27.750> we've<00:02:27.930> seen<00:02:28.170> or<00:02:28.860> kind

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
the reindeer profiles we've seen or kind

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.000 
the reindeer profiles we've seen or kind
of<00:02:29.310> seen<00:02:29.460> them<00:02:29.610> before<00:02:29.880> so<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:31.140> definitely

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
of seen them before so I definitely

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.100 
of seen them before so I definitely
think<00:02:32.250> it's<00:02:32.490> a<00:02:32.550> really<00:02:32.760> cool<00:02:32.940> thing<00:02:32.970> but<00:02:33.360> my

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
think it's a really cool thing but my

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.530 
think it's a really cool thing but my
favorite<00:02:34.560> is<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.520> raccoon<00:02:35.850> puffle<00:02:36.210> because

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
favorite is the raccoon puffle because

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.760 
favorite is the raccoon puffle because
they're<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:36.810> bushy<00:02:37.110> their<00:02:37.350> tail<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.620> really

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
they're so bushy their tail is really

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.530 
they're so bushy their tail is really
bushy<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.430> like<00:02:38.580> their<00:02:38.790> ears<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.240> I<00:02:39.300> think

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
bushy and I like their ears and I think

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.350 
bushy and I like their ears and I think
so<00:02:39.750> that's<00:02:40.260> kind<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.470> my<00:02:40.620> favorite<00:02:40.800> if<00:02:41.360> they

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
so that's kind of my favorite if they

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.160 
so that's kind of my favorite if they
were<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.780> ever<00:02:42.990> come<00:02:43.320> out<00:02:43.880> I<00:02:44.880> guess<00:02:45.600> within<00:02:46.020> the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
were to ever come out I guess within the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.810 
were to ever come out I guess within the
next<00:02:46.290> few<00:02:46.440> months<00:02:46.560> my<00:02:46.860> favorite<00:02:47.280> as<00:02:47.400> right<00:02:47.670> now

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
next few months my favorite as right now

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.360 
next few months my favorite as right now
would<00:02:48.450> either<00:02:48.630> be<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.170> green<00:02:49.530> raccoon<00:02:49.980> puffle

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
would either be the green raccoon puffle

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.580 
would either be the green raccoon puffle
or<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.610> orange<00:02:50.880> raccoon<00:02:51.150> puffle<00:02:51.480> that's<00:02:52.410> just

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
or the orange raccoon puffle that's just

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.870 
or the orange raccoon puffle that's just
kind<00:02:52.740> of<00:02:52.770> my<00:02:52.830> opinion<00:02:53.340> but<00:02:53.460> let<00:02:53.670> me<00:02:53.760> know<00:02:53.850> what

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
kind of my opinion but let me know what

profile and you guys are asking me how

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.920 
profile and you guys are asking me how
they<00:03:20.070> were<00:03:20.130> doing<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.490> well<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.090> did<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.600> little

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
they were doing this well I did a little

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.300 
they were doing this well I did a little
bit<00:03:22.080> of<00:03:22.110> research<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:22.830> is<00:03:22.980> because

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
bit of research and that is because

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.250 
bit of research and that is because
there's<00:03:24.060> something<00:03:24.420> existing<00:03:24.870> called<00:03:25.110> the

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
there's something existing called the

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.100 
there's something existing called the
puffle<00:03:25.620> adder<00:03:25.770> and<00:03:26.420> that<00:03:27.420> basically<00:03:27.870> allows

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
puffle adder and that basically allows

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.430 
puffle adder and that basically allows
you<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.380> add<00:03:29.100> any<00:03:29.490> new<00:03:29.880> puffle<00:03:30.450> including<00:03:31.320> the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
you to add any new puffle including the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.100 
you to add any new puffle including the
raccoon<00:03:31.950> puffle<00:03:32.310> bunny<00:03:33.120> puffle<00:03:33.510> or<00:03:33.690> rabbit
