 vacation guys and I propose you 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.030
 today is this little video 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.630
 just this little squat builder 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.940
 so it's true that in the last king 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.100
 turn to metz I told you about 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.570
 the team in 5 2 1 2 that I had made myself 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.100
 in the meantime and here it was not bad 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.320
 of people who wanted me to 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.430
 so present so listen this is the case 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.930
 today and I hope in any case that 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.820
 this little squat builder will please you 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.740
 so in any case we will start 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.960
 by the guardian petr s is this so 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.070
 listen to guys can be pretty 96 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.050
 I've read 41 games since I 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.879
 what I have in my club what and 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.309
 frankly here we know all the beasts 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.059
 recipes ch it's just a big sick 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.239
 mental on purpose 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.500
 here it is really a guardian it is 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.539
 always important to have a very good 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.980
 goalkeeper in his team and that's right 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.899
 there is very little of it was 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.120
 really good guardians all the time 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.530
 and maybe you know you still know a 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.600
 guards who is part of his 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.370
 guards who are constantly good at every 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.049
 match then we will go to the defense 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.909
 central with david luiz who at chelsea 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.170
 or a little under five credits 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.270
 so it's a little annoying but 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.640
 well here we all know david luiz and 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.799
 we all know how much he is over 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.930
 heck guys and so that's it 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.759
 frankly it's a pure monster 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.470
 nothing to say I think you know 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.200
 we all have already tested david luiz 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.460
 a big monster the same for roanne jesÃºs 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.920
 so I do not know if you have it all 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.390
 already tested but hey he has the speed he 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.680
 is big enough is 85 but 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.329
 frankly I had already tested before 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.220
 and I loved it 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.509
 and for those who have never before 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.189
 tested me I really do not recommend 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.659
 he's really a super solid defender 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.729
 like kaboul 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.710
 the third of the last defender 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.630
 central to this team then Kabul 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.750
 I think we have all already tested 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.850
 is means-it means 91 not me 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.670
 really worry too much because 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.000
 here he is he is always well placed 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.710
 here he has a physical 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.480
 extraordinary that allows to block 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.150
 all attacks we are frankly that 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.950
 it is super appreciable that's nothing to 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.860
 to say it's just a monster 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.690
 again afterwards in dlg we did not 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.880
 not blue armero guys so certainly 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.119
 2500 credit but then frankly the 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.620
 Guys it's it's just an armero killie 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.720
 because here are seven matches 4 assists 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.630
 for a side it's just huge 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.400
 and it's true that it's not really 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.390
 a lateral if it is a little bit 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.570
 on it's a little bit like a 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.950
 middle left but who who is a notch 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.630
 underneath finally here you see what 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.120
 I mean actually if you leave 5 2 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.530
 1 2 c it's a bit like the 3-5-2 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.180
 the guy knows it's exactly the same 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.370
 thing except seen differently if we want 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.540
 just imagine that the middle right 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.130
 the middle left they are a little bit 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.150
 lower and it gives you a 3-5-2 I 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.700
 you swear that after the middle it's 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.620
 like you mc 2 6 years and then 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.480
 you jiggle ben here it is your ten 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.970
 years is exactly the same thing so 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.670
 right side defender one to abolish the 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.500
 so frankly abate guy for example 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.000
 to comment we are all already 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.540
 fallen concludes we've all already had it at 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.510
 less once 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.870
 he's super fast super good in the 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.750
 revival 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.760
 and here it is especially the speed the 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.000
 legal speed that allows that 's 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.739
 stop any attack 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.900
 laughing over 90 speed then 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.640
 first central middle on hernanes 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.750
 legal in the eyes of the five-star years 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.140
 bad little 4-star gesture 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.459
 technical 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.980
 I do not know if you are many 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.140
 have already tested but but that's so 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.570
 you are followers of strikes from afar 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.790
 it's really the card to buy 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.950
 I had already tested before but when 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.360
 he was still in lazio rome and and 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.100
 this is my opinion about him does not change 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.100
 it's always a monster and 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.690
 frankly I will you if you do this 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.340
 team it takes you really need cowardice 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.570
 then secondly central we have 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.410
 does the enemy then fellini he is 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.860
 really solid 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.060
 so it really helps to have a 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.340
 fairly homogeneous medium that is that 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.210
 we have a player who is who is no longer there 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.030
 for 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.040
 for to go forward for for 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.540
 try his luck from afar and fellini 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.520
 it's more the guy who will stay a little 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.380
 more behind we really the role of 6 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.210
 here is super solid 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.100
 they really bring a big help 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.170
 in the air and that's it on 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.190
 corner is a big monster so 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.140
 frankly I advise you 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.240
 also in this team then we like 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.070
 to work one has a glen golan sorry the 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.410
 guys so we were not yelling much at 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.120
 to say about him I'm not sure he does not 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.520
 more but here it is it is a good 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.490
 10 and good ball driving and 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.620
 I honestly liked it 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.690
 then first nine first countries where 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.850
 guys in there christian benteke then 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.750
 way for most players clear 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.220
 no need to comment 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.990
 you know them all 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.910
 way these players we are all in the world 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.170
 fall once when his players in 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.970
 line and benteke a little bit more of a 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.890
 times I think and and as you can the 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.190
 see seven games calm 4 goal and five 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.270
 passes already been pretty astonished 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.710
 to see him do as many passes 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.700
 decisive but listen in any case he 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.140
 is as good as against that who has it 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.340
 been against me in the matches 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.140
 previous ones so 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.060
 so here's nothing to say and we finish 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.220
 this team with victor barbeau you the 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.370
 also know seven matches 12 goals from 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.950
 base of a meter 88 93 the speed is 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.200
 the most cited player on foot 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.360
 quality level price for 1000 credits 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.770
 with directly from lynx it is 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.110
 the best player 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.710
 quality level price to get in 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.880
 this game about leaks anyway and is 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.460
 so this is frankly this team 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.900
 it's just a killing guys at the beginning 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.550
 I was a little skeptical 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.930
 compared to 5 2 1 2 but finally that 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.030
 went really well I swear to you 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.350
 it's really not available that is 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.330
 complicated to play at the level of 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.700
 defense it's super simple also especially 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.140
 especially you go sideways who can 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.460
 go up and down super fast it's 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.320
 just a pleasure that I want to 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.330
 also specify that this team is 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.340
 not me who's thoughts it's it's a 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.230
 team I found on food aid so 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.670
 so here I wanted to tell you 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.230
 but it's true that here you are 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.730
 I would be surprised if you are many 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.230
 go every day on foot help to 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.000
 see if there are new teams 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.470
 interesting to you anyway 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.640
 all the better for those who do it 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.870
 but that's it for those who do not 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.370
 and they not necessarily feel good there 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.290
 I wanted to introduce you to this team 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.460
 and the dogs tell you it's just 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.830
 a slaughter so I advise you 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.090
 to really do sorry I have no 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.860
 gameplay but here I am just from 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.180
 to come back from holidays so here I am 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.160
 think that's it you would not have 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.500
 necessarily more than that I put 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.870
 two minutes from any center east were 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.610
 with a little music going on here we 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.980
 will tell you honestly I scored 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.480
 already quite a lot of ac2 nice goal like that 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.919
 p tits in the week 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.560
 the banks of the memphis 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:15.410
 straws so here I can now me 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.240
 allow to score rather lousy goals 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.310
 but it's also fun because I 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.080
 finally wins in division too and is 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.250
 so that's it's nice it's true 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.530
 that this is a team clearly 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.820
 disgusting this is it's not 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.740
 necessarily beginning that we have scored all 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.000
 days but now when we want to 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.110
 to do a little can rage people here 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.610
 I propose this team 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.260
