00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.380
 hello together and welcome to one 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.060
 small particularity in contrast to the 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.470
 other videos probably someone pink 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.080
 I would like to have presented comic today 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.670
 from current occasion that wanted on 24 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.800
 october 2013 decided the new 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.079
 asterix album asterix at the fixed 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.029
 Imagine the wall both in one 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.829
 hardcover softcover issue before how 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.260
 Actually, body always searches 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.520
 Character and 56 the hardcore version 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.110
 costs 12 euros 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.670
 by content the two stories 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.090
 or both volumes but just stop 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.039
 the hardcover issue is a bit more valuable that 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.710
 It had to be band 35 where it 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.510
 actually first 33 long asterix 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.030
 adventure is in between 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.100
 was pushed in yes yes yes, yes, yes, yes 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.050
 from the school of short stories 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.539
 contains and at the 34 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.579
 the spell drew asterix over to the 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.339
 fiftieth birthday professional years that 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.610
 It is the first real comic 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:09.150
 album since 2005 now eight years 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.320
 the last asterix when scaling danger 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.150
 he was rather very critical 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.880
 taken by the fans and it was 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.010
 at that time also the last band of the still from 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.080
 asterix draftsman albert uderzo complete 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.700
 at least written alone and also 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.530
 diet before drawing were made 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.360
 he already has the defense 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.400
 even more made now, however 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.260
 there is a completely new team 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.750
 although we said earlier no 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.100
 80 die for me and none at all 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.080
 give new asterix adventure 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.520
 oh yes that was apparently changed 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.800
 because the new bank was written by 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.690
 jean-yves ferri and drawn by 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.010
 konrad i hope i also have the names 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.310
 properly pronounced because mine 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:48.400
 He does not know French 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.560
 available yes as always has 64 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.350
 Of course, pages will not be opened 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.320
 with the typical picture here or there 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.550
 flies and just a short presentation 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.750
 and our skin are again some 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.880
 row next to the main characters and yes the 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.670
 title says it already travel this time 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.570
 asterix and obelix also pecked with the 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.129
 name picking is now likely 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.390
 first time can not do much 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:14.550
 it's just about that 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.550
 Celtic ancestors of the Gothic 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.970
 smava.de already on 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.360
 Of course it is tree trunk throw 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.920
 tartan and bagpipes are not here 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.120
 on it but also come the secretary 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.770
 So everyone is going to be here 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.050
 typical clichÃ©s by the choir 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.730
 pulled as it just in the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.860
 Previous eight tricks adventure case 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.040
 was that then just then the respective 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.720
 typical customs and 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.480
 characteristics make a little bit 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.360
 has corrected that amounts to that 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.850
 asterix and obelix in the deepest winter in 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.530
 Gallien find a live blog on the beach 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.660
 or this is a fixed eisblock 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.130
 frozen thing I atx quickly 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.500
 recognizes because of course as a scholar 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.000
 because he knows well-groomed look especially 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.650
 So on the Balkans actually has 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 have that asterix obelix and a me 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.340
 I also find out general education 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.739
 Of course the problem is that 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.510
 Country pecking is big and the peckte 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.040
 Although it can be thawed but has 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.260
 So first a language can be lost 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.640
 which one say where he comes from until he 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.290
 then the idea comes to the whole then 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.670
 but just record it once and 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.470
 Although on a pimple stone 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.810
 Of course you will then be asked 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.209
 he must bring him and obelix borrow 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.239
 by verleihnix music unfortunately at home 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.190
 stay a fishing boat and then bring 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.670
 infects together back into his 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.959
 homeland 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.209
 There is still a small one there 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.709
 conspiracy between reindeer and for the 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.980
 I will not betrayed because 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.620
 read the old theme as much so for 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.820
 content of the story now I come this 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.459
 is of course the exciting at a 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.380
 draftsman and texter team is how it is 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.120
 for this new asterix adventure in the 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.410
 Comparison to the classic adventures 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.239
 they never trade less of them 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.209
 were written and then just until 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.400
 in the 70s then in Bosnia 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.810
 emerged from community production and 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.910
 Above all, how is it unlike the 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.130
 Last albums the hand very much 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.410
 were criticized because yes many think so 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.299
 yes that 's just not a good writer me 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.500
 locked in 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.269
 the story itself is now first 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.890
 not very spectacular as well 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.120
 a classic 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.710
 such a story just that 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.690
 starts that there is a problem somewhere 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.190
 the problem has to be solved around that 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.410
 To solve a problem you have to have a trip 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.030
 take it on yourself and yes this time 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.209
 in the country sent because build there 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.980
 not yet and then met 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.109
 Of course, then it is advised 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.870
 and just another allusion to the 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.370
 classic stories and yes, too 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.760
 of course, some adventures too 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.110
 experiencing and drawing is the whole thing 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.360
 I have to say that very nicely 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.220
 So you realize Konrad that he 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.960
 just like a style of media 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.190
 Of course you also get advice 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.230
 has so I guess not that he 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.910
 Now just the old commentary 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.080
 18 but that will certainly be in the 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.150
 have exchanged 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.669
 and so on the text on the 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.620
 Draftsman personally selected the 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.600
 Drawings are very much the style 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.760
 expensive and he would be so noticeable however 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.440
 in the beginning just the first few pages 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.780
 some uncertainties, for example 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.850
 gives the wife of meetyoo salix the up 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.460
 today no name has very awkward 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.480
 in the beginning and almost looks like one 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.220
 I almost know like a cartoon of 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.580
 I do not know if he does that 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.680
 has recognized itself or whether it is random 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.700
 but later if she is in the comic 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.220
 actually shows up here is only 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.450
 to be seen from behind 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.710
 Let's hope that until the next one 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.810
 doctor or maybe a little bit 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.550
 better and also some of his 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.260
 characters act like that in some poses 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.000
 at least a little bit unusual for you 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.430
 the eye of the classic asterix reader 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.930
 the main characters are consistently in style 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.900
 who are so loyal and also the 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.940
 Nebencharaktere quite in 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.229
 stylistic the universe is very fit 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.580
 I like the times now 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.590
 be much more detailed than the 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.060
 previous albums what we just that 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.000
 owed is the ideal course then 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.350
 the next time nearly 80 years 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.180
 old maybe just not anymore 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.410
 because so detailed drawing spend 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.680
 could be what you are now in the 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.580
 but can see new adventures 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.350
 as I said, except for a few 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.580
 smaller side figures or some den 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.150
 figures like something else awkward 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.169
 works very well done 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.090
 In terms of content, I must say that even if it is 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.110
 just a classic adventure is 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.900
 the story a little bit 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.060
 unspectacular and what you give her 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.830
 in the very classic 18 knows just 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.240
 this beautiful allusion to the 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.380
 customs and peculiarities of the 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.060
 each country will be here in the 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.550
 truest sense of the word with the 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.199
 So beaten into tree trunk are very 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.550
 but obviously with the Scots 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:18.889
 Of course, that's what you want there now 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.310
 bring big except messi and 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.270
 log lice and bagpipes and 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.759
 Tartans are just that 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.289
 one immediately invades and others 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:29.570
 Misbehaviors defect and would have it 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:31.340
 to be able to introduce this delicious dish 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.710
 then perhaps with wild boar 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.350
 Start stop chances in reality 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.850
 but is done in principle against the 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.590
 then perhaps only the scots 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.970
 typical clichÃ© he because we are 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.919
 stop thinking just easier 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.889
 clichÃ©s and motorcycle of course, too 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:48.320
 I think everything is very nice 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:50.570
 the German translation the good too 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.490
 that's my 31 at the time 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:56.419
 criticized by asterix under traviata 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:59.810
 The then extremely many allusions 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:01.849
 the current advertising slogans and politicians 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.440
 and so on were attached the one 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:04.910
 perhaps still understands these days 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.620
 At that time I grew too 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.360
 can still say something with it 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.380
 like square practically good or that 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.440
 there's only once that will never come back 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.310
 this advertising slogan for the expo 2000 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.900
 But I should start today 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.740
 become younger humor teaching 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.020
 probably only the head 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.000
 shake and analogue an allusion 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.039
 because because of advertising slogans these topics 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.419
 fast out of date 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:25.190
 here are just nice claims 

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:26.270
 playing straight with the names of the fleets 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.849
 For example, there is a pint 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.409
 as a make-up so megabyte someone stops 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:32.030
 did not understand and such 

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:33.500
 Allusions are also timeless because 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.419
 I think the term megabyte will 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.919
 you still understand in 20 to 30 years 

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:38.539
 unlike any 

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:40.610
 short-lived advertising sayings so said 

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:42.139
 the German translation of which is 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.430
 claus-jÃ¼rgen as well as the maristen 

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:45.770
 muscles band is running 

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.810
 is taken nicely , too 

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.599
 very nice the story as said works 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:53.180
 a bit flat is superficial 

00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:56.000
 in itself very nice side characters 

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.780
 are okay too but i think that still 

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 much more in it 

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.669
 and that's why I would say the new band 

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.700
 is now not a highlight of the series 

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:05.280
 but now not a whole 

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:08.690
 that's why I would just give him three of 

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.690
 five munching
