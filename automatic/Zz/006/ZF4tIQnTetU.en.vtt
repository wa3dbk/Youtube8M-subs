00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello dear viewer is the third 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.240
 The release of the review of the Chinese Lego and today 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.070
 we come back to olega brik 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.870
 Chinese fake which is by quality 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.470
 actually very happy about this 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.710
 ridiculous price of only 75 rubles 36 items 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.369
 article 503 space spa series and 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.680
 service 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.619
 I bought it for a long time on almost 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.050
 a month ago but not collected because 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.480
 I wanted to because I wanted to do 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.130
 review so I was told that I am in the first 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.660
 video is very much shaking the box let's 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.850
 and will not lead him carefully 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:43.950
 immediately look but the way 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:45.260
 let's collect so we have inside a 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.050
 inside of us 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.910
 a bag of parts is just one bag 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.090
 principle not surprising for such 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.949
 small parts also here 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.160
 there is an instruction on one such small 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.000
 little piece of paper and we also have a second 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.700
 instruction which is completely repeating 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.939
 This instruction apparently 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.390
 here put two terrible above 2 than 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.040
 not one and the antenna separately it is pretty 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.409
 a small one could be put in a bag 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.119
 but nothing is done in principle 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:26.659
 scary let's collect neatly 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.659
 cut the bag like this with scissors and 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:35.390
 now the main thing is that we have nothing 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:39.630
 scattered many small details 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.189
 let's start this mini figure 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:47.070
 The astronaut turned out excellent quality 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:50.040
 hands rotate legs rotate face in 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.970
 in principle, the standard is such 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.610
 helmet and so the helmet we wear or not 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.259
 puts on puts on everything is fine here 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.500
 such a helmet and basically only 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.670
 minus what is here on 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.490
 glass on it and on plastmaski on 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.750
 shiny wrong painted inks 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:13.009
 see the black element think this minus 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.009
 rather minor 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.430
 This turned out to be a set for a small price. 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.620
 only 75 rubles as I said for 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.060
 Such a set of prices is quite good here. 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.760
 there are no special details for 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.680
 with the exception of yellow I do not know what it is 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.190
 transparent discs that are mounted on 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.170
 what are the downsides of this lunar rover 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.020
 Firstly, this part she dangles 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.720
 badly holds and secondly as I have 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.290
 spoke on the helmet and here on this 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.780
 Observatories in some places the paint will peel off 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.200
 falls off and maybe not bad and 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.590
 inflicted or she fell off over time 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.580
 but what I understood in 15 years is probably not right 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.340
 didn't learn normally 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.980
 apply paint so it would be better 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.720
 did this observatory for example such 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.750
 yellow these discs would be on 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.280
 my more interesting here is a bunch of set 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.290
 I don't know what else to say to everyone 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.120
 thanks for watching previous videos 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.000
 can see here on screen by 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.500
 a link for you has passed a couple of seconds for 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.010
 I had another day off 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.680
 but before the heap, I decided to record a review on 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.440
 one set is quite small to video 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.840
 it wasn't so boring and dull and so 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.590
 we again have combat zones series with 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.010
 Artyakov 707 40 rubles just worth a set 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.380
 only 17 parts usually take a set 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.540
 for the sake of the minifigure because here in 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.020
 Essentially nothing, and no, let's get it 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.990
 let's open it up 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.480
 one go so that before your eyes because 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.190
 that the set is quite small so what have 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.330
 we are here first let's 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.750
 we will assemble a minifigure as such 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.750
 little man 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.070
 lost head 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:15.799
 the main thing is never to lose your head 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:18.120
 here such will not be brutal face 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.910
 A set of very small instructions that 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.550
 unsurprisingly though 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:29.370
 do without it so we fasten it 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:32.900
 here is another little blog such here 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.240
 interesting details of the form of bags with something 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.820
 I do not know what 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.810
 so we have further one more bag 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:45.150
 we put such a flat top 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.720
 flag and basically what else is there from 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.030
 interesting details in this set so it 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.280
 saber because of the other sets I am 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.300
 although certainly not seen somewhere it 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:01.800
 there is such a small bush 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:05.310
 attach it here and give a little man in your hands 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.700
 saber here it is by the way the quality is pretty 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.310
 good brik once again me not 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:15.090
 upset though new finds there 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:21.780
 little man badly fastened helmet and it is not 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:27.260
 there is good since I stick something like that 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:30.120
 so something like this so the bag nose fell off 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.330
 so it turned out uncomplicated 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.960
 simple set but for 40 rubles for 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.610
 I think one man is worth taking 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.380
 such was a small review to everyone 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.380
 Thank you for your attention and all bye.
