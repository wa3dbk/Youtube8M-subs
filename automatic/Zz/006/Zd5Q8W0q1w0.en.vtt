follow-through being this like going
through<00:05:20.310> I'm<00:05:20.670> calling<00:05:20.910> that<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.030> fall<00:05:21.270> trip

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
through I'm calling that the fall trip

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.270 
through I'm calling that the fall trip
there's<00:05:22.170> no<00:05:22.320> gap<00:05:22.500> in<00:05:22.530> time<00:05:22.860> where<00:05:22.980> you<00:05:23.070> pause

there's no gap in time where you pause

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.820 
there's no gap in time where you pause
to<00:05:24.060> just<00:05:24.240> bring<00:05:24.360> it<00:05:24.480> through<00:05:24.570> you<00:05:24.750> just<00:05:24.960> use<00:05:25.800> a

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
to just bring it through you just use a

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.410 
to just bring it through you just use a
few<00:05:26.070> the<00:05:26.190> whole<00:05:26.370> drag<00:05:26.670> and<00:05:26.970> then<00:05:27.060> you<00:05:27.240> just

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420 
few the whole drag and then you just

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.820 
few the whole drag and then you just
swoop<00:05:28.200> it<00:05:28.410> in<00:05:28.560> there<00:05:28.770> like<00:05:29.490> this<00:05:29.670> like<00:05:29.820> one<00:05:30.090> to

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
swoop it in there like this like one to

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.730 
swoop it in there like this like one to
swoop<00:05:31.830> and<00:05:32.100> you're<00:05:32.250> here<00:05:32.460> and<00:05:33.390> then<00:05:33.600> you<00:05:34.590> get

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
swoop and you're here and then you get

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.540 
swoop and you're here and then you get
to<00:05:34.860> go<00:05:35.510> I<00:05:36.860> want<00:05:37.860> to<00:05:37.920> talk<00:05:38.040> about<00:05:38.160> the<00:05:38.340> hands

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
to go I want to talk about the hands

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.240 
to go I want to talk about the hands
much<00:05:38.790> because<00:05:39.240> the<00:05:40.200> whole<00:05:40.410> timing<00:05:40.740> with<00:05:41.070> your

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
much because the whole timing with your

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.320 
much because the whole timing with your
hands<00:05:41.670> and<00:05:42.230> and<00:05:43.230> the<00:05:43.320> two<00:05:43.470> step<00:05:43.710> is<00:05:44.330> preference

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
hands and and the two step is preference

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.540 
hands and and the two step is preference
because<00:05:45.570> I<00:05:45.990> can't<00:05:46.530> I<00:05:46.770> can't<00:05:47.010> tell<00:05:47.190> you<00:05:47.340> where

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
where to put your hands at all the times

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.640 
where to put your hands at all the times
know<00:05:50.010> because<00:05:50.940> depending<00:05:51.180> on<00:05:51.330> the<00:05:51.390> speed<00:05:51.750> and

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
know because depending on the speed and

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.560 
know because depending on the speed and
how<00:05:52.770> fast<00:05:53.010> you're<00:05:53.280> going<00:05:53.310> you<00:05:54.240> we're<00:05:54.480> all

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
how fast you're going you we're all

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.240 
how fast you're going you we're all
going<00:05:54.750> to<00:05:54.780> have<00:05:54.900> different<00:05:55.260> hand<00:05:55.440> placements

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
going to have different hand placements

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.540 
going to have different hand placements
and<00:05:56.370> timings<00:05:56.900> but<00:05:57.900> uh<00:05:58.130> yeah<00:05:59.130> I'm<00:05:59.220> gonna<00:05:59.340> do<00:05:59.460> it

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
and timings but uh yeah I'm gonna do it

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.330 
and timings but uh yeah I'm gonna do it
one<00:05:59.700> more<00:05:59.760> time<00:05:59.880> and<00:06:00.330> like<00:06:01.230> somewhat<00:06:02.040> regular

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
one more time and like somewhat regular

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.150 
one more time and like somewhat regular
speed<00:06:02.670> and<00:06:02.970> so<00:06:03.780> maybe<00:06:04.230> you<00:06:04.380> guys<00:06:04.440> could<00:06:04.620> replay

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
speed and so maybe you guys could replay

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.520 
speed and so maybe you guys could replay
this<00:06:05.400> and<00:06:05.640> see<00:06:05.850> how<00:06:06.570> maybe<00:06:06.840> I<00:06:06.960> do<00:06:07.170> it<00:06:07.200> and<00:06:07.500> just

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
this and see how maybe I do it and just
