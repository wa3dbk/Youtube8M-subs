there this is the original bushing in

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.819 
there this is the original bushing in
there<00:03:27.340> this<00:03:27.489> little<00:03:27.609> bit<00:03:27.819> of<00:03:27.910> play

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
there this little bit of play

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:35.580 
there this little bit of play
however<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:31.420> bolt<00:03:31.750> won't<00:03:31.959> fit<00:03:34.019> that<00:03:35.019> bolt<00:03:35.410> is

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
however this bolt won't fit that bolt is

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.759 
however this bolt won't fit that bolt is
a<00:03:35.620> perfect<00:03:36.190> fit<00:03:36.430> in<00:03:36.579> there<00:03:36.849> no<00:03:37.690> movement<00:03:37.959> and

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
a perfect fit in there no movement and

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.039 
a perfect fit in there no movement and
move<00:03:39.010> within<00:03:39.190> a<00:03:39.370> track<00:03:39.639> bar<00:03:39.910> will<00:03:40.359> cause<00:03:40.630> a

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
move within a track bar will cause a

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.069 
move within a track bar will cause a
death<00:03:41.500> wobble<00:03:41.769> so<00:03:42.310> keep<00:03:43.150> that<00:03:43.359> mind<00:03:43.419> you<00:03:43.870> might

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
death wobble so keep that mind you might

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.839 
death wobble so keep that mind you might
have<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.440> buy<00:03:44.560> some<00:03:44.799> extra<00:03:45.099> bolts<00:03:45.459> but<00:03:45.669> let's

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
have to buy some extra bolts but let's

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.629 
have to buy some extra bolts but let's
start<00:03:46.209> putting<00:03:46.359> this<00:03:46.480> back<00:03:46.690> in<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:47.190> always<00:03:48.190> like

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
start putting this back in I always like

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.099 
start putting this back in I always like
to<00:03:48.669> start<00:03:49.030> by<00:03:49.060> getting<00:03:49.389> the<00:03:49.419> top<00:03:49.690> one<00:03:49.930> and

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
to start by getting the top one and

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.110 
to start by getting the top one and
loosely<00:03:50.560> cuz<00:03:50.889> that<00:03:51.069> bottom<00:03:51.579> one<00:03:51.730> down<00:03:51.760> there

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
loosely cuz that bottom one down there

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.640 
loosely cuz that bottom one down there
can<00:03:52.329> be<00:03:52.450> a<00:03:52.480> little<00:03:52.630> bitch<00:03:52.900> at<00:03:53.109> times<00:03:53.380> but

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
can be a little bitch at times but

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.559 
can be a little bitch at times but
feeling<00:03:54.310> this<00:03:54.430> one<00:03:54.609> lined<00:03:54.849> up<00:03:55.060> pretty<00:03:55.239> good<00:03:55.419> at

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
feeling this one lined up pretty good at

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.470 
feeling this one lined up pretty good at
first<00:03:55.750> I<00:03:55.930> wasn't<00:03:56.079> sure<00:03:56.169> just<00:03:56.440> go<00:03:56.560> right<00:03:56.739> in<00:03:57.480> so

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
first I wasn't sure just go right in so

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.789 
first I wasn't sure just go right in so
what<00:03:58.569> you're<00:03:58.720> gonna<00:03:58.810> notice<00:03:59.079> is<00:03:59.470> gonna<00:03:59.650> make

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
what you're gonna notice is gonna make

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.710 
what you're gonna notice is gonna make
this<00:03:59.980> a<00:04:00.040> little<00:04:00.160> bit<00:04:00.340> easier<00:04:00.519> one<00:04:01.030> once<00:04:01.510> you

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
this a little bit easier one once you

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.870 
this a little bit easier one once you
remove<00:04:02.139> your<00:04:02.349> old<00:04:02.500> rubber<00:04:02.769> bushings<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:03.519> put

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
remove your old rubber bushings and put

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.509 
remove your old rubber bushings and put
these<00:04:04.030> energy<00:04:04.480> bushings<00:04:04.870> in<00:04:05.049> they<00:04:05.889> don't<00:04:06.040> flex

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
these energy bushings in they don't flex

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.220 
these energy bushings in they don't flex
like<00:04:06.790> rubber<00:04:07.090> they're<00:04:07.359> really<00:04:07.870> hard

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
like rubber they're really hard

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.110 
like rubber they're really hard
so<00:04:08.530> lining<00:04:08.859> them<00:04:08.980> up<00:04:09.099> is<00:04:09.280> gonna<00:04:09.430> be<00:04:09.639> a<00:04:09.790> little

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
so lining them up is gonna be a little

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.210 
so lining them up is gonna be a little
bit<00:04:10.389> difficult<00:04:10.690> so<00:04:11.200> what<00:04:11.290> I<00:04:11.349> did<00:04:11.500> there<00:04:11.950> close

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
bit difficult so what I did there close

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.629 
bit difficult so what I did there close
is<00:04:12.519> I<00:04:13.060> ground<00:04:13.840> down<00:04:13.989> the<00:04:14.260> edge<00:04:14.410> of<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.680> bolt<00:04:14.919> to

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
is I ground down the edge of the bolt to

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:19.140 
is I ground down the edge of the bolt to
a<00:04:15.669> point<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:17.739> used<00:04:17.979> to<00:04:18.039> line<00:04:18.609> up<00:04:18.789> bar<00:04:19.000> to

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
a point and I used to line up bar to

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.699 
a point and I used to line up bar to
kind<00:04:19.359> of<00:04:19.419> push<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.750> track<00:04:19.989> bar<00:04:20.200> over<00:04:20.500> as<00:04:20.560> far

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
kind of push the track bar over as far

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.110 
kind of push the track bar over as far
as<00:04:20.769> I<00:04:20.919> could<00:04:21.159> leave<00:04:21.370> in<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.789> OP

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
as I could leave in the OP

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.810 
as I could leave in the OP
so<00:04:22.210> then<00:04:22.389> loose<00:04:22.630> and<00:04:22.960> then<00:04:23.830> I<00:04:23.860> used<00:04:24.250> my<00:04:24.370> impact

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
so then loose and then I used my impact

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.629 
so then loose and then I used my impact
gun<00:04:25.030> and<00:04:25.449> I<00:04:26.080> drove<00:04:26.350> her<00:04:26.530> forward<00:04:26.860> and<00:04:27.280> I<00:04:27.370> pushed

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
gun and I drove her forward and I pushed

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.310 
gun and I drove her forward and I pushed
it<00:04:27.790> through<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:28.389> got<00:04:28.600> everything<00:04:28.870> aligned

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
it through and got everything aligned

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.390 
it through and got everything aligned
and<00:04:29.910> I<00:04:30.910> put<00:04:31.150> my<00:04:31.270> nut<00:04:31.479> on<00:04:31.630> it<00:04:31.660> afterwards<00:04:32.400> but

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
and I put my nut on it afterwards but

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.560 
and I put my nut on it afterwards but
keep<00:04:33.760> that<00:04:33.790> in<00:04:34.060> mind

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
keep that in mind

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.420 
keep that in mind
grind<00:04:35.020> down<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:35.440> end<00:04:35.590> little<00:04:35.770> bit<00:04:36.070> so<00:04:36.220> you<00:04:36.280> can

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
grind down the end little bit so you can

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.830 
grind down the end little bit so you can
fish<00:04:36.580> it<00:04:36.760> in<00:04:36.880> because<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.210> holes<00:04:37.600> aren't

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
fish it in because the holes aren't

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.120 
fish it in because the holes aren't
gonna<00:04:37.960> line<00:04:38.169> up<00:04:38.199> perfectly<00:04:38.470> they're<00:04:38.860> gonna<00:04:38.979> be

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
gonna line up perfectly they're gonna be

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.920 
gonna line up perfectly they're gonna be
just<00:04:39.310> be<00:04:39.490> a<00:04:39.520> little<00:04:39.850> they're<00:04:40.540> gonna<00:04:40.630> be<00:04:40.780> about

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
just be a little they're gonna be about

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.189 
just be a little they're gonna be about
a<00:04:41.320> hair<00:04:41.440> off<00:04:41.740> let's<00:04:42.190> just<00:04:42.400> say<00:04:43.199> that

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
a hair off let's just say that

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:45.900 
a hair off let's just say that
one's<00:04:44.470> done<00:04:44.740> up<00:04:45.040> can<00:04:45.340> you<00:04:45.370> see<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.610> other<00:04:45.729> one

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
one's done up can you see the other one

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.270 
one's done up can you see the other one
down<00:04:46.060> there<00:04:46.419> you<00:04:47.320> can<00:04:47.440> see<00:04:47.470> how<00:04:47.710> close<00:04:47.979> track

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
down there you can see how close track

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.070 
down there you can see how close track
bar<00:04:48.520> comes<00:04:48.790> to<00:04:48.970> exhaust<00:04:49.300> this<00:04:49.570> is<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:49.780> stock

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
bar comes to exhaust this is the stock

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.990 
bar comes to exhaust this is the stock
one<00:04:50.380> with<00:04:50.590> that<00:04:50.770> rough<00:04:51.130> country<00:04:51.370> for

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
country adjustable track bar the bend

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.570 
country adjustable track bar the bend
was<00:04:56.229> in<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:56.470> wrong<00:04:56.590> place<00:04:56.650> was<00:04:57.160> hoppin<00:04:57.460> as<00:04:57.520> it

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
was in the wrong place was hoppin as it

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.029 
was in the wrong place was hoppin as it
was<00:04:57.669> touching<00:04:57.910> the<00:04:58.090> exhaust<00:04:58.479> and<00:04:59.169> I<00:04:59.710> didn't

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
was touching the exhaust and I didn't

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.830 
was touching the exhaust and I didn't
feel<00:05:00.190> like<00:05:00.220> getting<00:05:00.490> my<00:05:00.729> exhaust<00:05:01.030> modified<00:05:01.539> so

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
feel like getting my exhaust modified so

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.510 
feel like getting my exhaust modified so
I<00:05:02.050> just<00:05:02.289> opted<00:05:02.650> out<00:05:02.710> to<00:05:02.860> buy<00:05:02.949> new<00:05:03.130> bushings

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
I just opted out to buy new bushings

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.620 
I'll try to sell the old track bar now
if<00:05:05.979> you've<00:05:06.160> never<00:05:06.220> had<00:05:06.820> your<00:05:06.970> track<00:05:07.240> bar<00:05:07.449> out

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
if you've never had your track bar out

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.830 
if you've never had your track bar out
ever<00:05:07.960> and<00:05:08.320> you're<00:05:08.620> doing<00:05:08.889> this<00:05:09.010> job<00:05:09.840> you're

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
ever and you're doing this job you're

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.270 
ever and you're doing this job you're
probably<00:05:11.020> gonna<00:05:11.410> have<00:05:11.620> a<00:05:11.650> lot<00:05:11.979> of<00:05:12.010> issues

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
probably gonna have a lot of issues

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.700 
probably gonna have a lot of issues
because<00:05:12.760> those<00:05:12.910> bolts<00:05:13.360> are<00:05:13.900> gonna<00:05:14.110> be

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
because those bolts are gonna be

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.340 
because those bolts are gonna be
rusted<00:05:15.190> and<00:05:15.310> seized<00:05:15.639> in<00:05:15.880> there<00:05:16.000> so<00:05:16.419> you<00:05:17.169> may

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
rusted and seized in there so you may

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.840 
rusted and seized in there so you may
end<00:05:17.530> up<00:05:17.680> having<00:05:17.740> to<00:05:18.039> cut<00:05:18.220> them<00:05:18.370> off<00:05:18.490> and<00:05:18.729> get

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
end up having to cut them off and get
