00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
underneath so I'm kind of cheating here

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.200 
underneath so I'm kind of cheating here
because<00:04:39.830> um<00:04:40.070> it<00:04:40.280> looks<00:04:40.640> like<00:04:40.760> her<00:04:41.030> eyes<00:04:41.180> a

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
because um it looks like her eyes a

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:47.050 
because um it looks like her eyes a
slightly<00:04:41.600> bigger<00:04:45.220> just<00:04:46.220> to<00:04:46.310> soften<00:04:46.610> it<00:04:46.910> I'm

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
slightly bigger just to soften it I'm

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.010 
slightly bigger just to soften it I'm
taking<00:04:47.420> a<00:04:47.510> slightly<00:04:47.870> smudgy<00:04:48.560> brush<00:04:48.770> and

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
taking a slightly smudgy brush and

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.170 
taking a slightly smudgy brush and
smudging<00:04:51.020> it<00:04:51.140> right<00:04:51.470> at<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:51.830> bottom<00:04:52.220> so<00:04:53.150> that

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
smudging it right at the bottom so that

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.760 
smudging it right at the bottom so that
it<00:04:53.330> doesn't<00:04:53.720> look<00:04:53.810> too<00:04:54.080> stark<00:04:56.320> so<00:04:57.320> now<00:04:57.500> this

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
it doesn't look too stark so now this

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.850 
it doesn't look too stark so now this
gives<00:04:57.980> the<00:04:58.190> illusion<00:04:58.370> of<00:04:58.730> bigger<00:04:58.970> eyes<00:04:59.860> next
