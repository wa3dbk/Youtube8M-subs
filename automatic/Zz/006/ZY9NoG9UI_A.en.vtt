00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
across the world with like almost node

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.330 
across the world with like almost node
with<00:02:54.840> like<00:02:55.020> no<00:02:55.200> delay<00:02:55.530> like<00:02:56.040> they<00:02:56.190> can

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
with like no delay like they can

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.950 
with like no delay like they can
completely<00:02:56.730> hear<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.270> it's<00:02:57.750> just

transferred through freaking cables

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.320 
transferred through freaking cables
through<00:03:00.570> cyberspace<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.700> then<00:03:02.700> people<00:03:03.180> can

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330

waves<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.440> my<00:03:10.590> voice<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.250> have<00:03:11.820> them<00:03:12.030> come<00:03:12.270> out

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
waves of my voice and have them come out

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.610 
waves of my voice and have them come out
basically<00:03:13.680> exactly<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.880> same<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:16.290> another

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
basically exactly the same to another

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.900 
basically exactly the same to another
person<00:03:16.830> halfway<00:03:17.310> across<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.550> world<00:03:17.670> like

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
person halfway across the world like

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.540 
person halfway across the world like
that<00:03:17.940> distance<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:18.720> just<00:03:18.959> so<00:03:19.470> immense<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.250> the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
that distance is just so immense and the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.100 
that distance is just so immense and the
fact<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:20.880> like<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.360> same<00:03:21.570> thing<00:03:21.780> we<00:03:21.900> can<00:03:22.050> do

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
fact that like the same thing we can do

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.870 
fact that like the same thing we can do
that<00:03:22.260> in<00:03:22.350> space<00:03:22.680> like<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.310> can<00:03:23.670> communicate

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
that in space like you can communicate

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.960 
that in space like you can communicate
with<00:03:24.330> someone<00:03:24.840> in<00:03:25.020> space<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:26.610> is<00:03:26.730> just

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
with someone in space that is just

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.720 
with someone in space that is just
incredible<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.690> that<00:03:28.500> vast<00:03:28.920> distance<00:03:29.490> can

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
incredible that that vast distance can

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.680 
incredible that that vast distance can
be<00:03:29.760> covered<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.650> through<00:03:31.650> technology<00:03:32.690> then

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
be covered and through technology then

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.020 
be covered and through technology then
just<00:03:33.959> stuff<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.620> we've<00:03:34.920> discovered<00:03:35.640> it's

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
just stuff that we've discovered it's

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.380 
just stuff that we've discovered it's
just<00:03:36.180> amazing<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.780> think<00:03:37.130> how<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.910> heck<00:03:39.150> we

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
just amazing to think how the heck we

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.240 
just amazing to think how the heck we
came<00:03:39.570> up<00:03:39.600> with<00:03:39.900> something<00:03:40.080> like<00:03:40.350> that<00:03:40.560> being

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
came up with something like that being

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.100 
came up with something like that being
so<00:03:41.550> primitive<00:03:42.030> in<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.239> past<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.780> then<00:03:42.930> just

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
so primitive in the past and then just

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.890 
so primitive in the past and then just
the<00:03:43.200> development<00:03:43.860> of<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.910> world<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.660> our

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
the development of the world and our

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.050 
the development of the world and our
mind<00:03:46.770> and<00:03:47.070> just<00:03:47.130> philosophers<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:47.970> all

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
mind and just philosophers and all

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.060 
mind and just philosophers and all
that's<00:03:48.180> just<00:03:48.480> incredible<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.200> think<00:03:49.320> of<00:03:49.800> how

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
that's just incredible to think of how

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.760 
that's just incredible to think of how
we<00:03:51.000> do<00:03:51.270> that<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:52.050> know<00:03:52.170> you<00:03:52.260> think<00:03:52.680> about

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
we do that and you know you think about

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.650 
we do that and you know you think about
it<00:03:53.070> because<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:53.790> biological<00:03:54.510> perspective

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
it because the biological perspective

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.570 
it because the biological perspective
and<00:03:55.170> there's<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.440> chemicals<00:03:55.920> perspective

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
and there's the chemicals perspective

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.910 
and there's the chemicals perspective
and<00:03:56.730> when<00:03:57.270> you<00:03:57.360> try<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.720> mesh<00:03:58.440> those<00:03:58.709> two

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
and when you try and mesh those two

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.890 
and when you try and mesh those two
together<00:03:59.130> it's<00:03:59.550> just<00:03:59.790> absolutely<00:04:00.540> incredible

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
together it's just absolutely incredible

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.800 
together it's just absolutely incredible
to<00:04:01.890> think<00:04:01.920> that<00:04:02.280> everything<00:04:03.000> is<00:04:03.120> composed<00:04:03.510> of

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
to think that everything is composed of

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.760 
to think that everything is composed of
these<00:04:04.050> tiny<00:04:04.440> little<00:04:04.980> particles<00:04:05.930> yet<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.230> forms

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
these tiny little particles yet it forms

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.100 
these tiny little particles yet it forms
a<00:04:07.890> solid<00:04:08.130> state<00:04:08.640> even<00:04:08.910> though<00:04:09.060> nothing<00:04:09.720> fits

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
a solid state even though nothing fits

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.280 
a solid state even though nothing fits
together<00:04:11.150> exactly<00:04:12.150> perfect<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:12.690> I've<00:04:13.020> heard

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
together exactly perfect and I've heard

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.890 
together exactly perfect and I've heard
that<00:04:13.530> there's<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:13.830> that<00:04:14.400> there<00:04:14.640> is<00:04:14.910> like<00:04:15.239> a<00:04:15.270> like

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
that there's a that there is like a like

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.440 
that there's a that there is like a like
a<00:04:15.930> deep<00:04:16.320> blows<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:17.160> smallest<00:04:17.730> chance<00:04:18.060> ever

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
a deep blows the smallest chance ever

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.330 
a deep blows the smallest chance ever
that<00:04:19.230> you<00:04:19.350> could<00:04:19.530> put<00:04:19.739> your<00:04:19.919> finger<00:04:20.310> up

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
that you could put your finger up

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.860 
that you could put your finger up
against<00:04:20.790> a<00:04:20.880> wall<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.299> would<00:04:21.419> face<00:04:21.630> through

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
against a wall and it would face through

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.500 
against a wall and it would face through
it<00:04:21.989> because<00:04:22.140> of<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:23.580> alignment<00:04:24.330> of<00:04:24.450> the

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
it because of the alignment of the

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.150 
it because of the alignment of the
particles<00:04:25.110> because<00:04:25.500> solids<00:04:26.370> do

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
particles because solids do

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.580 
particles because solids do
back<00:04:27.850> and<00:04:28.060> play<00:04:28.270> that<00:04:28.690> back<00:04:29.050> and<00:04:29.200> forth<00:04:29.260> in

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
back and play that back and forth in

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.140 
back and play that back and forth in
place<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:31.980> they're<00:04:32.980> just<00:04:33.100> very<00:04:33.340> very<00:04:33.490> tightly

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
place and they're just very very tightly

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.720 
place and they're just very very tightly
packed<00:04:34.450> and<00:04:34.690> they<00:04:35.200> could<00:04:35.680> just<00:04:35.710> be<00:04:36.280> in<00:04:36.580> the

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
packed and they could just be in the

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.670 
packed and they could just be in the
perfect<00:04:37.180> position<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:38.110> your<00:04:38.230> finger<00:04:38.530> could

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
perfect position that your finger could

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.230 
perfect position that your finger could
slide<00:04:38.950> through<00:04:39.130> there<00:04:39.250> and<00:04:39.370> that's<00:04:39.490> just<00:04:39.640> it's

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
slide through there and that's just it's

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.850 
slide through there and that's just it's
a<00:04:40.360> ridiculous<00:04:40.540> that<00:04:41.110> when<00:04:41.530> you<00:04:41.620> think<00:04:41.800> about

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
a ridiculous that when you think about

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.790 
a ridiculous that when you think about
like<00:04:42.280> from<00:04:42.820> a<00:04:42.850> chemistry<00:04:43.300> perspective<00:04:44.170> that

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
like from a chemistry perspective that

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.280 
like from a chemistry perspective that
everything<00:04:45.430> is<00:04:45.550> composed<00:04:45.910> of<00:04:46.180> these<00:04:46.510> L

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
everything is composed of these L

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.810 
everything is composed of these L
everything<00:04:47.920> is<00:04:48.010> composed<00:04:48.340> of<00:04:48.490> these<00:04:48.640> elements

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
everything is composed of these elements

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.140 
everything is composed of these elements
and<00:04:49.450> like<00:04:50.170> you<00:04:50.740> know<00:04:51.130> when<00:04:51.460> you<00:04:51.580> transfer

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
and like you know when you transfer

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.840 
and like you know when you transfer
these<00:04:52.950> electrical<00:04:53.950> currents<00:04:54.460> and<00:04:54.550> stuff<00:04:54.820> that

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
these electrical currents and stuff that

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.300 
these electrical currents and stuff that
is<00:04:55.090> composed<00:04:55.510> of<00:04:55.780> these<00:04:56.020> elements<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:57.190> it's

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
is composed of these elements and it's

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.340 
is composed of these elements and it's
just<00:04:57.550> you<00:04:57.970> know<00:04:58.000> it's<00:04:58.720> just<00:04:58.810> incredible<00:04:59.290> to

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
just you know it's just incredible to

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.440 
just you know it's just incredible to
think<00:04:59.500> about<00:04:59.980> this<00:05:00.190> stuff<00:05:00.370> like<00:05:00.580> how<00:05:00.820> small

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
think about this stuff like how small

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.480 
think about this stuff like how small
everything<00:05:02.080> is<00:05:02.200> that<00:05:02.410> can<00:05:02.560> make<00:05:02.710> something<00:05:03.160> so

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
everything is that can make something so

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.220 
everything is that can make something so
complex<00:05:04.210> when<00:05:04.480> it<00:05:04.570> comes<00:05:04.720> together<00:05:04.870> and<00:05:05.110> you

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
complex when it comes together and you

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.750 
complex when it comes together and you
think<00:05:05.410> about<00:05:05.590> it<00:05:05.680> from<00:05:05.770> biological<00:05:06.070> press

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
think about it from biological press

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.600 
think about it from biological press
perspective<00:05:07.750> too<00:05:07.930> and<00:05:08.200> everything<00:05:09.070> is<00:05:09.190> living

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
perspective too and everything is living

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.250 
perspective too and everything is living
in<00:05:09.700> chemistry<00:05:10.150> doesn't<00:05:10.450> take<00:05:10.810> place<00:05:10.840> and

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
in chemistry doesn't take place and

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.490 
in chemistry doesn't take place and
everything<00:05:11.830> is<00:05:12.300> it<00:05:13.300> just<00:05:13.660> it's<00:05:13.900> incredible<00:05:14.440> to

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
everything is it just it's incredible to

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.160 
everything is it just it's incredible to
think<00:05:14.650> about<00:05:15.040> all<00:05:15.250> this<00:05:15.550> stuff<00:05:15.610> and<00:05:16.090> you<00:05:17.050> know

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
think about all this stuff and you know

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.050 
think about all this stuff and you know
basically<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:18.100> moral<00:05:18.340> of<00:05:18.370> the<00:05:18.490> story<00:05:18.520> is<00:05:18.820> you

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
basically the moral of the story is you

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.730 
basically the moral of the story is you
know<00:05:19.120> be<00:05:19.270> glad<00:05:19.510> that<00:05:19.750> we<00:05:19.840> can<00:05:19.960> do<00:05:20.200> this<00:05:20.470> stuff

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740
