00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
let's go through that quickly

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.920 
let's go through that quickly
the<00:00:55.770> Victorinox<00:00:56.370> has<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:59.300> pen<00:01:00.300> knife<00:01:00.539> blade

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
the Victorinox has the pen knife blade

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.479 
the Victorinox has the pen knife blade
and<00:01:01.230> let<00:01:01.469> me<00:01:01.530> talk<00:01:01.680> about<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> couple

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
and let me talk about this for a couple

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.390 
and let me talk about this for a couple
minutes<00:01:02.609> um<00:01:03.530> not<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> couple<00:01:04.890> minutes<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.309> for

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
minutes um not a couple minutes just for

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.820 
minutes um not a couple minutes just for
a<00:01:05.489> little<00:01:05.670> bit<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.990> pen<00:01:07.380> blade<00:01:07.650> on

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
a little bit but the pen blade on

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.859 
a little bit but the pen blade on
Victorinox<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.670> looks<00:01:08.970> very<00:01:09.240> small<00:01:09.630> and

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
Victorinox is looks very small and

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.480 
Victorinox is looks very small and
that's<00:01:10.439> because<00:01:10.799> it's<00:01:10.950> not<00:01:11.100> very<00:01:11.130> tall

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
that's because it's not very tall

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.429 
that's because it's not very tall
vertically<00:01:12.360> like<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.780> not<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.170> wide

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
vertically like it's not that wide

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.310 
vertically like it's not that wide
however<00:01:14.280> they're<00:01:14.520> actually<00:01:15.000> pretty<00:01:15.810> big<00:01:16.110> I

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
however they're actually pretty big I

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.830 
however they're actually pretty big I
have<00:01:17.250> here<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.729> size<00:01:17.909> comparison<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.689> one

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
have here for size comparison this one

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.620 
have here for size comparison this one
is<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.049> spider<00:01:19.409> cold<00:01:19.680> cat<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.180> see<00:01:21.420> how

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
is a spider cold cat and you can see how

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.560 
is a spider cold cat and you can see how
big<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.770> Victorinox<00:01:23.700> plate<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.360> like

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
big that Victorinox plate is it's like

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.190 
big that Victorinox plate is it's like
the<00:01:24.750> same<00:01:25.049> length<00:01:25.409> as<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.930> tinkers<00:01:27.930> blade

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the same length as the the tinkers blade

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.499 
the same length as the the tinkers blade
and<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.549> just<00:01:29.549> shows<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.270> mean

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
and that just shows you that I mean

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.539 
and that just shows you that I mean
you're<00:01:31.170> not<00:01:31.259> really<00:01:31.320> sacrificing<00:01:32.189> too<00:01:32.340> much

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
you're not really sacrificing too much

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.749 
you're not really sacrificing too much
this<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.450> blade<00:01:34.170> length<00:01:34.490> even<00:01:35.490> though<00:01:35.670> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
this in the blade length even though you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.870 
this in the blade length even though you
know<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.119> cat<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.540> not<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.869> longest<00:01:37.079> knife

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
know the cat is not the longest knife

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.130 
know the cat is not the longest knife
you're<00:01:38.880> definitely<00:01:39.090> getting<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.689> good<00:01:39.930> length

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
you're definitely getting a good length

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.210 
you're definitely getting a good length
