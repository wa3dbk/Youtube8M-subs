emphasis on the technological side of

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.349 
emphasis on the technological side of
the<00:00:18.570> character<00:00:18.990> she<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.920> writing<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.580> pod<00:00:21.000> which

is the motorcycle Batman road in the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.120 
is the motorcycle Batman road in the
dark<00:00:24.660> night<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.529> think<00:00:25.650> it's<00:00:25.830> very<00:00:25.890> likely

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
dark night so I think it's very likely

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.160 
dark night so I think it's very likely
that<00:00:26.519> she<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.029> stealing<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.720> from<00:00:27.960> Wayne

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
that she is stealing this from Wayne

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.870 
that she is stealing this from Wayne
Enterprises<00:00:28.680> she<00:00:29.070> might<00:00:29.189> be<00:00:29.369> stealing<00:00:29.640> in

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
Enterprises she might be stealing in

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.700 
Enterprises she might be stealing in
this<00:00:30.119> scene<00:00:30.390> or<00:00:30.750> she<00:00:30.900> might<00:00:31.019> have<00:00:31.140> stolen<00:00:31.439> it

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
this scene or she might have stolen it

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.540 
this scene or she might have stolen it
earlier<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.940> course<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> story<00:00:34.430> and<00:00:35.430> I

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
earlier in the course of the story and I

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.100 
earlier in the course of the story and I
think<00:00:35.730> it's<00:00:35.850> also<00:00:36.120> very<00:00:36.450> possible<00:00:36.570> then

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
think it's also very possible then

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.569 
think it's also very possible then
that's<00:00:37.350> how<00:00:37.559> she<00:00:37.620> gets<00:00:37.950> most<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.399> our

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
that's how she gets most of our

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.490 
that's how she gets most of our
technology<00:00:38.969> stealing<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.840> from<00:00:40.020> winning

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
technology stealing it from winning

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.100 
technology stealing it from winning
under<00:00:40.890> prices<00:00:41.280> those<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.480> who<00:00:42.719> are<00:00:42.750> very

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
under prices those of you who are very

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.660 
under prices those of you who are very
disappointed<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.160> look<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
disappointed in this look for the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.639 
disappointed in this look for the
character<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.809> doesn't<00:00:45.840> look<00:00:46.350> more

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
character and that it doesn't look more

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.740 
character and that it doesn't look more
like<00:00:46.800> at<00:00:47.039> one<00:00:47.250> keep<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.030> mind<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.570> is

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
like at one keep in mind that it is

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.380 
like at one keep in mind that it is
possible<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:50.910> kind<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.210> her

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
possible that this is just kind of her

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.990 
possible that this is just kind of her
prototype<00:00:52.020> version<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> costume<00:00:53.219> similar

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
prototype version of the costume similar

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.900 
prototype version of the costume similar
to<00:00:54.300> what<00:00:54.600> Bruce<00:00:54.989> Wayne<00:00:55.289> or<00:00:55.649> early<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.370> Batman

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
to what Bruce Wayne or early in Batman

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.720 
to what Bruce Wayne or early in Batman
Begins<00:00:56.989> not<00:00:57.989> saying<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.829> that's<00:00:58.980> definitely

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
Begins not saying that that's definitely

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.750 
Begins not saying that that's definitely
the<00:00:59.910> case<00:00:59.940> for<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:00.980> as<00:01:01.980> usual<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.520> think

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
the case for this but as usual I think

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.030 
the case for this but as usual I think
we<00:01:03.059> should<00:01:03.090> reserve<00:01:03.480> judgment<00:01:04.290> until<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.769> see

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
we should reserve judgment until we see

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.850 
we should reserve judgment until we see
more<00:01:05.430> pictures<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.970> get<00:01:06.330> more<00:01:06.479> information

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
more pictures and get more information
