00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.940
Toyota Fuel Cell Vehicle Due In 2015 To Be
Called Called Mirai

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.050
Imagine driving a car with no harmful emissions,
that could go for 300 miles, and be filled

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.980
back up in 3-5 minutes.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.840
That's the reality of Toyota's upcoming fuel
cell vehicle, which today has been confirmed

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.409
as the Mirai.

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:25.739
The vehicle will go on sale in Japan in April
2015 and should be in U.S. showrooms by the

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.609
following summer, as a 2016 model.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.440
Mirai, which means “future” in Japanese,
is being hailed as a turning point for the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.640
automotive industry as it’s destined to
be the first mass produced vehicle powered

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.320
by a fuel cell stack, which takes in hydrogen
and oxygen and generates electricity to drive

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.649
its motor(s).

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.199
The only by-product is water.

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:55.050
The Mirai, first shown in concept form at
the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show, is expected to

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.539
be sold to customers instead of being leased,
as has been the case for previous fuel cell

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.579
vehicles like Honda's FCX Clarity.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:12.500
In Japan, the vehicle will be priced close
to seven million yen (approximately $60,294).

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.340
Pricing in other markets will be announced
closer to launch.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.630
Of course, whether hydrogen is a realistic
widespread fuel source (right now it's most

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.950
certainly not) and whether it's sourced from
non-fossil-fuel sources (right now most of

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.869
it comes from natural gas), the idea of a
fuel cell vehicle is intriguing to many.

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.619
To help answer these unknowns, Toyota has
also announced a new commitment to drive the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.940
development of a hydrogen refueling infrastructure,
with a new initiative in five northeastern

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.479
U.S. states set to join the existing initiatives
on the west coast.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.850
The automaker is collaborating with a company
called Air Liquide to develop and supply a

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:59.700
phased network of 12 hydrogen stations targeted
for New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.070
and Rhode Island, a move similar to Tesla
Motors’ [NSDQ:TSLA] rollout of Supercharger

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.000
stations to help spur the adoption of its
battery-powered electric cars.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.190
The states and locations Toyota picked were
selected in the greater New York and Boston

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.980
areas so that a backbone of a hydrogen highway
for the Northeast corridor could be developed.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.710
Specific details of the collaboration will
be revealed in the coming months.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.480
The new initiative builds on Toyota’s previous
support for hydrogen infrastructure development

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.410
in California.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.250
In May 2014, Toyota announced a $7.3 million
loan to FirstElement Fuels to support the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.930
operations and maintenance of 19 hydrogen
fueling stations across the state.Mirai
