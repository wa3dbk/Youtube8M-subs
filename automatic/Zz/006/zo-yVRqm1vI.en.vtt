what you need to do is move this rod up
left<00:02:08.080> and<00:02:08.200> right<00:02:08.319> with<00:02:08.649> these<00:02:08.769> two<00:02:09.039> joysticks

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
left and right with these two joysticks

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.369 
left and right with these two joysticks
the<00:02:10.090> right<00:02:10.299> joystick<00:02:10.539> controls<00:02:11.079> the<00:02:11.200> right

controls the left side of the
rod<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.629> you're<00:02:14.959> basically<00:02:15.379> shimmying<00:02:16.459> this

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
rod and you're basically shimmying this

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.660 
rod and you're basically shimmying this
rod<00:02:17.360> up<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:17.870> balancing<00:02:18.739> a<00:02:18.830> ball<00:02:19.069> on<00:02:19.129> it<00:02:19.489> and

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
rod up and balancing a ball on it and

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.220 
rod up and balancing a ball on it and
dropping<00:02:20.030> them<00:02:20.330> in<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.540> appropriate<00:02:20.989> holes

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
dropping them in the appropriate holes

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.320 
dropping them in the appropriate holes
and<00:02:21.590> when<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.340> start<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.730> game<00:02:22.910> of<00:02:23.090> course

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
and when you start the game of course

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.449 
and when you start the game of course
you<00:02:23.510> start<00:02:23.810> on<00:02:23.959> hole<00:02:24.440> number<00:02:24.709> one<00:02:25.160> which<00:02:25.430> is

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
you start on hole number one which is

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.190 
you start on hole number one which is
right<00:02:25.730> here<00:02:25.760> then<00:02:26.540> you<00:02:26.629> go<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.810> hole<00:02:27.019> number

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
right here then you go to hole number

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.229 
right here then you go to hole number
two<00:02:27.530> hole<00:02:27.920> number<00:02:28.099> three<00:02:28.489> hole<00:02:28.730> number<00:02:29.000> four

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
two hole number three hole number four

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.119 
two hole number three hole number four
etc<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.959> when<00:02:30.319> you<00:02:30.379> get<00:02:30.530> all<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.739> way<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:30.890> the

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
etc and when you get all the way to the

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.619 
etc and when you get all the way to the
end<00:02:31.250> you<00:02:31.370> get<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.610> hole<00:02:31.760> number<00:02:31.910> ten<00:02:32.330> and<00:02:32.599> I

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
end you get to hole number ten and I

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:33.880 
end you get to hole number ten and I
guess<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:32.900> kind<00:02:33.049> of<00:02:33.140> win<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:33.470> game<00:02:33.650> but<00:02:33.799> I

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
guess you kind of win the game but I

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.530 
guess you kind of win the game but I
haven't<00:02:34.040> actually<00:02:34.459> gotten<00:02:34.910> that<00:02:35.090> far<00:02:35.299> and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
haven't actually gotten that far and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.180 
haven't actually gotten that far and
it's<00:02:36.140> my<00:02:36.290> understanding<00:02:36.319> that<00:02:36.860> when<00:02:37.099> you

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
it's my understanding that when you

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.190 
it's my understanding that when you
light<00:02:37.670> when<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.209> get<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.480> ball<00:02:38.690> into<00:02:38.959> the

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
light when you get the ball into the

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.430 
light when you get the ball into the
10th<00:02:39.530> hole<00:02:39.769> it<00:02:40.250> turns<00:02:40.790> this<00:02:41.030> star<00:02:41.390> on<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.930> you

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
10th hole it turns this star on and you

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.710 
10th hole it turns this star on and you
say<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:43.430> bartender<00:02:44.030> hey<00:02:44.180> look<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.660> just

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
say to the bartender hey look I just

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.750 
say to the bartender hey look I just
beat<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.319> game<00:02:45.530> give<00:02:45.860> me<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.040> free<00:02:46.310> beer

beat the game give me a free beer

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.970 
beat the game give me a free beer

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
that's the whole game but it gets so

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.580 
that's the whole game but it gets so
much<00:04:49.770> harder<00:04:50.160> the<00:04:50.820> higher<00:04:51.060> you<00:04:51.270> get<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:51.660> more

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
much harder the higher you get the more

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.640

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
of these radicals are around the goal

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.159 
of these radicals are around the goal
hole<00:04:55.979> and<00:04:56.430> of<00:04:56.669> course<00:04:56.910> if<00:04:57.090> my<00:04:57.240> ball<00:04:57.539> goes<00:04:57.840> into

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
hole and of course if my ball goes into

00:04:58.169 --> 00:04:59.659 
hole and of course if my ball goes into
one<00:04:58.289> of<00:04:58.350> the<00:04:58.410> non<00:04:58.680> littles

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
one of the non littles

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.629 
one of the non littles
I<00:04:59.789> lose<00:05:00.389> the<00:05:00.570> ball<00:05:00.780> and<00:05:01.080> and<00:05:01.800> that's<00:05:01.979> it<00:05:02.160> and<00:05:02.550> so

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
I lose the ball and and that's it and so

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.200 
I lose the ball and and that's it and so
you<00:05:03.030> get<00:05:03.240> three<00:05:03.539> hot<00:05:03.870> balls<00:05:04.229> per<00:05:04.620> game<00:05:05.210> and

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
you get three hot balls per game and

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.159 
you get three hot balls per game and
there<00:05:06.720> we<00:05:06.810> go

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
there we go

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.010 
there we go
hole<00:05:07.349> number<00:05:07.379> three<00:05:08.240> and<00:05:09.240> I<00:05:09.539> get<00:05:09.689> a<00:05:09.719> pretty

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
hole number three and I get a pretty

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.709 
hole number three and I get a pretty
decent<00:05:10.110> bonus<00:05:10.710> for<00:05:10.889> that<00:05:10.999> and<00:05:11.999> we<00:05:12.150> move<00:05:12.360> on<00:05:12.509> now
