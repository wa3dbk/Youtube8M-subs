00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.179
 in a smartwatch area that samsung it 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.009
 necessary to show here at the ifa fair and 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.269
 because I took extra time was the 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.589
 announced earlier but 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.669
 this he is really for it 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.759
 shown first 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:19.769
 the time ss to the first s smartwatch 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:21.750
 from samsung and yes that means that 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.730
 samsung that anyway as an important 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.560
 operation to the us and fill it more 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.300
 functions than the earlier smartwatch from 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.320
 samsung and also has a curved 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.210
 display 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.070
 I do n't have a whole here around my hand 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.660
 very handy to see terribly busy 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.430
 the line is all around it 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.320
 pavilion one to come in here 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.560
 so I have one somewhere in between 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.720
 have to pick it out and yes we will 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.510
 do as it can to the gear s 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.000
 is and still a square smartwatch 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.770
 also quite a bit of a crap 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.850
 device it is wonderfully large device 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.020
 so can see 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.700
 curved screen so still quite thick and 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.350
 I think it's already a very big thing 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.540
 on my wrist quickly and and so could not 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.120
 very thick that is no problem 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.250
 with you can still adjust but I 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.750
 it would rather be a bit smaller though 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.630
 very functional that she can do others 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.740
 Of course its great novelty of hm 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.880
 This smartwatch is that you have one 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.070
 SIM card 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.650
 naturally has its own memory and that 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.490
 you camping with a bluetooth headset 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.110
 think if you 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.460
 I found myself running there you can 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.390
 just became music on this market 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.700
 chat your trigger 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.620
 turn on fitness tracker virus marlies 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.659
 it's in your ears and you have it 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.370
 phone no longer needed and if you were still allowed 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.930
 get a text message or something similar 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.100
 is it just as well 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.540
 you can also do it naturally of course 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.550
 pair with your phone you need it too 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.750
 first pair it with your phone 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.040
 before you can use it you must 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.870
 first time with the galaxy phone 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.220
 linked are the approximately 20 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.049
 models that support my 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.549
 devices from other brands that can 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.490
 so do not use along with this time 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.080
 the ice and extra time is working with the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.280
 special application only for 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.790
 So Samsung phones as the reason 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.500
 device must also just have 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.100
 really very extensive function time you 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.710
 can call with it 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.270
 so say this way you can make it 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.049
 of course with a headset with 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.150
 dial 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.710
 you can also just type messages on it 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.720
 and the like completely 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.630
 qwerty keyboard you on the device 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.640
 however, 2 inch screens it is 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.810
 the really a bit of a fuss 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.240
 For very short messages or side 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.260
 useful if you call'm not going 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.570
 record 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.100
 Call you back something like that will be the go 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.020
 but no further after 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.650
 you are not going to come in addition 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.060
 he just yes agenda function you can 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.430
 messages top laser of course also on 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.440
 lakes like reading can be vanalles 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.840
 participate 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.450
 you may also want to measure your heart rate i 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.090
 can now even measure the UV intensity 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.160
 which means you can watch your smart 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.720
 tell which sunscreen bill you are on 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.220
 must do how great the risk is on it 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.020
 burn things like that 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.820
 well what you gotta ask me my 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.170
 little bit who's in here falls 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.720
 of course again a pedometer and 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.870
 that they put things all in all so one 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.250
 huge comprehensive smartwatch 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.720
 a bit of a big black it is 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.070
 also a very expensive smartwatch eyes 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.200
 largest device is around 400 euros 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.090
 the cost of a smartwatch is that 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.170
 of course a good amount he is 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.720
 on the market soon 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.580
 yes my full review a little longer 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.540
 use will show if it 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.430
 device 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.870
 on the one hand is super handy by them 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.790
 comprehensive functionality are 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.130
 just so rude and too big and too expensive 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.200
 the smartwatch not me a lot 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.620
 interesting concept of this samsung galaxy 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.620
 gear s
