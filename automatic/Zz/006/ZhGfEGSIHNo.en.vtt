00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.019
 this new valence stroke is so in fact 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:13.210
 I would like us to paint a little bit of 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.309
 so what are called modes by 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.450
 compared to the major gal it allows me 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.340
 precisely to see the major scale a 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.310
 little bit other than just by 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.650
 sections that actually follow one another 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.300
 on the sleeve but no longer through 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.480
 of interval in fact that we will have to play 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:32.439
 with targets and so let's go 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.170
 with the mode of nothing so in fact the 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.000
 way of nothing what is it so we 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.719
 will work on a mode in fact of 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.670
 one of them nothing so at the beginning the most 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.899
 simple for you to think is that 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.879
 the teen nothing in fact 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:50.850
 it just corresponds to a 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.850
 agreement of the minor 7 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:58.420
 I think there are some of you already 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:00.600
 that they have to say to themselves that so there of a 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.380
 nothing that corresponds to this swimmer 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.790
 it's not totally wrong but it's 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.110
 not the right approach finally greenhouse that 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.760
 if you think about it like I told you 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.730
 you still think that by sections in 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.680
 does the zone think anything like 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.140
 something apart from actually the 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.490
 draille well for the good of nothing 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.520
 in fact you will actually play the 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.410
 second stretch of single major from 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.610
 of another there but we must think that 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.490
 first of all our fundamental is where 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.470
 it's a minor mode 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.440
 and if you think about ground 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.420
 major you will always have a 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:42.600
 major phrasing that will not match 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.030
 simply to the color of the mode 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.729
 give because you simply do not 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.310
 would not target the oxides normally on 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.770
 a grid in A minor I actually play 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:02:00.180
 simply the range of the wiener is to 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:03.750
 say what is called there to wind if 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:12.750
 I superimpose this scheme of range of the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:13.680
 housewife a good scheme beyond nothing I 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.670
 I realize that in fact there is a 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:23.670
 changing interval that is simply 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:25.560
 the 6th which becomes in fact major in 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.069
 is greenhouse that in my mode to wind 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.769
 of which in A minor actually I have six flat 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:36.150
 six miners while in my mode of 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:38.610
 nothing I have all the same notes over to the 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.090
 place of sicsbt flat a 6th fair 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.360
 music six major so we'll say that the 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:50.570
 note mode features nothing of that 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:53.730
 will be the 6th just his six major 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:57.690
 we will also say that it is a mode 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.570
 minor that the third minor is part 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.730
 of these the other characteristic and as 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:07.350
 it's on the second degree range 1900 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.140
 I will also recover the seventh 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.390
 minute 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.990
 like other features so 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.480
 in my mode of nothing the others 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:23.950
 characteristics one is the third 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:28.360
 minors the 7th minute and the 6th in 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:32.140
 ringing his three our there already 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.090
 it's something in it nothing done 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.569
 face in them if I do the same thing 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:42.730
 with my flat six as in the model 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:55.590
 the wind is already beautiful it's not at all 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:04:12.450
 the sound of gold I visualize already 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:12.450
 dairy so here if the 7th and the sixth 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.500
 these are the notes I'm going to have 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.810
 ring in order to make time in 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.430
 do I that I'm trying to 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.870
 play in nothing mode in any case 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.060
 to make people hear 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:33.340
 listen to the dorian color first a 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.090
 sentence in A minor confers in time that 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.090
 can see in a minor 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.050
 but still have nothing so directly 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.050
 conducted on the just a62 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.800
 no 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.479
 if joseph and prevent him from half 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:59.479
 hour for example 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.659
 if I doubt the six 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.090
 the fact of working is actually lemon 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.849
 there in this case today the mode 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:31.160
 doria will allow to visualize 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.759
 intervals the notes and sounds that 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.229
 go with 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:35.479
 on the handle which is of course 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:38.810
 fundamental it will allow you too 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:42.099
 a little bit of sound 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.240
 standards that we hear all the time 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.620
 that is, starting to 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.330
 work mauzac started to do 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.610
 hear sounds a little different 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.659
 that finally always play the range 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.979
 major or holy war has 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.870
 systematically that will force you a 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.610
 little bit to go to new 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.000
 sounds 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:05.949
 which is also very important in 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.949
 your evolution as a musician 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.949
 here 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.540
 m 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.350
 and
