 hello dear friends basis with you 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.330
 climb up on your screens you see 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.910
 another news block which 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.280
 dedicated to battlefield 4 I will hold today 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.340
 small analysis of teasers that carry 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.139
 name sea land and air 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.289
 what we talk about the Chinese side 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.600
 conflicts and a first dlc to battlefield 4 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.600
 let's start with a teaser called sea 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.590
 what this teaser is interesting for and what we 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.290
 see screw court anyone thought so 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.450
 many but if we look here at this 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.910
 frame then we will notice that this object 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.399
 too small for a submarine or 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.879
 crisis is an object more like a torpedo 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.410
 protection of this theory can be presented here 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.420
 this act which appeared after 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.570
 appearances of this teaser 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.879
 on it we see the wounded come back and such 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.119
 damage in my opinion can cause 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:10.280
 only torpedo the second teaser carries 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.280
 name land let's see it 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.420
 well, it's all just a caterpillar from a tank 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:29.439
 t-90 although many have suggested that this 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.560
 caterpillar of the tank type well 99 and this 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.509
 tank we will talk a little later 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.110
 3 teaser most interesting it is called 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.110
 air 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.950
 see the screw of the helicopter this screw is very 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.460
 similar to a screw from a chinese helicopter 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.409
 w for 10 who was in battlefield 2 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.649
 and so you can safely say that 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:06.299
 in battlefield 4 will finally appear to 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:08.709
 the chinese are also from reliable sources 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.470
 came a small bundle of information about 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:15.519
 the technique of the Chinese side conflict in 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.380
 battlefield 4 will be a tank type 99 and 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.040
 the fifth generation aircraft will also appear 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.769
 called j20 interesting and while 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.390

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.459
 battlefield 4 continuing the theme of china 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.610

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.880

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.769
 You gave us a dragon valley 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.590
