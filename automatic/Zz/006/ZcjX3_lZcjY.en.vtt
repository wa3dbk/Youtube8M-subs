00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:12.550 
the AV HP 4200 DVD unit let me expand on

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.590 
the AV HP 4200 DVD unit let me expand on
something<00:00:12.880> I<00:00:12.970> had<00:00:13.090> mentioned<00:00:13.450> earlier

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:13.600 
something I had mentioned earlier

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.070 
something I had mentioned earlier
regarding<00:00:14.500> the<00:00:14.890> 4200<00:00:15.610> versus<00:00:15.970> the<00:00:16.059> 3200<00:00:16.779> units

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
regarding the 4200 versus the 3200 units

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.429 
regarding the 4200 versus the 3200 units
the<00:00:17.740> difference<00:00:18.070> with<00:00:18.279> the<00:00:18.430> 3200<00:00:19.150> are<00:00:19.439> the

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
the difference with the 3200 are the

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:21.659 
the difference with the 3200 are the
physical<00:00:20.890> controls<00:00:21.189> that<00:00:21.310> are<00:00:21.429> here<00:00:21.550> on<00:00:21.640> the

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:21.669 
physical controls that are here on the

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.480 
physical controls that are here on the
bottom<00:00:21.939> are<00:00:22.359> on<00:00:22.990> the<00:00:23.499> left<00:00:23.679> hand<00:00:23.859> side<00:00:24.130> so<00:00:24.160> it's

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
bottom are on the left hand side so it's

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.269 
bottom are on the left hand side so it's
got<00:00:24.640> a<00:00:24.669> smaller<00:00:24.999> LCD<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.890> 3200<00:00:27.460> BT<00:00:28.300> as<00:00:28.630> the<00:00:28.839> BT

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
got a smaller LCD the 3200 BT as the BT

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.260 
got a smaller LCD the 3200 BT as the BT
donates<00:00:30.279> that<00:00:30.550> kind<00:00:31.089> of<00:00:31.119> tates<00:00:31.329> is<00:00:31.539> that<00:00:32.410> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
donates that kind of tates is that the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.240 
donates that kind of tates is that the
BT<00:00:34.270> has<00:00:34.450> bluetooth<00:00:34.840> built<00:00:35.079> into<00:00:35.320> it<00:00:35.440> it's

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
BT has bluetooth built into it it's

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.680 
BT has bluetooth built into it it's
actually<00:00:36.370> 50<00:00:36.760> dollars<00:00:37.059> cheaper<00:00:37.300> than<00:00:37.570> this

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
actually 50 dollars cheaper than this

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.080 
actually 50 dollars cheaper than this
unit<00:00:38.109> that<00:00:39.100> was<00:00:39.219> the<00:00:39.340> unit<00:00:39.520> I<00:00:39.609> thought<00:00:39.850> I<00:00:39.879> was

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
unit that was the unit I thought I was

unit that was the unit I thought I was
going<00:00:40.270> to<00:00:40.449> get<00:00:40.800> but<00:00:41.800> there's<00:00:42.460> one<00:00:42.699> fatal<00:00:43.000> flaw

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359 
going to get but there's one fatal flaw

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:45.599 
going to get but there's one fatal flaw
in<00:00:43.420> that<00:00:43.539> plan<00:00:43.739> if<00:00:44.739> you<00:00:44.859> go<00:00:45.010> take<00:00:45.190> a<00:00:45.250> look<00:00:45.489> at

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
in that plan if you go take a look at

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:51.500 
in that plan if you go take a look at
the<00:00:46.320> 3200<00:00:47.320> units<00:00:47.859> and<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.370> single<00:00:48.789> din<00:00:50.039> 8200

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the 3200 units and the single din 8200

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.439 
the 3200 units and the single din 8200
BT<00:00:52.510> they<00:00:53.350> all<00:00:53.559> three<00:00:53.980> of<00:00:54.039> them<00:00:54.160> have<00:00:54.370> the<00:00:55.059> USB

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
BT they all three of them have the USB

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.720 
BT they all three of them have the USB
port<00:00:55.780> is<00:00:55.929> on<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.260> physical<00:00:56.829> front<00:00:57.190> side<00:00:57.519> of

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
port is on the physical front side of

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.369 
port is on the physical front side of
the<00:00:57.820> unit<00:00:58.089> itself<00:00:58.390> on<00:00:58.629> the<00:00:58.719> outside<00:00:59.079> here

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
the unit itself on the outside here

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:00.990 
the unit itself on the outside here
which<00:00:59.859> means<00:01:00.010> if<00:01:00.190> I<00:01:00.250> sit<00:01:00.489> around<00:01:00.640> here<00:01:00.789> and<00:01:00.879> I'm

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
which means if I sit around here and I'm

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.250 
which means if I sit around here and I'm
going<00:01:01.089> to<00:01:01.179> use<00:01:01.300> it<00:01:01.390> with<00:01:01.449> an<00:01:01.570> iPod<00:01:02.019> all<00:01:02.199> the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
going to use it with an iPod all the

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.229 
going to use it with an iPod all the
time<00:01:02.440> which<00:01:02.589> I<00:01:02.679> usually<00:01:02.949> do<00:01:03.129> I<00:01:03.370> have<00:01:03.940> to<00:01:04.059> have<00:01:04.210> a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
time which I usually do I have to have a

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.110 
time which I usually do I have to have a
cable<00:01:04.780> plugged<00:01:05.260> in<00:01:05.530> to<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.580> front<00:01:06.910> of<00:01:07.030> the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
cable plugged in to the front of the

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.230 
cable plugged in to the front of the
unit<00:01:07.210> all<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.570> time<00:01:07.930> and<00:01:08.259> that's<00:01:08.350> a<00:01:09.009> big<00:01:09.240> drag

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
unit all the time and that's a big drag

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.700 
unit all the time and that's a big drag
to<00:01:10.420> me<00:01:10.509> I<00:01:10.540> didn't<00:01:10.780> like<00:01:10.930> that<00:01:10.960> look<00:01:11.259> at<00:01:11.380> all<00:01:11.530> so

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
to me I didn't like that look at all so

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.410 
to me I didn't like that look at all so
I<00:01:11.740> ended<00:01:11.979> up<00:01:12.070> losing<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.939> bluetooth<00:01:13.270> and

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
certainly like I said you can research

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.640 
certainly like I said you can research
that<00:02:51.420> on<00:02:52.420> how<00:02:52.690> to<00:02:52.750> defeat<00:02:53.020> that<00:02:53.080> if<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:53.470> want

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
that on how to defeat that if you want

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.949 
that on how to defeat that if you want
to<00:02:53.709> do<00:02:53.800> that<00:02:53.950> I<00:02:54.190> don't<00:02:54.520> know<00:02:54.820> if<00:02:54.910> legalities<00:02:55.840> on

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
to do that I don't know if legalities on

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.960 
to do that I don't know if legalities on
that<00:02:56.080> but<00:02:56.260> that's<00:02:56.320> up<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.709> anyway<00:02:57.700> so

I<00:05:59.950> said<00:06:00.220> if<00:06:00.640> I<00:06:00.760> go<00:06:00.910> back<00:06:01.120> here<00:06:01.590> and<00:06:03.360> choose<00:06:04.360> the

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
I said if I go back here and choose the

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:08.310 
I said if I go back here and choose the
appearance<00:06:04.900> in<00:06:05.050> the<00:06:05.140> screen<00:06:05.410> if<00:06:05.560> I<00:06:05.650> go<00:06:05.770> red<00:06:07.320> so

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
appearance in the screen if I go red so

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.760 
appearance in the screen if I go red so
you<00:06:08.410> see<00:06:08.590> it<00:06:12.870> looks<00:06:13.870> a<00:06:13.960> little<00:06:14.050> pinkish<00:06:14.500> to<00:06:14.650> me

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
you see it looks a little pinkish to me

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.310 
you see it looks a little pinkish to me
but<00:06:15.160> but<00:06:15.520> that's<00:06:15.610> red<00:06:15.940> anyway<00:06:16.270> so<00:06:17.080> you<00:06:17.140> can

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
but but that's red anyway so you can

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.810 
but but that's red anyway so you can
adjust<00:06:17.620> your<00:06:17.680> colors<00:06:18.010> however<00:06:18.400> you<00:06:18.490> want<00:06:18.700> and
