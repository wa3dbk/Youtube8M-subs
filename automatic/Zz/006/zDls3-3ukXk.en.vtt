way that most people were recommend to

way that most people were recommend to
you<00:00:21.350> first<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.500> all<00:00:22.730> no<00:00:23.730> half<00:00:24.090> gallon<00:00:24.480> tanks

you first of all no half gallon tanks

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.529 
you first of all no half gallon tanks
that's<00:00:25.650> too<00:00:25.859> small<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.789> it's<00:00:27.210> going<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.449> need

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
that's too small and it's going to need

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.689 
that's too small and it's going to need
daily<00:00:27.750> water<00:00:28.109> changes<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.859> keep<00:00:29.070> ammonia<00:00:29.519> down

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
daily water changes to keep ammonia down

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.470 
daily water changes to keep ammonia down
and<00:00:30.000> there's<00:00:30.179> no<00:00:30.480> room<00:00:30.689> swim<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.920> ideal<00:00:32.489> size

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480

and there's no room swim the ideal size
tank<00:00:33.870> will<00:00:34.020> be<00:00:34.050> 5<00:00:34.320> gallons<00:00:34.800> which<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.100> what

this is but two and a half gallons is
the<00:00:38.879> general<00:00:39.420> rule<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.989> most<00:00:40.680> people<00:00:41.040> can

every<00:00:45.750> other<00:00:45.870> day<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.410> one<00:00:47.129> actually<00:00:47.520> likes

every other day and one actually likes

every other day and one actually likes
the<00:00:48.000> smaller<00:00:48.270> tank<00:00:48.570> better<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> only

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
the smaller tank better it's the only

something to root plants and if you want
plants<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.850> I've<00:01:00.300> got<00:01:00.660> some<00:01:01.469> various<00:01:01.770> live

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980

of driftwood and a heater beta's need a
heater<00:01:14.310> they<00:01:14.880> need<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> temperature

they are tropical fish and they will not
do<00:01:22.950> very<00:01:23.070> well<00:01:23.189> without<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.759> he<00:01:24.390> also<00:01:24.659> has<00:01:25.020> a

do very well without it he also has a
heater<00:01:25.860> back<00:01:26.220> there<00:01:26.460> or<00:01:27.030> not<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.330> heater<00:01:27.600> a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.499 
filter back there I'm sorry and I don't
usually<00:01:31.320> recommend<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.100> Fiat<00:01:32.939> filter<00:01:33.360> for

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
usually recommend a Fiat filter for

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.870 
usually recommend a Fiat filter for
anything<00:01:33.750> under<00:01:34.229> five<00:01:34.740> gallons<00:01:35.189> as<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
anything under five gallons as the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.810 
anything under five gallons as the
filter<00:01:36.210> doesn't<00:01:36.509> really<00:01:37.280> filter<00:01:38.280> much<00:01:38.520> it

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
filter doesn't really filter much it

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.690 
filter doesn't really filter much it
pretty<00:01:39.420> much<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:40.079> there<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:41.009> aerate<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> water

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
pretty much is there to aerate the water

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.109 
pretty much is there to aerate the water
and<00:01:42.140> let<00:01:43.140> good<00:01:43.590> beneficial<00:01:44.070> bacteria<00:01:44.280> grow<00:01:44.939> in

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
and let good beneficial bacteria grow in

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.960 
and let good beneficial bacteria grow in
the<00:01:45.210> tank<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.860> bacteria<00:01:47.369> helps<00:01:47.729> break<00:01:47.939> down

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
the tank the bacteria helps break down

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.350 
the tank the bacteria helps break down
ammonia<00:01:48.659> into<00:01:49.020> nitrites<00:01:49.560> which<00:01:49.860> are<00:01:50.520> not<00:01:51.210> as

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
ammonia into nitrites which are not as

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.749 
ammonia into nitrites which are not as
bad<00:01:51.540> as<00:01:51.720> ammonia<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:52.950> still<00:01:53.100> lethal<00:01:53.340> and

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
bad as ammonia but it's still lethal and

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.899 
bad as ammonia but it's still lethal and
then<00:01:54.710> it<00:01:55.710> breaks<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.189> down<00:01:56.219> even<00:01:56.430> farther<00:01:56.670> into

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
then it breaks it down even farther into

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.179 
then it breaks it down even farther into
nitrates<00:01:57.420> which<00:01:57.540> are<00:01:57.750> harmless<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.380> tank<00:01:59.009> like

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
nitrates which are harmless a tank like

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.190 
nitrates which are harmless a tank like
this<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> fully<00:01:59.850> cycled<00:02:00.329> five<00:02:00.540> gallon<00:02:00.930> tank

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
this a fully cycled five gallon tank

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.929 
this a fully cycled five gallon tank
needs<00:02:01.799> anywhere<00:02:02.310> from<00:02:02.610> like<00:02:03.950> 30<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.250> 50%<00:02:05.520> water
