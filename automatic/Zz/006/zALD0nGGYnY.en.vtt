 wilfried what do you have with skates 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.710

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.940
 woldring people if something we can not do this 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.849
 yes it is a sport that is naturally in its genes full of dutch people and 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:19.630
 so also for me 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.550
 it from the old clichÃ© of as a little boy with the newspapers and the 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.659
 fill in the numbers 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:27.949
 who today 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.369
 watching sports that have evolved for me 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.410
 usually be prosecuted for in my head I myself of course you can 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.799
 and with the absolute top sport where the boundaries are sought from 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.590
 of the physical and notes that the limits of technology 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.130
 and I find that very interesting 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.150
 stock market traders 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.830

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.750

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.060

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.710
 combines 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.479
 4 the mini helps enough skating but also on the track but also next to the 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:24.210

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.750
 know that there is more on the earth
