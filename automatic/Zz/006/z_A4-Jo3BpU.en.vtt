00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.609
 in the Berlin max-schmeling-hall, the foxes received the second 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.939
 Christmas holiday the TSV hannover-burgdorf 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.450
 the Hanoverians richest as table second last to the Spree 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.920
 but who thought that would be a breeze 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.940
 but especially in the first half a perfectly balanced game 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.610
 especially the capitalists were hard for a long time 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.190
 and so came a bit oesch after a mistake of the foxes to the ball and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.580
 turned to 2 2 for the guests 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.610
 until the middle of the first half neither team was able to settle 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.700
 indicative of this scene 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.160
 nice goal for Hannover by Morten Olsen 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.790
 but immediately the Berlin turn on attack again and pull in return 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.900
 that had too much luck was 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.130
 After ten minutes played, the foxes could have a weak phase of the 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.560
 Lower Saxony to their advantage 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.520
 good parade Silvio Heinevetter 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.010
 a successful play building Mikhalkov rocks time 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.010
 and the necessary rest to 10 10 7 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.549
 the Berliners and lord of their own could keep the game more and more 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:25.860
 check 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.290
 Above all, a player squeezed his first half 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.780
 Conny Wilczynski 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.780
 with a nice finish to 16 10 12 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.080
 the possession and could be satisfied with the result of his team 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.920
 as well team players stood from 16 to 14 in the half-time break 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.160
 in the second half the Berliners were able to do their job again 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.610
 noticeably increase 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.890
 nice ball winning in the own half of Markus Richwien 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.570
 and Conny Wilczynski 12 22 to 17 for the capital city 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.749
 the Hanoverians were increasingly having problems seizing the best opportunities 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.670
 fast switching of foxes 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.909
 and Alexander Petersson with a great throw from the backcourt to 26 22 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:14.639
 Men studying standing defensive could be the second most 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.729
 Halftime substitute Peter Stoffel award 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:21.129
 time after time, the 34-year-old rescued brilliantly 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:25.839
 but even in the offensive, the foxes knew more and more to convince 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:29.249
 played a comfortable lead 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:30.790
 sven-sören Christophersen 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.629
 35 28 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.249
 the Berliners could not take the sovereign advantage 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:42.769
 and services at the end of 36 to 28 in the last home game of foxes in March 2010 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:44.989
 Dr 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.689
 Warstein continues in the world 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.719
 Unfortunately we have the percent that would be fatal 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.549
 The middle of the ladies over that is meanwhile but is a strong one 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:54.999
 Crew could 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.189
 how the Lohrer continues 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.150
 the whole is broadened by that, I commemorate and worry since 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.569
 European election unkte 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.079
 The Bitterfeld Serb has managed that there was the second chairman in 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.079
 his cologne he to Andy who in the end the 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.599
 At first you did not want to completely improve that 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.239
 understood Gegenzug also newer back to close we are in the end better 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.889
 succeeded and I think last ten minutes that was again relative 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.689
 clear story 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:27.430
 the team of Dagur Sigurdsson thus remains in the seventeenth home game in 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.919
 Follow unbeaten 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.179
 and consolidates rank two in the table 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:36.329
 percentage of the general public with the first round now their home maiden flight 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:37.299
 and already 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.540
 You can be very happy but we are unbeaten in the cup as well 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.829
 also in the league and it will be happy to join in 2011 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:47.319
 and here the further results of 18 plays 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.969
 Hamburg start 30 to 25 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.259
 Flensburg Wetzlar 42 22

 Friesenheim against Kiel 29 39 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.709
 she has revenue over approx 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.360
 25 24 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.360
 Melsungen against Magdeburg 29 to 29 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:07.120

 and Gummersbach against Lemgo 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.749
 23 to 28 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:16.599
 the table 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:20.579
 The foxes keep the connection to the HSV through the fifteenth win of the season 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.879
 just like Kiel and the Rhein-Neckar Löwen could win 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.039
 The TBV Lemgo has returned to the top half of the table after the victory 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.919
 Hanover-burgdorf remains in the aftermath of the defeat in Berlin 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.789
 Table cellar hanging but is still ahead of Friesenheim 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:36.979
 and the educators
