advanced roof I ever been made I felt

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.280

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
many times and at one moment I feel that

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.330 
many times and at one moment I feel that
I<00:01:29.300> should<00:01:30.300> make<00:01:30.600> an<00:01:30.810> ordinary<00:01:31.140> roof<00:01:31.800> instead

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
I should make an ordinary roof instead

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.160 
I should make an ordinary roof instead
but<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:33.000> try<00:01:33.690> it<00:01:33.750> again

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
but I try it again

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.780 
but I try it again
and<00:01:34.790> yeah<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.820> made<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.130> this<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.369> what<00:01:38.640> it

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
and yeah I made it and this is what it

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.440 
and yeah I made it and this is what it
look<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:41.250> second<00:01:41.729> thing<00:01:41.940> is<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.180> you

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
look like the second thing is that you

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.430 
look like the second thing is that you
will<00:01:42.750> notice<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.830> have<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.430> shiny<00:01:45.440> floor

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
will notice that I have a shiny floor

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.120 
will notice that I have a shiny floor
inside<00:01:46.890> house<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.940> is<00:01:48.119> actually<00:01:48.750> a

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
inside house and this is actually a

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.150 
inside house and this is actually a
download<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.610> downloaded<00:01:51.180> from<00:01:51.860> mod<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
download that I downloaded from mod the

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.450 
download that I downloaded from mod the
seams<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:54.300> called<00:01:54.660> me<00:01:55.229> rock<00:01:55.680> or<00:01:56.100> something

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
seams it called me rock or something

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.660 
seams it called me rock or something
like<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.690> but<00:01:57.690> I<00:01:57.990> think<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.100> looks<00:01:59.340> really

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
like that but I think it looks really

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.400 
like that but I think it looks really
cool<00:01:59.940> when<00:02:00.300> you<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.630> it's<00:02:00.840> shiny

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
cool when you have it's shiny

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.850 
cool when you have it's shiny
anyway<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.460> God<00:02:02.790> took<00:02:03.690> me<00:02:03.930> surprise<00:02:04.560> they

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
anyway the God took me surprise they

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.880 
anyway the God took me surprise they
just<00:02:05.340> only<00:02:05.580> one<00:02:05.940> hour<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.630> 30<00:02:07.140> minutes<00:02:07.319> and

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
just only one hour and 30 minutes and

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.390 
just only one hour and 30 minutes and
I'm<00:02:08.759> real<00:02:09.149> worried<00:02:09.929> if<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.950> did<00:02:11.160> something

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
I'm real worried if I did something

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.809 
I'm real worried if I did something
wrong

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
wrong

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.270 
wrong
but<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.840> garden<00:02:13.200> turned<00:02:13.590> out<00:02:13.710> really<00:02:14.069> really

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
but the garden turned out really really

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.990 
but the garden turned out really really
nice<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:15.120> think<00:02:15.890> normally<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:17.250> garden<00:02:17.730> takes

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
nice I think normally a garden takes

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.309 
nice I think normally a garden takes
over<00:02:18.510> eight<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.800> nine<00:02:20.010> hours<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:21.000> yeah<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:22.260> is
