the head on the side and um rampage

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.730 
the head on the side and um rampage
looks<00:02:44.380> very<00:02:44.470> nice<00:02:44.920> as<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.790> other<00:02:45.940> leg<00:02:46.710> to<00:02:47.710> the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
looks very nice as the other leg to the

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.400 
looks very nice as the other leg to the
left<00:02:48.070> side<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:49.510> what<00:02:49.660> you're<00:02:49.810> going<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:50.020> do<00:02:50.140> is

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
left side so what you're going to do is

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.090 
left side so what you're going to do is
I'm<00:02:50.650> bit<00:02:51.550> like<00:02:51.700> this<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:54.130> it<00:02:54.280> almost<00:02:55.860> get<00:02:56.860> back

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
I'm bit like this and it almost get back

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.150 
I'm bit like this and it almost get back
like<00:02:57.340> this<00:03:00.360> put<00:03:01.360> these<00:03:01.600> two<00:03:01.840> down<00:03:02.080> and<00:03:02.380> there

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
like this put these two down and there

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.010 
like this put these two down and there
is<00:03:03.280> just<00:03:03.460> a<00:03:03.640> little<00:03:03.850> tab<00:03:04.180> it's<00:03:04.480> very<00:03:04.720> loose

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
is just a little tab it's very loose

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.340 
is just a little tab it's very loose
though<00:03:05.320> so<00:03:05.980> uh<00:03:06.010> these<00:03:06.760> two<00:03:07.090> come<00:03:07.480> off<00:03:07.630> fairly

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
though so uh these two come off fairly

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.630 
though so uh these two come off fairly
easy<00:03:08.710> and<00:03:10.710> to<00:03:11.710> demolisher<00:03:12.960> this<00:03:13.960> one<00:03:14.260> is

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
easy and to demolisher this one is

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.580 
easy and to demolisher this one is
really<00:03:15.640> simple<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.360> just<00:03:16.690> have<00:03:17.050> to<00:03:17.170> put<00:03:17.380> these

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
really simple you just have to put these

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.520 
really simple you just have to put these
the<00:03:18.100> wheels<00:03:18.340> up<00:03:18.610> and<00:03:19.620> rotate<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.800> treads<00:03:21.070> down

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
the wheels up and rotate the treads down

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.210 
the wheels up and rotate the treads down
the<00:03:23.530> trips<00:03:23.830> down<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.810> very<00:03:26.530> simple<00:03:26.950> on<00:03:27.010> that

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
the trips down and very simple on that

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.460 
the trips down and very simple on that
one<00:03:27.400> overload<00:03:28.360> what<00:03:28.900> you're<00:03:29.050> going<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.230> do<00:03:29.320> is

one overload what you're going to do is
just<00:03:29.500> bring<00:03:30.430> this<00:03:30.730> out<00:03:31.950> put<00:03:32.950> them<00:03:33.190> just<00:03:33.580> like

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
just bring this out put them just like

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.960 
just bring this out put them just like
you're<00:03:34.120> putting<00:03:34.300> it<00:03:34.450> back<00:03:35.580> spread<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.700> feet

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
you're putting it back spread the feet

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.000 
you're putting it back spread the feet
and<00:03:38.850> move<00:03:39.850> this<00:03:40.060> whole<00:03:40.300> assembly<00:03:41.010> downwards

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
and move this whole assembly downwards

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.870 
and move this whole assembly downwards
move<00:03:43.000> through<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.420> thumb<00:03:43.570> back<00:03:44.580> now<00:03:45.580> that<00:03:45.820> we

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
move through the thumb back now that we

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.550 
move through the thumb back now that we
have<00:03:45.910> them<00:03:46.180> in<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.390> piece<00:03:46.600> is<00:03:46.810> time<00:03:47.110> to<00:03:47.380> put

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
have them in the piece is time to put

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.080 
have them in the piece is time to put
them<00:03:47.830> together<00:03:48.540> start<00:03:49.540> with<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.810> bottom<00:03:51.090> okay

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
them together start with the bottom okay

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.520 
them together start with the bottom okay
now<00:03:52.239> so<00:03:52.600> you<00:03:52.690> just<00:03:52.840> want<00:03:53.050> these<00:03:53.200> treads

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
now so you just want these treads

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.830 
now so you just want these treads
there's<00:03:53.770> little<00:03:54.040> tabs<00:03:54.310> here<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:54.880> you're<00:03:55.720> just

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
there's little tabs here and you're just

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.420 
there's little tabs here and you're just
going<00:03:55.989> to<00:03:56.080> want<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.320> slide<00:03:56.500> them<00:03:56.739> in<00:03:59.430> right

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
going to want to slide them in right

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.030 
going to want to slide them in right
here<00:04:01.980> can<00:04:02.980> be<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.160> little<00:04:03.459> bit<00:04:03.670> tough<00:04:03.940> at<00:04:04.480> first

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
here can be a little bit tough at first

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.570 
here can be a little bit tough at first
just<00:04:06.040> there<00:04:06.520> we<00:04:06.820> go<00:04:06.970> tabs<00:04:07.840> them<00:04:07.989> in<00:04:08.140> and<00:04:08.350> then

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
just there we go tabs them in and then

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.390 
just there we go tabs them in and then
the<00:04:09.580> wheels<00:04:09.760> just<00:04:10.650> snap<00:04:11.650> right<00:04:11.680> into<00:04:11.920> those

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
the wheels just snap right into those

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.370 
the wheels just snap right into those
and<00:04:12.700> you<00:04:13.239> can<00:04:13.450> put<00:04:13.690> this<00:04:13.870> back<00:04:14.110> you<00:04:14.140> can

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
and you can put this back you can

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.890 
and you can put this back you can
actually<00:04:14.680> push<00:04:14.890> it<00:04:15.070> in<00:04:15.220> if<00:04:15.430> you<00:04:15.550> want<00:04:15.580> I<00:04:16.060> tend

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
to leave it out though and almost like a

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.810 
to leave it out though and almost like a
tail<00:04:19.870> if<00:04:20.200> you<00:04:20.380> put<00:04:20.560> it<00:04:20.650> down<00:04:20.830> and<00:04:21.400> I<00:04:21.549> leave<00:04:21.789> it

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
tail if you put it down and I leave it

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
tail if you put it down and I leave it
like<00:04:22.090> that<00:04:22.500> fold<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.590> arms<00:04:23.680> in<00:04:24.190> and<00:04:24.840> there's

in very simple move down the lights and
let's<00:04:48.979> just<00:04:49.190> grasp<00:04:49.490> them<00:04:49.789> on<00:04:50.030> the<00:04:50.240> wheels<00:04:50.449> and

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
let's just grasp them on the wheels and

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.059 
let's just grasp them on the wheels and
there's<00:04:51.889> the<00:04:52.099> face<00:04:52.340> with<00:04:52.610> the<00:04:52.639> head<00:04:53.000> and<00:04:54.069> up

there's the face with the head and up
coming<00:04:55.610> out<00:04:55.759> to<00:04:55.909> catch<00:04:56.180> on<00:04:56.479> all<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.530> limbs

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
coming out to catch on all the limbs

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.089 
coming out to catch on all the limbs
right<00:04:58.970> here<00:04:59.240> it's<00:04:59.389> just<00:04:59.479> very<00:04:59.930> tight<00:05:00.380> so<00:05:01.069> it

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
right here it's just very tight so it

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.279 
right here it's just very tight so it
might<00:05:01.520> take<00:05:01.550> me<00:05:01.970> a<00:05:02.060> second<00:05:02.479> to<00:05:02.539> kind<00:05:02.840> of<00:05:02.990> snap

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
might take me a second to kind of snap

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.999 
might take me a second to kind of snap
it<00:05:03.500> in<00:05:03.650> because<00:05:03.860> it's<00:05:04.130> so<00:05:04.280> tight<00:05:04.550> but<00:05:04.940> uh<00:05:04.970> oh
