with you guys on both consoles because

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.090 
with you guys on both consoles because
that's<00:03:18.780> what<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:18.900> look<00:03:19.050> forward<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.650> in

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
that's what I look forward to and in

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.710 
that's what I look forward to and in
addition<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.459> that<00:03:20.580> i<00:03:20.610> will<00:03:20.910> be<00:03:20.940> playing<00:03:21.150> pc

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
addition to that i will be playing pc

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.160

once<00:03:22.260> it's<00:03:22.440> released<00:03:22.590> later<00:03:23.130> on<00:03:23.370> in<00:03:23.550> 2015<00:03:24.510> so

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
once it's released later on in 2015 so

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.740 
once it's released later on in 2015 so
overall<00:03:25.800> i<00:03:26.070> think<00:03:26.130> that<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:27.000> announcement<00:03:27.660> of

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
overall i think that the announcement of

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.650 
overall i think that the announcement of
next<00:03:28.170> gen<00:03:28.380> came<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.370> shock<00:03:29.790> for<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.450> lot<00:03:30.630> of

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
next gen came to a shock for a lot of

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.470 
next gen came to a shock for a lot of
people<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.290> i'm<00:03:32.190> not<00:03:32.370> exactly<00:03:32.760> sure<00:03:32.970> where<00:03:33.450> I

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
people and i'm not exactly sure where I

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.720 
people and i'm not exactly sure where I
stand<00:03:33.930> whether<00:03:34.320> or<00:03:34.500> not<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.920> was<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.640> know

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730
