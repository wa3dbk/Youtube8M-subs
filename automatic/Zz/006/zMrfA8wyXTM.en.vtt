00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:22.859 

and<00:01:14.990> another<00:01:15.290> side

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.880 

like<00:01:23.439> this

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890

so<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.030> will<00:01:27.180> make<00:01:27.330> sure<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:28.650> middle<00:01:29.010> of

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
so that you will make sure the middle of

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.120 
so that you will make sure the middle of
a<00:01:29.820> shoelace<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> middle<00:01:31.830> efficient

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
a shoelace is in the middle efficient

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:43.260 
a shoelace is in the middle efficient
now<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.790> your<00:01:36.240> work<00:01:36.530> for<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:37.830> side<00:01:38.130> boys

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.170 

fold<00:01:43.870> it<00:01:43.960> like<00:01:44.110> this<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:45.369> you<00:01:45.490> need<00:01:45.580> to<00:01:45.670> count

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
fold it like this but you need to count

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.359 
fold it like this but you need to count
this<00:01:47.020> is<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:47.830> whole<00:01:48.100> one<00:01:48.400> hold<00:01:49.390> two<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:50.369> hold

this is the whole one hold two and hold

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.950 
this is the whole one hold two and hold
three<00:01:51.729> and<00:01:52.110> hold<00:01:53.110> four<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:55.450> you<00:01:55.510> need<00:01:56.110> to

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
three and hold four so you need to

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.980 
three and hold four so you need to
insert<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.409> end<00:02:00.040> of<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:00.280> shoelace<00:02:00.720> into<00:02:01.720> hole

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
shoelace held from the bottom of the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.720 
shoelace held from the bottom of the
hole<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:26.170> will<00:02:26.410> put<00:02:26.710> it<00:02:26.830> from<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.280> bottom

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
hole and you will put it from the bottom

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.710 
hole and you will put it from the bottom
of<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.210> hole<00:02:28.450> five<00:02:28.750> here<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:33.520> will<00:02:33.970> see<00:02:34.420> it

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
of the hole five here so you will see it

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:43.520 
of the hole five here so you will see it
come<00:02:35.110> out<00:02:35.320> from<00:02:35.800> hole<00:02:36.100> 5<00:02:36.400> like<00:02:37.150> this

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.690 

turning<00:02:44.280> back<00:02:45.770> to<00:02:46.770> whole<00:02:47.010> number<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.490> the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
turning back to whole number to the

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
turning back to whole number to the
other<00:02:47.730> side<00:02:48.380> so<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.410> this<00:02:50.190> line<00:02:50.600> will<00:02:51.600> be

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
other side so that this line will be

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.660 
other side so that this line will be
parallel<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.410> each<00:02:52.590> other<00:02:54.350> put<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:55.550> from<00:02:56.550> the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
parallel to each other put it from the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:05.030 
parallel to each other put it from the
top<00:02:58.460> put<00:02:59.460> it<00:02:59.490> from<00:02:59.850> the<00:02:59.970> top

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.580 

now<00:03:05.780> you<00:03:06.780> have<00:03:07.519> you<00:03:08.519> can<00:03:08.819> align

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
now you have you can align

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.350 
now you have you can align
so<00:03:11.010> now<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.250> have<00:03:11.550> these<00:03:11.760> two<00:03:11.819> lines<00:03:12.150> parallel

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
so now you have these two lines parallel

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.190 
so now you have these two lines parallel
to<00:03:12.959> each<00:03:13.080> other<00:03:13.700> again

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
need to put the middle point here the

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.840 
need to put the middle point here the
middle<00:04:31.020> in<00:04:31.230> sections<00:04:31.970> to<00:04:32.970> make<00:04:33.210> this<00:04:34.170> line

middle in sections to make this line
under<00:04:35.930> design<00:04:37.010> so<00:04:38.010> let's<00:04:38.940> see<00:04:40.430> put<00:04:41.430> another

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
under design so let's see put another

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.780 
under design so let's see put another
top<00:04:41.940> of<00:04:42.180> design<00:04:42.870> and<00:04:43.200> the<00:04:43.460> bottom<00:04:44.460> of<00:04:44.580> this

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
top of design and the bottom of this

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.380 
top of design and the bottom of this
line<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.360> on<00:04:45.840> top<00:04:46.080> of<00:04:46.200> this<00:04:46.350> line<00:04:46.590> before<00:04:47.430> you

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
line and on top of this line before you

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.190 
line and on top of this line before you
put<00:04:48.690> it<00:04:49.500> into<00:04:50.070> hole<00:04:50.940> number<00:04:50.970> four<00:04:51.870> of<00:04:52.140> the

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
put it into hole number four of the

00:04:52.200 --> 00:05:02.140 
put it into hole number four of the
other<00:04:52.350> side<00:04:52.760> put<00:04:53.760> it<00:04:53.910> like<00:04:54.090> this

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.930 

so<00:05:02.690> you<00:05:02.750> have<00:05:03.139> a<00:05:03.440> shape<00:05:04.250> like<00:05:04.370> this<00:05:06.190> now<00:05:07.190> you

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
so you have a shape like this now you

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.689 
so you have a shape like this now you
need<00:05:08.150> to<00:05:08.419> use<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:10.550> bottom<00:05:10.970> of<00:05:11.300> this<00:05:11.570> hole<00:05:11.870> so

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
need to use the bottom of this hole so

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.750 
need to use the bottom of this hole so
you<00:05:13.699> put<00:05:14.060> it<00:05:14.300> from<00:05:14.840> the<00:05:14.990> bottom<00:05:15.410> and<00:05:16.340> take<00:05:16.580> it

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
you put it from the bottom and take it

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.780 
you put it from the bottom and take it
out<00:05:16.880> like<00:05:17.330> this<00:05:17.889> make<00:05:18.889> another<00:05:19.160> line<00:05:19.370> parallel

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
out like this make another line parallel

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.610 
out like this make another line parallel
to<00:05:19.970> this<00:05:20.389> line<00:05:20.449> but<00:05:21.320> let's<00:05:22.160> see<00:05:22.419> if<00:05:23.419> this<00:05:24.320> is<00:05:24.350> on

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
to this line but let's see if this is on

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.150 
to this line but let's see if this is on
the<00:05:24.740> top<00:05:24.949> this<00:05:25.940> should<00:05:26.270> be<00:05:26.419> a<00:05:26.449> lobotomy<00:05:26.990> so<00:05:27.889> put

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
the top this should be a lobotomy so put

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.270 
the top this should be a lobotomy so put
it<00:05:28.310> below<00:05:29.979> this<00:05:30.979> line<00:05:31.960> above<00:05:32.960> the<00:05:33.680> line<00:05:34.010> and

bottom and you will see it turn out like
this

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:13.959 
this

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:17.739 
this
what<00:06:14.959> you<00:06:15.110> needed<00:06:15.319> asked<00:06:16.009> is<00:06:16.189> to<00:06:16.819> take<00:06:17.119> this

what you needed asked is to take this

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:21.309 
what you needed asked is to take this
line<00:06:18.080> into<00:06:18.949> the<00:06:19.069> top<00:06:19.309> of<00:06:20.119> the<00:06:20.629> last<00:06:20.809> hole<00:06:21.110> of

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:21.319 
line into the top of the last hole of

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:26.679 
line into the top of the last hole of
the<00:06:21.469> other<00:06:21.619> side<00:06:21.889> but<00:06:23.740> remember<00:06:24.740> again<00:06:25.689> you

the other side but remember again you

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:34.059 
the other side but remember again you
need<00:06:26.809> to<00:06:26.869> make<00:06:29.469> a<00:06:30.469> cross<00:06:31.249> of<00:06:31.849> this<00:06:32.149> one<00:06:33.069> see

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:34.069 
need to make a cross of this one see

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:37.239 
need to make a cross of this one see
this<00:06:34.369> one<00:06:34.580> is<00:06:34.759> on<00:06:35.270> a<00:06:35.330> top<00:06:35.629> and<00:06:36.619> so<00:06:36.889> it<00:06:37.009> should<00:06:37.159> be

00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:37.249 
this one is on a top and so it should be

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:39.549 
this one is on a top and so it should be
on<00:06:37.369> the<00:06:37.459> bottom<00:06:37.580> like<00:06:37.849> this<00:06:37.969> and<00:06:38.330> vice<00:06:39.229> versa

00:06:39.549 --> 00:06:39.559 
on the bottom like this and vice versa

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:44.769 
on the bottom like this and vice versa
of<00:06:39.589> this<00:06:39.949> one<00:06:41.680> so<00:06:42.680> if<00:06:43.309> this<00:06:43.459> is<00:06:43.639> on<00:06:43.759> the<00:06:43.879> top<00:06:44.089> it

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:44.779 
of this one so if this is on the top it

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:48.249 
of this one so if this is on the top it
should<00:06:45.139> be<00:06:45.259> on<00:06:45.349> the<00:06:45.439> bottom<00:06:46.629> put<00:06:47.629> it<00:06:47.779> from<00:06:48.229> the
