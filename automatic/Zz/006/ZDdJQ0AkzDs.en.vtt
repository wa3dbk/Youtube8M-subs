the way through so unlike pizza I'm
going<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:33.369> eat<00:01:33.490> one<00:01:33.670> day

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.090 

the<00:01:41.240> flesh<00:01:42.240> isn't<00:01:42.569> quite<00:01:43.289> kind<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.859> same

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the flesh isn't quite kind of the same

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.279 
the flesh isn't quite kind of the same
as<00:01:44.340> Y<00:01:44.520> 1<00:01:44.850> 0<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.689> lot<00:01:45.840> paler<00:01:47.840> ones<00:01:48.840> ones

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
as Y 1 0 it's a lot paler ones ones

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.219 
as Y 1 0 it's a lot paler ones ones
although<00:01:49.770> sometimes<00:01:50.069> you<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.460> get<00:01:50.609> fish<00:01:51.140> in<00:01:52.140> a

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
although sometimes you can get fish in a

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.190 
although sometimes you can get fish in a
while<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.770> do<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.009> dailies<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.909> say<00:01:54.179> I<00:01:54.420> think

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
while to do that dailies I say I think

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.260 
while to do that dailies I say I think
it<00:01:55.289> depends<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.679> how<00:01:55.799> much<00:01:56.030> or<00:01:57.030> how<00:01:57.090> many

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
it depends on how much or how many

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.969 
it depends on how much or how many
crustaceans<00:01:58.020> they<00:01:58.170> new<00:01:58.649> diet<00:02:01.069> a<00:02:03.530> lot<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.619> fun<00:02:04.770> -

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
crustaceans they new diet a lot of fun -

fun<00:02:05.340> -<00:02:05.609> and<00:02:05.789> food<00:02:06.060> anyway<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:08.420> is<00:02:09.420> awesome

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.400

to put some some glad wrap on this one
I'm<00:02:46.880> sticking<00:02:47.210> underneath<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.660> just<00:02:48.470> show<00:02:48.590> the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
I'm sticking underneath to just show the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.920 
I'm sticking underneath to just show the
comparison<00:02:48.950> between<00:02:49.340> this<00:02:49.640> in<00:02:49.850> there<00:02:50.000> the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
comparison between this in there the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.920 
comparison between this in there the
little<00:02:51.080> fingerlings<00:02:51.530> bill<00:02:52.010> right<00:02:52.250> now

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.780 

oh<00:02:56.990> there's<00:02:57.410> my<00:02:57.530> little<00:02:57.560> fish<00:02:57.830> feeder<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.310> can

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
oh there's my little fish feeder I can

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.990 
oh there's my little fish feeder I can
do<00:02:58.940> and<00:02:59.830> I've<00:03:00.830> put<00:03:01.160> some<00:03:01.310> guards<00:03:01.730> on<00:03:01.880> it

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
do and I've put some guards on it

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.830 
do and I've put some guards on it
because<00:03:02.300> they<00:03:02.450> splash<00:03:02.720> around<00:03:03.050> so<00:03:03.230> much<00:03:03.410> that

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
because they splash around so much that

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.200 
because they splash around so much that
it<00:03:05.840> holds<00:03:06.380> up<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.740> fish<00:03:07.730> feeder<00:03:09.850> so<00:03:10.850> I've

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
it holds up to the fish feeder so I've

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.190 
it holds up to the fish feeder so I've
probably<00:03:11.480> got<00:03:11.860> motion<00:03:12.860> changes<00:03:13.490> here<00:03:13.760> because

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
probably got motion changes here because
