00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
the xbox one I the only problem I'm

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.710 
the xbox one I the only problem I'm
having<00:02:19.569> right<00:02:19.959> now<00:02:20.230> is<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.890> UM<00:02:21.010> right<00:02:21.760> RB<00:02:22.690> I

will<00:02:26.980> shift<00:02:27.250> over<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:27.909> right<00:02:28.090> bumper

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
will shift over and the right bumper

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.870 
will shift over and the right bumper
gets<00:02:28.659> caught

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
gets caught

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.900 
gets caught

notice<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.280> gameplay<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:45.760> totally<00:02:46.360> out<00:02:46.390> of

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
notice the gameplay is totally out of

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.120 
notice the gameplay is totally out of
sync<00:02:46.810> with<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:48.660> what<00:02:49.660> I'm<00:02:49.810> doing<00:02:50.170> it's<00:02:50.890> not

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
sync with the what I'm doing it's not

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.760 
sync with the what I'm doing it's not
even<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.460> same<00:02:51.490> gameplay<00:02:52.120> gameplay<00:02:53.080> as<00:02:53.470> to

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
even the same gameplay gameplay as to

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:02.630 
even the same gameplay gameplay as to
the<00:02:55.230> video<00:02:56.230> so<00:02:56.980> that's<00:02:57.610> why<00:02:58.800> the<00:03:00.840> controller

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
the video so that's why the controller

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.220 
the video so that's why the controller
feels<00:03:03.640> good<00:03:03.880> it<00:03:04.120> doesn't<00:03:04.300> inhibit<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:04.990> and<00:03:05.140> I

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
feels good it doesn't inhibit it and I

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.470 
feels good it doesn't inhibit it and I
like<00:03:05.560> some<00:03:06.130> people<00:03:06.430> don't<00:03:06.640> like<00:03:06.700> where<00:03:07.060> the
