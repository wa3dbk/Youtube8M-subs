00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
can't use that but I'm gonna try and

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.850 
can't use that but I'm gonna try and

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.770 
storage space for us if you're going to
be<00:05:49.710> using<00:05:49.979> lots<00:05:50.160> of<00:05:50.370> drives<00:05:50.640> or<00:05:51.000> even<00:05:51.390> a<00:05:51.450> lot<00:05:51.660> of

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
be using lots of drives or even a lot of

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.779 
be using lots of drives or even a lot of
storage<00:05:51.990> space<00:05:52.110> in<00:05:52.470> the<00:05:52.560> near<00:05:52.710> future<00:05:52.890> then

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
storage space in the near future then

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:55.940 
storage space in the near future then
yes<00:05:54.060> it<00:05:54.600> would<00:05:54.660> be<00:05:54.930> worth<00:05:55.110> that<00:05:55.289> you<00:05:55.470> can<00:05:55.770> just

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
yes it would be worth that you can just

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.070 
yes it would be worth that you can just
take<00:05:56.070> a<00:05:56.100> drive<00:05:56.340> when<00:05:56.669> it's<00:05:56.850> full<00:05:57.060> what<00:05:57.810> a<00:05:57.840> new

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
take a drive when it's full what a new

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.510 
take a drive when it's full what a new
empty<00:05:58.350> drive<00:05:58.650> straight<00:05:58.919> and<00:05:59.100> there<00:05:59.220> and<00:05:59.400> keep

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
empty drive straight and there and keep

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.500 
empty drive straight and there and keep
going<00:05:59.729> like<00:05:59.850> there<00:06:00.000> any<00:06:00.150> bother

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
going like there any bother

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
so I'll mature or them even enthusiasts

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.580 
so I'll mature or them even enthusiasts
valuators<00:06:03.870> or<00:06:04.289> photographers<00:06:05.220> then<00:06:05.580> yes

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
valuators or photographers then yes

or a secure reliable redundant venue and

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.830 
or a secure reliable redundant venue and
and<00:06:14.490> scratch<00:06:14.880> drive<00:06:15.270> probably<00:06:16.169> not<00:06:17.840> for

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
and scratch drive probably not for

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.180 
and scratch drive probably not for
serious<00:06:19.050> video<00:06:19.470> editors<00:06:19.830> that<00:06:19.860> want<00:06:20.130> that

kinda<00:06:20.550> redundant<00:06:20.970> in<00:06:21.150> backup<00:06:21.630> then<00:06:22.320> I'd

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
kinda redundant in backup then I'd

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.500 
kinda redundant in backup then I'd
probably<00:06:22.830> suggest<00:06:23.190> saving<00:06:23.789> your<00:06:24.060> money<00:06:24.180> and

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
probably suggest saving your money and

probably suggest saving your money and
getting<00:06:24.810> the<00:06:25.590> robotics<00:06:26.250> drible<00:06:26.550> something

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
getting the robotics drible something

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.010 
getting the robotics drible something
like<00:06:27.419> that<00:06:27.950> or<00:06:28.950> I<00:06:28.979> dedicated<00:06:29.940> read<00:06:30.180> inclusion

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
like that or I dedicated read inclusion

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.270 
like that or I dedicated read inclusion
which<00:06:31.590> is<00:06:31.740> going<00:06:31.919> to<00:06:31.979> give<00:06:32.070> you<00:06:32.190> the
