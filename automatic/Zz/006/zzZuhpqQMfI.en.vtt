00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.490
 that we both returned after 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.490
 these educational videos 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.370
 exactly let's continue here in 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.660
 can control with more video games and 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.270
 we also have some also 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.289
 releases that they made for xbox one 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:26.199
 and you go plants against zombies 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.960
 the good room if you like the pacific 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.519
 the call of duty and you still want to give 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.100
 more shrapnel 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:36.370
 the truth is a game if you're a fan of the 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.260
 series of plants against zombies good is 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.760
 for obviously if fans 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.860
 fans of the series of plants against 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.510
 zombies but the game style of this 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.909
 it is handled good for those who remember 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.269
 the game and the software that good put 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:51.280
 very fashionable the horde game mode 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.079
 which means that he had good with several 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.089
 comrades are going to have to eat like 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.839
 strong a point that they will be 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:00.460
 defending after every wave of 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.500
 enemies give them money they give 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.000
 experience and with that they are doing 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.520
 stronger for the coordinates that 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.130
 then the plants against 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.770
 zombies gardens warfare is what emulates 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.960
 a go looks like a horde mode 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.640
 gears of war in all these files 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.659
 good the skills as the 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.600
 characters to and going up let's say 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.189
 level that also the new attacks that 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.380
 they are giving this interesting jump 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.700
 chido serves you to hang out but 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.060
 obviously it is not a game that can be 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.860
 invest in a store hours 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.570
 or something like that for what there are many 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.340
 times is not a game of what is 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.920
 known as what not to spend a casual 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.729
 a little while playing and then to do 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.729
 another thing 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.820
 counterpose that outside pressure 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.210
 look at this 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.560
 personally, I'm not such a fan of why 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.650
 we put you hundred rating and 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.200
 let's go to the next game 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.990
 this is the truth of its for fans 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.380
 dragonball z for the battle of the 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.380
 zetas 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.159
 I think that this game I do not know how 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.690
 to rate it is that I do not know where 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.200
 start 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.640
 it's a big game is flatly the 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.510
 story from the moment they can 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.600
 play four has creel ins against 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.730
 spicy 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.260
 tell him autogyro there is truth because 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.000
 Now you can see four players against 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.710
 four players yes but we are not 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.930
 speaking in multiple games we are not 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.140
 talking about campaign mode has mode 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.870
 campaign I have the opportunity of 4 4 and 3 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.110
 crimes against freezer exactly and 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.810
 that was in the story mode now because 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.830
 as an influence of truth does not have 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.940
 I felt the story and it's an extensive and 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.280
 the worst 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.140
 there they go gameplay survey 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.380
 you only use a single button for best 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.850
 battles a single button in a triangle 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.820
 this when with the perfect playstation 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.910
 america but if a single button fly 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.880
 upload low button button button button and to the 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.740
 end between energy to the sun is something 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.040
 pretty bizarre has two buttons for 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.810
 fly but deadline plus one to attack the 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.610
 truth is that estilan lacked a lot in 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.170
 playability as you say are taken 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.090
 many freedoms of history can 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.280
 fight 4 okur against the androids 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.940
 then the truth if we can not 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.990
 finish 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.560
 efe 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.530
 4 there and we three normal and not what 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.310
 we can finish is amazing is a 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.170
 not so bad game 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.360
 but good in what fits now 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.310
 you can play there you have fun and you 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.710
 Risk Risks How bad the game is 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.230
 and the truth graphically looks good and 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.970
 the music is not the same in intention 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.970
 also something from the zetas 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:58.910
 get something out of them also 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.750
 the white to be that is some 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.750
 seeds 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.150
 in everything I'm in all this 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.770
 every time you play for a qualification 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.320
 5 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.570
 because once again history does not follow 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.190
 but it's fun after seeing well 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.410
 exactly true that it is a single button 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.110
 it plays well and entertains you but not 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.110
 follow the story of the dragon vote 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.659
 but with more educational videos here in 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.000
 the 99 and we're going in here out the 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:35.639
 control with everyone's favorite section 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.990
 the cinema we go to the movies with poo here 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.990
 can only control
