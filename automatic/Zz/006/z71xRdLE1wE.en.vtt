00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.640
 Uza 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.640
 Yup 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.870
 In because I'm in I'm also the I mean the people of the sentence 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.580
 Well, that's right 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:33.920
 For example, I think that even elementary school and junior high school were writing at this time 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.660
 I dare to say that-I think that there are various historical kake 6 well 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.540
 But basically that 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:44.160
 Say write your own something feelings 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:47.400
 I went to an exercise, but my head is trying to buy a personal feeling 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.150
 But just that transfer admission 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.110
 Well you to and you're good to the university's 2 paper whether or entry sheet likely 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.110
 Maybe it is so 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:04.650
 It's no good at that kind of a single borrowed bought only the subjective feelings of the their own 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:09.300
 As I said earlier, it was written so that anyone could read it 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:12.970
 So the I say elementary school essay is should I write, as can be seen is calling the teacher 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:17.920
 We're working hard to like Deng was from friendly to teacher 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.850
 Who is written in the know, such form Nde'll do but eh Mars try Tsu Akan such fare here Soda 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.630
 Say gone 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.630
 That's the difference 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.050
 In order to make it understandable to anyone who reads 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:38.649
 That kind of shared logical expansion of various sentences 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.649
 I'm configuration is there needs to be based on the work of say it 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:48.210
 In Well with regard here I'm there is a pattern of I bought that many 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.770
 Well detailed story and a little dysplasia time still after all 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:56.259
 Bought Well are asked to listen to the individual consultation 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.650
 Day at the aspiring motive Toka kind of its own past to spread Well and the first method of determining how to choose 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.180
 Talk directly below 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:05.590
 After all it is absolutely disgusting if it is not 9 of that individual university here 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:10.850
 It is impossible to say objectively 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:13.690
 First of all, prepare the materials there and cut it into the corner where it is properly transmitted 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.620
 I think it is supposed to 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:23.390
 It's an interview work with my wife, yes . 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:28.010
 Well, for example, the Tteyuu Deetto is Nema interview 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:32.150
 I think that there is nourishment or drowning even in undergraduate entrance exams 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.069
 Still baby teeth may come a little and is even become a little strange unlike the I mean grinded 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.750
 It changes when I think that it becomes 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.080
 Maybe it will be the university entrance exam and how it will change 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.720
 later 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:49.490
 That Well this coffee and I is so also with the junior high school of I mean hanging democratic of the country is the 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:54.710
 There are a lot of people saying that they are looking for good manners 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:03:00.300
 What it does say good by to say just because But incorporation whether Ayapini was You're the discussion continues to be 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:04.620
 From that it said quirk if it is yeah it is not such a thing to say 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:09.630
 So you'd better and which has been in this kind of wind was not be Toka interview lesson After doing or 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.560

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.319
 More okay 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:22.170
 I guess There Are You also still masu me but it is important that more of the content live 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:23.549

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.630

 Well students are smoking flower flowers flowers say say one person 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.440

 He is difficult if everyone 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:56.210
 Then on the 8th of the interview , I think this will be fine so I think I can get an interview from practitioners 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.460
 Tano 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:02.540
 It is not the evaluation of the person, but if it is wrong, it will be refrained, but because it is the evaluation of the contents 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.940
 Pretty much 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.940
 In particular, the'd say humanities are many and wit high 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:16.639
 The Tteyuu to output the firm from a hit in the head has been Yappa 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.639

 I like to read about one book because it is okay to use a new chapter book 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.230

 Everyone because we are people who regard to the book say the stop was not that you have this writing practice until now in 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.449
 It is not a bad point for everyone but it is a problem of curriculum education 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.420
 Not necessary
