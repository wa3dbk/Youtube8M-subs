00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.740
 Hello everyone, I am a critic like you 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:38.110
 I promise I spread walks that new on 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.950
 its channel and it is anboxing but also new 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.250
 laptop 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:45.480
 gaming from acer laptop aspire 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.800
 v3 772 g so 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.720
 packaging is already a little touched because 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:01:02.290
 it is necessary to check the quality of open 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:11.010
 open it yourself back here 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:16.330
 what we have inside and inside us 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:21.210
 quick start guide 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:27.720
 we have the most pcie and 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:32.880
 initial setup sambuk charger 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.880
 battery charger mushroom 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.340
 well, or power supply, respectively 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:51.290
 we have a 17 inch laptop 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:58.409
 big comrade himself and surf 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:02:04.670
 material plastic glossy screen matte 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.670
 so 17 3 inches 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.780
 full hd resolution 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.340
 we have a keyboard like this button 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.280
 windows is located here it is of course 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.810
 It will be a little uncomfortable in the game but 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.610
 tolerated 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.190
 touchpad with us . quite interesting is that 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.750
 here are the buttons themselves as such they are not 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.310
 so click on yourself . 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:32.160
 This is a rather unusual decision. 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.790
 so what are the characteristics of this 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.319
 laptop 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.750
 inside we have processor intel core assy 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.090
 frequency 2 and 2 gigahertz with turbo boost 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.459
 he is up to three and other hertz basically 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:51.720
 ok so nvidia geforce video card 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:55.459
 gtx 660m two gig so well branded 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.260
 full hd cranes and cheeses confit view lcd 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.950
 by the way why did I take a complete set of 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.160
 life to 760m they are 750 because there 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.620
 the difference in ps is quite huge 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.989
 toy so the difference between 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.220
 video cards are quite noticeable 8 gigabytes 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.470
 ddr3 hdd memory per thousand 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.359
 Unfortunately there is no ssd so speed 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.880
 hard drive would supply the desired 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:27.030
 better dvd-rom standard do not make noise 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.460
 but of course the battery itself is tolerable 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.850
 a screen in 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:41.020
 understandably so hd web cameras there is a beach 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:44.970
 dime right we have usb ports for out 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:50.670
 headphone microphone and power and 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:52.930
 vizir left that for himself everything we have in r 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:58.060
 network hdmi connector 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:00.940
 same ports and beaten from below we so 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.390
 here the battery is removable cover here you can 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.660
 add ssd on acceptable dose 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.680
 gigabytes and about RAM because 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.860
 that you can palm up to 16 RAM set 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:19.660
 on board windows 8 single image 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:22.900
 turn down some 64-bit to plus inside 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:27.850
 There is this hd graphics of such basic 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:35.530
 Task Well let's insert the battery 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:40.420
 if finally and so runs with us 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:43.120
 that logo and sire are a project now 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:46.020
 as countries will boot so far it goes 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.970
 setting a few words of its configuration 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.660
 perhaps the main problem grade 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.000
 was that there is no disk with Windows 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.680
 that is, if something is not good 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.830
 event befall you'll need it 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.450
 Windows look for a tricky microsoft well 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.640
 can you do anything more than tricky 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.880
 microsoft still beads by itself too 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.040
 cheats but while we are setting we are writing 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:14.680
 tweaking I would say a little long 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:16.660
 And so far we are waiting for the general 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.860
 the laptop is loaded there is a base 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:23.350
 The application among them is skype all 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.280
 export seems browser internet explorer 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:30.900
 microsoft store skydrive card people 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.960
 any calendar mail office of course 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:37.500
 crystal and well most likely the camera so 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:42.910
 some or rollers tongue xbox plum and 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:46.030
 circuit mcafee internet security in general 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.370
 there is a base software this is good we have 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.610
 here the desktop it looks like this 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:54.850
 and the screen resolution is pretty good 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.240
 full hd plus screen matte what two i 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:01.810
 good and nice 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:05.470
 he will not particularly get dirty if she herself 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:09.010
 the surface of the touchpad vase is glossy 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.530
 Still well, really I look at dirty 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.350
 Not much near the keyboard, it is already such 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:19.120
 more matte that ley and incomplete 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:22.810
 Late material stickers can then 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.060
 tear off while it's simple and was small 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.680
 Anboxing full review will be later 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:33.340
 but I like a lot of things in principle 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:35.650
 I was interesting with you 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.700
 buy a good thing with a cross 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.700
 good luck to all and bye
