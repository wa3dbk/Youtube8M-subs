00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:43.219 
right now this used to be part of Tokyo

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.539 
right now this used to be part of Tokyo
Bay<00:02:44.109> and<00:02:45.109> they<00:02:45.620> created<00:02:46.010> this<00:02:46.069> land<00:02:46.340> by

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
Bay and they created this land by

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.080 
Bay and they created this land by
