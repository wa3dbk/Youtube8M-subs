00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.450
 and we continue with virtual reality in the 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.420
 mouth we keep talking about reality 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.849
 virtual and is that microsoft does not rule out 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.530
 enter sooner or later into the world of 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.660
 virtual reality you know that until 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.550
 the moment your big bet the most 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.920
 similar to virtual reality on the part 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.380
 of microsoft are those hollow lens of the 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.450
 that we have already spoken that reality 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.970
 holographic so to speak good 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.390
 the virtual reality great protagonist 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.670
 during the last boss of this year 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.710
 undoubtedly, it gave a lot that 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.679
 speak you already know who they are and is also 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.589
 overturned with projector face not only 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:42.170
 are the oculus guys with that 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:45.980
 oculus reed then we would stay 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.379
 let's say on the other side to microsoft that 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.480
 explain and have explained on this occasion 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.300
 because they have not yet opted for this 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.609
 virtual reality technology and yes by 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.100
 your device hollow lens good then 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.409
 attention because in statements to the 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.329
 British eurogamer website during 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.489
 the event last week phil spencer 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.560
 the head of xbox in microsoft 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.100
 explained that the great bet of the 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.110
 company 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.280
 are the hollow lens a device 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.159
 augmented reality 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.200
 but he stressed that they do not rule out 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.020
 nothing to enter sooner or later in the 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.890
 virtual reality market I do not think 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.330
 that we have excluded ourselves said spencer 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.280
 he explained that they have thought of a kind 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.500
 of reality combined with reality 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.140
 increased hollow lens and designed the 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.850
 technology for that but that does not 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.920
 will prevent doing something in reality 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.130
 virtual says so much from a perspective 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.960
 feels party as in agreements what 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.420
 means that Microsoft might 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.310
 develop your own device or 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.039
 look for an agreement with the manufacturer of 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.869
 one that already exists Mr. Spencer has 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.580
 applauded the innovative nature of the 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.770
 virtual reality but it's not 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.929
 completely sure that I can 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.179
 become a viable product for 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.580
 the users or have some doubts 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:01.940
 about in virtual reality besides the 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.039
 Mr. Spencer let's also say that he has 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.340
 applauded the role of valve during 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:09.200
 all these years and recognizes the leadership 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.510
 who have always had video games 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.370
 for pc recognize that microsoft has 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.400
 been a little absent 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.650
 during the last years so good 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.750
 there are those statements of the Lord 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.430
 Spencer that the truth is that they are 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.890
 quite 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.019
 curious so to speak because good 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.180
 is saying that on the one hand that 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.189
 they want virtual reality for microsoft 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.140
 but on the other hand he's saying that 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.640
 they are not interested so much and that 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.230
 they are sure that that will come together 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.299
 I honestly what I think is that they go 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.939
 to wait to see if project morpheus and 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.980
 oculus network are successful and when they are 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.319
 sure of it then surely that 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.950
 microsoft is thrown headlong into the world of 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.950
 virtual reality
