00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.219 
you run your specs in inches okay and
the<00:01:47.790> Jasper<00:01:48.149> also<00:01:48.450> comes<00:01:48.720> with<00:01:48.810> here's<00:01:49.079> their

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the Jasper also comes with here's their

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.719 
the Jasper also comes with here's their
little<00:01:49.259> pin<00:01:49.619> as<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.130> said<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.460> just<00:01:50.579> put

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
little pin as I said you can just put

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.670 
little pin as I said you can just put
them<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:50.909> like<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.560> want

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
them in like that and so you just want

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.649 
them in like that and so you just want
to<00:01:52.740> drill<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> hole<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.310> your<00:01:53.369> work<00:01:53.549> piece<00:01:53.759> that

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
to drill a hole in your work piece that

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.480 
to drill a hole in your work piece that
goes<00:01:54.810> deep<00:01:55.619> enough<00:01:55.829> for<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.070> thing<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.369> go

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
goes deep enough for this thing to go

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.660 
goes deep enough for this thing to go
into<00:01:57.560> then<00:01:58.560> you've<00:01:58.680> also<00:01:58.799> you've<00:01:59.009> got<00:01:59.040> ya<00:01:59.369> this

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
into then you've also you've got ya this

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.760 
into then you've also you've got ya this
is<00:01:59.729> just<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.060> pack<00:02:00.210> screws<00:02:00.590> okay

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
is just a pack screws okay

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.499 
is just a pack screws okay
and<00:02:02.399> we<00:02:02.520> kept<00:02:02.640> wait<00:02:02.820> for<00:02:02.969> all<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.240> different

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
and we kept wait for all the different

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.660 
and we kept wait for all the different
tire<00:02:03.719> size<00:02:04.110> routers<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.740> can<00:02:04.860> fit<00:02:05.070> can<00:02:05.490> fit

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
tire size routers it can fit can fit

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.219 
tire size routers it can fit can fit
just<00:02:05.729> about<00:02:05.820> anything<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.780> Makita

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
just about anything this is a Makita

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.199 
just about anything this is a Makita
but<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.710> fits<00:02:07.860> just<00:02:07.920> about<00:02:08.069> anything<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.700> then

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
but it fits just about anything and then

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.309 
but it fits just about anything and then
it's<00:02:09.330> got<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.629> piece<00:02:09.840> there<00:02:10.020> there's<00:02:10.289> a

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
it's got that piece there there's a

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.199 
it's got that piece there there's a
quarter<00:02:10.619> inch<00:02:10.770> now<00:02:11.489> what<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.730> do<00:02:11.849> is<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.030> put

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
quarter inch now what you do is you put

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.490 
quarter inch now what you do is you put
that<00:02:12.300> in

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
that in

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.010 
that in
-<00:02:12.620> router<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.640> push<00:02:13.820> this<00:02:14.000> in<00:02:14.180> here<00:02:14.450> this

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
- router you push this in here this

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.500 
- router you push this in here this
piece<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:15.440> perspex<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.460> then<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.060> line<00:02:17.300> it<00:02:17.450> up

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
piece of perspex and then you line it up

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.360 
piece of perspex and then you line it up
perfectly<00:02:17.990> so<00:02:18.470> then<00:02:18.710> when<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:18.950> know<00:02:19.100> you're

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
perfectly so then when you know you're

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
perfectly so then when you know you're
dead<00:02:19.790> in<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:19.940> middle

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.220 

and<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.570> there<00:02:31.750> we<00:02:31.840> go

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
and so there we go

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.920 
and so there we go
we<00:02:32.620> have<00:02:32.740> a<00:02:32.800> perfect<00:02:33.190> whole<00:02:33.370> I<00:02:33.610> do<00:02:34.450> about<00:02:34.600> three

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
we have a perfect whole I do about three

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.020 
we have a perfect whole I do about three
passes<00:02:35.440> because<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.460> drill<00:02:36.670> bit<00:02:36.790> that

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
passes because that drill bit that

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.240 
passes because that drill bit that
router<00:02:37.660> bits<00:02:37.900> getting<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.170> little<00:02:38.290> old<00:02:38.530> so<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.160> do

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
router bits getting a little old so I do

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.920 
router bits getting a little old so I do
a<00:02:39.340> good<00:02:39.520> three<00:02:39.790> or<00:02:39.820> four<00:02:39.910> passes<00:02:40.420> on<00:02:40.540> them<00:02:40.720> I

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
a good three or four passes on them I

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.250 
a good three or four passes on them I
did<00:02:41.500> make<00:02:41.740> one<00:02:41.770> myself<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:43.780> is<00:02:43.960> the<00:02:43.990> one<00:02:44.230> I

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
did make one myself this is the one I

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.080 
did make one myself this is the one I
made<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:45.190> I'd<00:02:45.280> always<00:02:45.430> get<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.700> little<00:02:45.880> bit<00:02:45.970> the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
made and I'd always get a little bit the

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.880 
made and I'd always get a little bit the
end<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:46.420> obviously<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:47.200> couldn't<00:02:47.590> do<00:02:47.710> the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
end and obviously I couldn't do the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.480 
end and obviously I couldn't do the
really<00:02:48.580> fine<00:02:48.820> closed<00:02:49.210> holes<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:51.190> says<00:02:51.370> you

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
really fine closed holes and it says you

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.280 
really fine closed holes and it says you
can't<00:02:51.700> be<00:02:51.820> as<00:02:51.940> precise<00:02:52.300> enough<00:02:52.720> that's<00:02:53.170> why

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
can't be as precise enough that's why

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.840 
can't be as precise enough that's why
I'd<00:02:53.380> have<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.680> do<00:02:53.830> sometimes<00:02:54.070> to<00:02:54.490> get<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.670> little

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
I'd have to do sometimes to get a little

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.550 
I'd have to do sometimes to get a little
bit<00:02:55.060> bigger<00:02:55.240> this<00:02:55.720> is<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.020> perfect<00:02:56.230> size<00:02:56.530> for

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
bit bigger this is the perfect size for

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.780 
bit bigger this is the perfect size for
that<00:02:56.860> sub<00:02:57.130> now<00:02:58.000> it's<00:02:58.150> got<00:02:58.300> no<00:02:58.570> play<00:02:58.870> see<00:02:59.790> okay

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
that sub now it's got no play see okay

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.850 
that sub now it's got no play see okay
they<00:03:00.970> sort<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.240> cut<00:03:01.390> out<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.690> 10<00:03:02.200> inch<00:03:02.350> off<00:03:02.500> so

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
they sort of cut out the 10 inch off so

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.840 
they sort of cut out the 10 inch off so
now<00:03:02.980> we're<00:03:03.100> going<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.250> come<00:03:03.400> down<00:03:03.520> the<00:03:03.640> next

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
now we're going to come down the next

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.580 
now we're going to come down the next
small<00:03:04.000> thing<00:03:04.240> I've<00:03:04.360> got<00:03:04.390> which<00:03:04.990> is<00:03:05.200> I<00:03:05.470> think

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
small thing I've got which is I think

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.650 
small thing I've got which is I think
this<00:03:05.680> is<00:03:05.770> a<00:03:05.800> four<00:03:06.010> inch<00:03:06.040> speaker<00:03:06.340> I<00:03:06.730> haven't

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
this is a four inch speaker I haven't

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.690 
this is a four inch speaker I haven't
got<00:03:07.750> anything<00:03:07.900> smaller<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.770> work<00:03:09.160> with

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
got anything smaller to work with

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.910 
got anything smaller to work with
okay<00:03:10.450> so<00:03:10.510> best<00:03:11.020> to<00:03:11.080> do<00:03:11.260> this<00:03:11.350> with<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.590> vernier

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
okay so best to do this with a vernier

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.160 
okay so best to do this with a vernier
caliper<00:03:12.280> if<00:03:12.370> you've<00:03:12.490> got<00:03:12.670> one<00:03:12.850> but<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.090> don't<00:03:13.170> so

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
caliper if you've got one but I don't so

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.430 
caliper if you've got one but I don't so
it<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.680> dead-set<00:03:15.100> ten<00:03:15.700> centimeters<00:03:16.240> okay

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
it is dead-set ten centimeters okay

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.590 
it is dead-set ten centimeters okay
it's<00:03:17.740> obviously<00:03:18.160> ten<00:03:18.430> centimeters<00:03:18.970> in<00:03:19.180> inches

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
it's obviously ten centimeters in inches

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.040 
it's obviously ten centimeters in inches
is<00:03:19.780> well<00:03:20.530> just<00:03:20.800> under<00:03:21.040> four<00:03:21.250> inches<00:03:21.420> okay<00:03:22.420> so

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
is well just under four inches okay so

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.600 
is well just under four inches okay so
it's<00:03:24.210> 3<00:03:25.210> inches<00:03:25.390> and<00:03:26.010> 1416<00:03:27.010> switch<00:03:27.370> is<00:03:27.580> seven

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
it's 3 inches and 1416 switch is seven

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.890 
it's 3 inches and 1416 switch is seven
seven<00:03:30.610> eights<00:03:30.760> okay

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
seven eights okay

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.420 
seven eights okay
so<00:03:32.320> they're<00:03:32.440> three<00:03:32.620> inches<00:03:32.650> in<00:03:33.010> seven<00:03:33.280> eighths

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
so they're three inches in seven eighths

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.610 
so they're three inches in seven eighths

quarter<00:03:39.250> inch<00:03:39.400> as<00:03:39.550> well<00:03:39.730> so<00:03:40.090> yeah<00:03:40.360> then<00:03:40.570> you

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
quarter inch as well so yeah then you

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.070 
quarter inch as well so yeah then you
take<00:03:40.840> off<00:03:41.050> the<00:03:41.440> quarter<00:03:42.370> inch<00:03:42.520> off<00:03:42.910> your<00:03:43.300> three
