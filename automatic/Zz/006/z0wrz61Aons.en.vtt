00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:05.940 

okay<00:00:01.659> so<00:00:02.260> I'm<00:00:02.890> driving<00:00:03.490> through<00:00:04.740> Alhambra<00:00:05.740> on

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:05.950 
okay so I'm driving through Alhambra on

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.399 
okay so I'm driving through Alhambra on
my<00:00:06.370> way<00:00:07.019> this<00:00:08.019> time<00:00:08.349> using<00:00:08.709> my<00:00:09.129> camera<00:00:09.999> phone

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:10.409 
my way this time using my camera phone

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:13.560 
my way this time using my camera phone
which<00:00:11.409> I<00:00:11.679> think<00:00:11.919> does<00:00:12.190> a<00:00:12.219> pretty<00:00:12.730> decent<00:00:13.480> job

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.570 
which I think does a pretty decent job

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.710 
which I think does a pretty decent job
of<00:00:15.119> shooting<00:00:16.119> photos<00:00:16.660> as<00:00:17.290> well<00:00:17.950> as<00:00:18.250> video<00:00:18.720> it

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
of shooting photos as well as video it

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.360 
of shooting photos as well as video it
is<00:00:19.780> a<00:00:19.930> bit<00:00:20.380> more<00:00:20.650> awkward<00:00:21.280> to<00:00:21.520> hold<00:00:23.070> than<00:00:24.070> the

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.370 
is a bit more awkward to hold than the

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.090 
is a bit more awkward to hold than the
other<00:00:24.820> camera<00:00:25.360> that<00:00:25.540> I<00:00:25.570> work<00:00:25.900> with<00:00:26.200> since<00:00:26.770> the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100 
other camera that I work with since the

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.870 
other camera that I work with since the
video<00:00:27.610> is<00:00:28.410> horizontal<00:00:29.410> and<00:00:29.650> with<00:00:30.580> the<00:00:30.730> other

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
video is horizontal and with the other

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.579 
video is horizontal and with the other
video<00:00:31.240> camera<00:00:31.690> the<00:00:31.810> video<00:00:32.050> is<00:00:32.349> shot

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:32.589 
video camera the video is shot

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:34.590 
video camera the video is shot
vertically<00:00:33.339> which<00:00:33.550> is<00:00:33.699> rather<00:00:33.879> strange<00:00:34.329> or<00:00:34.539> at

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
vertically which is rather strange or at

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.959 
vertically which is rather strange or at
least<00:00:34.780> it<00:00:34.960> was<00:00:35.079> initially<00:00:35.440> but<00:00:36.309> now<00:00:36.519> you<00:00:36.579> know

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
least it was initially but now you know

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.360 
least it was initially but now you know
I've<00:00:37.120> become<00:00:37.480> very<00:00:37.559> accustomed<00:00:38.559> to<00:00:39.039> it

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
I've become very accustomed to it

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.459 
I've become very accustomed to it
so<00:00:39.789> now<00:00:39.999> it<00:00:40.239> feels<00:00:40.390> very<00:00:40.690> strange<00:00:41.079> to<00:00:41.319> be

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
so now it feels very strange to be

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.809 
so now it feels very strange to be
holding<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.039> camera<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:44.530> phone<00:00:44.800> camera<00:00:45.699> the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:45.819 
holding the camera the phone camera the

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:50.189 
holding the camera the phone camera the

to<00:01:33.820> continue<00:01:34.180> to<00:01:34.660> worsen<00:01:34.980> which<00:01:35.980> is

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
to continue to worsen which is

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.490 
to continue to worsen which is
unfortunate<00:01:36.910> because<00:01:37.120> it<00:01:37.600> leaves<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:38.020> person

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
unfortunate because it leaves the person

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.270 
unfortunate because it leaves the person
that<00:01:38.680> she's<00:01:38.860> interacting<00:01:39.190> with<00:01:39.630> very<00:01:40.630> little

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
that she's interacting with very little

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.050 
that she's interacting with very little
opportunity<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:43.060> have<00:01:43.300> a<00:01:44.520> positive<00:01:45.520> outcome

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
opportunity to have a positive outcome

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.160 
opportunity to have a positive outcome
the<00:01:46.480> outcome<00:01:46.930> is<00:01:47.080> always<00:01:47.410> going<00:01:47.650> to<00:01:47.770> be

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.750 

Oh<00:01:51.940> iffy<00:01:52.940> at<00:01:53.479> least<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.430> challenging<00:01:55.430> at<00:01:55.640> the
