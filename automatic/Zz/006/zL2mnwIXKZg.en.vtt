00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.050
 in this first video we will focus on 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.790
 Sometimes the designs are divided into 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.770

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.329
 driver or civil and auto ads attacks 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.130
 as jinks tweets ticketing for each 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.930
 one of them we will use a page of 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.030
 different runes since this will boost 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.340
 his performance for ads caster and what 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.859

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.660

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.350
 attack version and an age of flat with 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.359
 this will take much more advantage 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.070
 potential of the champions since these 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.379
 power your capabilities reach with your 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.390
 skills and this is what accumulates more 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.190
 damage of these characters for ads 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.290
 caster we have two master options 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.180
 the first the most defensive where 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.370
 we will carry 21 points of the offensive branch 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.960
 and 9 the defensive but if you're one of those 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.780
 they like to abuse their skills 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.800
 the second option is for you this one 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.979

 since they combine qualities of ads 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.180

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.070
 skills enhance the damage of their 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.110
 attacks for them we will use the 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.180
 next branch of masters 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.550
