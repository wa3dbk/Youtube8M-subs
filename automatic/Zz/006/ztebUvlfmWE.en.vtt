00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.649 

okay<00:00:00.240> so<00:00:00.780> here<00:00:01.319> they<00:00:01.469> are<00:00:01.500> um<00:00:02.070> I<00:00:02.610> really<00:00:03.360> love

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
okay so here they are um I really love

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.480 
okay so here they are um I really love
these<00:00:04.140> extensions<00:00:04.589> I<00:00:04.890> think<00:00:05.100> they're<00:00:05.220> really

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
these extensions I think they're really

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.909 
these extensions I think they're really
great<00:00:05.670> for<00:00:06.000> going<00:00:06.299> out<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.750> for<00:00:07.440> having<00:00:07.589> like

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
great for going out and for having like

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.020 
great for going out and for having like
a<00:00:08.570> nighttime<00:00:09.570> look<00:00:10.170> obviously<00:00:11.070> like<00:00:11.370> my<00:00:11.550> color

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
a nighttime look obviously like my color

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.200 
a nighttime look obviously like my color
match<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.480> not<00:00:12.599> perfect<00:00:13.049> here<00:00:13.670> it<00:00:14.670> was<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.940> lot

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
match is not perfect here it was a lot

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.230 
match is not perfect here it was a lot
better<00:00:15.360> when<00:00:15.750> my<00:00:15.929> hair<00:00:16.109> was<00:00:16.139> darker<00:00:16.650> obviously

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
better when my hair was darker obviously

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.630 
better when my hair was darker obviously
and<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.990> think<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.380> color<00:00:19.560> match<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:20.100> one<00:00:20.550> of

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
and I think the color match is one of

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.010 
and I think the color match is one of
the<00:00:20.699> most<00:00:20.820> important<00:00:21.300> things<00:00:21.449> if<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:21.840> buy

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
the most important things if you buy

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.859 
the most important things if you buy
these<00:00:22.260> extensions<00:00:23.150> otherwise<00:00:24.150> yeah<00:00:24.480> like<00:00:24.720> it

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
these extensions otherwise yeah like it

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.099 
these extensions otherwise yeah like it
just<00:00:24.900> looks<00:00:25.230> weird<00:00:26.210> in<00:00:27.210> terms<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:28.080> know

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
just looks weird in terms of you know

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.349 
just looks weird in terms of you know
whether<00:00:28.439> or<00:00:28.529> not<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:29.640> know<00:00:29.730> my<00:00:29.880> hair<00:00:30.150> was

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
whether or not you know my hair was

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.799 
whether or not you know my hair was
shiny<00:00:30.660> enough<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.199> match<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.600> synthetic<00:00:33.600> I

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
shiny enough to match the synthetic I

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.299 
shiny enough to match the synthetic I
really<00:00:34.380> didn't<00:00:34.559> have<00:00:34.649> any<00:00:34.829> problems<00:00:34.950> with

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
really didn't have any problems with

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.970 
really didn't have any problems with
that<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.989> most<00:00:37.170> i<00:00:37.320> would<00:00:37.440> ever<00:00:37.530> do<00:00:37.770> is

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
that and the most i would ever do is

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.430 
that and the most i would ever do is
just<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.489> add<00:00:38.670> some<00:00:39.000> shine<00:00:39.690> serum<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.350> my

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
just like add some shine serum to my

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.500 
just like add some shine serum to my
hair<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.890> then<00:00:41.670> also<00:00:42.559> you<00:00:43.670> can<00:00:44.670> tell<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.390> know

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
hair and then also you can tell you know

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.540 
hair and then also you can tell you know
they're<00:00:45.780> not<00:00:45.809> as<00:00:46.140> curly<00:00:46.649> as<00:00:46.680> they<00:00:46.920> once<00:00:47.129> were<00:00:47.250> I

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
they're not as curly as they once were I

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.720 
they're not as curly as they once were I
that<00:00:48.239> means<00:00:48.329> i<00:00:48.480> need<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.750> wash<00:00:48.960> them<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:50.039> then

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
that means i need to wash them and then

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.850 
that means i need to wash them and then
you<00:00:50.910> know<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.270> also<00:00:51.390> put<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.230> little

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860

scrunch<00:00:55.500> them<00:00:55.559> up<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.070> then<00:00:56.219> they'll

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
scrunch them up and then they'll

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.229
