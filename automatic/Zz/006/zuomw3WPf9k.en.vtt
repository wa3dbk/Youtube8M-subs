really wear to work like crop tops or
shorts<00:03:06.510> for<00:03:06.689> example<00:03:07.260> because<00:03:07.739> if<00:03:08.069> I'm

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
shorts for example because if I'm

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.679

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
make sure that I can get a lot of wear

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:13.220 
make sure that I can get a lot of wear
out<00:03:11.939> of<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.329> and<00:03:12.599> I<00:03:12.689> think<00:03:12.870> I've<00:03:12.959> heard<00:03:13.079> people

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
out of it and I think I've heard people

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.619 
out of it and I think I've heard people
refer<00:03:13.409> to<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.859> before<00:03:14.040> as<00:03:14.459> cost<00:03:15.150> per<00:03:15.299> wear

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
refer to that before as cost per wear

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.179 
refer to that before as cost per wear
which<00:03:15.810> I'll<00:03:15.959> quite<00:03:16.139> like<00:03:16.319> it's<00:03:16.620> kind<00:03:16.919> of<00:03:17.010> hard

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
which I'll quite like it's kind of hard

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:18.920 
which I'll quite like it's kind of hard
to<00:03:17.219> define<00:03:17.549> actually<00:03:18.090> what<00:03:18.359> kind<00:03:18.569> of<00:03:18.689> clothes

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
to define actually what kind of clothes

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.749 
to define actually what kind of clothes
I<00:03:19.229> don't<00:03:19.290> mind<00:03:19.709> splurging<00:03:20.220> on<00:03:20.340> because<00:03:20.609> it's

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:20.759 
I don't mind splurging on because it's

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:23.719 
I don't mind splurging on because it's
not<00:03:20.909> a<00:03:21.150> particular<00:03:21.689> thing<00:03:22.259> like<00:03:22.459> skirts<00:03:23.459> or

not a particular thing like skirts or

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:26.059 
not a particular thing like skirts or
jeans<00:03:23.759> but<00:03:24.389> it's<00:03:24.540> more<00:03:24.810> if<00:03:25.139> the<00:03:25.620> piece<00:03:25.799> is

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
jeans but it's more if the piece is

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.640 
jeans but it's more if the piece is
interesting<00:03:26.699> but<00:03:26.939> not<00:03:26.970> in<00:03:27.329> a<00:03:27.569> trend<00:03:27.930> based<00:03:28.319> way

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
interesting but not in a trend based way

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.499

normally<00:03:35.549> would<00:03:35.849> spend<00:03:36.030> on<00:03:36.329> a<00:03:36.359> top<00:03:36.599> but<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.109> got

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
normally would spend on a top but I got

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.839 
normally would spend on a top but I got
it<00:03:37.409> because<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.889> felt<00:03:38.069> like<00:03:38.189> it<00:03:38.519> was<00:03:38.669> really

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
it because I felt like it was really

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:39.379 
it because I felt like it was really
special

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
special

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.360 
special
I<00:03:39.540> really<00:03:39.810> liked<00:03:39.959> all<00:03:40.199> the<00:03:40.319> lace<00:03:40.470> detailing<00:03:40.979> in

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
I really liked all the lace detailing in

I really liked all the lace detailing in
the<00:03:41.459> lining<00:03:41.729> and<00:03:42.150> I<00:03:42.239> felt<00:03:42.419> like<00:03:42.509> it<00:03:42.659> really

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
the lining and I felt like it really

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.899 
the lining and I felt like it really
suited<00:03:43.139> me<00:03:43.319> so<00:03:43.650> that's<00:03:44.220> what<00:03:44.430> made<00:03:44.579> it<00:03:44.669> worth

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
suited me so that's what made it worth

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.429 
suited me so that's what made it worth
spending<00:03:45.209> money<00:03:45.509> on<00:03:45.689> some<00:03:45.930> other<00:03:46.079> things<00:03:46.349> like
