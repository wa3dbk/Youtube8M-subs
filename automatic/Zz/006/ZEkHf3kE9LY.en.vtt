00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
galaxy player PI point 0 using the n64

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.950 
galaxy player PI point 0 using the n64
emulator<00:00:26.180> and<00:00:27.180> we're<00:00:27.390> just<00:00:27.480> wait<00:00:27.689> for<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:27.900> to

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
emulator and we're just wait for this to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.140 
emulator and we're just wait for this to
load<00:00:28.170> up

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.660 

and<00:00:34.690> I<00:00:34.750> chose<00:00:34.990> this<00:00:35.050> this<00:00:35.890> particular<00:00:36.100> wrong

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
and I chose this this particular wrong

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.980 
and I chose this this particular wrong
amount<00:00:36.850> of<00:00:36.970> all<00:00:37.090> the<00:00:37.240> other<00:00:37.390> ones<00:00:37.630> because

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:37.990 
amount of all the other ones because

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.690 
amount of all the other ones because
it's<00:00:38.200> pretty<00:00:38.500> much<00:00:38.650> the<00:00:38.710> most<00:00:39.190> graphic

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
it's pretty much the most graphic

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.880 
it's pretty much the most graphic
intense<00:00:40.210> so<00:00:40.990> if<00:00:41.080> it<00:00:41.170> can<00:00:41.290> run<00:00:41.440> this<00:00:41.620> one

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
intense so if it can run this one

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.010 
intense so if it can run this one
probably<00:00:42.280> can<00:00:42.640> run<00:00:42.880> all<00:00:43.180> the<00:00:43.660> other<00:00:43.810> ones

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
probably can run all the other ones

00:00:44.020 --> 00:01:09.390 
probably can run all the other ones
fairly<00:00:44.470> smoothly<00:00:44.770> as<00:00:45.070> well<00:00:48.840> here<00:00:49.840> we<00:00:49.930> go<00:01:08.400> get

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
fairly smoothly as well here we go get

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:29.270 
fairly smoothly as well here we go get
like<00:01:09.970> a<00:01:10.000> little<00:01:10.150> bit

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.330 

it<00:01:30.280> is<00:01:30.520> lagging<00:01:30.909> a<00:01:30.970> little<00:01:31.000> bit<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.799> as<00:01:33.100> you<00:01:33.220> can

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
it is lagging a little bit so as you can

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.230 
it is lagging a little bit so as you can
see<00:01:33.549> there<00:01:33.729> is<00:01:33.850> minor<00:01:34.119> lag<00:01:34.799> because<00:01:35.799> I<00:01:36.369> guess

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
see there is minor lag because I guess

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.999 
see there is minor lag because I guess
it's<00:01:37.450> due<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.869> device<00:01:38.140> being<00:01:38.470> a<00:01:38.649> single

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
it's due to the device being a single

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:47.179 
it's due to the device being a single
core<00:01:39.399> processor<00:01:39.869> magical<00:01:40.869> so<00:01:41.799> that<00:01:42.070> is<00:01:42.220> normal

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.889 

also<00:01:48.189> the<00:01:48.520> controls<00:01:49.119> are<00:01:49.360> not<00:01:49.479> mapped<00:01:49.750> out

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
also the controls are not mapped out

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.240 
also the controls are not mapped out
correctly<00:01:50.670> because<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:52.030> virtual<00:01:52.509> keypad

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
correctly because the virtual keypad

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.580 
correctly because the virtual keypad
gives<00:01:54.250> you<00:01:54.369> limitations<00:01:55.060> on<00:01:55.299> the<00:01:55.600> different

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
gives you limitations on the different

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.550 
gives you limitations on the different
moods<00:01:56.799> you<00:01:56.979> can<00:01:57.130> use<00:01:57.340> on<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.270> character<00:01:58.720> and

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
moods you can use on the character and

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.779 
moods you can use on the character and
that<00:01:59.590> kind<00:01:59.860> of<00:01:59.920> sucks<00:02:02.039> but<00:02:03.039> you<00:02:03.280> know<00:02:03.399> all<00:02:03.610> in

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
that kind of sucks but you know all in

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.679 
that kind of sucks but you know all in
all<00:02:03.880> in<00:02:04.149> 64<00:02:04.720> wood<00:02:04.959> is<00:02:05.170> a<00:02:05.200> fully<00:02:05.679> functional

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
all in 64 wood is a fully functional

all in 64 wood is a fully functional
