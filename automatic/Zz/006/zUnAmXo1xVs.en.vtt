 they teach from below where if we want 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.910

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:38.250
 the lack of success and steel tubes 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:40.460
 acrobatic figures or various things the 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.610
 meva base positions that

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.400
 practically 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.330
 could hurt the flyer or the 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.330
 flyer in this case 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.120

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.989

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.859
 they stop coming and that for us 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.840
 means that there will be more diffusion 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.359
