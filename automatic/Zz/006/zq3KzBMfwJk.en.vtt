not many high points but a lot of cool

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.260 
not many high points but a lot of cool
things<00:02:29.740> you<00:02:29.800> can<00:02:30.040> do<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.220> I'm<00:02:31.000> going<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.180> show

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
things you can do so I'm going to show

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.970 
things you can do so I'm going to show
you<00:02:31.330> example<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:31.960> beginner<00:02:32.410> thing<00:02:32.800> you

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
you example of a beginner thing you

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.670 
you example of a beginner thing you
could<00:02:33.190> do<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:33.610> just<00:02:33.790> jump<00:02:34.000> off<00:02:34.240> and<00:02:34.680> something

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
could do so just jump off and something

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.260 
could do so just jump off and something
like<00:02:35.710> that<00:02:36.010> would<00:02:36.130> be<00:02:36.190> considered<00:02:36.610> beginner

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
like that would be considered beginner

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.150 
like that would be considered beginner
almost<00:02:37.990> hit<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.200> there<00:02:38.440> now<00:02:38.740> if<00:02:38.860> you<00:02:38.950> put

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
almost hit it there now if you put

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.650 
almost hit it there now if you put
distance<00:02:39.640> in<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:39.790> like<00:02:40.060> say<00:02:40.210> that<00:02:40.360> guy<00:02:40.510> was

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
distance in that like say that guy was

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.970 
distance in that like say that guy was
standing<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.140> window<00:02:41.530> over<00:02:41.650> there<00:02:41.860> and

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
standing in that window over there and

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.560 
standing in that window over there and
you<00:02:42.040> know<00:02:42.160> that's<00:02:42.520> no<00:02:42.730> longer<00:02:42.910> beginner<00:02:43.360> so

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
you know that's no longer beginner so

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.000 
you know that's no longer beginner so
adding<00:02:43.840> distance<00:02:44.110> can<00:02:44.500> always<00:02:44.830> turn

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
adding distance can always turn

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.800 
adding distance can always turn
something<00:02:45.250> from<00:02:45.490> a<00:02:45.580> beginner<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:46.390> more<00:02:46.630> of<00:02:46.720> an

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
something from a beginner to more of an

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.990 
something from a beginner to more of an
advanced<00:02:47.170> shot<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:47.680> something<00:02:48.670> else<00:02:48.790> you

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
advanced shot so something else you

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000 
advanced shot so something else you

thing you could do which I'll show you
here<00:03:09.580> quickly<00:03:09.910> and<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:10.209> do<00:03:10.270> have<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.540> kill<00:03:10.750> camp

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
here quickly and I do have a kill camp

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.240

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.530 
for this one I do not have a cocaine for
the<00:03:12.310> latter<00:03:12.490> stories<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.090> kind<00:03:13.300> of<00:03:13.360> just

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
the latter stories I kind of just

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.090 
the latter stories I kind of just
thought<00:03:13.630> of<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:13.959> as<00:03:14.260> I<00:03:14.530> was<00:03:14.680> making<00:03:15.010> this

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
thought of that as I was making this

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.350 
thought of that as I was making this
video<00:03:15.280> I<00:03:15.459> haven't<00:03:15.670> even<00:03:15.760> tried<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.060> yet<00:03:16.180> that

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
video I haven't even tried it yet that

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.210 
video I haven't even tried it yet that
was<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.510> first<00:03:16.780> time<00:03:16.959> so<00:03:17.470> anyways<00:03:17.770> uh<00:03:17.890> you

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
was the first time so anyways uh you

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.040 
was the first time so anyways uh you
could<00:03:18.340> jump<00:03:18.550> here<00:03:18.790> do<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.000> bounce<00:03:19.300> shot<00:03:19.630> with<00:03:19.840> it

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
could jump here do a bounce shot with it

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.960 
could jump here do a bounce shot with it
and<00:03:20.200> something<00:03:21.010> like<00:03:21.040> that<00:03:21.340> so<00:03:21.610> I<00:03:21.820> don't

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
and something like that so I don't

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.730 
and something like that so I don't
really<00:03:22.209> have<00:03:22.390> any<00:03:22.480> super<00:03:22.990> advanced<00:03:23.290> shots<00:03:23.590> if

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
really have any super advanced shots if

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.080 
really have any super advanced shots if
you<00:03:23.800> want<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.010> make<00:03:24.100> an<00:03:24.190> advanced<00:03:24.520> shot<00:03:24.880> uh

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
you want to make an advanced shot uh

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.840 
you want to make an advanced shot uh
just<00:03:25.900> like<00:03:26.110> add<00:03:26.320> bounces<00:03:27.070> ladder<00:03:27.400> stalls

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
just like add bounces ladder stalls

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.090 
just like add bounces ladder stalls
whatever<00:03:28.360> add<00:03:28.989> some<00:03:29.200> more<00:03:29.350> equipment<00:03:29.650> maybe

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
whatever add some more equipment maybe

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.830 
whatever add some more equipment maybe
silence<00:03:30.700> show<00:03:30.820> at<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.030> end<00:03:31.150> more<00:03:31.330> distance

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
silence show at the end more distance

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.270 
silence show at the end more distance
that<00:03:31.989> would<00:03:32.110> get<00:03:32.230> you<00:03:32.320> into<00:03:32.500> an<00:03:32.590> advanced<00:03:32.980> shot

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
that would get you into an advanced shot

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.680 
that would get you into an advanced shot
if<00:03:33.400> you're<00:03:33.519> more<00:03:33.820> into<00:03:34.180> that<00:03:34.300> type<00:03:34.660> of

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
if you're more into that type of

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.750 
if you're more into that type of
trickshot<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.410> harder<00:03:35.800> things<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.190> hit<00:03:36.340> this

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
trickshot the harder things to hit this

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.460 
trickshot the harder things to hit this
game<00:03:37.000> is<00:03:37.239> very<00:03:37.600> challenging<00:03:37.900> they<00:03:38.290> hit<00:03:38.440> a

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
game is very challenging they hit a

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.080 
game is very challenging they hit a
trickshot<00:03:38.769> in<00:03:39.040> because<00:03:39.430> of<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.700> fact<00:03:39.970> that

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
trickshot in because of the fact that

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.600 
trickshot in because of the fact that
there<00:03:40.390> is<00:03:40.570> no<00:03:40.930> um<00:03:41.230> but<00:03:41.739> your<00:03:41.860> gun<00:03:42.010> doesn't<00:03:42.160> pull

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
there is no um but your gun doesn't pull

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.190 
there is no um but your gun doesn't pull
towards<00:03:43.030> there's<00:03:43.150> no<00:03:43.239> aim<00:03:43.450> assist<00:03:43.660> on<00:03:44.080> the

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
towards there's no aim assist on the

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.840 
towards there's no aim assist on the
snipers<00:03:44.620> so<00:03:44.860> makes<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.459> little<00:03:45.610> bit<00:03:45.730> more

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
snipers so makes it a little bit more

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.340 
snipers so makes it a little bit more
challenging<00:03:46.300> but<00:03:46.480> anyways<00:03:46.750> pretty<00:03:47.170> sure<00:03:47.290> you

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
challenging but anyways pretty sure you
