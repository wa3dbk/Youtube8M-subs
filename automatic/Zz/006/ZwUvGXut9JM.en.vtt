00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.890
 this video is about double 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.509
 rod-like Crochet the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.260
 are a bit bigger than that 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.200
 normal chopsticks and for that I take 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:20.160
 again ten air mesh on at 10 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:24.210
 Crochet chopsticks first 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:30.599
 10 and then I take four walls 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:34.860
 air masses at 1,234 so and then daily 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.770
 out needle in the fifth of the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.980
 take the first double chopsticks for it 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.860
 I have two envelopes on the needles 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.050
 pierce through the mesh by the hol 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.379
 thread 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:54.930
 so now i have 44 envelopes on 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:57.149
 the needle goes through two again 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.899
 through two and then through the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.410
 last two 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.539
 so the whole looks then from that is in 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.760
 end effect like a normal whole 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.890
 just say that once more 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.490
 So you have to wash off once more 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:19.040
 the two by way of the two 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:25.070
 Fetch envelopes thread 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.070
 by two by two and by 2 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:40.080
 through two through two by two looks like this 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:46.120
 the whole then again from here 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:48.510
 by 2 by two and by 2 the whole 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.250
 Of course, it is even bigger if you 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.530
 makes triple sticks or still 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.610
 bigger ones take more and more envelopes 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:02.050
 and then always pick two of them 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:08.500
 piercing thread want 2 by two 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:10.090
 and by 2, you win, of course 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.390
 very fast at altitude 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.860
 the whole thing will also look very relaxed 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.860
 that very easy 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:37.580
 more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 I have everything 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:40.050
 done right and then the tenth so 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.930
 sees the whole of a series 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:47.790
 I take four when making the air 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:52.430
 so turn and crochet again 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.430
 round back row back course 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:18.160
 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 all there now 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.290
 you can also see how easy the whole thing is 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.070
 So that's really only the high one 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.680
 really much substance has that win 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.880
 not all 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.500
 you would be breathing four again 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.170
 then go to the next row 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.170
 crochet and that's how it looks
