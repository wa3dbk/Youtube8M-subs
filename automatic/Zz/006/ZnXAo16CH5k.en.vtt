00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:05.680 
project with Forevermark to make kind of

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.970 
project with Forevermark to make kind of
a<00:00:05.859> a<00:00:06.099> one-off<00:00:06.729> special<00:00:07.269> piece<00:00:08.109> and<00:00:08.470> to<00:00:08.800> come

a a one-off special piece and to come

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.190 
a a one-off special piece and to come
here<00:00:09.310> and<00:00:09.520> kind<00:00:10.390> of<00:00:10.450> see<00:00:10.690> all<00:00:10.780> these<00:00:10.960> amazing

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200 
here and kind of see all these amazing

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.560 
here and kind of see all these amazing
things<00:00:11.590> and<00:00:11.800> be<00:00:11.890> inspired<00:00:12.280> by<00:00:12.760> what<00:00:12.790> so<00:00:13.269> and

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.570 
things and be inspired by what so and

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.600 
things and be inspired by what so and
kind<00:00:14.350> of<00:00:14.410> fuel<00:00:14.650> them<00:00:14.860> into<00:00:15.160> the<00:00:15.250> design<00:00:15.580> I

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
kind of fuel them into the design I

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.029 
kind of fuel them into the design I
think<00:00:15.970> it's<00:00:16.150> a<00:00:16.359> great<00:00:16.810> challenge<00:00:17.170> for<00:00:17.680> me

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
think it's a great challenge for me

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.650 
think it's a great challenge for me
because<00:00:18.100> like<00:00:18.310> I<00:00:18.640> said<00:00:18.700> it's<00:00:19.270> not<00:00:19.450> something

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
because like I said it's not something

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.730 
because like I said it's not something
that<00:00:19.990> I've<00:00:20.140> ever<00:00:20.580> been<00:00:21.580> part<00:00:21.850> of<00:00:22.030> before<00:00:22.240> and

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
that I've ever been part of before and

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.109 
that I've ever been part of before and
diamonds<00:00:23.740> are<00:00:23.890> sort<00:00:24.130> of<00:00:24.160> like<00:00:24.340> new<00:00:24.550> territory

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
diamonds are sort of like new territory

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.580 
diamonds are sort of like new territory
for<00:00:25.150> me<00:00:26.970> diamonds<00:00:27.970> are<00:00:28.480> very<00:00:28.660> kind<00:00:29.199> of<00:00:29.230> ancient

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
for me diamonds are very kind of ancient

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.040 
for me diamonds are very kind of ancient
and<00:00:30.070> natural<00:00:30.520> but<00:00:30.970> the<00:00:31.180> process<00:00:31.779> that<00:00:31.930> they<00:00:32.020> go

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
and natural but the process that they go

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.369 
and natural but the process that they go
through<00:00:32.230> is<00:00:32.469> incredibly<00:00:32.819> high-tech<00:00:34.379> lasers

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
through is incredibly high-tech lasers

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.750 
through is incredibly high-tech lasers
and<00:00:35.649> angles<00:00:36.460> and<00:00:37.170> also<00:00:38.170> mix<00:00:38.620> with<00:00:38.829> our<00:00:39.010> human

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
and angles and also mix with our human

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.869 
and angles and also mix with our human
touch<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:43.690> all<00:00:43.870> down<00:00:44.170> to<00:00:44.589> the<00:00:45.159> hands<00:00:45.370> end<00:00:45.760> of

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
touch it's all down to the hands end of

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.369 
touch it's all down to the hands end of
the<00:00:45.940> day<00:00:46.059> and<00:00:46.149> that<00:00:46.239> said<00:00:46.479> it<00:00:46.749> goes<00:00:46.960> back<00:00:47.199> to

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
the day and that said it goes back to

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.979 
the day and that said it goes back to
sort<00:00:47.620> of<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.850> link<00:00:49.030> between<00:00:49.149> kind<00:00:49.749> of<00:00:49.839> this

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
sort of the link between kind of this

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.139 
sort of the link between kind of this
project<00:00:50.469> and<00:00:50.649> what<00:00:50.769> I<00:00:50.829> do<00:00:50.979> it's<00:00:51.370> it's<00:00:51.639> it's<00:00:52.030> all

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
project and what I do it's it's it's all

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.770 
project and what I do it's it's it's all
about<00:00:52.389> creating<00:00:53.109> things<00:00:53.289> with<00:00:53.530> your<00:00:53.649> hands<00:00:54.069> I

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
about creating things with your hands I

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.840 
about creating things with your hands I
like<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:56.289> kind<00:00:56.530> of<00:00:56.589> have<00:00:56.649> very<00:00:57.309> straight<00:00:57.579> lines

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
like to kind of have very straight lines

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.029 
like to kind of have very straight lines
and<00:00:58.209> my<00:00:58.539> work<00:00:58.749> can<00:00:58.989> be<00:00:59.139> quite<00:00:59.350> controlled<00:00:59.859> in

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
and my work can be quite controlled in

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.189 
and my work can be quite controlled in
that<00:01:00.159> sense<00:01:00.399> so<00:01:00.850> that<00:01:01.030> idea<00:01:01.629> of<00:01:01.659> something

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
that sense so that idea of something

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.070 
that sense so that idea of something
very<00:01:02.979> meticulous<00:01:03.789> and<00:01:03.999> very<00:01:04.080> mathematical

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
very meticulous and very mathematical

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.470 
very meticulous and very mathematical
with<00:01:05.170> all<00:01:05.290> those<00:01:05.410> angles<00:01:05.860> and<00:01:06.220> that<00:01:06.790> mix<00:01:07.150> of

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
with all those angles and that mix of

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.320 
with all those angles and that mix of
science<00:01:08.170> and<00:01:08.710> nature<00:01:08.830> I<00:01:09.190> guess<00:01:09.550> that<00:01:09.880> dragging

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
science and nature I guess that dragging

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.180 
science and nature I guess that dragging
something<00:01:10.570> out<00:01:10.810> of<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:10.990> ground<00:01:11.020> and<00:01:11.560> putting

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
something out of the ground and putting

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.880 
something out of the ground and putting
upon<00:01:12.670> this<00:01:13.060> rock<00:01:13.570> all<00:01:13.990> of<00:01:14.320> these<00:01:14.530> kind<00:01:14.830> of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
upon this rock all of these kind of

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.780 
upon this rock all of these kind of
manmade<00:01:15.640> processes<00:01:16.510> to<00:01:16.690> create<00:01:16.720> something

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
manmade processes to create something

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.010 
manmade processes to create something
which<00:01:18.790> is<00:01:19.030> incredibly<00:01:19.510> beautiful<00:01:19.990> and

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
which is incredibly beautiful and

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.080 
which is incredibly beautiful and
incredibly<00:01:20.590> rare<00:01:20.920> of<00:01:21.370> course<00:01:21.460> that's<00:01:21.850> going

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
incredibly rare of course that's going

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.940 
incredibly rare of course that's going
to<00:01:22.150> be<00:01:22.240> something<00:01:22.840> now<00:01:22.990> excites<00:01:23.530> me

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
to be something now excites me

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.460 
to be something now excites me

here<00:01:35.710> in<00:01:35.770> South<00:01:35.950> Africa<00:01:36.340> not<00:01:36.460> just<00:01:36.700> with<00:01:36.820> the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
here in South Africa not just with the

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.400 
here in South Africa not just with the
diamonds<00:01:37.360> but<00:01:37.570> with<00:01:37.840> all<00:01:37.960> of<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.200> community

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
diamonds but with all of the community

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.550 
diamonds but with all of the community
projects<00:01:38.980> that<00:01:39.070> we've<00:01:39.190> seen<00:01:40.230> it's<00:01:41.230> kind<00:01:41.530> of

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
projects that we've seen it's kind of

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.950 
projects that we've seen it's kind of
amazing<00:01:42.010> how<00:01:42.040> it's<00:01:42.370> a<00:01:42.640> it's<00:01:43.180> not<00:01:43.360> about<00:01:43.480> great

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
amazing how it's a it's not about great

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.530 
amazing how it's a it's not about great
it's<00:01:44.200> about<00:01:44.500> making<00:01:44.980> that<00:01:45.610> country<00:01:45.970> better<00:01:46.120> I

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
it's about making that country better I

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.820 
it's about making that country better I
think<00:01:46.870> that's<00:01:46.990> really<00:01:47.110> beautiful

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
think that's really beautiful

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.470 
think that's really beautiful
but<00:01:48.250> it's<00:01:48.370> great<00:01:48.550> that<00:01:48.790> both<00:01:49.000> parties<00:01:49.420> are

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
but it's great that both parties are

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.940 
but it's great that both parties are
getting<00:01:49.720> something<00:01:50.350> incredibly<00:01:50.740> beneficial

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
getting something incredibly beneficial

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.730 
getting something incredibly beneficial
and<00:01:51.580> more<00:01:52.540> so<00:01:52.780> for<00:01:52.960> Botswana<00:01:53.260> they're<00:01:53.590> gonna

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
and more so for Botswana they're gonna

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.780 
and more so for Botswana they're gonna
have<00:01:54.070> this

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
have this

canvas and so of maybe be inspired by
what<00:02:02.630> I<00:02:02.659> see<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.050> I<00:02:03.560> think<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:04.430> needs<00:02:04.670> to

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
what I see and I think it needs to

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.590 
what I see and I think it needs to
definitely<00:02:06.020> have<00:02:06.580> some<00:02:07.580> tiresome<00:02:08.360> linked

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
definitely have some tiresome linked

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:17.060 
definitely have some tiresome linked
into<00:02:09.140> to<00:02:09.920> what<00:02:10.069> we've<00:02:10.250> seen

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.130 

there's<00:02:18.070> obviously<00:02:18.550> been<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.850> lot<00:02:19.030> of<00:02:19.330> kind<00:02:20.080> of

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
there's obviously been a lot of kind of

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.010 
there's obviously been a lot of kind of
bad<00:02:20.350> press<00:02:20.680> about<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.940> way<00:02:22.090> diamonds<00:02:22.630> are<00:02:22.810> a

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
bad press about the way diamonds are a

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.290 
bad press about the way diamonds are a
source<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.620> I<00:02:23.710> think<00:02:24.000> Forevermark<00:02:25.000> really

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
source and I think Forevermark really

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.410 
source and I think Forevermark really
stands<00:02:25.570> out<00:02:25.720> as<00:02:25.960> a<00:02:26.260> company<00:02:27.040> who<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:28.150> kind<00:02:28.360> of

stands out as a company who you kind of

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.660 
stands out as a company who you kind of
go<00:02:28.600> against<00:02:29.020> that<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:30.220> know<00:02:30.340> from<00:02:30.520> what

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
go against that and you know from what

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.060 
go against that and you know from what
we've<00:02:30.820> seen<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.390> from<00:02:31.630> what<00:02:31.810> they<00:02:31.960> support

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.410 

just<00:02:36.070> for<00:02:36.190> what<00:02:36.340> they<00:02:36.460> stand<00:02:36.700> for<00:02:36.850> as<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.120> brand

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
I think it's a definitely an appealing

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.580 
I think it's a definitely an appealing
part<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.840> whole<00:02:41.020> package<00:02:43.290> it's<00:02:44.290> just<00:02:44.440> been

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
phenomenal to really see and experience

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.430 
phenomenal to really see and experience

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
what we've been really privileged to see

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.140 
what we've been really privileged to see
an<00:02:50.500> experience<00:02:51.040> this<00:02:51.130> week<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:51.670> know<00:02:54.150> it

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
an experience this week you know it

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.520 
an experience this week you know it
really<00:02:55.390> does<00:02:55.570> feel<00:02:55.780> like<00:02:55.810> almost<00:02:56.260> coming<00:02:56.470> to

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
really does feel like almost coming to

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.610 
really does feel like almost coming to
another<00:02:56.680> world<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:58.230> think<00:02:59.230> it's<00:02:59.350> one<00:02:59.440> of<00:02:59.470> those

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
another world I think it's one of those

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.070 
another world I think it's one of those
things<00:02:59.920> that<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.820> doesn't<00:03:01.150> quite<00:03:01.420> feel<00:03:01.750> real

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
things that it doesn't quite feel real

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.160 
things that it doesn't quite feel real
at<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.380> time<00:03:06.630> but<00:03:07.630> I<00:03:07.660> think<00:03:07.900> it's<00:03:08.050> certainly

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
at the time but I think it's certainly

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.590 
at the time but I think it's certainly
gonna<00:03:08.530> be<00:03:08.710> one<00:03:08.830> of<00:03:08.860> those<00:03:09.010> things<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.600> sticks

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
gonna be one of those things that sticks

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:22.700 
gonna be one of those things that sticks
with<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:10.810> fo<00:03:11.260> forever

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.770
