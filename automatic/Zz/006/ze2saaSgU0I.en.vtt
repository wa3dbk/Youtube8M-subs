to expand the character and double click
it<00:00:55.239> if<00:00:55.360> it<00:00:55.510> isn't<00:00:55.809> already<00:00:55.960> up<00:00:56.290> here<00:00:56.500> in<00:00:56.559> the

it if it isn't already up here in the
character<00:00:57.010> definition<00:00:57.519> and<00:00:57.729> if<00:00:57.909> you<00:00:58.000> scroll

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
character definition and if you scroll

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.750 
character definition and if you scroll
through<00:00:58.420> you<00:00:58.960> can<00:00:59.170> see<00:00:59.439> that<00:00:59.890> there<00:01:00.220> are<00:01:00.250> a

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
through you can see that there are a

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.780 
through you can see that there are a
bunch<00:01:01.390> of<00:01:01.689> bones<00:01:02.619> listed<00:01:03.100> here<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.460> ones<00:01:03.640> that

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
bunch of bones listed here the ones that

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.160 
bunch of bones listed here the ones that
are<00:01:03.909> most<00:01:04.210> interest<00:01:04.629> are<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.780> ones<00:01:04.989> called

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
are most interest are the ones called

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.750 
are most interest are the ones called
base<00:01:05.409> but<00:01:05.710> there's<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:06.010> mapping<00:01:06.340> list<00:01:06.549> and

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
base but there's the mapping list and

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.940 
base but there's the mapping list and
the<00:01:06.850> naming<00:01:07.090> template<00:01:07.630> now<00:01:08.290> in<00:01:08.409> order<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.710> map

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
the naming template now in order to map

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.039 
the naming template now in order to map
the<00:01:09.220> bones<00:01:09.430> we're<00:01:09.670> gonna<00:01:09.759> import<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.540> motion

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
the bones we're gonna import the motion

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.380 
the bones we're gonna import the motion
file<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:12.369> we<00:01:12.460> created<00:01:12.759> that<00:01:12.939> we<00:01:13.090> created

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
file that we created that we created

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.740 
file that we created that we created
earlier

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
earlier

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.360 
earlier
any<00:01:14.049> motion<00:01:14.290> file<00:01:14.619> you<00:01:14.770> get<00:01:14.860> out<00:01:15.010> of<00:01:15.130> a<00:01:15.190> piece

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
any motion file you get out of a piece

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.850 
any motion file you get out of a piece
off<00:01:15.520> will<00:01:15.730> work<00:01:15.940> because<00:01:16.150> we're<00:01:16.450> not<00:01:16.540> actually

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
off will work because we're not actually

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.410 
off will work because we're not actually
interested<00:01:17.860> in<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.520> whole<00:01:18.670> motion<00:01:18.850> file<00:01:19.180> just

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
interested in the whole motion file just

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.940 
interested in the whole motion file just
in<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.720> T<00:01:19.870> pose<00:01:20.080> at<00:01:20.230> the<00:01:20.260> beginning<00:01:20.590> because

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
in the T pose at the beginning because

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.680 
in the T pose at the beginning because
that's<00:01:21.160> what<00:01:21.430> contains<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.150> bones<00:01:22.330> that<00:01:22.510> we

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
that's what contains the bones that we

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.260 
that's what contains the bones that we
need<00:01:22.870> so<00:01:23.560> let's<00:01:23.890> see<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.280> in<00:01:24.640> order<00:01:24.820> to<00:01:24.910> map

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
need so let's see the in order to map

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.790 
need so let's see the in order to map
these<00:01:25.450> things<00:01:25.870> what<00:01:26.080> I'm<00:01:26.170> gonna<00:01:26.290> do<00:01:26.530> is<00:01:26.680> I'm

leg here well and you might want to look
at<00:01:46.659> that<00:01:46.920> left<00:01:47.920> leg<00:01:48.190> is<00:01:48.610> right<00:01:49.000> here<00:01:49.270> so<00:01:49.300> just

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
at that left leg is right here so just

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.500 
at that left leg is right here so just
alt<00:01:49.900> click<00:01:50.409> each<00:01:50.650> of<00:01:50.920> these<00:01:51.040> hoops<00:01:51.420> got<00:01:52.420> to

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
alt click each of these hoops got to

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.350 
alt click each of these hoops got to
click<00:01:52.659> it<00:01:52.810> first<00:01:53.050> and<00:01:53.229> then<00:01:53.350> alt<00:01:53.620> click<00:01:53.950> I

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
click it first and then alt click I

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.730 
click it first and then alt click I
accidentally<00:01:55.360> drag<00:01:55.570> both<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.440> you<00:01:56.530> get<00:01:56.650> the

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
accidentally drag both and you get the

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.260 
accidentally drag both and you get the
idea<00:01:57.010> so<00:01:57.040> you're<00:01:57.310> going<00:01:57.430> to<00:01:57.490> need<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.760> drag

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
idea so you're going to need to drag

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.289 
idea so you're going to need to drag
each<00:01:58.570> of<00:01:58.720> these<00:01:58.840> bones<00:01:59.229> to<00:01:59.860> the<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:01.210> the

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
each of these bones to the to the

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.090 
each of these bones to the to the
mapping<00:02:01.479> list<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.020> don't<00:02:02.229> forget<00:02:02.860> about

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
mapping list and don't forget about

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.890 
mapping list and don't forget about
getting<00:02:03.400> things<00:02:03.729> like<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:04.060> toe<00:02:04.270> base<00:02:04.510> and<00:02:04.840> the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
getting things like the toe base and the

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.990 
getting things like the toe base and the
shoulders<00:02:05.320> and<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.590> neck<00:02:05.620> because<00:02:06.490> there<00:02:06.850> are

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
shoulders and the neck because there are

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.820 
shoulders and the neck because there are
more<00:02:07.270> bones<00:02:07.540> available<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.229> be<00:02:08.349> mapped<00:02:08.560> than

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
the absolute minimum but you're going to

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.649 
the absolute minimum but you're going to
get<00:02:12.040> more<00:02:12.220> realistic<00:02:12.549> animations<00:02:13.269> if<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.480> map

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
get more realistic animations if you map

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.350 
get more realistic animations if you map
the<00:02:13.810> rest<00:02:14.019> once<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:15.220> have<00:02:15.519> mapped<00:02:15.879> all<00:02:16.090> of

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
an error but a diagnostic pop-up that

because of the BVH file format that

something that it's going to affect what

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.939 
something that it's going to affect what
we're<00:03:31.269> doing<00:03:31.629> as<00:03:31.750> far<00:03:31.780> as<00:03:31.989> I<00:03:32.139> know<00:03:32.199> I've<00:03:32.799> never

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:32.949 
we're doing as far as I know I've never

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.369 
we're doing as far as I know I've never
noticed<00:03:33.190> any<00:03:33.489> adverse<00:03:33.819> effects<00:03:34.180> from<00:03:34.239> it<00:03:34.510> okay

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
noticed any adverse effects from it okay

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.520 
noticed any adverse effects from it okay
so<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:37.209> can<00:03:37.389> see<00:03:37.419> here<00:03:37.810> if<00:03:37.900> I<00:03:37.989> expand<00:03:38.379> this

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
so you can see here if I expand this

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.479 
so you can see here if I expand this
character<00:03:38.919> this<00:03:39.040> is<00:03:39.099> the<00:03:39.250> one<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.400> created

character this is the one I created

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.800 
character this is the one I created
earlier<00:03:40.379> yesterday<00:03:41.379> actually<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:42.040> if<00:03:43.000> you

not said except for things like the

not said except for things like the
fingers<00:03:48.430> because<00:03:48.790> I<00:03:48.819> didn't<00:03:49.120> map<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.510> fingers

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
fingers because I didn't map the fingers

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.509 
fingers because I didn't map the fingers
because<00:03:50.139> I'm<00:03:50.260> not<00:03:50.379> going<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.739> be<00:03:50.859> animating

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
because I'm not going to be animating

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.860 
because I'm not going to be animating
fingers<00:03:51.849> because<00:03:52.090> if<00:03:52.389> he<00:03:52.510> soft<00:03:52.720> doesn't

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
fingers because if he soft doesn't

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.869 
fingers because if he soft doesn't
support<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.440> if<00:03:53.769> I<00:03:53.949> was<00:03:54.099> using<00:03:54.250> higher<00:03:54.519> quality

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
support it if I was using higher quality

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.089 
support it if I was using higher quality
motion<00:03:55.150> capture<00:03:55.419> software<00:03:55.629> that<00:03:55.989> did<00:03:56.319> get<00:03:56.709> my

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
motion capture software that did get my

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.710 
motion capture software that did get my
fingers<00:03:57.459> or<00:03:57.609> actually<00:03:58.209> it'd<00:03:58.329> be<00:03:58.389> soft<00:03:58.569> very

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
fingers or actually it'd be soft very

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.180 
fingers or actually it'd be soft very
high<00:03:58.870> quality<00:03:59.260> but<00:03:59.349> if<00:03:59.470> I<00:03:59.560> if<00:03:59.739> it<00:03:59.889> had<00:04:00.010> better

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
high quality but if I if it had better

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.800 
high quality but if I if it had better
resolution<00:04:00.579> and<00:04:00.940> could<00:04:01.060> do<00:04:01.180> finger<00:04:01.480> mapping

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
resolution and could do finger mapping

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.569 
resolution and could do finger mapping
then<00:04:01.989> I<00:04:02.019> would<00:04:02.230> map<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.440> fingers<00:04:02.829> but<00:04:03.459> the

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
then I would map the fingers but the

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.580 
then I would map the fingers but the
idea<00:04:03.970> here<00:04:04.030> is<00:04:04.449> that<00:04:04.480> now<00:04:04.780> I've<00:04:05.049> got<00:04:05.470> this

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
idea here is that now I've got this

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.009 
idea here is that now I've got this
naming<00:04:05.980> template<00:04:06.579> and<00:04:06.760> then<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:07.540> location

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
naming template and then that location

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.030 
naming template and then that location
that<00:04:08.409> I<00:04:08.440> saved<00:04:08.889> the<00:04:09.159> for<00:04:09.519> the<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:10.209> file<00:04:10.659> to

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
that I saved the for the the file to

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.839 
that I saved the for the the file to
you're<00:04:12.040> going<00:04:12.159> to<00:04:12.220> want<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:12.400> know<00:04:12.459> where<00:04:12.699> that

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
you're going to want to know where that

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.420 
you're going to want to know where that
is<00:04:13.030> because<00:04:13.540> remember<00:04:14.230> before<00:04:14.889> in<00:04:15.250> the

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
is because remember before in the

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.129 
is because remember before in the
previous<00:04:15.579> lesson<00:04:16.269> when<00:04:16.419> we<00:04:16.570> put<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.900> medic

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
previous lesson when we put the medic

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.259 
previous lesson when we put the medic
into<00:04:17.349> T<00:04:17.530> pose<00:04:17.769> and<00:04:18.070> then<00:04:18.159> we<00:04:18.310> saved<00:04:18.669> him<00:04:18.940> out<00:04:19.090> as

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
into T pose and then we saved him out as

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.029 
into T pose and then we saved him out as
an<00:04:19.389> FBX<00:04:19.810> file<00:04:20.079> well<00:04:20.440> you're<00:04:20.590> gonna<00:04:20.680> want<00:04:20.949> to

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
an FBX file well you're gonna want to

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.310 
an FBX file well you're gonna want to
save<00:04:21.310> this<00:04:21.699> naming<00:04:22.030> template<00:04:22.630> map<00:04:22.840> into<00:04:23.289> the

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
save this naming template map into the

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.680 
save this naming template map into the
same<00:04:23.620> folder<00:04:24.070> and<00:04:24.490> you're<00:04:25.210> gonna<00:04:25.330> want<00:04:25.599> to

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
same folder and you're gonna want to

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.659 
same folder and you're gonna want to
probably<00:04:25.870> create<00:04:26.349> one<00:04:26.590> of<00:04:26.620> these<00:04:26.860> for<00:04:27.250> each<00:04:27.460> of

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
probably create one of these for each of

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.399 
probably create one of these for each of
the<00:04:27.760> classes<00:04:27.909> I've<00:04:28.510> only<00:04:28.659> created<00:04:29.020> a<00:04:29.080> couple

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
the classes I've only created a couple

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:30.410 
the classes I've only created a couple
of<00:04:29.530> them

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
of them

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.730

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
new ones you can reuse them you don't

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.200 
new ones you can reuse them you don't
have<00:04:34.750> to<00:04:35.020> do<00:04:35.170> these<00:04:35.410> steps<00:04:36.160> every<00:04:36.370> time<00:04:36.700> you

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
have to do these steps every time you

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.820 
have to do these steps every time you
can<00:04:37.360> reuse<00:04:37.630> these<00:04:38.080> templates<00:04:38.530> and<00:04:38.620> I'm<00:04:38.710> going

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
can reuse these templates and I'm going

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.610 
can reuse these templates and I'm going

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
where we're going to actually bind the

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.930 
where we're going to actually bind the
animation<00:04:50.710> to<00:04:50.890> a<00:04:50.920> real<00:04:51.160> model<00:04:51.580> and<00:04:51.700> make<00:04:51.820> him

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
animation to a real model and make him

00:04:51.940 --> 00:05:01.320 
animation to a real model and make him
walk<00:04:52.060> around<00:04:52.390> a<00:04:52.480> little<00:04:52.600> bit<00:04:52.810> I<00:05:00.330> realized

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
walk around a little bit I realized

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.180 
walk around a little bit I realized
after<00:05:01.600> I<00:05:01.720> recorded<00:05:02.260> this<00:05:02.410> that<00:05:02.710> I<00:05:02.740> didn't

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
after I recorded this that I didn't

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.630 
after I recorded this that I didn't
actually<00:05:03.490> put<00:05:04.240> how<00:05:04.810> to<00:05:04.870> add<00:05:05.410> the<00:05:05.800> path<00:05:06.040> that<00:05:06.520> we

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
actually put how to add the path that we

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.060 
actually put how to add the path that we
just<00:05:06.940> created<00:05:07.510> to<00:05:07.990> the<00:05:08.200> asset<00:05:08.620> brother<00:05:08.830> so

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
just created to the asset brother so

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.820 
just created to the asset brother so
after<00:05:09.430> you<00:05:09.580> have<00:05:09.610> created<00:05:09.940> and<00:05:10.650> exported<00:05:11.650> your

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
after you have created and exported your

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.920 
after you have created and exported your
medic<00:05:12.130> and<00:05:12.340> after<00:05:12.790> you<00:05:12.940> have<00:05:13.090> created<00:05:13.330> and

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
medic and after you have created and

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.170 
medic and after you have created and
exported<00:05:14.710> your<00:05:14.920> naming<00:05:15.490> template<00:05:16.150> that

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
exported your naming template that

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.410 
exported your naming template that
character<00:05:17.020> map<00:05:17.320> that<00:05:17.620> I<00:05:17.650> showed<00:05:17.710> you<00:05:18.250> just<00:05:18.880> a

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
character map that I showed you just a

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.290 
character map that I showed you just a
moment<00:05:19.570> ago<00:05:20.040> and<00:05:21.040> you<00:05:21.340> know<00:05:21.490> the<00:05:21.700> path<00:05:21.880> it's<00:05:22.120> in

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
moment ago and you know the path it's in

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.300 
moment ago and you know the path it's in
right<00:05:22.510> so<00:05:23.080> you're<00:05:23.230> gonna<00:05:23.320> want<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.620> go<00:05:23.740> here<00:05:24.130> to

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
right so you're gonna want to go here to

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.400 
right so you're gonna want to go here to
the<00:05:24.460> asset<00:05:24.910> browser<00:05:25.000> and<00:05:25.450> just<00:05:25.660> right<00:05:26.050> click

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
the asset browser and just right click

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.010 
the asset browser and just right click
templates<00:05:27.010> and<00:05:27.310> say<00:05:27.670> add<00:05:27.820> favorite<00:05:28.420> path<00:05:28.690> and

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
templates and say add favorite path and

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.450 
templates and say add favorite path and
then<00:05:29.200> you're<00:05:29.290> gonna<00:05:29.380> want<00:05:29.620> to<00:05:29.680> browse<00:05:29.980> to<00:05:30.010> that

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
then you're gonna want to browse to that

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.390 
then you're gonna want to browse to that
folder<00:05:31.120> wherever<00:05:31.360> it<00:05:31.690> might<00:05:31.900> be<00:05:31.960> on<00:05:32.500> your

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
folder wherever it might be on your

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.520 
folder wherever it might be on your
computer<00:05:34.030> and<00:05:34.210> then<00:05:34.570> what<00:05:34.750> will<00:05:34.870> happen<00:05:35.320> is

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
computer and then what will happen is

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.870 
computer and then what will happen is
we'll<00:05:35.710> add<00:05:35.890> one<00:05:36.100> of<00:05:36.160> these<00:05:36.310> little<00:05:36.490> folder

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
we'll add one of these little folder

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.310 
we'll add one of these little folder
nodes<00:05:37.090> and<00:05:37.270> as<00:05:37.390> you<00:05:37.510> can<00:05:37.630> see<00:05:37.690> here<00:05:38.140> I've<00:05:38.290> got

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
nodes and as you can see here I've got

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.080 
nodes and as you can see here I've got
engineer<00:05:39.100> because<00:05:39.220> I<00:05:39.370> did<00:05:39.550> an<00:05:39.640> engineer

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
engineer because I did an engineer

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.600 
engineer because I did an engineer
earlier<00:05:40.660> medic<00:05:41.410> that's<00:05:41.590> my<00:05:41.920> version<00:05:42.340> of<00:05:42.490> that

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
earlier medic that's my version of that

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.790 
earlier medic that's my version of that
tipos<00:05:43.150> medic<00:05:43.480> that<00:05:43.510> I<00:05:43.630> did<00:05:43.900> and<00:05:44.170> then<00:05:44.290> tf2

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
tipos medic that I did and then tf2

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.490 
tipos medic that I did and then tf2
character<00:05:45.310> map<00:05:45.550> and<00:05:45.790> once<00:05:46.750> the<00:05:46.960> you<00:05:47.080> have<00:05:47.290> done

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
character map and once the you have done

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.170 
character map and once the you have done
these<00:05:47.680> they<00:05:47.920> remain<00:05:48.220> there<00:05:48.430> forever<00:05:48.550> so<00:05:49.030> you'd

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
these they remain there forever so you'd

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.850 
these they remain there forever so you'd
only<00:05:49.300> have<00:05:49.420> to<00:05:49.570> do<00:05:49.750> it<00:05:49.900> once<00:05:50.170> and<00:05:50.440> then<00:05:50.530> in<00:05:50.770> the

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
only have to do it once and then in the

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.710 
only have to do it once and then in the
next<00:05:51.160> tutorial<00:05:51.670> I<00:05:51.790> will<00:05:51.850> show<00:05:52.120> you<00:05:52.180> how<00:05:52.330> to<00:05:52.360> use

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
next tutorial I will show you how to use

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.010 
next tutorial I will show you how to use
these<00:05:52.930> to<00:05:53.200> make<00:05:53.350> your<00:05:53.790> video<00:05:54.790> animation<00:05:55.690> your

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
these to make your video animation your

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.650 
these to make your video animation your
your<00:05:56.260> motion<00:05:56.620> capture<00:05:56.950> animation<00:05:57.660> incredibly

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
your motion capture animation incredibly

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.180 
your motion capture animation incredibly
easy<00:05:58.930> you<00:05:59.380> only<00:05:59.530> have<00:05:59.710> to<00:05:59.800> go<00:05:59.920> through<00:05:59.950> the

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
easy you only have to go through the

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.220 
easy you only have to go through the
process<00:06:00.580> of<00:06:00.670> T<00:06:00.850> posing<00:06:01.210> them<00:06:01.330> once<00:06:01.540> and<00:06:01.750> then

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:02.230 
process of T posing them once and then

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.230 
process of T posing them once and then
creating<00:06:02.560> that<00:06:02.650> mapping<00:06:03.010> template<00:06:03.370> once<00:06:03.880> and

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
creating that mapping template once and

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.970 
creating that mapping template once and
then<00:06:04.360> from<00:06:04.570> then<00:06:04.720> on<00:06:04.750> you<00:06:05.380> just<00:06:05.560> drag<00:06:05.770> and<00:06:05.950> drop

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:05.980 
then from then on you just drag and drop

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.160 
then from then on you just drag and drop
it'll<00:06:06.850> be<00:06:06.970> very<00:06:07.090> nice<00:06:07.300> so<00:06:07.720> I<00:06:07.750> will<00:06:08.080> look

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.170 
it'll be very nice so I will look

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.510 
it'll be very nice so I will look
