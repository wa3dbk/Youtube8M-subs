00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 that my name is Carlos Mesa 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.200
 the outside shot 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.689
 but the summer of 1993 

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:11.680
 I think and mechanic 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.680
 By the way are the ultra lightweight if the engines 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:16.689
 the 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:17.849
 I can put together 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.909
 I can build the planes that come from pt 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:23.210
 I can build the engines 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.130
 so the real growth for the engines 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.779
 they do not send us 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.069
 different countries 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:32.400
 for one hundrerd 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.230
 Your motor is very reliable 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.860
 always when I give them a proper maintenance if I say pure pérez 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.940
 passion the truth is that it is a mobile that 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.010
 We kept the passion for the people for the American engines 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.100
 love working with motors 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.240
 love to repair the premolars delicious 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.240
 I really enjoy all my work 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.530
 I enjoy enormously 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.920
 always announced to him like any other 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.390
 airplane 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.080
 percent fly by the lift created by the rooms in the air 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.710
 who are propelled with the case of these materials are propelled by the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.490
 engine 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.860
 the reason for the choice 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.360
 and helped the plane move 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.560
 there are other types that are gliders that do not need the engine simply that 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.710
 tow 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.650
 another plane is towed by the smell 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.980
 they keep certain time in the air they need other skills 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.020
 Australians are very insecure are forgiveness they are very safe always when 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.280
 they are given the proper maintenance as any vehicle 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.619
 p dn should be an important tablecloth 13 pretty careful 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.160
 in order to have the due security of the case 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.480
 who make it safe the person 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.950
 that does not provide maintenance and does not care 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.750
 it very safe the fuel capacity late all 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.130
 this one in the ring 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.020
 2b 70 liters of fuel use fuel super equal to that of 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.040
 vehicles 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.910
 after this is that the partners of the waves 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.490
 percent and duration depends on the speed of the plane normally 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.589
 an average of them are flying to 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:11.899
 about 80 kilometers per hour and they can fly to 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:14.769
 they can fly a 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.709
 around two hours all in two hours what reaches not only 80 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.779
 kilometers per hour is not in my case I came from Colombia in an ultralight 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:27.119
 We will go to scale in Panama we left Colombia Medellin Colombia 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:28.469
 scale in panama 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.949
 from medellín colombia panama we last four hours 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:35.069
 and of panama lemon another four hours 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.999
 making scale we do not sleep or dove o'shea went around the whole world 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:40.929
 if you want to do it 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:43.879
 there is no problem always when doing the life scales for 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.639
 replenish fuel check the plane check the engine and that everything is fine 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.930
 but they have gone from patagonia to alaska between lines 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:57.759
 they are often beautiful here are many has won in general and the 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:58.929
 valley the general 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:03.689
 It's one of the nicest places I know to fly that delicious 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.250
 because we have some crops that from the air are very beautiful from the cultivation of 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:10.349
 the cane 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.180
 the coffee farms the hospital at the end of the very nice edition and fly in the 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.059
 morning 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:18.659
 as height watching the crops got off the very nice 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:22.599
 and the most beautiful of all is that he felt very close to God 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.000
 We are going to look at the instrument panel of an ultralight aircraft now 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:33.389
 we have the engine indicators efe - indications 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:34.500
 of the revolution 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.439
 per minute the engine has just run out 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.739
 that budget measures the temperature of the head of the cylinders 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.129
 we have a compass to guide us 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.430
 we have an indicator that the homophobia indexes we are not defending as 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.919
 going up or down 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.319
 the fuel quantity indicator 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.459
 we have to suffer it 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.939
 to turn on the different instruments 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.549
 as a skele zone the assets 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.950
 we have a transponder that is used to know in what position is the 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:07.789
 airplane 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:11.079
 when a control tower does not request it 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.399
 the altimeter 

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:15.269
 that tells us how high the plane is 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.019
 with respect to the earth here we have the speedometer 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.430
 everything indicates the relative speed 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.689
 of the plane against the wind 

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:25.689
 and this is a temperature gauge exhaust gases 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.599
 The only thing it does is to measure the temperature that the gases 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:34.370
 escape stop do not hire trent engines if you do a communications radio bhp 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:39.349
 to maintain royal contact with all the other governments that are in the 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:39.990
 area 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.539
 the lever 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.539
 this action the 'flaps' tenacity surfaces 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.449
 but not for takeoff and landing 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.629
 we have control 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:55.389
 this is the elevator with this movement 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.499
 that these are the ailerons 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:01.180
 this causes the elevator causes the airplane to climb hohagen 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.039
 values ​​chaos in the face of violence or on the other 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.069
 and in the background 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:09.110
 there are the pedals 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.120
 that together with better 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.509
 with the cane 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.169
 help control the direction of the plane there promote them to the fund 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:17.509
 we are criminal 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:18.490
 this plane 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.159
 like almost all ultralight airplanes 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:24.159
 13 is to see what is made for two people 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:27.819
 that can fly comfortably is a very safe aircraft 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:31.800
 the field then of an engine failure if you want 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.790
 the plane can float and can plan to find a suitable place 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.259
 For landing 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.009
 pérez suffers the propeller 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:42.460
 this one that is in charge of movement that in turn 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.749
 pushed between light in front 

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:47.749
 peter that we have the engine this is a small box 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.370
 motor fish is a 65 horsepower engine 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.960
 two-stroke a lot of fuel super d all vehicles normally 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.939
 he has his two collaborators 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:01.270
 has your mixing oil tank 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.139
 and has its water radiator 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.279
 the engine cools the water 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:09.439
 and it's basically a very light engine for the power that it gives 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.539
 this engine 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.759
 Cesc has that 65 horse 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:17.960
 and is able to lift 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.080
 easily 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.759
 this plane 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:24.300
 with two people and with fuels 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.580
 with this execution of the stretch
