00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.200
 Always I am indebted 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:14.139
 This time 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:14.139
 I would like to explain the composition of proteins in cells 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.330
 It's protein synthesis 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.330
 The 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.109
 Seen in FIG. And 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.109
 Here you will 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.290
 First of all 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:40.260
 This is in my shell inside the cell, but there is a double helix ena in the shell 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.930
 That 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.079
 First of all 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:49.100
 The nucleotide sequence of that dna is 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.100
 I have copied 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.470
 To take this 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.820
 10 cars 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.060
 Called 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.839
 The point person to in 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:09.530
 It is this messenger rna that does the work to do 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.050
 messenger rna has a sequence of dna 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.860
 Take on 4 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.790
 It is a copy machine 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.320
 Transcribe 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.320
 Get out of each 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.679
 The one that was transcribed in 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.679
 There is a long base sequence though 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.790
 This is the ribosome 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:37.380
 Proteins are synthesized in the ribosome 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.259
 First of all, the messenger rna 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.189
 Enter the ribosome 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.189
 In a 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.490
 There is an amino acid written here. 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.880
 The say amino acids 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.830
 Three 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.330
 With postponement 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.650
 thing 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.440
 Standing 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.690
 It is an amino acid 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.770
 that 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.700
 Toka valine 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.700
 It is written 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:12.920
 A friend of skill 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:18.250
 There are various amino acids though 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:21.630
 All three people have base sequences. 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.180
 The amino acid is 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.080
 transfer 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.540
 by rna 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.540
 This also goes into the ribosome 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.350
 so 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.750
 This messenger lane 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.750
 It has been transferred N from na 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.950
 things and 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:50.280
 Will stick here that with amino acids three base sequences 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:54.470
 I will stick three at a time in succession 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.100
 In which it united 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.100
 protein 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.540
 Will be the wind that 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.140
 is not it 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.140
 First of all, words are important here 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.120
 messenger rna is 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.830
 dna of 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.670
 This base sequence 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:23.480
 I 'm this pen to copy 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:26.620
 It is the messenger rna that transcribes 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:34.180
 Entering into the ribosome to in 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:36.510
 Port-au-Prince and then to take the amino acid in the mother-in-law Affairs is the rna 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.510
 is 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.690
 Ikima the amino acid in lance Whirlpool sister of the ribosome 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:50.630
 So yeah 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:52.430
 You can combine Dr. Pan with the messenger and the lancer, but this one 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.750
 To 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.620
 Main vein 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.620
 Is called 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.030
 Econo in Desun 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.550
 It is a house plant ne 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.890
 This way of going and each 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:19.709
 name 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:19.709
 Because you are asked often to test, such as the Tteyuu I would like to remember it this time
