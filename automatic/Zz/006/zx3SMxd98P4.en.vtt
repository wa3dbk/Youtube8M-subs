00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
I think we lost about 3 so we really

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.499 
I think we lost about 3 so we really
took<00:01:36.920> this<00:01:37.070> enemy<00:01:37.399> team<00:01:37.579> apart<00:01:37.909> and<00:01:38.119> it<00:01:38.360> was

you<00:02:57.419> do<00:02:57.569> get<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.840> see<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.139> LEvolution<00:02:58.500> come

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
you do get to see the LEvolution come

00:02:58.829 --> 00:02:59.449 
you do get to see the LEvolution come
rolling<00:02:59.220> in

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
rolling in

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.309 
rolling in
of<00:02:59.669> course<00:02:59.939> the<00:03:00.090> LEvolution<00:03:00.419> on<00:03:00.750> this<00:03:00.900> map<00:03:01.139> is

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
of course the LEvolution on this map is

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.289 
of course the LEvolution on this map is
the<00:03:01.500> massive<00:03:01.950> sandstorm<00:03:02.489> so<00:03:03.030> as<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.150> can<00:03:03.239> see

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
the massive sandstorm so as you can see

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.759 
the massive sandstorm so as you can see
at<00:03:03.629> the<00:03:03.720> start<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.019> map<00:03:04.169> here<00:03:04.349> the<00:03:04.379> sky<00:03:04.739> is

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
at the start the map here the sky is

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.069 
at the start the map here the sky is
quite<00:03:05.189> clear<00:03:05.519> line-of-sight<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.540> quite<00:03:06.810> clear

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
quite clear line-of-sight is quite clear

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.899 
quite clear line-of-sight is quite clear
but<00:03:07.439> as<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.620> can<00:03:07.709> see<00:03:07.889> the<00:03:08.250> sandstorm<00:03:08.760> in<00:03:08.849> the

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
but as you can see the sandstorm in the

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.099 
but as you can see the sandstorm in the
background<00:03:09.269> they're<00:03:09.359> starting<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.780> roll<00:03:10.079> in

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
background they're starting to roll in

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.140 
background they're starting to roll in
and<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:10.560> really<00:03:10.799> does<00:03:11.069> change<00:03:11.370> how<00:03:11.730> this<00:03:11.939> map

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
and that really does change how this map

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.330 
and that really does change how this map
plays<00:03:12.480> now<00:03:12.959> I<00:03:12.989> really<00:03:13.470> underestimated<00:03:13.769> this

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
plays now I really underestimated this

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.740 
plays now I really underestimated this
sandstorm<00:03:14.819> when<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.090> first<00:03:15.389> saw<00:03:15.569> it<00:03:15.599> in

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
sandstorm when I first saw it in

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.270 
sandstorm when I first saw it in
trailers<00:03:16.109> I<00:03:16.260> didn't<00:03:16.530> think<00:03:16.650> too<00:03:16.829> much<00:03:16.889> of<00:03:17.069> it

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
trailers I didn't think too much of it

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.190 
trailers I didn't think too much of it
but<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.519> really<00:03:17.700> is<00:03:17.849> quite<00:03:18.209> immersive<00:03:18.810> these

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
but it really is quite immersive these

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.899 
but it really is quite immersive these

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
this does slowly flood over the map it

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.569 
this does slowly flood over the map it
is<00:03:27.989> pretty<00:03:28.260> scary<00:03:28.349> actually<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.129> makes<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.370> map

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579
