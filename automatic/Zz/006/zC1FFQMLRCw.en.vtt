00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
a little bit faster Nordisk entry

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.680 
a little bit faster Nordisk entry
because<00:04:34.190> if<00:04:34.370> I<00:04:34.550> turn<00:04:34.790> the<00:04:34.940> steam<00:04:35.240> train<00:04:35.510> off

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
because if I turn the steam train off

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.250 
because if I turn the steam train off
and<00:04:36.220> at<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.370> same<00:04:37.550> time<00:04:37.790> this<00:04:38.570> one<00:04:38.840> will<00:04:39.020> catch

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
and at the same time this one will catch

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.990 
and at the same time this one will catch
up<00:04:39.530> if<00:04:39.710> a<00:04:39.890> getter<00:04:40.130> is<00:04:40.280> all<00:04:40.490> those<00:04:40.669> cuddles

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
up if a getter is all those cuddles

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.810 
up if a getter is all those cuddles
still<00:04:41.600> it's<00:04:42.200> gonna<00:04:42.440> catch<00:04:42.770> up<00:04:42.800> even<00:04:43.729> though

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
still it's gonna catch up even though

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:50.080 
still it's gonna catch up even though
that<00:04:44.210> one<00:04:44.419> carries<00:04:44.810> this<00:04:45.020> right

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
just switch it so that it won't go and

00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:14.350 
just switch it so that it won't go and

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:23.920 

this<00:05:15.360> is<00:05:15.539> a<00:05:15.690> courgette<00:05:16.259> let's<00:05:16.500> swap<00:05:16.740> it<00:05:16.919> around

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.640 

you<00:05:24.930> take<00:05:25.110> a<00:05:25.169> look

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
show us how it works dude okay see you

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.040 
show us how it works dude okay see you
don't<00:05:32.880> have<00:05:33.120> to<00:05:33.150> hold<00:05:33.360> it<00:05:33.569> all<00:05:33.720> the<00:05:33.840> time

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
don't have to hold it all the time

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.200 
don't have to hold it all the time
because<00:05:34.229> you<00:05:34.560> can<00:05:34.770> keep<00:05:35.280> it<00:05:35.520> locked<00:05:35.819> right

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
because you can keep it locked right

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.540 
because you can keep it locked right
there<00:05:36.599> you<00:05:37.169> can<00:05:37.349> push<00:05:37.530> it<00:05:37.650> right<00:05:37.800> there<00:05:38.069> and<00:05:38.340> go

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
there you can push it right there and go

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.850 
there you can push it right there and go
just<00:05:38.909> right<00:05:39.120> back<00:05:39.330> up<00:05:39.630> and<00:05:40.169> you<00:05:40.289> built<00:05:40.530> it<00:05:40.710> so

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
just right back up and you built it so

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.659 
just right back up and you built it so
that<00:05:41.009> it's<00:05:41.159> a<00:05:41.250> death<00:05:41.460> trap<00:05:41.759> right<00:05:42.199> right<00:05:43.669> and

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669
