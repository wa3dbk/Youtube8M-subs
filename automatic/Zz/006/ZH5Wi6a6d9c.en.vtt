anything now the beauty of the power
gorilla<00:07:10.600> is<00:07:10.870> it<00:07:11.140> works<00:07:11.410> using<00:07:11.800> lithium

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 
gorilla is it works using lithium

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.909 
gorilla is it works using lithium
polymer<00:07:12.910> technology<00:07:13.840> instead<00:07:14.410> of<00:07:14.560> the<00:07:14.710> more

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:14.919 
polymer technology instead of the more

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:17.310 
polymer technology instead of the more
common<00:07:15.370> lithium-ion<00:07:16.030> technology<00:07:16.210> there's<00:07:17.169> no

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:17.320 
common lithium-ion technology there's no

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.620 
common lithium-ion technology there's no
metal<00:07:17.590> casing<00:07:18.220> to<00:07:18.430> squeeze<00:07:18.760> the<00:07:18.970> electrodes

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:19.630 
metal casing to squeeze the electrodes

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.290 
metal casing to squeeze the electrodes
and<00:07:19.780> separators<00:07:20.500> together<00:07:20.800> so<00:07:21.280> already<00:07:21.880> it's

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.300 
and separators together so already it's

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.230 
and separators together so already it's
a<00:07:22.540> lighter<00:07:22.930> prospect<00:07:23.590> also<00:07:24.430> because<00:07:24.910> you<00:07:25.060> can

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 
a lighter prospect also because you can

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.290 
a lighter prospect also because you can
really<00:07:25.900> make<00:07:26.229> a<00:07:26.260> compact<00:07:27.010> unit<00:07:27.340> its<00:07:27.970> energy

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:28.300 
really make a compact unit its energy

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.230 
really make a compact unit its energy
density<00:07:29.020> is<00:07:29.229> up<00:07:29.710> to<00:07:29.919> twenty<00:07:30.400> percent<00:07:30.790> greater

than<00:07:31.810> a<00:07:31.900> lithium<00:07:32.350> iron<00:07:32.650> so<00:07:33.130> you<00:07:33.220> can<00:07:33.370> carry<00:07:33.669> it

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:33.820 
than a lithium iron so you can carry it

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.390 
than a lithium iron so you can carry it
anywhere<00:07:34.360> it<00:07:34.419> really<00:07:34.990> is<00:07:35.169> a<00:07:35.410> mobile<00:07:36.010> man<00:07:36.280> your
