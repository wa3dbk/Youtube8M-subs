faders<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.810> platters<00:03:09.200> just<00:03:09.470> feel<00:03:09.650> so

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
faders and the platters just feel so

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.890 
faders and the platters just feel so
good<00:03:10.280> on<00:03:10.489> this<00:03:10.790> controller<00:03:11.239> that<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:11.810> know

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
good on this controller that I know

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.839

features<00:03:25.790> on<00:03:25.940> this<00:03:26.060> because<00:03:26.299> you'll<00:03:26.540> find

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
features on this because you'll find

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
jog wheels on this thing they have just

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.969 
jog wheels on this thing they have just
incredible<00:03:53.180> response<00:03:53.569> in<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.379> software<00:03:54.799> and

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:54.979 
incredible response in the software and

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:57.189 
incredible response in the software and
they<00:03:55.159> feel<00:03:55.459> great<00:03:55.909> what<00:03:56.689> really<00:03:56.840> makes<00:03:57.109> this

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:57.199 
they feel great what really makes this

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:58.360 
they feel great what really makes this
controller<00:03:57.560> stand<00:03:57.859> out<00:03:57.979> above<00:03:58.189> the<00:03:58.250> rest

controller stand out above the rest
though<00:03:58.729> is<00:03:58.879> just<00:03:58.909> the<00:03:59.239> sheer<00:03:59.540> amount<00:03:59.780> of

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
though is just the sheer amount of

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.439 
though is just the sheer amount of
integration<00:04:00.949> it<00:04:01.069> has<00:04:01.220> with<00:04:01.489> tractor<00:04:01.849> it<00:04:02.329> was
