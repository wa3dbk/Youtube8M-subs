today<00:00:01.800> I'm<00:00:01.860> going<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.129> show<00:00:02.280> you<00:00:02.310> how<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.610> write

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
today I'm going to show you how to write

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.360 
today I'm going to show you how to write
down<00:00:03.179> any<00:00:03.419> number<00:00:03.570> as<00:00:03.990> I<00:00:04.380> product<00:00:04.980> prime

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
down any number as I product prime

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.540 
down any number as I product prime
factors<00:00:06.529> so<00:00:07.529> let's<00:00:07.740> write<00:00:07.980> down<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.250> hundred

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
factors so let's write down a hundred

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.680 
factors so let's write down a hundred
and<00:00:08.880> twenty<00:00:09.450> as<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.750> product<00:00:10.260> prime<00:00:10.559> factors

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
and twenty as a product prime factors

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.030 
and twenty as a product prime factors
first<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.900> all<00:00:12.990> what<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.170> need<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.500> do<00:00:13.710> is

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
first of all what you need to do is

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.849 
first of all what you need to do is
think<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:15.089> two<00:00:15.330> numbers<00:00:15.360> which<00:00:16.289> multiply

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
think of two numbers which multiply

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.550 
think of two numbers which multiply
together<00:00:17.119> to<00:00:18.119> give<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.920> 120<00:00:21.020> this<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.230> one<00:00:22.410> to

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
together to give you 120 this is one to

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.259 
together to give you 120 this is one to
go<00:00:22.740> four<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:24.090> 12<00:00:24.689> times<00:00:25.109> 10<00:00:25.789> because<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:27.060> have

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
go four is 12 times 10 because you have

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:38.240 
go four is 12 times 10 because you have
a<00:00:27.539> zero<00:00:27.960> at<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.500> end<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.800> 120<00:00:36.860> right<00:00:37.860> next

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
a zero at the end of 120 right next

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.729 
a zero at the end of 120 right next
thing<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.460> need<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.670> do<00:00:38.940> now<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.600> if<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.260> get<00:00:40.469> a

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
thing you need to do now is if you get a

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:41.869 
thing you need to do now is if you get a
prime<00:00:41.070> number

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
prime number

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.150 
prime number
you<00:00:42.030> need<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.360> circle<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:43.020> if<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.920> not<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
you need to circle it if it's not a

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.350 
you need to circle it if it's not a
prime<00:00:44.579> number

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
prime number

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.779 
prime number
you<00:00:45.989> need<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.350> split<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> number<00:00:47.100> up<00:00:47.399> again

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
you need to split the number up again

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.740 
you need to split the number up again
into<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.270> pair<00:00:48.539> factors<00:00:49.489> 12<00:00:50.489> isn't<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.510> prime

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
into a pair factors 12 isn't a prime

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.619 
into a pair factors 12 isn't a prime
number<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:53.489> need<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.760> split<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.390> into

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
number so we need to split this up into

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.119 
number so we need to split this up into
another<00:00:55.050> pair<00:00:55.260> factors<00:00:55.969> let's<00:00:56.969> go<00:00:57.270> with<00:00:57.629> two

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
another pair factors let's go with two

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.880 
another pair factors let's go with two
times<00:00:59.129> six

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.800 

tis<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.010> prime<00:01:05.309> number<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:06.090> I'm<00:01:06.510> going<00:01:06.750> to

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
tis a prime number so I'm going to

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.620 
tis a prime number so I'm going to
circle<00:01:07.110> 8<00:01:09.080> 6<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.619> prime<00:01:10.710> number<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.820> I'm

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
circle 8 6 is not a prime number so I'm

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.320 
circle 8 6 is not a prime number so I'm
going<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> split<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.260> number<00:01:13.710> up<00:01:14.330> into

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
going to split this number up into

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.359 
going to split this number up into
another<00:01:15.450> pair<00:01:15.840> factors<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.830> time<00:01:17.159> I'm<00:01:17.250> going

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
another pair factors this time I'm going

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.649 
another pair factors this time I'm going
to<00:01:17.460> go<00:01:17.610> with<00:01:19.040> 3<00:01:20.040> times<00:01:20.369> 2<00:01:22.729> 3<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.909> prime<00:01:24.180> number

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
to go with 3 times 2 3 the prime number

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.700 
to go with 3 times 2 3 the prime number
so<00:01:24.689> circle<00:01:25.619> 8<00:01:26.330> 2<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> prime<00:01:27.750> number<00:01:27.900> so

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
so circle 8 2 is a prime number so

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.399 
so circle 8 2 is a prime number so
Circle<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:31.790> only<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.180> do<00:01:33.299> nice<00:01:33.540> go<00:01:33.780> back<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.140> 10

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
Circle it only to do nice go back to 10

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.440 
Circle it only to do nice go back to 10
and<00:01:34.710> split<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.250> one<00:01:35.460> up<00:01:35.640> into<00:01:35.820> another<00:01:36.030> pair

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
and split this one up into another pair

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:46.399 
and split this one up into another pair
of<00:01:36.479> factors<00:01:39.229> let's<00:01:40.229> go<00:01:40.530> with<00:01:40.740> 2<00:01:40.979> times<00:01:41.369> 5<00:01:45.380> 2<00:01:46.380> is

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
of factors let's go with 2 times 5 2 is

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.149 
of factors let's go with 2 times 5 2 is
a<00:01:46.560> prime<00:01:46.920> number<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.340> circle<00:01:48.240> 8<00:01:48.680> 5<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> prime

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
a prime number so circle 8 5 is a prime

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.609 
a prime number so circle 8 5 is a prime
number<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.000> circulate<00:01:53.990> all<00:01:54.990> these<00:01:55.229> numbers

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
number so circulate all these numbers

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.249 
number so circulate all these numbers
which<00:01:55.770> I've<00:01:55.950> circled<00:01:56.579> are<00:01:57.000> prime<00:01:57.360> factors<00:01:58.020> of

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
which I've circled are prime factors of

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.719 
which I've circled are prime factors of
120

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
120

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.179 
120
now<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.750> question<00:02:01.140> asks<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.740> write<00:02:01.920> down

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
now the question asks you to write down

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.810 
now the question asks you to write down
the<00:02:02.460> product<00:02:03.000> two<00:02:03.360> prime<00:02:03.600> factors<00:02:04.670> so<00:02:05.670> what

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
the product two prime factors so what

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.119 
the product two prime factors so what
you<00:02:05.909> need<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.149> do<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:07.020> write<00:02:07.469> all<00:02:07.649> these<00:02:07.829> prime

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
you need to do is write all these prime

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.590 
you need to do is write all these prime
factors<00:02:08.640> down

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.160 

and<00:02:11.830> insert<00:02:12.830> multiplication<00:02:13.730> signs<00:02:14.170> between

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
and insert multiplication signs between

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.770 
and insert multiplication signs between
the<00:02:15.920> prior<00:02:16.220> factors<00:02:18.850> all<00:02:19.850> right<00:02:20.090> this<00:02:20.540> is

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
the prior factors all right this is

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.800 
the prior factors all right this is
known<00:02:21.080> as<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.920> produce<00:02:22.250> prime<00:02:22.460> factors<00:02:23.000> if

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
known as the produce prime factors if

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.300 
known as the produce prime factors if
you<00:02:24.020> multiply<00:02:24.470> all<00:02:24.530> these<00:02:24.770> numbers<00:02:24.830> together

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
you multiply all these numbers together

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.920 
you multiply all these numbers together
it<00:02:26.210> gives<00:02:26.570> you<00:02:26.980> 120<00:02:28.060> which<00:02:29.060> is<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:29.420> number<00:02:29.720> at

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
it gives you 120 which is the number at

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.730 
it gives you 120 which is the number at
the<00:02:29.960> top<00:02:30.320> of<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.680> fact<00:02:30.890> tray<00:02:32.200> let's<00:02:33.200> go<00:02:33.500> to

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
the top of the fact tray let's go to

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:44.080 
the top of the fact tray let's go to
another<00:02:34.040> example<00:02:41.050> so<00:02:42.050> let's<00:02:42.230> write<00:02:42.530> down<00:02:43.090> 72

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
another example so let's write down 72

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.370 
another example so let's write down 72
as<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.720> products<00:02:45.260> prior<00:02:45.470> factors<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:47.510> time<00:02:47.810> we

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
as a products prior factors this time we

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.860 
as a products prior factors this time we
haven't<00:02:48.590> got<00:02:48.710> a<00:02:48.830> zero<00:02:49.100> at<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.460> end<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.840> let's

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
haven't got a zero at the end so let's

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.680 
haven't got a zero at the end so let's
go<00:02:51.740> with<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.010> two<00:02:52.190> times<00:02:52.520> table<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:56.510> write

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
go with the two times table and write

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.670 
go with the two times table and write
four<00:02:56.900> half<00:02:57.050> seven<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.560> ten<00:02:57.740> we<00:02:57.980> get<00:02:58.130> 36

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
four half seven to ten we get 36

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.950 
four half seven to ten we get 36
so<00:03:00.680> 2<00:03:01.040> times<00:03:01.400> 36<00:03:02.770> cells<00:03:03.770> tare<00:03:04.630> 2<00:03:05.630> is<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:05.810> prime

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
so 2 times 36 cells tare 2 is a prime

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.830 
so 2 times 36 cells tare 2 is a prime
number<00:03:06.110> so<00:03:06.640> circulate<00:03:08.920> 36<00:03:09.920> is<00:03:10.070> a<00:03:10.100> prime<00:03:10.840> so

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
number so circulate 36 is a prime so

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.180 
number so circulate 36 is a prime so
let's<00:03:11.990> split<00:03:12.230> this<00:03:12.500> number<00:03:12.890> up<00:03:15.070> again<00:03:16.070> let's

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
let's split this number up again let's

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.010 
let's split this number up again let's
go<00:03:16.400> with<00:03:16.550> the<00:03:16.640> two<00:03:16.820> times<00:03:17.150> tables

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
go with the two times tables

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.950 
go with the two times tables
let's<00:03:18.530> go<00:03:18.740> 2<00:03:19.100> times<00:03:19.490> 18<00:03:22.270> again<00:03:23.270> 2<00:03:23.570> is<00:03:23.690> a<00:03:23.750> prime

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
let's go 2 times 18 again 2 is a prime

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.630 
let's go 2 times 18 again 2 is a prime
number<00:03:24.080> so<00:03:24.440> Circle<00:03:25.220> it<00:03:26.260> 18<00:03:27.260> is<00:03:27.470> a<00:03:27.500> prime<00:03:27.950> so

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
number so Circle it 18 is a prime so

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.980 
number so Circle it 18 is a prime so
split<00:03:28.910> it<00:03:29.120> up<00:03:31.180> this<00:03:32.180> time<00:03:32.240> I'm<00:03:32.690> going<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.840> go

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
split it up this time I'm going to go

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:39.850 
split it up this time I'm going to go
with<00:03:33.170> three<00:03:33.590> times<00:03:33.950> 6<00:03:37.750> threes<00:03:38.750> prime<00:03:39.260> so

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
with three times 6 threes prime so

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.470 
with three times 6 threes prime so
Circle<00:03:40.550> it<00:03:41.680> 6<00:03:42.680> is<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:42.920> prime<00:03:43.370> so<00:03:43.850> split<00:03:44.150> it<00:03:44.330> up

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
Circle it 6 is a prime so split it up

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.550 
Circle it 6 is a prime so split it up
again<00:03:46.330> this<00:03:47.330> time<00:03:47.390> we're<00:03:47.720> going<00:03:47.810> to<00:03:47.870> go<00:03:48.050> with<00:03:48.260> 2

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
again this time we're going to go with 2

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:58.679 
again this time we're going to go with 2
times<00:03:49.010> 3

00:03:58.679 --> 00:03:58.689 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:01.030 

all<00:03:59.689> we<00:03:59.810> need<00:03:59.959> to<00:03:59.989> do<00:04:00.140> now<00:04:00.379> is<00:04:00.439> write<00:04:00.650> down<00:04:00.709> our

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
all we need to do now is write down our

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.490 
all we need to do now is write down our
producer<00:04:01.459> prime<00:04:01.640> factors<00:04:02.209> so<00:04:02.900> if<00:04:03.049> we<00:04:03.140> put<00:04:03.349> all

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
producer prime factors so if we put all

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.390 
producer prime factors so if we put all
these<00:04:03.650> numbers<00:04:03.709> together<00:04:04.189> and<00:04:06.400> put

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
these numbers together and put

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.330 
these numbers together and put
multiplication<00:04:08.299> signs<00:04:08.599> between<00:04:09.500> h1<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:12.650> that

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
multiplication signs between h1 and that

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.140 
multiplication signs between h1 and that
is<00:04:13.579> the<00:04:13.879> produce<00:04:14.209> prime<00:04:14.480> factors<00:04:15.019> if<00:04:16.150> question

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
is the produce prime factors if question

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.939 
is the produce prime factors if question
last<00:04:17.269> year<00:04:17.510> to<00:04:17.690> write<00:04:17.870> product<00:04:18.320> of<00:04:18.620> prime

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
last year to write product of prime

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.090 
last year to write product of prime
factors<00:04:19.160> using<00:04:19.970> powers<00:04:20.440> you<00:04:21.440> can<00:04:21.680> write<00:04:21.889> it

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
factors using powers you can write it

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.930 
factors using powers you can write it
down<00:04:22.310> as<00:04:22.789> 2<00:04:23.120> to<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.960> power<00:04:24.139> of<00:04:24.380> 3<00:04:24.740> because<00:04:25.580> you

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
down as 2 to the power of 3 because you

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.710 
down as 2 to the power of 3 because you
have<00:04:26.150> three<00:04:26.539> twos<00:04:26.840> being<00:04:27.260> multiplied<00:04:27.800> and
