about<00:03:29.260> confronting<00:03:29.500> him<00:03:29.950> but<00:03:30.100> he's<00:03:30.220> already

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
about confronting him but he's already

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.580 
about confronting him but he's already
so<00:03:30.640> on<00:03:30.790> edge<00:03:31.000> why<00:03:31.180> are<00:03:31.540> you<00:03:31.720> protecting<00:03:32.200> him

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
so on edge why are you protecting him

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.940 
so on edge why are you protecting him
because<00:03:33.250> you're<00:03:33.910> not<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.360> only<00:03:34.600> one<00:03:34.950> hoping

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
because you're not the only one hoping

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.800
