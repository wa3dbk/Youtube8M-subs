other great thing about the consistency

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.440 
other great thing about the consistency
of<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.650> is<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:28.920> fact<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.250> here<00:02:30.000> it's<00:02:30.330> a

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
of it is the fact that here it's a

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.630 
of it is the fact that here it's a
moderately<00:02:30.900> cold<00:02:31.080> climate<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.920> things<00:02:32.400> like

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
moderately cold climate and things like

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.210 
moderately cold climate and things like
coconut<00:02:32.880> oil<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.390> shea<00:02:33.600> butter<00:02:34.130> solid<00:02:35.130> at

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
coconut oil and shea butter solid at

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.100 
coconut oil and shea butter solid at
room<00:02:35.310> temperature<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.720> kind<00:02:36.959> of<00:02:36.989> have

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
room temperature and so you kind of have

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.960 
room temperature and so you kind of have
to<00:02:37.230> do<00:02:37.410> your<00:02:37.590> spoon<00:02:37.860> in<00:02:38.069> there<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.580> get<00:02:38.880> this

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
to do your spoon in there and get this

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.850 
to do your spoon in there and get this
lump<00:02:39.330> out<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.810> then<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:39.959> mount<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.290> down<00:02:40.470> and

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
lump out and then you mount it down and

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.160 
lump out and then you mount it down and
it's<00:02:41.370> just<00:02:41.580> really<00:02:41.880> unmotivated<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.660> use<00:02:42.930> it

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
it's just really unmotivated to use it

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.530 
it's just really unmotivated to use it
so<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.370> keeps<00:02:44.670> its<00:02:44.910> kind<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.180> creamy

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
so this is keeps its kind of creamy

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.630 
so this is keeps its kind of creamy
consistency<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.410> it's<00:02:46.530> just<00:02:46.709> so<00:02:47.010> easy<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.370> use

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
consistency and it's just so easy to use
