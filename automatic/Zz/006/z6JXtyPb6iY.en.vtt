00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
the clocks and one one choice is just to

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.380 
the clocks and one one choice is just to
switch<00:02:09.820> out<00:02:10.030> this<00:02:11.190> set<00:02:12.190> of<00:02:12.310> lenses<00:02:12.519> on<00:02:13.030> this

clock<00:02:13.769> with<00:02:14.769> my<00:02:15.220> other<00:02:15.970> GT<00:02:16.420> 250<00:02:17.019> a<00:02:17.070> which<00:02:18.070> is

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
clock with my other GT 250 a which is

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.020 
clock with my other GT 250 a which is
older<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:18.670> not<00:02:19.570> older<00:02:19.900> but<00:02:20.109> not<00:02:21.010> as<00:02:21.609> in<00:02:21.820> good

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
older and not older but not as in good

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.039 
older and not older but not as in good
conditions<00:02:22.769> but<00:02:23.769> one<00:02:23.950> thing<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.310> does<00:02:24.519> have<00:02:25.049> is

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
conditions but one thing it does have is

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.430 
conditions but one thing it does have is
really<00:02:26.890> nice<00:02:27.100> lenses<00:02:27.760> for<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.120> clock<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.690> if<00:02:29.290> I

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
really nice lenses for the clock so if I

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.590 
really nice lenses for the clock so if I
can't<00:02:29.680> get<00:02:29.829> policy<00:02:30.489> other<00:02:30.640> cleanses<00:02:31.359> then

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
can't get policy other cleanses then

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.710 
can't get policy other cleanses then
I'll<00:02:31.750> be<00:02:31.959> taking<00:02:32.709> these<00:02:33.160> lenses<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.420> putting

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
250 is not as in nice as nice conditions

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.259 
250 is not as in nice as nice conditions
it<00:02:43.660> does<00:02:43.900> have<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.680> little<00:02:45.370> bit<00:02:45.489> of<00:02:45.640> denting<00:02:46.090> in

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
the gas tank let's see where is it over

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.819 
the gas tank let's see where is it over
here<00:02:50.079> put<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:50.950> dent<00:02:51.190> in<00:02:51.340> there<00:02:55.260> mufflers<00:02:56.260> are<00:02:56.530> I

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
was thinking about restoring it and in

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.360 
was thinking about restoring it and in
the<00:04:00.989> meantime<00:04:01.079> I<00:04:01.379> bought<00:04:01.680> this<00:04:01.950> this<00:04:04.370> can

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370

they've<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.670> word<00:04:06.049> reproduction<00:04:07.310> seat<00:04:08.310> from

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.199 
they've the word reproduction seat from
Thailand<00:04:09.269> but<00:04:12.920> anyway<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.519> reason<00:04:14.549> I<00:04:14.940> showed

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
Thailand but anyway the reason I showed

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.810 
Thailand but anyway the reason I showed
this<00:04:15.450> GT<00:04:16.229> 250<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:16.829> because<00:04:17.100> it<00:04:17.280> has<00:04:17.459> really

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
this GT 250 is because it has really

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.360 
this GT 250 is because it has really
nice<00:04:18.079> lenses<00:04:19.079> on<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.289> clocks<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:22.370> I'll

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
nice lenses on the clocks and I'll

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.760 
nice lenses on the clocks and I'll
probably<00:04:23.789> taking<00:04:24.419> these<00:04:24.630> lenses<00:04:25.050> over<00:04:25.410> to<00:04:25.590> the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
probably taking these lenses over to the

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.790 
probably taking these lenses over to the
other<00:04:26.660> GT<00:04:28.340> 250<00:04:29.340> which<00:04:29.639> is<00:04:29.789> this<00:04:29.940> one<00:04:30.680> is<00:04:31.680> it

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
other GT 250 which is this one is it

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.770 
other GT 250 which is this one is it
very<00:04:32.160> nice<00:04:33.530> and<00:04:34.530> hopefully<00:04:35.190> that<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.180> replace

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
very nice and hopefully that you replace

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.110 
very nice and hopefully that you replace
those<00:04:37.110> lenses<00:04:37.470> if<00:04:38.010> I<00:04:38.190> can't<00:04:38.460> get<00:04:38.639> those<00:04:38.820> lenses

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
those lenses if I can't get those lenses

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.839 
those lenses if I can't get those lenses
polished<00:04:39.780> and<00:04:39.960> looking<00:04:40.260> nice<00:04:40.470> so<00:04:43.639> my<00:04:44.639> next

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
polished and looking nice so my next

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.650 
polished and looking nice so my next
step<00:04:45.000> is<00:04:45.389> to<00:04:45.720> finish<00:04:46.470> rebuilding<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:47.190> carbs

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
step is to finish rebuilding the carbs

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.129 
step is to finish rebuilding the carbs
put<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:48.720> gas<00:04:48.900> tank<00:04:49.199> on<00:04:49.580> start<00:04:50.580> it<00:04:50.729> up<00:04:50.990> you<00:04:51.990> get

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
put the gas tank on start it up you get

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.050 
put the gas tank on start it up you get
everything<00:04:52.410> synced<00:04:53.010> up<00:04:53.130> the<00:04:53.460> carburetors

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
everything synced up the carburetors
