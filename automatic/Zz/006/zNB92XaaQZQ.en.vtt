wasn't quite right for me one particular
problem<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.220> had<00:00:20.340> with<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.550> I'll<00:00:20.670> explain<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.090> a

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
problem I had with it I'll explain in a

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.570 
problem I had with it I'll explain in a
few<00:00:21.300> seconds<00:00:21.660> there<00:00:22.220> so<00:00:23.220> back<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
few seconds there so back to the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.490 
few seconds there so back to the
OtterBox<00:00:24.529> has<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:25.800> hard<00:00:26.960> outer<00:00:27.960> shell<00:00:28.109> that

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
OtterBox has this hard outer shell that

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.870 
OtterBox has this hard outer shell that
it<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.650> either<00:00:28.769> go<00:00:28.890> on<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.160> back<00:00:29.310> like<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> have

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
it can either go on the back like I have

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.270 
it can either go on the back like I have
it<00:00:30.000> now<00:00:30.439> or<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.130> snap<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.640> front<00:00:34.280> and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
it now or it can snap on the front and

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.639 
it now or it can snap on the front and
so<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.820> pretty<00:00:36.059> much<00:00:36.149> have<00:00:36.530> protection<00:00:37.530> all

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.780 

the<00:01:25.010> bag<00:01:25.190> has<00:01:25.430> this<00:01:25.640> neat<00:01:26.410> texture<00:01:27.410> to<00:01:27.620> it<00:01:27.650> and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.350 

then<00:01:31.790> of<00:01:31.940> course<00:01:31.970> with<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:33.260> base<00:01:34.360> inside

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
then of course with the base inside

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.810 
then of course with the base inside
there<00:01:35.810> is<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.050> ability<00:01:36.560> to<00:01:36.830> snap<00:01:37.070> this<00:01:37.340> up<00:01:37.400> and

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
there is the ability to snap this up and

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.130 
there is the ability to snap this up and
use<00:01:38.180> it<00:01:38.300> as<00:01:38.450> a<00:01:38.480> stand<00:01:39.470> up<00:01:39.680> base<00:01:39.980> for<00:01:40.510> the<00:01:41.510> unit

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
use it as a stand up base for the unit

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.180 
use it as a stand up base for the unit
so<00:01:42.440> this<00:01:43.250> is<00:01:43.430> kind<00:01:43.700> of<00:01:43.790> hard<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.830> open<00:01:45.830> you<00:01:45.920> feel

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
so this is kind of hard to open you feel

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.080 
so this is kind of hard to open you feel
like<00:01:46.280> you're<00:01:46.370> gonna<00:01:46.490> break<00:01:46.730> it

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
there's little spots right here where it

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
there's little spots right here where it
catches<00:01:50.510> if<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.290> grab<00:01:51.470> it<00:01:51.590> here<00:01:51.740> just<00:01:53.320> really

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:31.410 
overall this thing feels pretty rugged
and<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:19.730> really<00:02:20.360> like<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:28.959> it<00:02:29.959> comes<00:02:30.290> with<00:02:30.410> a

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
and I really like it and it comes with a

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.150 
and I really like it and it comes with a
plastic<00:02:32.420> screen<00:02:33.110> protector<00:02:33.170> that's<00:02:33.739> glued

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
plastic screen protector that's glued

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.720 
plastic screen protector that's glued
into<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.520> inside<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.030> this<00:02:35.690> hard<00:02:35.989> inner<00:02:36.730> shell

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
into the inside of this hard inner shell

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.140 
into the inside of this hard inner shell
and<00:02:38.350> I<00:02:39.350> ended<00:02:39.620> up<00:02:39.709> actually<00:02:40.130> yanking<00:02:40.790> that<00:02:40.820> out

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
and I ended up actually yanking that out

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.229 
and I ended up actually yanking that out
because<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.170> had<00:02:42.500> recently<00:02:42.890> put<00:02:43.160> a<00:02:43.400> zag

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.780 
because I had recently put a zag
invisible<00:02:44.840> shield<00:02:45.080> on<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:46.070> surface<00:02:46.580> of<00:02:46.700> the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
invisible shield on the surface of the

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.699 
invisible shield on the surface of the
screen<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.090> protect<00:02:47.209> it<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:48.200> two<00:02:48.410> of<00:02:48.560> those

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
screen to protect it the two of those

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.400 
screen to protect it the two of those
things<00:02:49.010> together<00:02:49.780> or<00:02:50.780> they<00:02:51.080> weren't<00:02:51.230> really

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
things together or they weren't really

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.199 
things together or they weren't really
worked<00:02:51.650> out<00:02:51.770> so<00:02:52.010> well<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.400> I<00:02:52.670> like<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:52.970> zag

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
worked out so well and I like the zag

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.610 
worked out so well and I like the zag
better<00:02:53.510> than<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.780> like<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.019> screen<00:02:54.530> protector

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
better than I like the screen protector

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.470 
better than I like the screen protector
they<00:02:54.920> would<00:02:55.040> go<00:02:55.130> in<00:02:55.310> so<00:02:55.580> I<00:02:55.610> simply<00:02:55.850> had<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.300> out

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
they would go in so I simply had it out

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.600 
they would go in so I simply had it out
if<00:02:57.380> I<00:02:57.530> didn't<00:02:57.739> have<00:02:57.830> this<00:02:57.950> agon<00:02:58.340> though<00:02:58.519> it

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
if I didn't have this agon though it

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.790 
if I didn't have this agon though it
would<00:02:58.700> probably<00:02:58.820> work<00:02:59.030> just<00:02:59.239> fine<00:02:59.650> one<00:03:00.650> thing

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
would probably work just fine one thing

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.650 
would probably work just fine one thing
that<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:00.980> really<00:03:01.190> like<00:03:01.340> about<00:03:01.370> this<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.420> it<00:03:02.570> was

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
that I really like about this and it was

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.120 
that I really like about this and it was
my<00:03:02.780> problem<00:03:03.050> with<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.200> other<00:03:03.350> one<00:03:03.560> was<00:03:04.010> that

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
my problem with the other one was that

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.710 
my problem with the other one was that
the<00:03:04.280> bottom<00:03:04.670> of<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.030> other<00:03:05.150> one<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.690> other

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
the bottom of the other one the other

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.790 
the bottom of the other one the other
case<00:03:06.790> came<00:03:07.790> up<00:03:07.940> too<00:03:08.150> high<00:03:08.390> over<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.470> buttons

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
case came up too high over the buttons

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.600 
case came up too high over the buttons
it<00:03:10.580> made<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.820> hard<00:03:10.970> to<00:03:11.000> press<00:03:11.800> them<00:03:12.800> you<00:03:13.459> kind

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
it made it hard to press them you kind

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.130 
it made it hard to press them you kind
of<00:03:13.730> had<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:13.880> really<00:03:14.209> sometimes<00:03:14.570> even<00:03:14.900> have<00:03:15.019> to

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
of had to really sometimes even have to

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.479 
of had to really sometimes even have to
pull<00:03:15.380> down<00:03:15.590> on<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.980> in<00:03:16.070> order<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:16.280> get<00:03:16.430> the

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
pull down on it in order to get the

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.520 
pull down on it in order to get the
buttons<00:03:16.760> this<00:03:16.970> leaves<00:03:17.209> a<00:03:17.300> nice<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:17.720> open<00:03:17.930> it's

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
buttons this leaves a nice and open it's

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.040 
buttons this leaves a nice and open it's
very<00:03:18.590> easy<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.190> hit<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.400> buttons<00:03:20.050> there's

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
very easy to hit the buttons there's

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.360 
very easy to hit the buttons there's
nothing<00:03:21.380> blocking<00:03:21.530> it

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
nothing blocking it

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.610 
nothing blocking it
it<00:03:22.700> just<00:03:22.910> has<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.060> bit<00:03:23.269> of<00:03:23.360> a<00:03:23.420> lip<00:03:23.630> there<00:03:24.019> that

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
it just has a bit of a lip there that

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.590 
it just has a bit of a lip there that
protects<00:03:25.010> everything<00:03:25.550> but<00:03:26.269> it<00:03:26.360> doesn't

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
protects everything but it doesn't

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.699 
protects everything but it doesn't
actually<00:03:26.660> block<00:03:27.050> you<00:03:27.200> from<00:03:27.260> hitting<00:03:27.500> the

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
actually block you from hitting the

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.120 
actually block you from hitting the
buttons<00:03:29.110> so

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
buttons so

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.710 
buttons so
