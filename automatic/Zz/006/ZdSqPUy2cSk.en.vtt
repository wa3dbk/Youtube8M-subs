00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.930
 it is about a donation clear I know 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.330
 Not 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.399
 most i think will be scanners 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.460
 so so 50 50 I'm not quite 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.820

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.930
 Donate clinic know 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.710
 I just wanted it for a short time 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:48.210
 Imagine because he is with us 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.879
 actually before my quest I believe 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.460
 this whole girlfriend is not here 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:59.129
 you need yes to finish it 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:00.899
 25,000 donated troops and there for 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.910
 It's a good tip indeed 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.549
 donate plans or even if you are 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.439
 quickly level up volt and two I am 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.030
 now in the clear path gtf that one 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.320
 actually in English bracket here 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.450
 are also a few German in it 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.150
 example here is finally mention 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:28.829
 once the and 04 and somewhere still 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:34.350
 alex left the club and although I am 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.930
 now here since last night and you 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.600
 For example, you can see how fast here 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.070
 So now the message was before ten 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.200
 minutes below communes has new people 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.090
 rows leave and can 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.470
 actually very good, because here 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.820
 all the time people come in you can 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.340
 donate 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.990
 Get out of there before you go in all the time 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.990
 other throat velvet and just the whole 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.180
 time only giants donate that I will 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.490
 me a little anti-social 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.850
 So here are also sometimes as a 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.070
 old klammen have come at niklas 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.350
 just did not say come in 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.209
 donate more then donate and again 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.110
 gone out there have the fuck 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.870
 have played 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.160
 I somehow locked archery 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.030
 but something like that quickly 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.770
 For example, and therefore find 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.590
 I'm good if it donate 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.380
 there are plans, for example 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.840
 salt rule that people from level 80 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.000
 plus may stay and if small 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.950
 oldest so you see we are at the moment 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.620
 quite a lot and only they are allowed too 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.900
 donate 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.910
 and then people come in to ask 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.360
 and go out again and then I have 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.120
 for example, a small saying and 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.410
 though then and crossley free speech in the 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.110
 trend - on the late late load station 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.400
 that is something like comes in asks 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.620
 to leave is another 20 minutes 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.980
 and 22 minutes you can go back 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.290
 ask and you must not do anything 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.380
 So donate those you love 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:15.890
 So income below level 80 stop 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.890
 and jack delete means he is all 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.650
 One thing you still know 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.650
 all still go 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:30.360
 you all know the team right now 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:32.880

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.450
 Eat a heavy donation clan has me 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:41.880

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.920

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.299

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.280
