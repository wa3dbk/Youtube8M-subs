00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
stuff i reviewed alone x unboxing

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.059 
stuff i reviewed alone x unboxing
yesterday<00:02:47.269> it<00:02:47.480> uses<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.780> same<00:02:48.170> exact<00:02:48.530> wiring

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
yesterday it uses the same exact wiring

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.440 
yesterday it uses the same exact wiring
as<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.549> low<00:02:49.700> next<00:02:49.970> one<00:02:50.120> does<00:02:52.000> low<00:02:53.000> necks<00:02:53.299> are

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
as the low next one does low necks are

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.080 
as the low next one does low necks are
you<00:02:53.569> stealing<00:02:53.870> ICS<00:02:54.500> wiring<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.190> it<00:02:55.790> has<00:02:55.879> this

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
you stealing ICS wiring and it has this

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.550 
you stealing ICS wiring and it has this
i'm<00:02:56.299> not<00:02:56.390> exactly<00:02:56.690> sure<00:02:56.900> what<00:02:57.140> it<00:02:57.170> does<00:02:57.349> and

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
i'm not exactly sure what it does and

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.110 
i'm not exactly sure what it does and
pretty<00:02:57.739> sure<00:02:57.890> it's<00:02:58.040> just<00:02:58.069> a<00:02:58.280> fuse<00:02:58.579> or<00:02:58.610> self

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
pretty sure it's just a fuse or self

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.770 
pretty sure it's just a fuse or self
resetting<00:02:59.569> fuse<00:02:59.840> hopefully<00:03:00.760> or<00:03:01.760> just<00:03:02.569> regular

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
resetting fuse hopefully or just regular

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.180 
resetting fuse hopefully or just regular
fuse<00:03:03.319> i<00:03:03.650> guess<00:03:04.489> i<00:03:04.760> really<00:03:05.299> don't<00:03:05.569> know<00:03:05.690> and

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
fuse i guess i really don't know and

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.940 
fuse i guess i really don't know and
this<00:03:07.190> is<00:03:07.370> going<00:03:07.579> to<00:03:07.730> turn<00:03:07.910> into<00:03:07.970> a<00:03:08.239> nice<00:03:08.950> Dean's

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
this is going to turn into a nice Dean's

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.720 
this is going to turn into a nice Dean's
connector<00:03:10.640> sometime<00:03:11.150> soon<00:03:11.829> as<00:03:12.829> in<00:03:12.859> like<00:03:13.310> five

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
connector sometime soon as in like five

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.199 
connector sometime soon as in like five
minutes<00:03:15.010> so<00:03:16.010> i'll<00:03:16.100> put<00:03:16.280> Dean's<00:03:16.489> on<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:16.850> i<00:03:17.000> can

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
minutes so i'll put Dean's on it i can

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.759 
minutes so i'll put Dean's on it i can
just<00:03:17.359> drive<00:03:17.630> fire<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:18.019> a<00:03:18.079> couple<00:03:18.200> times<00:03:18.350> just

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
just drive fire it a couple times just

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.470 
just drive fire it a couple times just
see<00:03:19.069> how<00:03:19.130> it<00:03:19.310> is<00:03:22.239> construction<00:03:23.239> on<00:03:23.299> it's

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
see how it is construction on it's

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.360 
see how it is construction on it's

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
conclusions on the gun before I fire it

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.360

for<00:04:59.870> the<00:04:59.990> externals<00:05:00.530> is<00:05:00.880> um<00:05:01.880> I<00:05:03.250> won't<00:05:04.250> say

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
for the externals is um I won't say

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.659 
for the externals is um I won't say

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
surprised but I I expected this from ICS

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.129 
surprised but I I expected this from ICS
they're<00:05:11.000> a<00:05:11.030> good<00:05:11.240> manufacturer<00:05:11.930> they're

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
they're a good manufacturer they're

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.909 
they're a good manufacturer they're
probably<00:05:12.289> the<00:05:12.470> most<00:05:12.970> underestimated

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
probably the most underestimated

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.230 
probably the most underestimated
manufacturer<00:05:15.919> not<00:05:16.160> many<00:05:16.340> people<00:05:16.669> recommend

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
manufacturer not many people recommend

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.430 
manufacturer not many people recommend
them<00:05:17.449> but<00:05:18.349> they<00:05:18.530> do<00:05:18.590> make<00:05:18.740> great<00:05:19.370> stock<00:05:19.759> guns

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
them but they do make great stock guns

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.930 
them but they do make great stock guns
this<00:05:21.440> gun<00:05:21.680> I<00:05:21.919> believe<00:05:22.220> does<00:05:22.460> not<00:05:22.639> have<00:05:22.820> the

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
this gun I believe does not have the

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.770 
this gun I believe does not have the
split<00:05:23.210> gearbox<00:05:23.660> design<00:05:25.150> like<00:05:26.150> their<00:05:26.330> amphoras

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
split gearbox design like their amphoras

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.580 
split gearbox design like their amphoras
do<00:05:26.990> so<00:05:27.669> it<00:05:28.669> should<00:05:29.599> be<00:05:29.630> about<00:05:29.900> the<00:05:30.169> same<00:05:30.349> size

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
do so it should be about the same size

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.560 
do so it should be about the same size
as<00:05:30.860> a<00:05:30.889> regular<00:05:31.340> version<00:05:31.580> 2<00:05:31.849> gearbox<00:05:32.270> because

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
as a regular version 2 gearbox because

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.029 
as a regular version 2 gearbox because
they're<00:05:32.690> split<00:05:32.990> ones<00:05:33.169> are<00:05:33.320> slightly<00:05:33.650> thicker

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
they're split ones are slightly thicker

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.879 
they're split ones are slightly thicker
I'm<00:05:34.310> not<00:05:34.520> sure<00:05:34.580> if<00:05:34.760> this<00:05:34.880> one's<00:05:35.090> thicker<00:05:35.330> but

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
I'm not sure if this one's thicker but

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.899 
I'm not sure if this one's thicker but
you<00:05:36.889> know<00:05:37.039> doesn't<00:05:37.490> really<00:05:37.610> matter<00:05:39.250> you<00:05:40.250> can

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:40.909 
you know doesn't really matter you can

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:44.320 
you know doesn't really matter you can
take<00:05:41.090> it<00:05:41.180> apart<00:05:41.949> but<00:05:42.949> you<00:05:43.370> take<00:05:43.610> this<00:05:44.000> out

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
take it apart but you take this out

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.969 
take it apart but you take this out
there's<00:05:44.990> a<00:05:45.050> screw<00:05:45.260> on<00:05:45.320> the<00:05:45.409> other<00:05:45.560> side<00:05:45.770> and

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
there's a screw on the other side and

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:47.830 
there's a screw on the other side and
you<00:05:46.039> take<00:05:46.220> that<00:05:46.370> out<00:05:46.580> slides<00:05:47.270> off<00:05:47.510> just<00:05:47.810> a

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
you take that out slides off just a

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.170 
you take that out slides off just a
little<00:05:47.870> to<00:05:48.110> me<00:05:48.229> a<00:05:48.260> connector<00:05:48.680> there<00:05:48.889> you<00:05:49.280> just

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
little to me a connector there you just

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.370 
little to me a connector there you just
leave<00:05:50.479> it<00:05:50.630> there<00:05:50.659> so<00:05:50.930> I<00:05:50.960> can<00:05:51.080> take<00:05:51.169> it<00:05:51.229> apart

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
leave it there so I can take it apart

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.510 
leave it there so I can take it apart
though<00:05:52.060> and<00:05:53.060> you<00:05:53.960> and<00:05:54.500> then<00:05:54.620> this<00:05:54.770> whole<00:05:55.250> thing

though and you and then this whole thing
slides<00:05:55.820> off<00:05:56.090> and<00:05:56.479> then<00:05:56.870> you<00:05:57.080> take<00:05:57.320> out<00:05:57.500> a<00:05:57.530> screw

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
slides off and then you take out a screw

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.620 
slides off and then you take out a screw
on<00:05:57.889> the<00:05:58.010> bottom<00:05:58.070> of<00:05:58.550> the<00:05:58.760> grip<00:05:59.240> here<00:05:59.449> and
