00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.850

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.519
 fifth game day and the first game 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.469
 from Germany to Portugal today 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.480
 Do not miss 18h 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.849
 the second game will be against Iran 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.690
 Nigeria and the third game Ghana versus 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.789
 the USA 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.439
 We want to see what we want 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.470
 you type in these games and before 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.519
 everything at the germany game portugal 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.740
 heavy opponent 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.869
 But let's see what Germany is like 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.900
 can do it today against it 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.020
 the timer is started and wilma goes 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.129
 consciously in the direction of germany 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.930
 self-assured as never before and there 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.090
 the first goal in the eleventh minute for 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.450
 Germany not bad 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.280
 where will hope that it is true what 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.320
 she turns now she looks 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.500
 a bit over, but now she is waiting 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.859
 but here the moment 25 minutes played them 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.449
 looked in the direction of her cabin looks 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.940
 Maybe her face on something like that 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.610
 nice with pixel art was made by 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.000
 me 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.159
 35 minutes played 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.130
 what does she do it like frozen 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.960
 it just stands there and they stand 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.820
 she really stands there until she dies 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.880
 I just look a little bit closer to the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.240
 screen they pretty much dead from it 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.799
 no piece moves 50 minutes the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.689
 always determined but now it moves 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.299
 look around a bit and 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.460
 looks towards portugal and again 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.600
 Cabin and damn it I 've got 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.880
 facebook does not matter Sorry 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.610
 She walks in the direction of the cabin for 68 minutes 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:50.220
 played 70 now she goes in the direction 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:53.360
 portugal now and in the 75 minute of 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:59.040
 equalization of portugal 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:02.700
 wilmaa com already right direction and 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.560
 the 2 2 1 185 two to one for 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.840
 Germany is supposed to run out of play 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.190
 says wilma just write it down 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.060
 and then we'll see you soon 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.010
 next game 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.250
 and now the next game is on 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.459
 row iran against nigeria let's see how 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.459
 it goes out 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:28.060
 there we have wilma she will be back 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.110
 See what she does today five minutes 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.569
 she still does not play 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.750
 rosy not as optimistic as before 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:41.220
 did not go to work so fast 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.780
 Let's see what you are doing in this game 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.370
 by the way, she has the first two 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.180
 not so bad later 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.980
 isolated 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.019
 I can not say that with the others 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.450
 because I'm on the third day of play 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.130
 everything here I take a week 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.380
 I'm away in Berlin with the Germans 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.130
 that's why in the 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.250
 to take in advance just takes 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.120
 all this for a while 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.130
 take 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.090
 After that change borders will always take 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.130
 really long, so one hour per video 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.760
 at least and then upload 20 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.670
 minutes and must cut together 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.340
 I also with the ball 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.170
 animations and stuff like that 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.260
 So yes she goes nigeria direction 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:34.299
 yes , it is true if the 58 minute 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:36.370
 the 1 0 from the nigerian point of view is there 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.470
 is the right name for me 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.049
 Not 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.810
 out of sight of nigeria but now goes 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.459
 you in the direction of Iran 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.600
 and Hassli remains shortly before standing 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:51.579
 considers it yourself again maybe 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.269
 but no gate for Iran 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:57.299
 but now the compensation in the 83 but 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.579
 She is already going back to Nigeria 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:04.630
 But she stops and the time is 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:08.440
 past 5 11 iran against nigeria 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.440
 ok until the next game until and 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.799
 the last one is playing this game day 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.070
 tread ghana against the usa 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.019
 and we start directly directly 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.900
 started 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:26.080
 wilma what do you say 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:29.130
 I am very curious how the clock like 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.130
 the us will play 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:39.670
 not much is happening here yet 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:41.710
 15 minutes played and wilma the turns 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.530
 But now she goes out and sees 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.900
 so than would go direction usa 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.570
 want to stay there but maybe stand 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.730
 but maybe not yet we will let us 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.230
 still a bit fidget that a third 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.830
 the game is played 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:05:00.280
 now , however, it is heading towards usa 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.800
 the flow and there is the 1 0 in the 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.770
 38 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.400
 in the 38, the USA shoots the 1 0 against 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.050
 Ghana 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.100
 I was actually stronger 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.930
 rated as the usa but there can 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.780
 can also change something ghana yes 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.720
 also enter the victory is also 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:23.320
 possible 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:26.890
 Played 55 minutes what makes wilma film 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:33.610
 but apparently only stay with the usa 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:37.300
 yet one-third of the game in front of us to 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:40.270
 21 minutes and wemmer turns around 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.330
 Considered and considered, she still gets the 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:46.120
 compensation or image can be at 0 2 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.490
 1 result this is the big question 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:52.630
 Is she going in the direction of mesic? 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:55.030
 played back 85 minutes 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:59.760
 okay it got pretty boring 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:02.170
 partie 0 to 1 the victory for the usa 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.960
 Thank you for seeing it 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.720
