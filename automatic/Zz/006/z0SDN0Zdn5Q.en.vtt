00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.410
 I'm allowed here with three buden fischer the 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:27.980
 one is at 1120 and the other at 650 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.410
 and the last one I had really considered 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.719
 but the bottle is extremely flat 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.290
 or more so on four meters well the location 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:43.140
 to three meters 20 so three meters twenty 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:48.690
 nothing at all the water temperature 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:52.920
 is it about now at 78, the fish 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.489
 look better they are totally massive 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.739
 totally fat well nourished yes healthy healthy 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:04.439
 fish the angel pressure here is normal 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.600
 well there are already at the same since 78 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.600
 years continuously all here 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:59.200
 I have been here before in autumn 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:01.780
 and I even had 11 to 20 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.630
 on 15 meters times tried so the 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.650
 the colleague of mine said 15 meters 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.060
 they do not seem to have 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:15.459
 I trusted that and now I understand that 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:16.060
 somehow we do not have middle now 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.810
 December 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.830
 today it was 14 degrees air temperature 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.870
 and I have it all so now 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.660
 that I come out today 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.760
 One night for me now 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.000
 I've been here last week 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.830
 for about six hours had two 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.090
 Unfortunately, only one fish is available 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.400
 lay the mat and then another 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.400
 really nice really nice fish 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:44.970
 now, of course, the one route is the 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.970
 is now at 15 6 15 7 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.390
 information here from the colleague has 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.010
 so no one is still too deep for me 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.860
 Just want to try it too 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:03.380
 consciously demonstrated the night is over 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.110
 I had around 1 o'clock on the left 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.160
 router or left that is without the 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:14.750
 in the flat lies about eleven meters had 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:17.870
 I am a process there I am in the bread and 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.430
 I rowed out of it 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.870
 I actually noticed something there 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.880
 what there really is no wind here 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:28.459
 we have extreme southwest wind 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.750
 I've got 20 minutes to go 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.049
 minutes until I am even on 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.340
 table was so imaginary 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:39.650
 from here comes the wind 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:41.060
 southwest wind here is the fish and me 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.019
 Put me down and the boat always has 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.090
 so aborted 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.079
 then i have the route between the 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.720
 taken legs 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.239
 Here is the fish and that's where I'm from 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.590
 rum and have existed so three left 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.510
 because in the Frankish it is already 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.579
 a problem he can not do if 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.889
 now here is the fish and there comes 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.709
 the wind and you are here and want to 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:03.739
 The fish does not try it 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.630
 always for the winter now and let yourself from 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.639
 drive and thus conquer church 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.709
 come by 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.359
 it did not work out so well 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.150
 if I had an electric motor now 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.680
 second or second best 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.260
 It was also good that I was one 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:26.870
 dinghy had because with the 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:28.880
 small 230 plastic bot logo cut so 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.419
 the wind was already extreme 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.820
 So the balls were certainly good half 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.039
 meter high is then turned bright 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.450
 blow on every half hour is 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.560
 then the rude expired i got there 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.190
 put a lot of fish on the mat 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.470
 yes, the layers so I say 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:51.230
 now between 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.230
 five and ten kilo 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.320
 the wind has become more extreme 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.669
 probably rain soon too 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.669
 I would do half an hour now 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:14.090
 what was very pleasing 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:16.030
 phoned as always then that is 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:20.570
 left ran out that's the 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:24.110
 shallow or beautiful spittler i say 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:27.320
 time of 45 kilo dynamic route 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:30.220
 Done the wind again 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:34.580
 has now eased a bit again 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.470
 I am on land the laptop made 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.080
 I looked at the internet when 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.810
 maybe 80 ps once every minute 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.199
 indicator with three beepers reported the 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:51.520
 whole rights the right ones I think 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:56.210
 totally great that is the 15.7 15 8 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.860
 that is very slow then 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:02.000
 expired I went out 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.169
 contact ok I have to say 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.169
 that was really fun for me now 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:08.570
 because I also fish very rarely as 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.760
 Such a deep well in the winter even more 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.800
 then the fish came up so really 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:17.300
 a picture- pretty mirror is larger 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:19.669
 absolutely no matter now I 've already noticed 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.639
 it was already excited, though 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:24.110
 adrenaline can be a mistake every time 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.800
 Especially when he is in one 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:31.220
 Baggersee since that is now one 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:34.520
 Baggersee has a maximum team of 22 23 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.159
 meters as it works whether sitting 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.509
 I did not know that by accident 

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:40.509
 luck also has that vista yes 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:48.550
 yes that was the last time for 2014 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.540
 dario you do not do anything here now 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.890
 a bit more relaxed 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.650
 but we have now on the 

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:56.290
 weather report looked 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:58.510
 it should be tomorrow to minus eight in part 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:02.550
 a certain region to minus twelve degrees 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:05.980
 the water is still with us now 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.760
 72 is still possible in any case 

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.920
 to catch fish 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.980
 and now have an air temperature of 

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.540
 say seven eight degrees 

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:17.140
 So that fits when the fish on the 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.150
 Matt lies and you care for him that is 

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:22.260
 no problem now should stop if it 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:25.240
 the air temperature gets extremely cold 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:27.490
 is already in extreme minus degrees and that 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:32.140
 then maybe water has two and a half 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:34.450
 three and a half or four degrees then you have to 

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:38.140
 Just watch out a bit like what 

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:40.120
 But for us, this is the first one 

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.680
 Season ends then we go in 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.590
 january / february look but 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:48.690
 we have a few new ones to improve 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:48.690
 Right now in France in Alsace
