00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
icons it's going to look more cluttered

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.500 
icons it's going to look more cluttered
and<00:04:45.540> it's<00:04:45.960> going<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.140> be<00:04:46.520> too<00:04:47.520> confusing<00:04:47.729> some

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
and it's going to be too confusing some

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.020 
and it's going to be too confusing some
of<00:04:48.630> them<00:04:48.720> might<00:04:48.870> be<00:04:49.490> sticking<00:04:50.490> off<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.760> screen

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
of them might be sticking off the screen

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.030 
of them might be sticking off the screen
so<00:04:51.300> if<00:04:51.660> you<00:04:51.870> have<00:04:51.960> a<00:04:51.990> lot<00:04:52.169> of<00:04:52.260> icons<00:04:52.590> go<00:04:52.890> with<00:04:52.979> a

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
so if you have a lot of icons go with a

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.850 
so if you have a lot of icons go with a
smaller<00:04:53.280> size<00:04:53.580> and<00:04:53.820> you<00:04:54.690> and<00:04:54.930> it<00:04:55.320> looks<00:04:55.350> nicer

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
smaller size and you and it looks nicer

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.170 
smaller size and you and it looks nicer
if<00:04:55.919> it's<00:04:56.070> a<00:04:56.130> little<00:04:56.310> bit<00:04:56.400> smaller<00:04:56.640> too<00:04:56.910> and

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
if it's a little bit smaller too and

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.450 
if it's a little bit smaller too and
then<00:04:57.660> you<00:04:57.750> can<00:04:57.870> increase<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.380> zoom<00:04:58.620> so<00:04:59.400> I

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
then you can increase the zoom so I

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.710 
then you can increase the zoom so I
could<00:04:59.610> like<00:04:59.729> make<00:04:59.910> it<00:05:00.030> a<00:05:00.090> really<00:05:00.210> small<00:05:00.479> size

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
could like make it a really small size

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.450 
could like make it a really small size
and<00:05:00.780> I<00:05:01.169> could<00:05:01.380> make<00:05:01.530> my<00:05:01.680> zoom<00:05:02.010> um

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.320 

maximum<00:05:05.870> 128<00:05:06.870> and<00:05:07.400> zoom<00:05:08.400> with<00:05:08.640> you<00:05:09.030> could<00:05:09.180> play

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
maximum 128 and zoom with you could play

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.690 
maximum 128 and zoom with you could play
around<00:05:09.539> with<00:05:09.750> that<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:10.169> then<00:05:10.979> want<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.550> do

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
around with that and then want to do

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.340 
around with that and then want to do
that<00:05:11.880> you<00:05:12.030> can<00:05:12.180> go<00:05:12.390> into<00:05:14.030> um<00:05:15.030> general<00:05:15.930> and<00:05:16.140> you

that you can go into um general and you

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.190 
that you can go into um general and you

on how to do that and then go to
Internet<00:06:30.270> explorer<00:06:30.630> and<00:06:30.900> usually<00:06:31.710> this<00:06:31.860> one

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
Internet explorer and usually this one

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:33.920 
Internet explorer and usually this one
you<00:06:32.310> might<00:06:32.490> have<00:06:32.639> trouble<00:06:32.819> cutting<00:06:33.300> it<00:06:33.569> so

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
you might have trouble cutting it so

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.950 
you might have trouble cutting it so
delete<00:06:34.469> it<00:06:34.620> and<00:06:34.770> just<00:06:35.669> say<00:06:35.879> yes<00:06:36.180> and<00:06:36.449> that's

delete it and just say yes and that's

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.980 
delete it and just say yes and that's
how<00:06:37.110> it<00:06:37.379> usually<00:06:38.069> gets<00:06:38.129> rid<00:06:38.370> of<00:06:38.460> it<00:06:38.690> so<00:06:39.690> yeah
