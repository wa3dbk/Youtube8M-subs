00:00:09.983 --> 00:00:11.165
 Hello! 

00:00:11.213 --> 00:00:13.265
 We present you a dynamic team game 

00:00:13.406 --> 00:00:15.089
 from Blizzard Entertainment: 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.365
 Heroes of the Storm. 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.360
 Today we will talk about eSports. 

00:00:18.415 --> 00:00:21.365
 For teams playing at a high level 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.465
 it is important to first think about the composition, 

00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:26.165
 synergy of heroes. 

00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:28.865
 It is necessary to select the composition in such a way 

00:00:28.908 --> 00:00:30.765
 so that the characters complement and reinforce each other, 

00:00:30.812 --> 00:00:33.465
 and match the desired style of play. 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:36.966
 You can take more fighters to tie the battle. 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.065
 or assassins to clean unwary enemies. 

00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:44.666
 Support heroes direct the course of the battle, 

00:00:46.693 --> 00:00:50.266
 and experts wreak havoc throughout the map. 

00:00:51.248 --> 00:00:53.765
 Good knowledge of the current map - 

00:00:53.798 --> 00:00:56.766
 another factor in the selection of the team. 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.566
 The ultimate goal is always the same - 

00:00:58.603 --> 00:01:00.966
 destroy the enemy stronghold 

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.165
 but each battlefield has its own tasks 

00:01:03.197 --> 00:01:04.592
 influencing tactics 

00:01:04.718 --> 00:01:06.391
 to achieve victory. 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.466
 For example, 

00:01:07.746 --> 00:01:08.766
 in dragonland 

00:01:08.822 --> 00:01:11.466
 teams are divided to take two shrines 

00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:13.266
 and get a powerful knight-dragon. 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.134
 In the Cursed dell 

00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:19.266
 you need to stick together and fight for the gifts. 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.366
 Enlist the support of the Raven Lord, 

00:01:21.595 --> 00:01:24.066
 and the enemies will be forced to go on the defensive. 

00:01:24.723 --> 00:01:26.220
 However remember 

00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:27.965
 performance of tasks on the map - 

00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:29.466
 not the only way to win. 

00:01:29.517 --> 00:01:33.665
 Sometimes teams don't do tasks, 

00:01:33.697 --> 00:01:35.766
 to take advantage of something else. 

00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:38.166
 Not collecting gifts in the Cursed dell, 

00:01:38.204 --> 00:01:40.566
 can kill more warriors on the lines 

00:01:40.603 --> 00:01:42.966
 and get ahead of rivals in level. 

00:01:42.986 --> 00:01:45.665
 before the next big fight. 

00:01:45.697 --> 00:01:47.766
 Finally, professional teams 

00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:50.765
 Do not forget about less obvious aspects. 

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:53.866
 For example, about what talents the enemy chose, 

00:01:53.892 --> 00:01:56.265
 and what talents you can take in return. 

00:01:56.355 --> 00:02:00.165
 Talents increase and change abilities. 

00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:02.866
 Heroes study them as the game progresses. 

00:02:02.874 --> 00:02:05.867
 Suppose you play heroes 

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.666
 who break in at the beginning of the fight - 

00:02:07.697 --> 00:02:10.366
 Tyrael with "Condemnation" or Sonya with a jump. 

00:02:10.415 --> 00:02:13.666
 Both of these abilities allow you to fight 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.466
 and attack the weak target. 

00:02:16.222 --> 00:02:17.242
 therefore 

00:02:17.298 --> 00:02:20.866
 your Svetik can take the Emerald Wind, 

00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:23.274
 to drop the attackers 

00:02:23.306 --> 00:02:25.066
 and scatter them around. 

00:02:25.265 --> 00:02:28.666
 This will allow Svetik and the defending team 

00:02:28.697 --> 00:02:31.665
 turn the tide of battle in their favor 

00:02:31.712 --> 00:02:33.166
 leaving 5 against 2. 

00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:35.866
 Knowledge is power. 

00:02:35.915 --> 00:02:38.266
 An experienced team always collects information. 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.566
 about talents chosen by opponents 

00:02:41.603 --> 00:02:43.966
 and opposes his own. 

00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:46.066
 Serious players 

00:02:46.183 --> 00:02:50.265
 will find a lot of nuances in Heroes, 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.265
 one of the most important of which 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.265
 is communication within the team. 

00:02:56.306 --> 00:02:59.566
 Understanding what partners are doing now 

00:02:59.611 --> 00:03:02.265
 and coordination with them 

00:03:02.306 --> 00:03:04.665
 help to achieve goals on the map. 

00:03:04.712 --> 00:03:07.366
 This is a quality professional team. 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.366
 There is no "I" in Heroes of the Storm. 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.008
 Remember that you are part of a team 

00:03:13.111 --> 00:03:14.566
 and go to victory together. 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.242
 Good luck!
