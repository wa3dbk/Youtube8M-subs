this guy I think that he is an absolute
legend<00:02:55.959> should<00:02:56.410> get<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.590> legend<00:02:56.950> card<00:02:57.160> when<00:02:57.340> he

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
legend should get a legend card when he

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.100 
legend should get a legend card when he

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
really defensive but it's just the

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.920 
really defensive but it's just the
formation<00:03:24.280> that<00:03:24.430> I<00:03:24.519> went<00:03:24.700> with<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.510> want<00:03:25.870> to

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
formation that I went with and I want to

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.000

put<00:03:26.049> him<00:03:26.170> in<00:03:26.260> there<00:03:26.380> because<00:03:26.530> he's<00:03:26.739> just<00:03:26.920> a

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
put him in there because he's just a

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.740 
put him in there because he's just a
monster<00:03:27.190> so<00:03:27.850> we're<00:03:27.970> going<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.120> go<00:03:28.239> with<00:03:28.360> his<00:03:28.510> I

monster so we're going to go with his I

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.170

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
think is 96 Team of the Year from FIFA

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.479 
think is 96 Team of the Year from FIFA
12<00:03:31.540> just<00:03:32.110> absolutely<00:03:32.650> monstrous<00:03:33.130> I<00:03:33.340> think

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
12 just absolutely monstrous I think

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.340 
12 just absolutely monstrous I think
it's<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:33.670> best<00:03:33.850> card<00:03:34.180> that<00:03:34.330> he's<00:03:34.420> ever<00:03:34.570> had<00:03:34.750> 99

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
it's the best card that he's ever had 99

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.770 
it's the best card that he's ever had 99
dribbling<00:03:35.680> on<00:03:35.799> there<00:03:35.980> 97<00:03:36.730> passing<00:03:37.239> 85

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
shooting a teapot 80 pace really really

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.300 
shooting a teapot 80 pace really really
good<00:03:41.019> card<00:03:41.290> and<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:41.830> think<00:03:42.070> it's<00:03:42.190> better

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
good card and I think it's better

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.890 
good card and I think it's better
probably<00:03:42.700> than<00:03:42.760> his<00:03:43.060> card<00:03:43.299> from<00:03:43.480> this<00:03:43.660> year

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
probably than his card from this year

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.470 
probably than his card from this year
and<00:03:44.079> moving<00:03:44.980> into<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:45.280> defense<00:03:45.640> I<00:03:45.880> got<00:03:46.299> to<00:03:46.360> put

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
and moving into the defense I got to put

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.120 
and moving into the defense I got to put
this<00:03:46.570> guy<00:03:46.780> and<00:03:46.989> he's<00:03:47.079> an<00:03:47.200> absolute<00:03:47.560> legend<00:03:47.980> and

Felipe<00:04:49.490> Luis<00:04:49.849> I<00:04:50.090> believe<00:04:50.330> as<00:04:50.539> well<00:04:50.569> and<00:04:50.960> he<00:04:51.469> had

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
Felipe Luis I believe as well and he had

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.439 
Felipe Luis I believe as well and he had
a<00:04:51.590> team<00:04:51.860> of<00:04:51.889> the<00:04:52.009> season<00:04:52.159> last<00:04:52.639> year<00:04:52.819> that<00:04:53.419> I

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
a team of the season last year that I

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.920 
a team of the season last year that I
think<00:04:53.960> was<00:04:54.500> so<00:04:55.280> great<00:04:56.030> even<00:04:56.180> was<00:04:56.360> his<00:04:56.539> card<00:04:56.780> I'm

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
think was so great even was his card I'm

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.480 
think was so great even was his card I'm
trying<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.199> think<00:04:57.319> what<00:04:57.439> car<00:04:57.830> rating<00:04:58.069> his<00:04:58.280> cars

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
trying to think what car rating his cars

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.249 
trying to think what car rating his cars
worth<00:04:58.639> 87<00:04:59.330> rated<00:04:59.569> over<00:04:59.689> him<00:04:59.900> so<00:04:59.930> would've<00:05:00.169> been

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:00.259 
worth 87 rated over him so would've been

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.110 
worth 87 rated over him so would've been
slightly<00:05:00.500> higher<00:05:00.710> than<00:05:00.740> a<00:05:00.949> Vidal<00:05:01.250> and<00:05:01.460> but<00:05:02.090> I

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
slightly higher than a Vidal and but I

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.339 
slightly higher than a Vidal and but I
don't<00:05:02.360> think<00:05:02.479> overall<00:05:02.930> would<00:05:03.139> have<00:05:03.259> been

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:03.349 
don't think overall would have been

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:05.769 
don't think overall would have been
quite<00:05:03.680> as<00:05:03.919> good<00:05:04.159> and<00:05:04.370> but<00:05:05.029> the<00:05:05.120> guy<00:05:05.270> I<00:05:05.300> ended<00:05:05.689> up

00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:05.779 
quite as good and but the guy I ended up

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:07.719 
quite as good and but the guy I ended up
going<00:05:05.960> with<00:05:06.139> you<00:05:06.919> gotta<00:05:07.099> forgive<00:05:07.400> me<00:05:07.580> you
