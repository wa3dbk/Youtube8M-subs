00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 so hello dear friends with you 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.350
 again i am black hawk and today i am to you 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.150
 I'm not using another series of flysplay 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.820
 or our show that just started 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.030
 and with some podcasts that I say 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.300
 important things for everyone who regularly 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.920
 are watching and who loves my video friends here 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.070
 I am currently open 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.730
 open the main page of my channel i 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.400
 look 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.910
 views under the first series of the show first 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.130
 think 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.940
 three weeks have passed since the release 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.340
 this video was only 15 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.829
 thousand 800 84 views I say total 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.280
 just because compared with the rest 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.430
 video for example with the same yearsplay when 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.489
 filmed 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.030
 being in lspd then a huge 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.809
 Of course, here are views, for example, 37 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.670
 475 thousand views 36 249 thousand 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.699
 views and now compare with these 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.850
 video i can say that 15000 for 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.780
 my channel is very small i think you 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.910
 agree with me 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.420
 for example take a prize which will take part 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.760
 is a definite record holder on 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.549
 my channel she scored two and a half 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.189
 million views in one year it's 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.500
 wonderful indeed i'm about 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.720
 this video is very happy and went about 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.790
 first thought unfortunately I have not all 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.290
 suits friends so me 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.290
 probably this show 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.180
 suspend doing about what 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.340
 watching his people not so much 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.510
 how will the next part come out i 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.710
 I think of course there will be views 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.670
 gradually decrease so probably we 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.890
 stop besides 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.340
 here literally today wrote in skype 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.440
 one of the participants of our show is what he 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.260
 leaves samp-rp project here I am now 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.440
 bluntly opened his message he was banned 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.300
 for the report deleted his account so he 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.580
 will no longer play it was antonio 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.979
 marcus he will no longer play at all 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.290
 in samp and so I understand either the project 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.979
 samp-rp is a fact in general 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.800
 the fact that he leaves the show so one 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.690
 participant is no longer we can not to the second 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.520
 parts suddenly recruit new member but in 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.920
 Basically two main reasons why me 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.350
 you have to close this show to stop 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.020
 Next and flysley also need to say 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.200
 pretty sad news friends now 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.770
 you see what the video on the channel goes 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.739
 less and less I think that many of 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.570
 you are not happy with this friends therefore I 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.670
 you must admit that in samp i 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.200
 already practically I do not play, I went 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.180
 probably the last time could be a month 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.750
 back to samp for sure I already have a house there 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.989
 flew my friends so for me the most 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.180
 the main thing is that these fifty 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.530
 eight pieces and this is a huge amount 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.630
 fifty eight pieces read by 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.350
 half an hour count how much I've played 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.019
 but for fifty eight parts I already 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.080
 probably many future players samp-rp 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.209
 I learned a lot someone found his beloved 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.160
 the game let's say someone plays on samp-rp 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.590
 gets a lot of pleasure from it 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.300
 someone 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.910
 this many people enjoyed 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.220
 Watching my let's play and I think that 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.379
 my mission in this regard is accomplished 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.930
 I satisfied the interests of my viewers and 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:19.319
 many left happy so I 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.400
 It lets consider the fact that the play was a success 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.230
 big flysplay 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.060
 it was a big step in the development of the channel 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.150
 so I thank everyone who watched 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.430
 letplay and all who me all this time 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.019
 supported of course you know those who 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.209
 watched my channel yes can I already 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.400
 stopped letplay then started again 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.890
 but I tried to be something to change 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.730
 add something to the contrary to remove but 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:45.269
 Unfortunately, probably not enough of my actions 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.430
 to improve this content few of these 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.319
 action and when all successful therefore 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.250
 Friends probably letplay so far I, too 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:55.620
 I will have to freeze the reasons I tell you 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:00.120
 called and of course friends I have 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.760
 some thoughts on creating 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.319
 any internet resources in general 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.200
 friends until I get ahead 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.819
 we have an idea I along with my 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.290
 a team of great administrators 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:17.669
 Separately want to highlight Daniil would be new and
