to the other building it kind of get a
heads<00:04:08.180> up<00:04:08.360> into<00:04:08.660> a<00:04:08.690> them<00:04:09.560> coming<00:04:10.280> into<00:04:10.430> the

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
heads up into a them coming into the

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.130 
heads up into a them coming into the
base<00:04:10.700> and<00:04:11.060> figure<00:04:11.540> that<00:04:11.720> they're<00:04:11.840> going<00:04:11.959> to<00:04:12.019> go

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
base and figure that they're going to go

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.810 
base and figure that they're going to go
to<00:04:12.200> for<00:04:12.860> me<00:04:12.980> in<00:04:13.070> the<00:04:13.160> same<00:04:13.340> building<00:04:13.640> that<00:04:13.730> I

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
to for me in the same building that I

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.400 
to for me in the same building that I
wasn't<00:04:14.120> last<00:04:14.299> time<00:04:14.510> so<00:04:14.690> if<00:04:14.780> I<00:04:14.840> move<00:04:15.049> to<00:04:15.200> a<00:04:15.230> new

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
wasn't last time so if I move to a new

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.950 
wasn't last time so if I move to a new
building

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
building

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.690 
building
I<00:04:16.020> might<00:04:16.260> have<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.470> drop<00:04:16.680> on<00:04:16.860> them<00:04:17.010> which<00:04:17.550> is<00:04:17.580> a

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
I might have the drop on them which is a

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.060 
I might have the drop on them which is a
decent<00:04:18.150> idea<00:04:18.240> suppose<00:04:18.750> but<00:04:19.110> i'll<00:04:19.890> let<00:04:19.950> you

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
decent idea suppose but i'll let you

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.260 
decent idea suppose but i'll let you
guys<00:04:20.190> kind<00:04:20.310> of<00:04:20.430> watch<00:04:20.550> the<00:04:20.730> end<00:04:20.820> of<00:04:20.910> this<00:04:20.970> i<00:04:21.150> had

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
guys kind of watch the end of this i had

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.880 
guys kind of watch the end of this i had
another<00:04:21.570> question<00:04:21.780> about<00:04:22.110> the<00:04:22.230> conquest<00:04:22.710> game

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
another question about the conquest game

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.250 
another question about the conquest game
as<00:04:23.370> opposed<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:23.940> a<00:04:23.970> when<00:04:24.810> you're<00:04:24.930> capturing

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
as opposed to a when you're capturing

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.410 
as opposed to a when you're capturing
the<00:04:25.380> bases<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:25.920> hold<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.160> bases<00:04:26.520> does

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
the bases and you hold the bases does

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.360 
the bases and you hold the bases does
that<00:04:27.570> take<00:04:27.750> your<00:04:27.900> tickets<00:04:28.050> as<00:04:28.380> well<00:04:28.560> because

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
that take your tickets as well because

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
that take your tickets as well because
I've<00:04:29.520> noticed<00:04:29.820> towards<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.090> end<00:04:30.210> of<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.300> game

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
I've noticed towards the end of the game

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.000 
I've noticed towards the end of the game
date<00:04:30.660> and<00:04:30.870> it<00:04:31.080> only<00:04:31.170> really<00:04:31.440> comes<00:04:31.710> up<00:04:31.890> in

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
date and it only really comes up in

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.560 
date and it only really comes up in
really<00:04:32.190> close<00:04:32.460> games<00:04:32.880> when<00:04:33.150> you<00:04:33.240> get<00:04:33.360> down<00:04:33.510> to

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
really close games when you get down to

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.960 
really close games when you get down to
the<00:04:33.840> end<00:04:34.260> and<00:04:34.530> you<00:04:34.650> know<00:04:34.770> it's<00:04:34.950> like<00:04:35.040> 20<00:04:35.460> to<00:04:35.580> 20

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
the end and you know it's like 20 to 20

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.020 
the end and you know it's like 20 to 20
is<00:04:36.170> it<00:04:37.170> who<00:04:37.380> holds<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.740> most<00:04:37.980> bases<00:04:38.550> allows

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
is it who holds the most bases allows

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.820 
is it who holds the most bases allows
for<00:04:39.420> them<00:04:39.510> to<00:04:39.630> take<00:04:39.750> tickets<00:04:39.990> or<00:04:40.350> is<00:04:40.470> it<00:04:40.620> don't

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
for them to take tickets or is it don't

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.410 
for them to take tickets or is it don't
die<00:04:41.100> or<00:04:41.460> else<00:04:41.580> you're<00:04:41.730> going<00:04:41.820> to<00:04:41.910> lose<00:04:42.000> tickets

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
or is it a combination I still haven't

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.130 
or is it a combination I still haven't
quite<00:04:44.310> figured<00:04:44.550> that<00:04:44.730> out<00:04:44.850> it<00:04:45.540> only<00:04:45.720> happens

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
quite figured that out it only happens

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.510 
quite figured that out it only happens
in<00:04:46.260> close<00:04:46.470> games<00:04:46.710> that<00:04:46.950> you<00:04:47.040> really<00:04:47.280> can't

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
in close games that you really can't

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.790 
in close games that you really can't
quite<00:04:47.790> you<00:04:48.540> know<00:04:48.570> figure<00:04:49.260> it<00:04:49.380> out<00:04:49.500> it's<00:04:49.740> the

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
quite you know figure it out it's the

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.140 
quite you know figure it out it's the
only<00:04:50.010> time<00:04:50.130> it<00:04:50.250> really<00:04:50.370> matters<00:04:50.760> now<00:04:50.910> here<00:04:51.090> I

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
only time it really matters now here I

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.790 
only time it really matters now here I
get<00:04:51.300> a<00:04:51.330> little<00:04:51.480> antsy<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.020> decided<00:04:52.380> to<00:04:52.410> you

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
get a little antsy and decided to you

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.650 
get a little antsy and decided to you
know<00:04:52.830> throw<00:04:53.070> some<00:04:53.310> c4<00:04:53.550> up<00:04:53.970> of<00:04:54.090> that<00:04:54.210> area<00:04:54.420> where

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
know throw some c4 up of that area where

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.000 
know throw some c4 up of that area where
i<00:04:54.690> saw<00:04:54.870> that<00:04:54.990> tank<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:55.470> by<00:04:55.560> early<00:04:55.590> which<00:04:55.980> was

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
i saw that tank and by early which was

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.380 
i saw that tank and by early which was
surprising<00:04:56.610> enough<00:04:56.790> that<00:04:56.940> it<00:04:57.060> didn't<00:04:57.270> come

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
surprising enough that it didn't come

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.640 
surprising enough that it didn't come
into<00:04:57.510> the<00:04:57.630> base<00:04:57.750> to<00:04:57.930> try<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.170> cap<00:04:58.350> it<00:04:58.380> but<00:04:58.620> i

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
into the base to try and cap it but i

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.050 
into the base to try and cap it but i
figure<00:04:58.920> you<00:04:59.040> know<00:04:59.130> i<00:04:59.310> might<00:04:59.700> get<00:04:59.820> somebody

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
figure you know i might get somebody

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.430 
figure you know i might get somebody
coming<00:05:00.480> in<00:05:00.600> and<00:05:00.870> you<00:05:01.080> know<00:05:01.170> sure<00:05:01.410> enough

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
coming in and you know sure enough

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.230 
coming in and you know sure enough

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
there's a vehicle coming in here and i
