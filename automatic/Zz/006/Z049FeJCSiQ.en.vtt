00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
a little switch on the bottom of the

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.619 
a little switch on the bottom of the
light<00:00:59.309> switch<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.730> little<00:00:59.850> button<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.510> you'd

mash that button and that would allow

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.640

out of it pull the switch handle and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.420 
out of it pull the switch handle and
everything<00:01:08.939> right<00:01:09.360> out<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:11.130> instead<00:01:11.369> of

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
everything right out of it so instead of

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.130 
everything right out of it so instead of
unscrewing<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.479> don't<00:01:12.750> push<00:01:13.020> that

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
unscrewing that you don't push that

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.080 
unscrewing that you don't push that

little button and just pull this whole
thing<00:01:15.150> out<00:01:15.509> then<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.840> turn<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.320> knob<00:01:17.060> and

thing out then you turn this knob and

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.330 
thing out then you turn this knob and
that<00:01:18.240> would<00:01:18.390> release<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.159> mechanism<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.280> you

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
that would release the mechanism so you

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.969 
that would release the mechanism so you
get<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.670> out<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.970> mess<00:01:21.090> around<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.979> this

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
get it out and mess around with it this

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.770 
get it out and mess around with it this
is<00:01:23.130> what<00:01:23.280> I'm<00:01:23.400> doing<00:01:23.520> right<00:01:23.759> now<00:01:26.509> once<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.630> get

what I was talking about I can reach
over<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.530> here<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:10.950> test<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.490> this<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.090> hot

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.000 
over in here and test it this is the hot
wire<00:02:13.130> that<00:02:14.130> goes<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:15.410> there's<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.560> secondary

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
wire that goes to it there's a secondary

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.950 
wire that goes to it there's a secondary
hot<00:02:17.280> wire<00:02:17.520> here<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:19.820> then<00:02:20.820> what<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.690> do<00:02:21.810> it

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
hot wire here and then what I can do it

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.720 
hot wire here and then what I can do it
this<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.440> headlights<00:02:22.860> when<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.460> pull<00:02:23.700> that

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
this is the headlights when I pull that

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.930 
this is the headlights when I pull that
out<00:02:25.010> two<00:02:26.010> clicks<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.940> comes<00:02:27.240> on<00:02:28.610> one<00:02:29.610> click

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
out two clicks that comes on one click

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.300 
out two clicks that comes on one click
should<00:02:30.180> be<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.420> parking<00:02:30.840> light<00:02:31.100> which<00:02:32.100> I've

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
should be the parking light which I've

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.820 
should be the parking light which I've
got<00:02:32.460> here<00:02:32.960> parking<00:02:33.960> light<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.380> then<00:02:34.470> parking

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
got here parking light and then parking

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.980 
got here parking light and then parking
light<00:02:34.950> goes<00:02:35.220> off<00:02:35.490> that's<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.390> front<00:02:36.720> little

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
light goes off that's that front little

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.870 
light goes off that's that front little
bulb<00:02:37.260> in<00:02:37.560> there<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:38.100> goes<00:02:38.340> off<00:02:38.580> when<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
bulb in there that goes off when the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.660 
bulb in there that goes off when the
headlights<00:02:39.209> go<00:02:39.450> on<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.650> works<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.220> this

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
headlights go on so that works that this

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:49.130 
headlights go on so that works that this
is<00:02:44.570> one<00:02:45.570> of<00:02:45.690> these<00:02:46.130> this<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.370> -<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.510> this

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
is one of these this is the - and this

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.620 
is one of these this is the - and this
light<00:02:49.350> has<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.650> thing<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.490> turn<00:02:50.790> this

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
light has a thing that you turn this

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.150 
light has a thing that you turn this
switch<00:02:51.870> has<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.290> thing<00:02:52.560> that<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.800> turn<00:02:52.980> it

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
switch has a thing that you turn it

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.730 
switch has a thing that you turn it
makes<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.459> -<00:02:53.640> light<00:02:53.940> brighter<00:02:54.270> and<00:02:54.510> dimmer<00:02:54.740> so

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
makes a - light brighter and dimmer so

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.310 
makes a - light brighter and dimmer so
when<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:55.980> get<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:56.280> attached<00:02:56.670> well<00:02:57.200> with<00:02:58.200> the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
when I get this attached well with the

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.730 
when I get this attached well with the
lights<00:02:58.560> on<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:59.900> can<00:03:00.900> turn<00:03:01.110> this<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.590> gets

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
lights on I can turn this and it gets

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.160 
lights on I can turn this and it gets
brighter<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.160> dimmer<00:03:02.370> see<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.959> that's

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
brighter and dimmer see that so that's

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:11.440 
brighter and dimmer see that so that's
the<00:03:04.290> -<00:03:04.530> life<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:06.000> okay<00:03:06.660> I've<00:03:06.900> got<00:03:07.340> lights<00:03:08.340> and

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:19.100 

parking<00:03:12.450> lights<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:14.239> -<00:03:15.239> lights<00:03:16.160> here<00:03:17.420> so<00:03:18.420> I

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
parking lights and - lights here so I

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:29.220 
parking lights and - lights here so I
should<00:03:19.860> have<00:03:21.050> all<00:03:22.050> that<00:03:22.110> stuff<00:03:22.769> out<00:03:23.070> there

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.390 

the<00:03:30.230> other<00:03:30.440> thing<00:03:30.680> that<00:03:30.710> comes<00:03:30.950> into<00:03:31.220> play

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
the other thing that comes into play

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.010 
the other thing that comes into play
here<00:03:31.640> is<00:03:31.730> a<00:03:31.760> dimmer<00:03:32.060> switch<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.780> dimmer

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
here is a dimmer switch the dimmer

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.570 
here is a dimmer switch the dimmer
switch<00:03:33.730> will<00:03:35.110> transfer<00:03:36.110> that<00:03:36.470> one<00:03:36.920> hot<00:03:37.280> wire

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
switch will transfer that one hot wire

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.120 
switch will transfer that one hot wire
from<00:03:37.970> hot<00:03:38.900> from<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.170> high<00:03:39.380> side<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:39.950> low

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
from hot from the high side to the low

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.210 
from hot from the high side to the low
side<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:41.380> maybe<00:03:42.380> I<00:03:42.500> should<00:03:42.709> go<00:03:42.860> to<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:43.010> dimmer

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
side and maybe I should go to the dimmer

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.070 
side and maybe I should go to the dimmer
switch<00:03:43.310> next<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.300> look<00:03:44.480> at<00:03:44.630> that

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
switch next and look at that

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.890 
switch next and look at that
I<00:03:45.110> think<00:03:45.620> oil
