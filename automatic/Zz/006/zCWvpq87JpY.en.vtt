ethical tired i'll load up a sample so
this<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.350> my<00:00:46.530> broken<00:00:46.920> copy<00:00:49.520> but<00:00:50.520> i<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:50.820> i

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
have a little groove calling here and a

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.229 
have a little groove calling here and a
little<00:00:55.710> base<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:56.760> actually<00:00:56.879> hear<00:00:57.180> it

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
little base so you can actually hear it

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:05.030 
little base so you can actually hear it
in<00:00:57.420> action<00:01:01.969> ok<00:01:03.140> making<00:01:04.140> sure<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.619> volume

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
in action ok making sure the volume

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:58.130 
in action ok making sure the volume
isn't<00:01:05.220> too<00:01:05.489> loud<00:01:05.760> here<00:01:08.689> is

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.810 

okay<00:02:00.390> that's<00:02:01.390> about<00:02:01.600> it<00:02:01.780> but<00:02:02.439> maybe<00:02:02.950> show<00:02:03.759> you

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
okay that's about it but maybe show you

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.350 
okay that's about it but maybe show you
one<00:02:04.149> more<00:02:04.179> thing<00:02:05.490> if<00:02:06.490> you<00:02:06.670> want<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:06.970> figure<00:02:07.119> out

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
one more thing if you want to figure out

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.509 
one more thing if you want to figure out
how<00:02:07.600> certain<00:02:07.960> things<00:02:08.349> are<00:02:08.560> done<00:02:08.739> well<00:02:09.160> just

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
how certain things are done well just

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.180 
how certain things are done well just
grab<00:02:10.000> one<00:02:10.360> of<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:12.480> available<00:02:13.480> instruments

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
grab one of the available instruments

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.880 
grab one of the available instruments
drag<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.340> into<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.610> track<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.239> just<00:02:16.959> dissect<00:02:17.709> it

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
drag it into a track and just dissect it

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.300 
drag it into a track and just dissect it
kind<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:19.269> let's<00:02:19.959> have<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.440> look<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.560> look<00:02:21.160> at

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
kind of so let's have to look a look at

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.000 
kind of so let's have to look a look at
one<00:02:21.940> of<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.180> snare<00:02:22.420> drums<00:02:24.360> okay<00:02:25.360> just<00:02:25.690> grab

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
one of the snare drums okay just grab

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.820 
one of the snare drums okay just grab
whatever<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.549> thought<00:02:28.799> okay<00:02:31.110> yeah<00:02:32.110> let's<00:02:32.410> just

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
whatever I thought okay yeah let's just

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.890 
whatever I thought okay yeah let's just
have<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.190> look<00:02:33.280> here<00:02:33.489> so<00:02:34.390> this<00:02:34.959> is<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:36.900> simpler

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
have a look here so this is a simpler

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.259 
have a look here so this is a simpler
instrument<00:02:38.620> as<00:02:38.739> you<00:02:38.830> can<00:02:38.980> see<00:02:39.160> if<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.060> right

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
instrument as you can see if you right

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.199 
instrument as you can see if you right
click<00:02:40.299> on<00:02:40.630> it<00:02:40.690> make<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.500> into<00:02:41.829> a<00:02:41.860> sampler<00:02:42.430> there

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
click on it make it into a sampler there

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.839 
click on it make it into a sampler there
you<00:02:43.299> see<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:44.380> it<00:02:44.890> actually<00:02:45.250> consists<00:02:45.790> of

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
you see that the it actually consists of

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.710 
you see that the it actually consists of
three<00:02:46.299> way<00:02:46.569> files<00:02:49.799> look<00:02:50.799> at<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.010> velocities

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
three way files look at the velocities

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.759 
three way files look at the velocities
there's<00:02:52.720> one<00:02:52.959> for<00:02:53.200> really<00:02:54.040> low<00:02:54.790> volumes<00:02:55.769> then

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
there's one for really low volumes then

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.740 
there's one for really low volumes then
from<00:02:57.010> 24<00:02:57.489> up<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:58.590> 88<00:02:59.590> and<00:02:59.980> then<00:03:00.489> for<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.940> loud

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
from 24 up to 88 and then for the loud

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.520 
from 24 up to 88 and then for the loud
ones<00:03:02.489> so<00:03:03.489> instead<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:03.970> what<00:03:04.810> I've<00:03:04.959> been<00:03:05.260> using

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
ones so instead of what I've been using

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.830 
ones so instead of what I've been using
to<00:03:05.829> to<00:03:06.370> use<00:03:06.549> actually<00:03:07.150> actually<00:03:07.239> use<00:03:07.569> three

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
to to use actually actually use three

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.309 
to to use actually actually use three
but<00:03:10.840> more<00:03:11.049> interesting<00:03:11.709> is<00:03:12.010> what<00:03:13.139> they<00:03:14.139> have

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
but more interesting is what they have

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.430 
but more interesting is what they have
in<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.739> filter<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.340> global<00:03:15.910> settings<00:03:16.440> like

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
in the filter of global settings like

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.569 
in the filter of global settings like
what<00:03:17.769> sustained<00:03:18.250> a<00:03:18.430> used<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:18.910> be<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.989> volume

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
what sustained a used to be the volume

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.050 
what sustained a used to be the volume
the<00:03:21.579> volume<00:03:21.609> to<00:03:22.060> velocity<00:03:22.569> and<00:03:23.260> as<00:03:23.889> as<00:03:24.700> i<00:03:24.880> said

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
the volume to velocity and as as i said

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.920 
the volume to velocity and as as i said
before<00:03:25.209> always<00:03:25.720> set<00:03:26.049> to<00:03:26.319> loop<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.530> trigger

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
before always set to loop the trigger

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.599 
before always set to loop the trigger
stuff<00:03:28.930> like<00:03:29.109> that<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:31.750> you<00:03:31.810> can<00:03:32.350> basically<00:03:33.100> do

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
stuff like that so you can basically do

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.770 
stuff like that so you can basically do
this<00:03:33.850> for<00:03:34.650> every<00:03:35.650> instrument<00:03:36.639> that<00:03:37.389> comes

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
this for every instrument that comes

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.540 
this for every instrument that comes
with<00:03:38.109> with<00:03:38.709> Ableton<00:03:39.220> just<00:03:41.910> dissected

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
with with Ableton just dissected

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.050 
with with Ableton just dissected
do<00:03:45.550> Becker<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.180> sampler<00:03:46.690> vehicle<00:03:48.060> well

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
do Becker to a sampler vehicle well

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.069 
do Becker to a sampler vehicle well
that's<00:03:49.540> about<00:03:49.690> it<00:03:49.920> thanks<00:03:50.920> for<00:03:51.040> watching
