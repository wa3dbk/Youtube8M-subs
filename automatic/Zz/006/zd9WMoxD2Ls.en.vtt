00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.800
 the nations are as good national 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.500
 important was to win we got the 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.840
 three points and trill I already tell you not that what 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.660
 important was his name on the part of 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.880
 We then neither was a match 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.090
 perfect in lamadrid deep but good 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.610
 atv that in the end the important thing was to win 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:32.529
 we got the three points away 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:35.649
 more to málaga and we continue in the struggle 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.770
 82 minutes or we scored three goals and I 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:42.399
 I think that saved us a bit because 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.890
 that málaga was good did not have the 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.019
 possession and at the end works we find 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.780
 Syrians we do not either but good 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:53.230
 I have not that the important thing is to put 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.059
 goals we got 43 understandings and to 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.949
 final 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.630
 the three points stayed here good 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:03.020
 we are in a good line 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:07.550
 the day that we are taking a little 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.560
 more every day we play better we are 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.960
 getting points and since then 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.820
 we have lost only one game and 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.770
 Well, I think we have to continue like this 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.370
 We are confident with desire to 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.780
 continue like this with enthusiasm and you have to give 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.780
 everything in these last matches 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.520
 but we want to continue like this we are 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.910
 excited with the desire to end there 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.380
 up and I have one that now we 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.720
 we have to relax we have to continue 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.009
 working the same and getting good 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.250
 results and we'll see where we finish 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.250
 we go quarters 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:56.360
 after the valence was won 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.189
 moment but but we're looking good 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.799
 there is a little to the Valencian and I the others 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.630
 teams that come from below and good since 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.439
 I have one that now the important thing is not 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.080
 lose a game keep scoring and I 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.550
 I think the key will be to beat the 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.290
 valencia at home no sooner then 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.140
 we will see what we do in others 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.120
 matches but but I'm telling you 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.380
 we want to continue up there and it's going to continue 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.349
 there is something we have to follow 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.930
 scoring all the matches that already 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.420
 I have what we have some points of 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.040
 advantage but but good we have matches 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.260
 outside also complicated the case 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.280
 we also need rivals 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.590
 strong and we have to continue like that 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.140
 is another we do not want to follow whom 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.690
 we want to fight until the last moment 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.010
 to end up there and we'll see what 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.830
 what do we do 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.310
 the goal was 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.650
 what five weeks ago the 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.990
 goal would be europe league now not 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.860
 we are fourth and good now for the 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:59.030
 hobby as d 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.030
 qualify for the europe league serious 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.739
 but well we'll see we still have 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.319
 eight rooms 24 points that are many 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:13.220
 we have some points of advantage but 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:17.099
 h good risk to the champions league 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.049
 we look askance to see how everything is going and 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.819
 we will see to see at least as if 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.220
 we fight to make your vote 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.769
 we are not watching the league we started a 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.540
 little irregular but but good from 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.140
 of the day 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:35.670
 we are seeing better the team of 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.840
 enough matches and good with confidence 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.480
 I think all the games are 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.920
 playing well the team is winning is 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.260
 responding well the hobby also 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.680
 she is well excited with strength to 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.040
 to encourage everyone 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.610
 I have to continue I'm very happy 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.860
 so far so far it can be 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.540
 at least I'm playing quite a lot 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.660
 the team is fine is responding 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.000
 we are confident we go quarters like this 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.250
 that better no more can not be said no 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.830
 I'm lightning this year it's fine it's not 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.290
 fighting for a place and that your goal 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.630
 It will also be designated to enter Europe 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.760
 and the other one has not so I think that 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.370
 it will be a complicated match not here 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.579
 against them because there was not a match 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.680
 round the campus radio plays quite 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.380
 open and that put us I think that 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.950
 some benefits but good there is the year 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.680
 past already proved that it is difficult 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.430
 beat them and well I have one that is a 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.430
 complicated party
