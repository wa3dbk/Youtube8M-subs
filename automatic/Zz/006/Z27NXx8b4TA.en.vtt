- hiya partner - and answering a
question<00:00:24.880> from<00:00:25.880> John<00:00:26.210> who's<00:00:26.660> a<00:00:26.739> employee<00:00:27.739> down

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
question from John who's a employee down

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.279 
question from John who's a employee down
the<00:00:28.160> South<00:00:28.340> Pole<00:00:28.579> of<00:00:28.609> gray<00:00:28.939> Theon<00:00:29.210> he<00:00:30.169> was

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
the South Pole of gray Theon he was

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.180 
the South Pole of gray Theon he was
asking<00:00:31.210> what<00:00:32.210> boots<00:00:32.509> he<00:00:32.809> should<00:00:33.110> use<00:00:33.379> he<00:00:33.739> finds

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
asking what boots he should use he finds

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.869 
asking what boots he should use he finds
that<00:00:34.400> our<00:00:35.030> polar<00:00:35.360> series<00:00:35.839> is<00:00:35.989> really<00:00:36.110> too<00:00:36.470> big

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
that our polar series is really too big

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.160 
that our polar series is really too big
warm<00:00:37.879> enough<00:00:38.150> but<00:00:38.329> too<00:00:38.510> big<00:00:38.690> to<00:00:38.870> operate

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
warm enough but too big to operate

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.840 
warm enough but too big to operate
equipment<00:00:39.350> so<00:00:39.710> it<00:00:39.769> gets<00:00:39.920> in<00:00:40.070> it<00:00:40.430> gets<00:00:40.610> in<00:00:40.760> the

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
equipment so it gets in it gets in the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.569 
equipment so it gets in it gets in the
way<00:00:40.879> of<00:00:41.000> foot<00:00:41.300> pedals<00:00:41.659> etc<00:00:42.110> I<00:00:42.949> would<00:00:43.280> suggest

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
way of foot pedals etc I would suggest

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.630 
way of foot pedals etc I would suggest
anything<00:00:44.150> from<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:44.540> epic<00:00:44.809> series<00:00:45.190> journey<00:00:46.190> is

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
anything from the epic series journey is

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.119 
anything from the epic series journey is
a<00:00:46.820> new<00:00:47.149> boot<00:00:47.449> and<00:00:47.839> if<00:00:47.930> you'd<00:00:48.079> like<00:00:48.199> if<00:00:48.800> you<00:00:48.949> like

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
a new boot and if you'd like if you like

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.299 
a new boot and if you'd like if you like
it<00:00:49.159> it's<00:00:49.579> a<00:00:49.960> little<00:00:50.960> bit<00:00:51.110> lower<00:00:51.379> profile<00:00:51.979> and<00:00:52.250> I

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
it it's a little bit lower profile and I

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.039 
it it's a little bit lower profile and I
guess<00:00:52.580> that<00:00:52.729> depends<00:00:53.030> on<00:00:53.150> what<00:00:53.330> pants<00:00:53.900> you're

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:54.049 
guess that depends on what pants you're

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.549 
guess that depends on what pants you're
wearing<00:00:55.239> or<00:00:56.239> you<00:00:56.420> can<00:00:56.540> go<00:00:56.720> with<00:00:56.750> evolution

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
wearing or you can go with evolution

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.950 
wearing or you can go with evolution
which<00:00:58.040> is<00:00:58.189> a<00:00:58.220> taller<00:00:58.519> boot<00:00:58.820> now<00:00:59.150> the<00:00:59.239> advantage

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
which is a taller boot now the advantage

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.859 
which is a taller boot now the advantage
with<00:01:00.170> these<00:01:00.379> boots<00:01:00.769> over<00:01:01.460> apex<00:01:02.299> which<00:01:02.629> you're

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:02.869 
with these boots over apex which you're

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:05.200 
with these boots over apex which you're
asking<00:01:03.350> about<00:01:03.409> is<00:01:03.589> apex<00:01:04.250> actually<00:01:04.759> have<00:01:04.970> the

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
asking about is apex actually have the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.200 
asking about is apex actually have the
same<00:01:05.500> soul<00:01:06.500> and<00:01:06.950> base<00:01:07.280> as<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.790> rest<00:01:07.970> of<00:01:08.090> the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
same soul and base as the rest of the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.640 
same soul and base as the rest of the
polar<00:01:08.689> series<00:01:09.259> and<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:11.570> width<00:01:11.810> it's<00:01:12.350> wide

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
polar series and the width it's wide

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.940 
polar series and the width it's wide
it's<00:01:13.040> stable<00:01:13.580> it's<00:01:13.820> extremely<00:01:14.479> warm<00:01:14.750> but<00:01:15.560> you

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
it's stable it's extremely warm but you

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.789 
it's stable it's extremely warm but you
can<00:01:16.159> see<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:16.640> width<00:01:16.790> of<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.090> boot<00:01:17.799> compared

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
can see the width of the boot compared

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.620 
can see the width of the boot compared
to<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:18.920> epic<00:01:19.220> series<00:01:19.460> is<00:01:20.090> quite<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:20.450> bit

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
to the epic series is quite a bit

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.590 
to the epic series is quite a bit
different<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:21.439> if<00:01:21.500> you<00:01:21.590> want<00:01:21.770> something<00:01:22.250> for

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
different so if you want something for

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.180 
different so if you want something for
equipment<00:01:23.600> you'd<00:01:24.080> be<00:01:24.200> better<00:01:24.409> off<00:01:24.560> with<00:01:25.070> the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
equipment you'd be better off with the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.840 
equipment you'd be better off with the
epic<00:01:25.520> series<00:01:26.350> it's<00:01:27.350> not<00:01:27.680> quite<00:01:28.070> as<00:01:28.250> warm<00:01:28.520> as

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
epic series it's not quite as warm as

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.380 
epic series it's not quite as warm as
the<00:01:29.230> polar<00:01:30.230> series<00:01:30.710> but<00:01:31.610> it's<00:01:31.760> still<00:01:32.030> very

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
the polar series but it's still very

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.590 
the polar series but it's still very
warm<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:33.110> you<00:01:33.830> know<00:01:33.979> certainly<00:01:34.600> inside

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
warm and you know certainly inside

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.430 
warm and you know certainly inside
equipment<00:01:36.170> no<00:01:36.590> problem<00:01:37.100> whatsoever<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:38.840> we
