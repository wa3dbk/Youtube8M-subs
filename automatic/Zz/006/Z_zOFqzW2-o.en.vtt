00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hi there, this is the second part of the video about 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.870
 my new clothes with my new dresses 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.090
 I'll tell you a little about that now 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.460
 this model dresses which turned out to be 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.000
 I ended up with two identical why so 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.370
 It happened 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.289
 I originally ordered my own dress 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.510
 but not leaned to the wrong size 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.970
 I ordered instead of the elves sent to me 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.920
 sq which she certainly did not fit me 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.840
 on the stone dress liked and on the site and 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.970
 in reality, I decided to order myself 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.970
 the second is the same in the right size and 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.309
 all one at a different site and the principle 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.350
 the same price is just the size different 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.969
 although different sites I will leave a reference 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.760
 Anyone interested can look at 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.860
 which sites are about the same thing and 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.230
 at the same prices and further video 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.969
 of course you will see how this dress 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.700
 the dress looks cool on me 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.649
 tailoring and material and colors and see 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.649
 my other new dress 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.930
 look 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.300
 but 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.990
 the way 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.220
 but 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.520
 aisha 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.150
 but 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.320
 but 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.320
 well and 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.890
 Yes 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.890
 but 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.500
 of things . 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.230
 you saved 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.230
 and namaz 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.360
 govinda 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.390
 aysha 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.390
 but 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.860
 Yes 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.940
 and my last update is my last 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.180
 new dress here is such a beautiful 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.550
 color combination beautiful pattern to 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.370
 Sorry I did not fit but in size 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.910
 so you have to give it to give 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.710
 someone really did not decide who else 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.170
 nice dresses all well done 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.960
 ahead she goes cutting along the waist line 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.790
 because one behind also goes on the zipper 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.760
 I like the sleeves to cover 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.070
 shoulder line that she's flared she doesn't 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.650
 glows on the lining 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.380
 dense such chiffon everything is very good 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.530
 neatly processed very carefully 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.110
 this firm and the noise myth if i correctly 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.870
 I read such a nice dress unfortunately 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.550
 all my new clothes didnâ€™t fit 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.500
 Today I hope you enjoyed this 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.420
 video and if so put your fingers 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.870
