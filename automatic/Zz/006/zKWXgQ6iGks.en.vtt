00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.690
 then welcome from this one 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:15.010
 welcome you to the press conference 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.539
 following the part of the second one 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.099
 league between energy cottbus and 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.520
 our guests from fortuna düsseldorf 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.810
 Both trainers are thankful for that 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.880
 the guest was the first word olli reck 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.289
 please yes hello first I believe we 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.460
 have a very intense game today 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.720
 seen by both teams went there 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.080
 not so surprising for 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.160
 decent residue but I think 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.750
 that our team or mine 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.930
 team then after a very good game 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.780
 has found and promptly responded to 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.100
 the residue and we ourselves 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.730
 knew it was a very intense one 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.050
 game is against energy today because it is 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.879
 is of course the starting point for 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.739
 energy succeeded if you are in the bottom 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.270
 you have to fight for every meter that has 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.010
 Energy feels about 90 minutes too 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.989
 done and demanded everything in this 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.250
 game 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.330
 I called the team in 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.560
 right moment the right one 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
 We have to make a decision 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.160
 I believe that another time today 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.840
 done 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.330
 with a towering fabian gv the gate 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.799
 yet another situation where 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.180
 Energy also has the possibility 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.220
 to go into the lead again or 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.630
 to balance what ever again 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.560
 but overall I have to support 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.079
 say it's a very dedicated one 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.939
 performance of my team was very 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.590
 Concentrated performance has become clear 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.280
 and the tactical requirements kept the 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.920
 words were very important as the 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.780
 a very strong defensive out to 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.060
 content quickly toggle forward 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.820
 the opponent again and again before insoluble 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.850
 tasks to make and that's us 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.000
 once succeeded but I stay with it 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.470
 again today was difficult against one 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.899
 very well set team of 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.180
 energy cottbus and pieces of energy the 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.740
 thumb, I believe with one 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.960
 positive results in the next game 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.750
 Can you bring down the walls? 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.009
 energy thumbs thanks 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.180
 Thanks also for the warm ones 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:09.280
 words about gps word on our page 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.910
 congratulations to fortuna düsseldorf and 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.110
 also to you oliver 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.900
 I think that we won today 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.850
 to whom they have given 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.200
 We have the first half like it 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.420
 also said probably very courageous 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.490
 absolutely wanted to play in the lead 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.290
 have done that and then 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.690
 We will get a reason for payment in return 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.480
 taken with the first shot at our 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.640
 then immediately equalize and 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.100
 That's why it would have been nice if 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.050
 We simply do this guide as well 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.670
 or expand more 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.840
 by we really say about a 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.460
 longer period we do not have 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.430
 made 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.470
 and still after that 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.810
 compensation in the first half some 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.340
 have had opportunities and have a lot 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.370
 courageous and very dedicated too 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.870
 played in the second half then 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.720
 It must be clear that we are not 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.820
 managed to make the goal short 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.830
 After the halftime we had one 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.050
 triple chance steffen sole by 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.250
 herbs and these are the ones 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.620
 crucial phases in this game 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.870
 also today 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.350
 and then we get it 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.570
 back in the back and then must 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.090
 to say clearly that we have little means 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.910
 have found the simple now 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.350
 to achieve compensation 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.090
 I think symptomatic was also then 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.800
 also how we get the goats 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.870
 the third goal today so easy 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.850
 basically taken from nothing like 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.270
 a goaltor will not have a chance 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.800
 to come back again and that is 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.290
 of course extremely frustrating for us 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.630
 all that is normal but we have to 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.320
 another game on the next sunday in 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.500
 paderborn 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:55.160
 and even if the disappointment like 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.130
 At that time you have to be very big 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.190
 straighten up and that goes every single one 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.050
 Player for all of us and we will 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.570
 also do around this last game then 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.910
 also to contest and if possible 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.989
 successfully 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.520
 thank you very much stefan schmidt now exists 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.870
 to ask the possibility to ask 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.550
 both trainers have education short 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.850
 handzeichen we have two microphones in the 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.390
 room 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.390
 Please would very much like her 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.880
 close your words to others 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.710
 you have the third goal 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.470
 addressed how to explain something like that 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.729
 a goal of this misfire I have 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.160
 said the goats are unacceptable 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:36.070
 and we just get to easy against 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.100
 tor it must be said clearly and are 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.900
 Of course, concentration matters too 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.400
 that's not just about quality 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.780
 but just do one with the 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.270
 concentration of the action and there is up 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.340
 On the one hand, the goal is the third 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.590
 but also after the lead 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.449
 Immediately then get the compensation 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.340
 and that are so crucial phase 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.699
 a game we would have the same 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.889
 possibility really still had on 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.210
 end to get the compensation or 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.139
 after that to achieve the compensation and 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:12.190
 That's just what we have 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:16.690
 unfortunately torn again there's more 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.490
 questions do not seem to be the case 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.020
 then I thank you that was the last one 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.410
 home game of the year wishes you one 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.090
 nice rest advent slip into the new 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.560
 year probably because and the 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.729
