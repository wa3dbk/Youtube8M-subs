stuff like that of course as well
another<00:00:37.590> big<00:00:37.890> thing<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.160> we've<00:00:38.460> worked<00:00:38.670> on

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
another big thing that we've worked on

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.000 
another big thing that we've worked on
is<00:00:39.210> creating<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.780> much<00:00:40.050> bigger<00:00:40.440> much<00:00:40.739> more

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
is creating this much bigger much more

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.650 
is creating this much bigger much more
expansive<00:00:41.309> sandbox<00:00:42.000> for<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.210> game<00:00:42.390> set

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
expansive sandbox for the game set

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.540 
expansive sandbox for the game set
placing<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.260> know<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> game<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.250> game<00:00:44.430> takes

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
placing you know the game the game takes

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.430 
placing you know the game the game takes
place<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.850> empire<00:00:45.090> base<00:00:45.270> twice<00:00:45.719> as<00:00:45.989> big<00:00:46.170> as<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
place in empire base twice as big as the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.380 
place in empire base twice as big as the
original<00:00:46.800> City<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.460> know<00:00:47.489> if<00:00:47.850> there's<00:00:48.059> so

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
original City you know if there's so

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.880 
original City you know if there's so
much<00:00:48.570> more<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.870> do<00:00:49.170> than<00:00:49.379> there<00:00:49.559> wasn't<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
much more to do than there wasn't the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.950 
much more to do than there wasn't the
original<00:00:50.039> see<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.760> that's<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.840> other

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
original see and that's one of the other

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.510 
original see and that's one of the other
big<00:00:52.020> factors<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.500> now<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.649> think<00:00:52.890> thirdly<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
big factors and now I think thirdly the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.819 
big factors and now I think thirdly the
other<00:00:54.000> factor<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.750> combat<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.649> game

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
other factor is the combat in the game

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.319 
other factor is the combat in the game
no<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.100> more<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.460> third-person<00:00:56.850> shooter

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
no it's more like a third-person shooter

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.670 
no it's more like a third-person shooter
than<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.660> an<00:00:57.780> open-world<00:00:58.170> game<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.559> know

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
than it is an open-world game you know

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.319 
than it is an open-world game you know
once<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.160> go<00:00:59.280> into<00:00:59.399> these<00:00:59.520> big<00:00:59.760> interior<00:01:00.210> of

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
once you go into these big interior of

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.490 
once you go into these big interior of
environments<00:01:00.780> they<00:01:00.899> let<00:01:01.079> their<00:01:01.230> full<00:01:01.410> of

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
environments they let their full of

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.689 
environments they let their full of
dynamic<00:01:01.859> objects<00:01:02.190> they're<00:01:02.340> full<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
dynamic objects they're full of the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.219 
dynamic objects they're full of the
details<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.210> you'd<00:01:03.390> expect<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.049> say

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
details that you'd expect you and say

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.990 
details that you'd expect you and say
another<00:01:04.830> big<00:01:05.040> game<00:01:05.070> maybe<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.519> kids<00:01:05.729> are<00:01:05.850> all

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
another big game maybe that kids are all

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.490 
another big game maybe that kids are all
in<00:01:06.030> charge<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.600> know<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.260> your

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
in charge you know and to have that your

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.960 
in charge you know and to have that your
sandbox<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.979> something<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:08.369> unique<00:01:08.610> that

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
sandbox is something really unique that

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.880 
sandbox is something really unique that
we<00:01:09.119> think<00:01:09.299> Matthew<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.630> doing<00:01:09.869> yes<00:01:10.290> buddy<00:01:10.590> Joe
