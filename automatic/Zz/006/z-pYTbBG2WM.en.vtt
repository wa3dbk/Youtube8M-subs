00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.860
 calm and coming to other materials 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.080
 I slept in knowing this hello 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.880
 kitty and I decided to do it because I 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.769
 asked a friend called to perform well 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.320
 that this video goes for you solar 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.720
 you first have to wash our hands 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.069
 and then put on some gloves but 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.659
 we settle with them there's no 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.609
 problems as long as we have the 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.649
 very clean hands 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.870
 now with white fondant we make a 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.910
 ball and we give it oval shape of such 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.070
 so that we stay like this 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.320
 this piece is going to be the head of our 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.719
 hello kitty the next step is to make 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.300
 the ears for that we use again 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.760
 blank background we knead it very well and 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.649
 we stretch with the mini roller after 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.980
 with the help of spatula blade we are going to 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.170
 take out a rectangle like this rectangle 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.289
 in total we must have 2 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.120
 the first is to take out the ears for 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.629
 that we have to use our minis for tula 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.520
 and cut out two triangles since the 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.040
 we have with the help of our fingers 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.619
 let's try the tips so that they do not 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.020
 are anti sharp and then with the 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.470
 help from our spatula line we can 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.390
 match it to the desired shape 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.939
 now with a brush and water we are going to paste 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.670
 the ears that we already have in such a way 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:27.220
 that we have left like this now let's paste 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.409
 eyes and nose you can use your 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.320
 edible mound or black fondant and background 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.810
 in yellow for the nose 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.150
 again with a brush and water we place 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.830
 the place where we are going to paste them and with 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.470
 help of the mini spatula in our 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.020
 fingers we arrange the eyes and nose in 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.750
 where we like it most and the result goes to 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.700
 be this the next rectangle that 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.550
 I commented with this small cutter 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.250
 round let's take out two circles that 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.909
 They will be the feet and we are going to be of 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.369
 this form 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.200
 once again we use white fondant 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.479
 now to do the little hands of our 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.579
 kit that are two very small balls 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.829
 how are you removing them to move to 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.140
 make the body with pink fondant very 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.090
 well kneaded let's make this little ball 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.370
 that has to be a little bit smaller than 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.230
 head with our roller let's go to 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.569
 notify a little just to flatten the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.180
 surface afterwards with our fingers 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.530
 we are going to press on all four sides and 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.530
 with the mini is for tula we are going to 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.599
 cut up and down and we press a 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.190
 little more so that we have this figure 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.950
 that will be the dress of our hello 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.160
 kitty now let's do what is the 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.959
 neck for the neck we can make a 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.780
 light pressure here with our coca 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.060
 door so that we have this 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.519
 hollow now shaped in pink a tone 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.099
 lighter we are going to make this strip and the 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:50.410
 let's cut with our mini spatula 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.410
 We will insert this piece here 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.080
 with a pink cover in the same color as the 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.159
 neck let's take out the arms 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.530
 we stretch with the mini roller and 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.900
 cut with the mini spatula a 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.810
 rectangle like last time since what 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.700
 we have we are going to draw two triangles a 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.650
 little longer than the first ones 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.930
 we did since we have the body like this 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.360
 we are going to hit him the arms we put him 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.159
 water on both sides and we hit with 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.920
 very careful until we stay like this 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:21.560
 now in the lower part of the arms 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.659
 let's put the hands with a little 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.060
 of water and likewise we are going to 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.950
 do for the feet by gluing and accommodating 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.799
 so that when we stop at 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.629
 our kit and we stay from this court 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.879
 now let's finish with the head 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.370
 then with rÃ³zsa the same tone as the 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.170
 dress let's make a little 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.090
 rectangle with flattened tips 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.250
 then with a coca door we go to 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.459
 press in the middle of both sides 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.799
 to give it the shape we can also 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.130
 help us with our fingers to 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.930
 mark it even more 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.480
 the next step is with the mini 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.060
 spatula that will help us mark the 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.940
 center of the bow you have to make a light 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.620
 pressure without getting to cut afterwards with 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.600
 another tool we are going to mark it 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.180
 still a little more to make it look 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.790
 deep and look like a bow 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.590
 moored with a pointed tool 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.470
 let's make the folds of the bun 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.540
 pressing a bit now we are going to 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.420
 paste it on the head with a little bit of 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.250
 water the next step is to put the 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.270
 head on the body with this stick 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.740
 then since we have the full body 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.320
 let's make mustaches for that 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.170
 We use black fondant and stretch it 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.660
 very thin then we cut strips very 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.180
 small and with the mini spatula and water 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.970
 we arrange them as neat as possible 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.340
 without sticking to your face since 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.260
 we want this to be good 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.550
 it was all if they liked the video like 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.550
 See you next week
