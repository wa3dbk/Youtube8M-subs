 They are always traveling also more 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.940
 today in florida here in south florida 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.000
 in the city of hollywood on the beach in the well and 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.540
 on the coast here right on the edge of the beach 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.270
 here o 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.719
 I do not know if you see the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.640
 palm trees indeed perhaps deep down is already 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.379
 the beach the sand the beach 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:00.770
 We are here in a gated community in 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:06.750
 private and it is difficult to see these 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:09.570
 grades these type but the hunger and steel 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.939
 which are souring the doors and 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.049
 apartment windows 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.439
 Look how interesting o doors and windows 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.409
 all protected 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:28.100
 most everything is closed it is ok 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:31.560
 flame richars are double the double 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.900
 protection against hurricanes against 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.329
 these natural anomalies 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.009
 that these natural 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.119
 happen in Florida, which is very 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.369
 frequent here 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.960
 This is generally used for this purpose. 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.750
 to protect the apartment from 200 and 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.590
 objects that are is loaded by the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.189
 hurricanes 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.049
 but this is not the only one here in the case of 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.869
 people are seeing that we are not 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.259
 As a man the hurricane is now 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.600
 today in this period that I am 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.030
 recording this video but looks at most 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.670
 of the apartments have these protections 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.170
 this one has this protection already closed all 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.610
 actually has 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.610
 but what are you using 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.520
 are several that are using is optional 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.900
 use or take away but most are using 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.860
 How can you become nense nense? 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.260
 difficult in particular because this is good 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.000
 simply because this index indicates 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.370
 that the economy has a lot of people 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.480
 resident who lives here temporary are they 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.360
 just come spend some time here is just a 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.920
 wave of poet of the year they do not live fixed 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.670
 on here 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.900
 usually it happens here 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.510
 especially in hollywood when the 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.350
 tourists are from Canada or the north side 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.450
 from new york boston and chicago some 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.510
 city â€‹â€‹where the winter is strict 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.459
 where there is a lot of snow and very cold so 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.790
 they have an apartment here 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.610
 summer vacation apartment is on 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.890
 Winter fact that winter them 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.920
 It's too cold out here. 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.530
 the use of the heat that even in 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.040
 winter here nekemte compared there where 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.040
 they live 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.609
 so they enjoy the summer there where they 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.609
 live normally the summer is also 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:31.739
 hot and when cool 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:34.430
 they go down the Florida team to 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:40.829
 enjoy the beaches 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:42.299
 even when it is between winter quotes is 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.230
 this is another curious detail is that 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:48.000
 You there you see with transfers 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.230
 closed condos 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.359
 so totally isolated or time of 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.160
 Hurricane threat of hurricane or if you have 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:04:00.030
 many so at the same time none 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:04.019

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:08.299
 They are not at Sergio's house . 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:11.340

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.859

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:20.519
 those who are wondering and these 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.860
 people who do not live here is a bigger 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.570
 out of the year that does not have the alex 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.150
