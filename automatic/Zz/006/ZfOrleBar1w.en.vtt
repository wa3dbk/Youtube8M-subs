you look at the cockpit of the vehicle

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:37.430 
you look at the cockpit of the vehicle
it's<00:00:35.970> actually<00:00:36.300> built<00:00:36.540> much<00:00:36.750> like<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> fighter

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
it's actually built much like a fighter

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
where you add stuff to it what are some

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.360 
where you add stuff to it what are some
of<00:00:42.330> the<00:00:42.420> features<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:43.680> vehicle<00:00:43.980> actually<00:00:44.129> has

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
of the features the vehicle actually has

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.160

traffic monitoring and the entire car as

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.040 
traffic monitoring and the entire car as
I<00:01:32.670> said<00:01:32.850> before<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.240> built<00:01:33.450> specifically<00:01:33.929> for

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
I said before is built specifically for

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.070 
I said before is built specifically for
the<00:01:34.319> purpose<00:01:34.349> of<00:01:34.709> law<00:01:34.800> enforcement<00:01:36.080> haven't

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
the purpose of law enforcement haven't

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.150 
the purpose of law enforcement haven't
announced<00:01:37.259> pricing<00:01:37.560> yet<00:01:37.890> will<00:01:38.069> be

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
announced pricing yet will be

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.010 
announced pricing yet will be
competitive<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.849> patrol<00:01:39.179> ready<00:01:39.450> vehicle

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
competitive with a patrol ready vehicle

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.690 
competitive with a patrol ready vehicle
so<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.709> agencies<00:01:41.069> are<00:01:41.190> going<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.369> be<00:01:41.459> spending

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
so the agencies are going to be spending

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.760 
so the agencies are going to be spending
any<00:01:41.940> more<00:01:42.119> money<00:01:42.179> to<00:01:43.140> put<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> car<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
any more money to put the car on the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.320 
any more money to put the car on the
road<00:01:43.979> but<00:01:44.190> they<00:01:44.340> will<00:01:44.459> be<00:01:44.520> spending<00:01:45.000> less

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
road but they will be spending less

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.089 
road but they will be spending less
money<00:01:45.360> over<00:01:45.929> the<00:01:45.959> life<00:01:46.200> cycle<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.709> vehicle

00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:47.099 
money over the life cycle of the vehicle

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:48.830 
money over the life cycle of the vehicle
we<00:01:47.490> have<00:01:47.580> a<00:01:47.610> clean<00:01:47.849> diesel<00:01:48.179> powertrain<00:01:48.660> that

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
we have a clean diesel powertrain that

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.449 
we have a clean diesel powertrain that
gets<00:01:48.959> a<00:01:49.170> forty<00:01:49.500> percent<00:01:49.830> improvement<00:01:50.099> in<00:01:50.429> fuel

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.459 
gets a forty percent improvement in fuel

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:53.690 
gets a forty percent improvement in fuel
economy<00:01:50.700> over<00:01:51.509> any<00:01:52.190> vehicle<00:01:53.190> being<00:01:53.310> used<00:01:53.580> in

economy over any vehicle being used in
law<00:01:53.849> enforcement<00:01:53.880> today<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.740> course<00:01:55.920> that

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
law enforcement today and of course that

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:57.800 
law enforcement today and of course that
has<00:01:56.190> some<00:01:56.369> tailpipe<00:01:56.729> benefits<00:01:57.179> to<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.479> as<00:01:57.599> well

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
has some tailpipe benefits to it as well

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.600 
has some tailpipe benefits to it as well
so<00:01:58.080> a<00:01:58.110> forty<00:01:58.440> percent<00:01:58.679> reduction<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.250> fuel<00:01:59.340> in

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
so a forty percent reduction in fuel in

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.840 
so a forty percent reduction in fuel in
