00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:14.360
 johann ag now comes a video about 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.889
 head for the black ops 3m on today 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.570
 first reveal trailer we see 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.160
 we got a first gameplay 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.230
 Sequences and excerpts from black ops 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.250
 three can recognize 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.750
 we do not have that many now 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.950
 information from the trailer of my 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.810
 opinion, that does not have so many new ones 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.010
 get information but are up 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.830
 Anyway, a few anyway 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.820
 things and a few pictures you get there 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.200
 you could show it to yourself 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.520
 that could be the reason why the 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.160
 in the background a bit of 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.630
 the trailer yes as one recognizes each 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.860
 if the whole thing is futuristic 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.090
 yes, you already recognized the graphic 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.860
 It looks pretty good too 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.150
 but that's what I expected 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.750
 because on advance week was already 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.250
 pretty good 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.630
 that's only one thing 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.829
 singleplayer trailer but you recognize 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.090
 still has a bit something 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.520
 from the mouvement as well as in the 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.960
 multiplayer could be about 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.430
 recognizes that, for example, because the boost 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.559
 jobs you can see a few sequences like 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.880
 the people almost use this bus around 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.550
 jump somewhere on it and that is 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.380
 I would say a bit more fluid 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.089
 when in thrower was there you have yes 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.500
 always quasi you should be able to twice 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.750
 accelerate and then you are back 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.460
 a bit higher here is 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.780
 that a fluid glide me quasi 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.940
 already talked as if it were structurally 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.610
 So hofer ability is that one 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.110
 Slight bit jumping as well 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.690
 you can see in a sequence where you are under 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.010
 water shoots so yes is now 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.270
 also that maybe you are 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.500
 synonymous only in singleplayer but that one 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.049
 stop under water again this time shoots 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.030
 then you can see again at the 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.979
 wall running along that's something 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.869
 which one is actually good in multiplayer 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.010
 Reintun could do that and with me too 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.090
 Clear where I could imagine 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.220
 that is also in the multiplayer 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.450
 come in and see 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.740
 a few more soldiers against 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.049
 any robots are fighting 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.460
 that's kind of big part 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.450
 to have the campaign one has 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.700
 but not so much information 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.950
 get what's going on in the campaign 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.900
 so it's said a little bit of 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.070
 that's how far you can go with technology 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.540
 can go and so on I link 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.640
 I also the German part in the 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.170
 description of course but it is now 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.369
 not really that much was said 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.009
 now in the campaign who against 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.119
 Fought what makes it so big there 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.159
 just contains a few pictures 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.509
 been shown a few basic thoughts 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.030
 from the game 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.979
 you can see some weapons and the ones 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.510
 are relatively futuristic but still 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.350
 still allowing you to use real weapons 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.120
 are based so 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.120
 I now have no laser of anything 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.160
 seen but everything just things that 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.080
 even today could exist like that 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.270
 roughly that it is on today 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.680
 really based weapons 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.270
 I'm happy about that in Vancouver 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.740
 There are also many laser weapons and so on 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.050
 in this game for now as I said 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.250
 I do not have any super futuristic ones right now 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.560
 Weapon seen what I actually quite 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.790
 I think I'll be very happy 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.770
 What are you interested in from this trailer 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.470
 Hold as I said in itself is the 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.120
 trailer I think is quite well done and 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.770
 yes, but it bothers me a bit with that 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.260
 the ex jumps i would have to honestly 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.240
 I said not again used but 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.830
 nevertheless I is looking forward to the game 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.180
 are definitely the sequences 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.920
 are definitely pretty cool out 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.810
 And as I said , I would definitely 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.890
 times you are interested and yes that 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.270
 what now synonymous with the video if you 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.710
 maybe you like yourself upstairs 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.710
 friends the password of the skin purely people
