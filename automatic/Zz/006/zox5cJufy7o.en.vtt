00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
23 on to help me add 23 on I'm going to

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.630 
23 on to help me add 23 on I'm going to
split<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.500> into<00:00:29.130> its<00:00:29.609> tens<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.660> units<00:00:31.640> and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
split it into its tens and units and

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.660 
split it into its tens and units and
we'll<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.329> over<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.170> far<00:00:34.500> side<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
we'll do this over the far side of the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.979 
we'll do this over the far side of the
board<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.860> help<00:00:38.160> me<00:00:38.570> in<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
board this is just to help me in the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:48.049 
board this is just to help me in the
number<00:00:40.379> 23<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.700> know<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.540> three<00:00:42.960> units<00:00:45.140> I<00:00:47.059> also

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
number 23 I know this three units I also

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.500 
number 23 I know this three units I also
know<00:00:48.530> -<00:00:52.219> now<00:00:53.219> I've<00:00:53.399> split<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.850> up<00:00:54.030> into<00:00:54.210> its

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
know - now I've split this up into its

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.479 
know - now I've split this up into its
Tenzin<00:00:54.960> unit<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:56.280> start<00:00:56.670> adding<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:58.489> want

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
Tenzin unit I can start adding on I want

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.950 
Tenzin unit I can start adding on I want
to<00:00:59.550> start<00:00:59.879> by<00:01:00.780> adding<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:02.219> tens<00:01:02.660> we<00:01:03.660> know

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
to start by adding on the tens we know

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:15.370 
to start by adding on the tens we know
this<00:01:04.500> only<00:01:04.739> affects<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.880> ten<00:01:06.299> column<00:01:06.890> so<00:01:07.890> 34

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.580 

and<00:01:16.380> I'm<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.890> add<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.250> other<00:01:17.460> turn<00:01:17.939> on

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
and I'm going to add the other turn on

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:28.160 
and I'm going to add the other turn on
44<00:01:25.159> adding<00:01:26.159> my<00:01:26.340> tens<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.479> I'm<00:01:27.540> going<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.960> add

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
44 adding my tens on so I'm going to add

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.890 
44 adding my tens on so I'm going to add
on<00:01:28.409> my<00:01:28.619> units

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.680 

adilyn<00:01:36.800> another<00:01:37.070> one<00:01:37.780> gets<00:01:38.780> me<00:01:38.950> 256<00:01:40.510> and<00:01:41.510> then

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
adilyn another one gets me 256 and then

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:49.090 
adilyn another one gets me 256 and then
on<00:01:41.810> my<00:01:41.960> final<00:01:42.770> one<00:01:43.040> gets<00:01:44.000> me<00:01:44.240> to<00:01:44.920> 67<00:01:48.100> therefore

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
on my final one gets me to 67 therefore

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.880 
on my final one gets me to 67 therefore
the<00:01:49.250> final<00:01:49.640> number<00:01:50.390> on<00:01:50.600> my<00:01:51.050> number<00:01:51.380> line<00:01:51.590> if<00:01:53.890> so

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
the final number on my number line if so

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:03.910 
the final number on my number line if so
this<00:01:55.190> is<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.610> answer<00:01:57.850> 34:23<00:01:58.850> is<00:02:00.400> 57<00:02:02.830> there<00:02:03.830> are

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
this is the answer 34:23 is 57 there are

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.250 
this is the answer 34:23 is 57 there are
now<00:02:04.130> two<00:02:04.820> questions<00:02:05.540> for<00:02:05.810> you<00:02:05.870> to<00:02:06.110> have<00:02:06.230> a

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
now two questions for you to have a

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.550 
now two questions for you to have a
gamma<00:02:06.640> pause<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.940> video<00:02:08.360> will<00:02:08.929> you<00:02:09.050> do<00:02:09.320> these

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
gamma pause the video will you do these

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.400 
gamma pause the video will you do these
questions<00:02:12.040> first<00:02:13.040> one<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.520> 21<00:02:14.120> at<00:02:14.510> stage<00:02:14.959> two

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
questions first one is 21 at stage two

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.020 
questions first one is 21 at stage two
I'm<00:02:16.100> starting<00:02:17.060> at<00:02:17.480> 21<00:02:18.850> 32

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
I'm starting at 21 32

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.600 
I'm starting at 21 32
I'm<00:02:20.390> going<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.780> split<00:02:20.959> up<00:02:21.260> into<00:02:21.890> my<00:02:22.220> tens

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
I'm going to split up into my tens

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:30.170 
I'm going to split up into my tens
immunity<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:24.260> I've<00:02:24.380> got<00:02:24.650> three<00:02:25.250> ten

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.580 

Oh

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.520 

I<00:02:34.620> can<00:02:35.400> then<00:02:35.580> start<00:02:36.000> adding<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.540> on<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:37.080> always

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
I can then start adding this on I always

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:56.630 
I can then start adding this on I always
add<00:02:38.099> my<00:02:38.370> tents<00:02:38.730> first<00:02:41.239> 2110<00:02:42.239> is<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:55.489> added<00:02:56.489> all

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
add my tents first 2110 is I added all

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:12.440 
add my tents first 2110 is I added all
my<00:02:56.730> tents<00:02:57.510> on<00:02:57.780> now<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:59.040> add<00:02:59.459> my<00:02:59.849> unit<00:03:08.870> I<00:03:11.450> finished

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
my tents on now I add my unit I finished

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:22.670 
my tents on now I add my unit I finished
adding<00:03:12.840> on<00:03:13.290> my<00:03:13.769> tendon<00:03:14.400> units<00:03:14.850> that<00:03:16.700> 4:53<00:03:21.680> do

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
adding on my tendon units that 4:53 do

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.850 
adding on my tendon units that 4:53 do
second<00:03:23.160> one<00:03:23.310> I'm<00:03:23.549> starting<00:03:24.480> at<00:03:25.280> 43<00:03:27.140> I'm<00:03:28.140> adding

write it down is just to help me if you
can<00:03:50.409> do<00:03:50.590> this<00:03:50.709> in<00:03:50.860> your<00:03:50.980> head<00:03:51.370> you<00:03:52.030> can<00:03:52.239> do<00:03:52.390> that

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
can do this in your head you can do that

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.160 
can do this in your head you can do that
step<00:03:53.079> in<00:03:53.409> your<00:03:53.799> head<00:03:54.209> so<00:03:55.209> now<00:03:55.420> we'll<00:03:55.629> start<00:03:55.840> off

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
step in your head so now we'll start off

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:10.259 
step in your head so now we'll start off
adding<00:03:56.860> on<00:03:57.010> my<00:03:57.189> tank<00:03:57.840> right<00:04:07.980> now<00:04:09.030> I'm<00:04:10.030> on<00:04:10.239> my

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
adding on my tank right now I'm on my

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:29.310 
adding on my tank right now I'm on my
units<00:04:27.030> so<00:04:28.030> my<00:04:28.210> answer

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
units so my answer

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:36.030 
units so my answer
the<00:04:29.500> 43<00:04:30.130> at<00:04:31.050> 24<00:04:32.050> is<00:04:33.030> 60
