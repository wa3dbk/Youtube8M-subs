00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 for what hello am i doing today 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.920
 video about the next finish birlik 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.020
 let's probably start with these 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.730
 relative novelties this updated 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.420
 series of decorative cosmetics secret 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.070
 store it appeared back in september 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.780
 catalogs in this in new design but 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.410
 just now I got to her 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.550
 I had time to order and try this one 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.269
 which is called a secret signal 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.279
 It costs 299 rubles. It is declared as 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.189
 voluminous and someone will have this mascara and 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.500
 I painted a pack I think many already you 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.590
 video frames she came here it is written 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.480
 these are three di cell brush evolution 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.910
 looks like this 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.899
 put on the eyelashes and I don't know will 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.850
 visible or not try so may show 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.469
 in principle, I like the effect of this 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.530
 me one layer is really created 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.690
 immediately such a marked amount indicated 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.910
 eyelashes form itself from this 6 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.949
 tassel I love these here still cars 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.170
 classic but minus i think you yourself 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.690
 already noticed this limiter look 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.640
 that's what condition it comes after 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.920
 several uses of mascara 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.020
 spills over the edges and in order not to 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.270
 there were lumps all the time 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.840
 brush this brush in a hurry 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.430
 For example, here is a little bit of myself and for centuries this 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.770
 mascara apply then it comes all 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.750
 removes to spend the final time 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.759
 the result is good you tried me very 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.460
 like also really by the way i don't 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.320
 noticed to irritate my eyes it 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.210
 carcass let's call it as hypoallergenic me 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.790
 sensitive eyes and I'm nothing 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.920
 did not notice here wu and also that to me 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.960
 like it is not stated as a stand or 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.689
 water resistant but it keeps very well 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.659
 that is, even if some kind of little 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.460
 my eyes will water or a little 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.380
 I know I have a fine rain 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.450
 keeps that is it does not showered 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.970
 lumps are not smeared by anyone in 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.710
 some black such traces that is me 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.240
 she seems very steadfast and this too 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.950
 I still do a big plus 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.979
 I liked everything I wanted to show you 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.869
 this is lipstick with tell you what to her 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.610
 I use only the second day but still 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.380
 decided to include this in this review 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.270
 show you because for the time being we haven't 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.360
 really like this lipstick too by the way 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.180
 very good ringing me 1 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.060
 I haven't heard bad reviews and when I 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.730
 chose a shade that at first seemed 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.980
 that the line is not quite for me because 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.400
 that there is no specific honey so light 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.410
 shades that I love and that of course 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.260
 something like a little task to me but then 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.540
 I decided to take this one shade 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.820
 romantic pink cat 47 16 thats always 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.830
 by the way all articles leave mexico 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.480
 below and you know not very much 1 here 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.280
 now this lipstick on my lips 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.740
 I think a very nice pink 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.870
 hue under such an explicit enough 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.430
 cold after all it is written that 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.410
 it smoothes the surface of the lips and 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.989
 take care thanks to grape oil 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.670
 bones of web pages elastic gentle 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.380
 protected from premature aging 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.520
 loss of a natural look it is by the way 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.440
 stacked 299 rubles seems to me great 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.690
 combination of price and quality because 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.400
 applied really easy peeling 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.470
 I did not emphasize to me, although I basically 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.750
 Now so here are a little dryish 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.670
 her head is kind and matt or 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.530
 velvety but not much 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.450
 such oily as sometimes too 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.310
 happens to know and texture to this you too 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.459
 noticed she cannot be said that 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.019
 completely opaque yes such straight here 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.390
 tight but not to say that she 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.420
 completely colorless and shine like this 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.670
 here is something in the middle 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.140
 density Omsk texture roll and 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.989
 it was possible with a very big discount 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.720
 order on board w ' this one here 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.850
 I help in the elite coffee shades and more 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.920
 foundation that I'll show you too 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.080
 decided to take a try even though 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.120
 that it was impossible to choose the right shade of lipstick and 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.470
 foundation he is generally in the sole 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.150
 option only this one 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.010
 elite coffee shade will be so 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.830
 This is of course not quite true for me. 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.000
 the matching color is therefore most likely 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.100
 gonna give my girlfriend i have on 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.610
 will take a girlfriend with a suitable color type 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.190
 which may suit this lipstick and 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.870
 Now all the more very fashionable 90 with their 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.940
 brown so matte lipstick 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.519
 generally brownish lipstick seems to me 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.410
 began to be perceived more favorably 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.850
 lately she is shining I hope 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.190
 not unreported be answer 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.090
 This is what concerns lipstick I repeat 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.069
 until very radios of sensations 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.950
 effect with you that I wanted to show you 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.819
 sorry secretaries this is a tonal reception 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.139
 double agent 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.500
 he again did not come on the stock stand 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:24.770
 499 rubles 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:27.419
 they are very budget and in it 2 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.760
 It turns out two means in one that is 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.729
 the foundation and the foundation itself in each 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.620
 15 milliliters and so here is the 2nd floor 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.050
 packs that is, you can click right away 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.639
 squeeze the two funds as possible for 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.880
 separately that I really have 1 because 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.169
 that did not fit and the shade it again 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.910
 Here is the basis I will try to use 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.700
 separately look like this again 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.440
 this is something like a serum 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.540
 I would say very , very so tender 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.300
 pleasant aroma but it can be said that 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.950
 I do nâ€™t even feel much of a perfume 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.410
 and the foundation itself 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.300
 he is of course a darkish principle if 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.180
 put it in a thin layer let's 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.880
 I will show, and now you have to blow off 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.410
 it adapts a bit to the skin tone 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.590
 common song what is it universal 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.820
 shade then for all but of course for 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.620
 snow white it's still dark colors 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.510
 of course it would be cool if you still 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.210
 there were a few shades I think 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.310
 because i'm releasing a tonal tool in 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.020
 one color is quite difficult to make 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.919
 so that it fits all here by the way 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.310
 written that also contains spf15 this 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.900
 creme 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.340
 not the last thing left for me and service 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.099
 to the story so here is such 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.410
 podvesochka ordered for shares she was 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.330
 presented in the catalog which is now 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.630
 acts and in the next I have it no longer 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.520
 I saw and in general it costs 400 rubles but 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.680
 if you order something from the series 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.320
 the secretary of this can take her for 200 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.460
 Here in this package and later written 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.900
 that it is an alloy of precious metals and 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.810
 covered it all up electroplated 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.310
 silver made in china and chain length 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.229
 70 centimeters 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:02.160
 Next was such a velvet 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:04.139
 black pouch and the pendant itself and the chain 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.150
 It looks like that for me just a long time ago 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:07.740
 I wanted a suspension 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.289
 Immediately decided that I would take it because 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.970
 void for a long time wanted 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:15.599
 I can not say that she somehow strongly 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.940
 It looks expensive to be honest and 400 rubles 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:19.000
 I am also wrong what it is worth if 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.980
 select filled 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.290
 Yes, I cost 200 rubles I think 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.240
 In principle, nothing I showed in 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.880
 some old faberlic video 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.950
 I also order a pendant and a bracelet 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.140
 such a summer they had 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.390
 presented the same thing written there 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.460
 that this is not precious metals but on top 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.680
 electroplated silver can say that 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.600
 after some time they start 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.820
 a little yellow they probably completed 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.290
 the first part of the video about ordering faberlic them 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.240
 The second part will tell you about others 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.130
 non-ruler products 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.810
 secretary solved thanks for watching 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.030

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.440
 please leave below and see you 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.440
 in the second part all bye
