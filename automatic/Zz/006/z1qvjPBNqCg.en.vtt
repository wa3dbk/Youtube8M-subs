00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.920 
this truck had to be have some
modifications<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.770> we<00:02:31.950> were<00:02:32.070> building<00:02:32.280> it

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
modifications to it we were building it

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.180 
modifications to it we were building it
he's<00:02:33.930> got<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.580> 5.5<00:02:35.580> o:nen<00:02:36.260> generator<00:02:37.260> LP<00:02:37.950> gas

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
he's got a 5.5 o:nen generator LP gas

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.810 
he's got a 5.5 o:nen generator LP gas
driven<00:02:38.820> inside<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:40.440> if<00:02:40.890> Shore<00:02:41.070> power<00:02:41.310> cord<00:02:41.640> is

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
driven inside and if Shore power cord is

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.470 
driven inside and if Shore power cord is
on<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> shelf<00:02:42.180> inside<00:02:42.600> his<00:02:42.810> rack<00:02:44.060> we<00:02:45.060> had<00:02:45.210> to<00:02:45.330> do

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
on a shelf inside his rack we had to do

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.960 
on a shelf inside his rack we had to do
the<00:02:46.200> modification<00:02:47.010> here<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.520> build<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.790> gas

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
the modification here and build a gas

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.260 
the modification here and build a gas
tank<00:02:48.330> system<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:48.870> move<00:02:48.990> it<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.560> interior

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
tank system and move it to the interior

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.190 
tank system and move it to the interior
product<00:02:51.270> so<00:02:51.450> we<00:02:51.510> had<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:51.690> change<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.050> wheel

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
product so we had to change the wheel

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.200 
product so we had to change the wheel
wells<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.710> drop<00:02:52.830> them<00:02:52.980> down<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.790> change<00:02:54.060> the

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
wells and drop them down to change the

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.390 
wells and drop them down to change the
gas<00:02:54.360> line<00:02:54.720> direction<00:02:54.960> so<00:02:55.740> we<00:02:55.860> pull<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.160> cap

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
gas line direction so we pull the cap

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.490 
gas line direction so we pull the cap
system<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.000> got<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.240> mounted<00:02:57.420> here<00:02:57.780> naturally

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
equipment that had to go over the top so

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.140 
equipment that had to go over the top so
we<00:04:11.709> had<00:04:11.829> to<00:04:11.949> build<00:04:12.099> some<00:04:12.370> lake<00:04:12.549> systems<00:04:13.000> for

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
we had to build some lake systems for

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.509 
we had to build some lake systems for
them<00:04:13.269> one<00:04:13.389> on<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.599> other<00:04:13.689> side<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:14.400> make<00:04:15.400> it

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
them one on the other side and make it

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.759 
them one on the other side and make it
all<00:04:15.639> work<00:04:15.819> out<00:04:16.000> so<00:04:16.389> it<00:04:16.570> wasn't<00:04:16.870> too<00:04:16.989> high<00:04:17.169> and

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
all work out so it wasn't too high and

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.770

but feed the top where the where the I
said<00:06:48.300> everything<00:06:48.570> is<00:06:48.690> the<00:06:48.930> counters<00:06:49.290> hinge

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
said everything is the counters hinge

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.620 
said everything is the counters hinge
for<00:06:50.310> it<00:06:50.370> lifts<00:06:50.610> up<00:06:50.820> and<00:06:50.970> they<00:06:51.060> have<00:06:51.150> access<00:06:51.570> to

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630 
for it lifts up and they have access to

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.240 
for it lifts up and they have access to
go<00:06:51.870> down<00:06:52.020> in<00:06:52.170> here<00:06:52.320> and<00:06:52.470> reload<00:06:52.740> this<00:06:52.950> from<00:06:53.130> the

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
go down in here and reload this from the

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.310 
go down in here and reload this from the
inside<00:06:53.340> without<00:06:54.180> anybody<00:06:54.660> getting<00:06:54.840> lonely

inside without anybody getting lonely
hope<00:06:55.470> that<00:06:55.650> something<00:06:55.860> drop<00:06:56.070> some<00:06:56.310> in<00:06:56.460> it<00:06:56.580> and

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 
hope that something drop some in it and

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.910 
hope that something drop some in it and
so<00:06:57.890> the<00:06:58.890> truck<00:06:59.790> also<00:07:00.230> you<00:07:01.230> see<00:07:01.440> up<00:07:01.560> here<00:07:01.590> has<00:07:01.890> a

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:01.920 
so the truck also you see up here has a

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.710 
so the truck also you see up here has a
stereo<00:07:02.190> system<00:07:02.520> in<00:07:02.850> it<00:07:02.940> besides<00:07:03.270> the<00:07:03.420> TV

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 
stereo system in it besides the TV

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.510 
stereo system in it besides the TV
system<00:07:04.170> and<00:07:04.410> the<00:07:04.830> speakers<00:07:05.220> are<00:07:05.370> on<00:07:05.400> the

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
system and the speakers are on the

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.040 
system and the speakers are on the
outside<00:07:05.940> and<00:07:06.000> the<00:07:06.270> speakers<00:07:06.600> are<00:07:06.720> up<00:07:06.810> front

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
outside and the speakers are up front

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.050 
outside and the speakers are up front
here<00:07:07.230> underneath<00:07:07.500> the<00:07:07.680> front<00:07:07.950> so<00:07:08.190> you<00:07:08.940> got

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
here underneath the front so you got

a seed present lights and pretty well

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.910 
a seed present lights and pretty well
finished<00:07:22.440> up<00:07:22.620> and<00:07:23.990> just<00:07:24.990> another<00:07:25.230> example<00:07:25.500> of

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:25.920 
finished up and just another example of

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.860 
finished up and just another example of
setting<00:07:26.640> the<00:07:26.730> windows<00:07:27.090> back<00:07:27.270> building<00:07:27.780> the

we got we had an idea of what he wanted
we<00:07:34.950> drew<00:07:35.130> some<00:07:35.310> pictures<00:07:35.510> and<00:07:36.510> we'll<00:07:36.720> build<00:07:36.870> it

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 
we drew some pictures and we'll build it

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.790 
we drew some pictures and we'll build it
so<00:07:38.150> whatever<00:07:39.150> your<00:07:39.330> imagination<00:07:39.590> may<00:07:40.590> make

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:45.150 
over we'll sit down and we'll figure it

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.490 
over we'll sit down and we'll figure it
out<00:07:45.300> and<00:07:45.540> we'll<00:07:45.690> draw<00:07:45.900> a<00:07:45.930> plane<00:07:46.169> and<00:07:46.410> we'll

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:46.500 
out and we'll draw a plane and we'll

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:57.070 
out and we'll draw a plane and we'll
build<00:07:46.710> it<00:07:46.860> so<00:07:47.640> come<00:07:47.850> see<00:07:48.060> us
