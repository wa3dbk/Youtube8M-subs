better

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
better

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.240 
better
and<00:04:15.060> more<00:04:15.450> detail<00:04:15.840> so<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.500> probably<00:04:16.739> recommend

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
and more detail so I probably recommend

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.979

him<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.400> little<00:04:17.669> more<00:04:17.850> but<00:04:18.510> definitely<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:18.959> think

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
him a little more but definitely I think

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.479
