 strength as we are saying and today I 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.250

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.100
 how much we like the looks and 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:20.540
 the outfits in this case we're going to do 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:24.020
 four outfits with white pants and 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.080
 black patterned are coming for this 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.630
 spring for this summer a million 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.720
 different prints on the pants 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:37.130
 with flowers with stripes with pictures with 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.689
 rhombuses with anything goes then 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.920
 has pointed me to this trend so 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:46.490
 cool and I bought a pair of pants 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.049
 printed with black and white rhombuses 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.880
 agreement I'm looking down because 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.740
 I take them already then so 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.780
 tell you well the characteristic of 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.060
 pants with white and black rolls 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.100
 it's a pair of pants that when I saw it I 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.360
 I fell in love with him because the truth that I 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.960
 I remembered a lot as the trend 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.390
 or the French Parisian looks 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.479
 a look at the corner if you did not like it 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.670
 very much very much then I have 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.100
 acquired is a very pegadito pants 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.550
 very finite vale perfect for summer 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.650
 for spring that does like the 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.020
 effect of a leggings or a jean like 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.480
 you want to call him and then I'm going to 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.490
 teach how to combine these trousers 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.110
 a very basic way okay do not we go to 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.850
 do anything so super out of the ordinary 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.220
 because we're going to combine it with some 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.040
 very basic shirts and let's make a 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.380
 look black and white bicolor the 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.360
 Parisians that we are going to take I am here 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.120
 as measured the Parisians that we are going to 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.890
 carry are the same all the time you're 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:53.380
 Parisians with you already see with one as a 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:56.470
 here with a cream then we 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.000
 they will come super well to combine 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.340
 this pants with these shirts 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.680
 Basic girls do not move from there and you 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.700
 I see the end of the first look video 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:12.019
 very basic black tank top 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:15.170
 with a message we take it out by 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.659
 outside right in the front 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:22.370
 we have put on a golden belt with 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:24.889
 chain and a necklace also in gold and 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.439
 black that combines perception with 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:32.329
 belt a watch in gold and black 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:34.189
 also to complete this outfit here 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.970
 We see the Parisians that I have taught you 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:39.500
 at the beginning of the cream and golden video 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.800
 we liked 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.950
 second aid we carry a chrome top in 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.880
 black with broken and golden letters and a 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.250
 black leather belt 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.800
 so that the trousers do not rise well 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.290
 waist and mark us the way one 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.570
 round gold bracelet very simple 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.150
 that combines with our gold watch and 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.250
 I entered second to a completed cid 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.020
 third outfit 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.390
 taking advantage of this pants is very 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.330
 pegadito and can go through leggins we 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:14.460
 we have put a long black shirt 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:18.230
 with a lovely kitty pattern but 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:21.290
 and if we better put it on 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.590
 is much more sexy with that shoulder 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.680
 and that little one in the air my fourth and last 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.600
 axis a long shirt also like what 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.650
 above with a patterned Christmas 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:37.250
 but let's see I think it's going to be a lot 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.830
 better put it on like the black shirt 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.680
 that we have seen in the third out set 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.940
 we take the whole shirt forward and 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.830
 we make a knot that is apparent 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.800
 let's leave just the height where 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.080
 ends the waist of the pants I do not 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:59.390
 say you do not stay infinitely see 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:04.030
 and of course what we see and pine 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.030
 makes a lovely figure 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:14.300
 you have seen figure beautiful figure but 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:18.110
 think a little bit and if we get off the 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.720
 much more sexy shoulder do not believe me 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.290
 I really like to take my shoulder to the air 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.470
 ntx I have to recognize it if the success of 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.780
 new that we liked the looks that 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:33.140
 we have done in black and white with this 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.550
 printed trousers I do not expect that yes no 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.920
 forget to leave me in the little box 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.710
 comments which one you liked 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.280
 more if the 1 or the 2 in ways that 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:46.070
 tell you the pants printed to me 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.920
 is that I love them is that I also 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:52.360
 the time to dress I do not like to be not me 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.360
 like to be traditional nor 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.310
 and have a wardrobe for saying so 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.860
 Do not call attention to me if I 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.930
 so I'm going to it so I'm going to 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.330
 deny I like to draw attention with the 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.580
 dress yes it is true that there is 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.260
 days that you like so good to go a 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.700
 little more arranged than others or that 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.280
 you have more desire to go higher than 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.720
 other days but I do not like the 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.210
 garments that pass totally 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.410
 unnoticed I have of course because 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.130
 There are times when you have to 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:24.440
 wear that kind of clothes but for 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.600
 general rule I like to have clothes that 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.850
 have personality and match 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.680
 my personality also and with my 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.920
 character and with my style these 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:37.190
 printed pants because the truth is 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.350
 that people usually say that the 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.639
 stamped depending on which of 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.409
 giordano 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:44.909
 that there is no pledge that we 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:46.949
 fattening 

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:49.229
 a garment makes us fat if we 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:51.840
 it we are fat and we feel 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.400
 short if you buy a garment that 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.310
 the rest of the world says that it's going to 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.469
 get fat but you put it on and you look 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:01.620
 divine with her that pledge I assure you 

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:04.650
 Slimline you because you're worth it because 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.689
 with good attitude with positive attitude and 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.060
 with the attitude that you look beautiful 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:10.560
 and pretty these pants, many of them 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.210
 you or many of you can 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.000
 to be thinking what I'm going to do a big ass 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:18.479
 huge and that they stick too much on me 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.419
 thigh and they mark me too much to me 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:23.810
 They love me I look beautiful I think that I 

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:27.300
 they make an ass very jumpy 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:30.150
 and well I do not know I love it I love the 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:33.300
 figure that I have with them so 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:35.940
 no clothes do not make them fatter 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.170
 we are the ones who make ourselves more 

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.710
 mental fat 

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:43.350
 comfortable senses with what you wear and not 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:46.020
 there will be absolutely no fear that 

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.960
 you may wear whatever you want you 

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:51.330
