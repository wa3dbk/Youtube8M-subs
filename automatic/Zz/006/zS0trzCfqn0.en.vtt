00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.069
 a bit after that to cinema dishes 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.320
 You probably know the mission but very, very 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.269
 useful and better to use your 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.070
 ration regularly so watch this 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.440
 video i will show you my version 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.770
 at the board on us for cooking 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.270
 need the movie itself of course I take 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.130
 here is such a glass here 200 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.760
 milliliters per two people 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.029
 further it is vegetables i take zucchini im pepper 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.830
 red sweet champignons and spinach you 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.840
 can take less vegetables you can 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.399
 there are other vegetables in general, which are 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.690
 you like me i will show you exactly this 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.750
 option with these vegetables 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.969
 further it is onions i take leeks and you 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.940
 can see ordinary bulb head 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.730
 garlic and ginger ginger and here I am 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.289
 I consider an important ingredient in quantity 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.360
 again , you can watch less 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.760
 the more the more you take the more 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.280
 vigorous is Okinawa dish of her 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.870
 not pronounced taste and vegetables in principle 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.719
 has such a neutral taste therefore 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.449
 good by add ginger so little 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.580
 to diversify to make a string u in our 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.780
 dish and also I advise using 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.390
 for example chilli black pepper salt 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.479
 of course so let's start a movie 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.650
 we boil for 10-15 minutes therefore 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.990
 let's cook a little later 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.229
 prepare vegetables cut Bulgarian 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.229
 pepper 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.539
 we cut a thorn green 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.159
 then zucchini why say you can 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.810
 take any vegetables there are no 10 clear 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.409
 rules and what you can take at all 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.929
 just one carrot or 1 zucchini or 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.840
 There color lines carrot or mushrooms 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.539
 important important you will see the principle itself 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.479
 As you can cook it and Ken 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.310
 combined with vegetables will collect and there already 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.679
 you will continue to experiment 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.929
 then take spinach and finely cut it 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.720
 you can take if you are not fresh 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.960
 frozen spin and just freeze 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.360
 his and squeeze also use 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.290
 so we have to cut the garlic 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.290
 white 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.250
 my perfect combination of sharpness but not 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.800
 too when so vigorous is probably 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.030
 that's when chopped ginger turns out 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.030
 like 2 heads of garlic 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.969
 ingredients are prepared and can 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.889
 put the movie says 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.900
 boil and and as written on 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:35.849
 packaging or your favorite way i 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.799
 I cook just 10 15 minutes on medium heat 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.689
 and at the same time we turn on the already 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.549
 warm up on the sly to fry 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.760
 vegetables when the surface warms up 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:47.250
 add olive oil and we can 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:53.540
 add already onions garlic and 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:56.609
 kind of so we need seconds of the heat requested 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.730
 then add the mushrooms well 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.799
 and stir fried mushrooms as pairs 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.530
 minutes and literally something mushrooms are here 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:10.109
 so much fry can add 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:12.870
 and all the help we mix well 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.579
 fry on high heat all the time so 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.620
 just a couple more minutes 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.620
 and this is all fried film 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:28.569
 and then we add pepper all over again 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.769
 mix well and stirring so 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.760
 continue to fry 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:36.500
 that according to the novel. 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.220
 and we need to add spinach 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:44.209
 watered can be ill at the middle fire 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.209
 mix well 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.290
 and now we can supply add 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.810
 spice 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:58.110
 add black pepper add both 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.170
 chillin and so she's on average fire 3-5 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.799
 minutes literally until vegetables are ready 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.660
 We put out the little that's actually 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.430
 this way of cooking vegetables and 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.640
 such a combination is generally beautiful 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.579
 suitable for rice noodles krisu with beans 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.100
 and now we can add ready here 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.320
 Quinoa we will eat with you this dish with 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.320
 Quinoa is still a movie it is very useful and 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.680
 unlike the same rice noodles and and 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.150
 best consumed in your diet 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.039
 regularly we can make fire a little 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.900
 above average and still literally 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:34.280
 minute 2 like this all together 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.280
 fry and everything will be ready 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.270
