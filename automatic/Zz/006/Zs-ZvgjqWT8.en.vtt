00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
to measure yourself you can just get a

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.359 
to measure yourself you can just get a
tape<00:01:54.960> measure<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.890> one's<00:01:56.100> really

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
tape measure like this this one's really

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.580 
tape measure like this this one's really
short<00:01:56.700> actually<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.600> found<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.200> random

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
short actually I just found this random

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.249 
short actually I just found this random
one<00:01:58.740> because<00:01:59.130> I've<00:01:59.579> lost<00:02:00.060> mine<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.750> think<00:02:01.079> I

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
one because I've lost mine I think I

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.620 
one because I've lost mine I think I
sucked<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.950> up<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.369> Hoover<00:02:02.640> but<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.450> is

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
sucked it up in the Hoover but this is

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.630 
sucked it up in the Hoover but this is
just<00:02:03.840> like<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.259> tape<00:02:04.890> measure<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.460> what<00:02:05.579> it

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
just like a tape measure this is what it

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.100 
just like a tape measure this is what it
looks<00:02:05.820> like

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
looks like

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.109 
looks like
I'm<00:02:07.620> pretty<00:02:07.950> sure<00:02:08.130> you<00:02:08.340> all<00:02:08.520> know<00:02:08.700> what<00:02:08.880> tape

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
I'm pretty sure you all know what tape

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.120 
I'm pretty sure you all know what tape
measures<00:02:09.479> look<00:02:09.630> like<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.410> inch<00:02:10.710> side

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
measures look like this is the inch side

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.430 
measures look like this is the inch side
so<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.460> recommend<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.540> measure<00:02:12.750> yourself<00:02:12.960> in

3 pounds so you know I prefer to weigh
myself<00:03:12.120> in<00:03:13.220> pounds<00:03:14.220> just<00:03:14.489> because<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:15.090> was

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
myself in pounds just because it was

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.670 
myself in pounds just because it was
easier<00:03:15.660> for<00:03:15.720> me<00:03:15.900> but<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.350> doesn't<00:03:16.530> really

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
easier for me but it doesn't really

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.530 
easier for me but it doesn't really
matter<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.160> can<00:03:17.430> weigh<00:03:17.549> yourself<00:03:17.730> in<00:03:18.180> any
