00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.309
 the lato sensu therapists alright with 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.199
 you 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.920
 Our video lesson today will be about the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.109
 the field of immunology specifically 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.680
 secondary immunodeficiency content 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.060
 or acquired to converse 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.449
 we need to know what a 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.759
 immunodeficiency in general in one 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.950
 deficiency of the immune system and 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.020
 protect against diseases and malignancies 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.960
 can be divided into a disability 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.579
 that is caused by a defect in the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.579
 development of the system 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.440
 immunodeficiency secondary 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.360
 are diseases that directly affect 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.309
 cells leaving the system 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.610
 immunologically susceptible to 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.670
 adverse reactions against pathogens are 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.969
 or inherited by genetic predisposition 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.120
 and arise due to poor nutrition traumas 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.690
 biological or chemical agents and 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.700
 immunosuppressants 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.010
 among the regulatory agents will be 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.189
 the human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.330
 that hiv is the human photoshop virus 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.549
 1 and 2 that htlv in adults the majority of 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.439
 cases of a secondary disability to 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.110
 better understanding of disability week 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.630
 we need to study AIDS is 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.780
 married to the virus 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.729
 human immunodeficiency virus as all 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.110
 the acquired immunodeficiencies are 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.840
 understood through understanding 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.390
 of this pathology as we saw previously 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.509
 we have two types of hiv 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.210
 hiv type 1 is a somewhat 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.030
 only seconds 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.700
 of the human body so it is usually 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.220
 fast attacks the immune system 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.420
 to enter the human body attacks cells 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.090
 CD4 that would be imposed on you our 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.510
 critical ballot 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.850
 thereby 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.620
 the primary receptor promoting fusion 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.080
 between the viral envelope and the 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.940
 allowing the virus to enter the 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.040
 which develops whether from agents 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.590
 opportunists who invade our organism 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:16.720
 due to the decrease of the cells of 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:19.440
 he plays defense type 2 was identified 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.880
 in 1986 as a new etiological agent 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.790
 similar to hiv type 1 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.430
 the main difference between viruses in 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.490
 relation to its genomic structure and 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.650
 city ​​hygiene 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.240
 it has pathogenic potential and 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.300
 lower transmissibility 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.670
 presented by type 1 hiv usually 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.240
 individuals infected with the hiv type 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.640
 2 has a longer survival with 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.360
 this image we can better understand the 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.160
 functioning of the HIV virus and in che 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.790
 first performs the cells 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.120
 expressed cd4 including t cells 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.920
 and macrophages therefore 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.470
 has two copies of the gene here 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.989
 transcribed without the complementary DNA 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.550
 reverse transcriptase are inserted into the 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.040
 cell chromosome 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.760
 the integrated form of the virus is called 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.760
 provided 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.910
 the complex that protects the viral envelope 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.800
 high affinity for 64 mt and 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.420
 fusion of the viral envelope with the membrane 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.940
 of the cell 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.730
 the virus entry merger depends on the 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.480
 presence of a receptor on the 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.500
 cell being cck and yes with the main 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.290
 receptor 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.810
 AIDS is a disease that spreads from 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.000
 a very fast way in the present day 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.920
 both in developed countries and in 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.190
 developing countries 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.739
 The best remedy for this is prevention. 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.260
 this is clear, but the diagnosis 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.180
 is essential for the success of the 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.320
 treatment of patients with 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.150
 virus 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.489
 the inclusion of new drugs for 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.720
 treatment significantly increased the 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.780
 patients' life expectancy 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.590
 patients with HIV when compared to 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.280
 the last decade 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.080
 currently searching 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.000
 being constantly developed with the 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.830
 objective of being able to inhibit the 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.080
 devastating AIDS virus 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.209
 now we will talk about another virus 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.180
 virus on photoshop.com human or 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.630
 simply reach the TV that corresponds 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.400
 to a return from the same hiv family 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.580
 infecting the human t cell 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.400
 there are two types of this htlv virus in the 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.350
 type 1 and htlv type 2 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.900
 the former is associated with 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.750
 degenerative neurological disorders and 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.930
 such as leukemia and lymphoma 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.390
 of human adult t cells discovered 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.419
 in the 80's it is made t cells 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.760
 but has low viral load 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:53.169
 it is more difficult to contract if 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:57.070
 compared with the hiv polymyositis virus if 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:59.110
 looking at kits and listeners are diseases 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.030
 which are related to this type of 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.090
 virus 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.889
 the same way as hiv htlv 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.620
 transmitted by sexual intercourse more 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.660
 unprotected sex in the 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.450
 transfusions through the use of 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.390
 sharing of hospital matrices and 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.669
 from mother to child during pregnancy with 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.560
 breastfeeding and at the time of delivery 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.890
 another example of immunodeficiency 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.080
 secondary diseases are autoimmune diseases that 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.690
 correspond to a condition that occurs 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.690
 when the immune system attacks and 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.000
 destroys healthy body tissues 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.300
 improperly causing destruction 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.680
 of one or more tissue types of the body 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.740
 abnormal growth of an organ and 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.810
 change in the function of an organ one 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.530
 autoimmune disease can affect or 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.919
 organs 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.840
 the type of tissue where the organs or 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.000
 affected tissues may present more 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.760
 of a disease at the same time an example 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.130
 of disease is the type of diabetes 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.500
 1 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.419
 Type 1 diabetes is caused by 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.830
 destruction of the cells producing 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.110
 insulin as a result of a defect 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.840
 immune system in which the antibodies 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.600
 attack the cells that produce it 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.640
 hormone to diabetes with 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.660
 five to ten percent of patients with 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.790
 this problem 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.220
 within this subject we also have a 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:22.180
 text affliction of organs that can be 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.320
 exemplified by renal insufficiency 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.780
 corresponding to the sudden loss of 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.760
 Kidney capacity to have is to remove 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.990
 waste and concentrate the urine without losing 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.850
 electronics 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.100
 it has many possible causes for 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:37.610
 Kidney damage may be due to 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:40.190
 dehydration hemorrhages shock injuries 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.240
 serious diseases surgeries among 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.280
 others 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.930
 when its characteristics appear 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.150
 diseases such as diabetes insufficiency 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.500
 kidney are usually installed in the 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.720
 body a long time ago 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.150
 infections autoimmune diseases can 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.430
 be less young and thus the first 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:58.670
 evidence of these meals may be the 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.320
 complications, ie the system 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.780
 immunological 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.220
 so people this is what I hope you 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.050
 have enjoyed and until a 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.050
 video call bye
