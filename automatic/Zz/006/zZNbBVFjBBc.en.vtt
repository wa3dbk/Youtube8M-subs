00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
the axes I'm not sure which one it is

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.100

there is my Haxorus and shiny care blast

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.400 
there is my Haxorus and shiny care blast
that's<00:04:44.440> awesome<00:04:45.990> really<00:04:46.990> wanted<00:04:47.229> one<00:04:47.380> of

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
that's awesome really wanted one of

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.310 
that's awesome really wanted one of
these<00:04:47.560> things<00:04:48.270> okay<00:04:49.270> so<00:04:49.330> I<00:04:49.840> don't<00:04:50.020> know<00:04:50.139> what

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
these things okay so I don't know what

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.950 
these things okay so I don't know what
that<00:04:50.349> is<00:04:50.530> but<00:04:51.310> I'm<00:04:51.370> going<00:04:51.550> to<00:04:51.639> guess<00:04:51.960> the

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
that is but I'm going to guess the

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.750 
that is but I'm going to guess the
nature's<00:04:53.289> brave<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:55.300> it<00:04:56.080> is<00:04:56.370> plus<00:04:57.370> Stevens

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
nature's brave and it is plus Stevens

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.820 
nature's brave and it is plus Stevens
minus<00:04:58.090> special<00:04:58.389> defense<00:04:58.690> I<00:04:58.870> think<00:04:59.289> that<00:04:59.560> it's

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
minus special defense I think that it's

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.500 
minus special defense I think that it's
kind<00:05:00.070> of<00:05:00.190> good<00:05:00.370> for<00:05:00.400> s<00:05:00.639> cavalier<00:05:01.090> I<00:05:01.150> think<00:05:01.389> it

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
kind of good for s cavalier I think it

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.540 
kind of good for s cavalier I think it
has<00:05:01.599> high<00:05:01.780> defense<00:05:02.199> but<00:05:02.409> I'm<00:05:02.500> not<00:05:02.650> sure<00:05:02.680> no

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
has high defense but I'm not sure no

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.700 
has high defense but I'm not sure no
idea<00:05:03.849> but<00:05:04.570> it<00:05:04.750> looks<00:05:04.930> like<00:05:05.020> kind<00:05:05.409> of<00:05:05.440> like<00:05:05.500> one

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
idea but it looks like kind of like one

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.990 
idea but it looks like kind of like one
of<00:05:05.740> those<00:05:05.860> hit<00:05:06.070> and<00:05:06.190> miss<00:05:06.310> nature's<00:05:06.699> I'm<00:05:06.880> not

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
of those hit and miss nature's I'm not

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.149 
of those hit and miss nature's I'm not
really<00:05:07.120> sure<00:05:07.240> though<00:05:07.539> but<00:05:08.530> whatever<00:05:08.949> I<00:05:09.039> could

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 
really sure though but whatever I could

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:11.490 
really sure though but whatever I could
care<00:05:09.460> less<00:05:09.490> anyway<00:05:10.030> so<00:05:11.020> let's<00:05:11.110> show<00:05:11.320> it<00:05:11.349> in

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500
