00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.069
 easy to get pepsi company but 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:07.530

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:23.019

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:33.879
 better and then nothing we follow this once 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.959
 entered we give you play we are entering 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:40.299
 in random terrain and we put a name 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.090
 I really do not know how to save the maps 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.560
 here and there I already made like three here I do not 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.170
 keep them this time I will put 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.440
 give our to my map 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.300
 is generating us it 's going to take a lot and 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.370
 I repeat, I hope for value in this work 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.830
 because I do not bring them any any 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.239
 game that I find out there if I do not try 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:05.440
 much if the best one has the best 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.209
 graphics best game mode this is the 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.590
 I put and I bring them because I want 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.650
 share it with you 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.560
 then I do not expect anything from the balls 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.640
 here the camera moves with the buttons 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.819
 four triangles circle and x 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.849
 we move with the stick 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.310
 we change things with the analogue pad 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:30.980
 upwards down look at this is 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.160
 he brought them because he is the one that resembles 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:38.060
 more in the pc graphics many were 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.250
 very very pixelated very square good 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.290
 minecraft receiver square but 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.790
 good the bad thing about this is that it generates 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.390
 a land look at already you see the limit 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.330
 of the terrain is blue this generates us 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.370
 very small grounds why then 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.720
 because if it's a bit heavy this for 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:01.250
 the pcpe we jump with the select we break 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.230
 things with the trigger and we put with lr 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.420
 look at this I brought them why 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.290
 the water has movement 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.410
 and it looks better in leaves I put water and 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.090
 I put in but 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.600
 we have to put them in one place 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.600
 where you see 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.980
 to see why good in another more 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.990
 so that it generates you by day 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.730
 you are going up 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.650
 I do not see anything this map does not see anything 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.560
 I would not have put him in such a way that I would have 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.930
 put another name as sun 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.600
 look here we are already 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.000
 the water has a movement look here 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.900
 is the limit is a human look at the 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.410
 we put how it expands and looks 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.009
 transparent 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.380
 the other minecraft did not have that here 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.930
 It looks very opaque but on your pc, because I 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.910
 I'm seeing very well in the psp in the 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.580
 laptop looks very ugly but on the pc but 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.199
 this one will look great also look at that 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.860
 the costumes because the lava is also 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:05.580
 expands example in the lava cart 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.310
 Youtube 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:12.300
 we do not look 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:15.560
 I can not die and also because with this 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.560
 we can generator 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.560
 what is your name 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:24.370
 stone and stone generator look 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:28.020
 there is already generating there was water 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.020
 they have we put water 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.270
 it never takes a bit 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:42.760
 it has sound the water is already generated stone 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.800
 although as I told you in the version 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:49.790
 of psp takes much longer 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:53.070
 for other reasons I already died spawn 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.840
 I hope you liked this the truth 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.690
 I do not know how to fly the maps because 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:01.380
 less than twice because I think it's 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:03.720
 the mister or something like that, I have not tried the 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.880
 another I think I'm because he already believes as 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.160
 five maps and I already made sauces because it's 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.480
 very entertaining because there are stairs 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.480
 books there is everything to do their 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.480
 torches 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:21.060
 there's also what I liked that also 

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:24.020
 there is 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:27.050
 where is glass 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.840
 to make the windows 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.370
 and with and well nothing gentlemen I hope value 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.069
 in this online work a 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:37.940
 subscription this good takes away a lot 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:41.449
 time and they encourage me to look for more 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:44.000
 games and bring them to you because 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:47.150
 they are for you at the end of the day because 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.039
