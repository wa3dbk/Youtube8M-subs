and screw it especially in my case where
it's<00:02:51.140> a<00:02:51.170> plastic<00:02:51.410> adapter<00:02:51.890> I<00:02:52.160> was<00:02:52.459> worried<00:02:52.849> the

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
it's a plastic adapter I was worried the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.570 
it's a plastic adapter I was worried the
threaded<00:02:53.660> rod<00:02:53.870> was<00:02:54.110> going<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.530> be<00:02:55.220> too<00:02:55.400> much

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
threaded rod was going to be too much

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.030 
threaded rod was going to be too much
for<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.910> adapter<00:02:56.330> so<00:02:56.569> I<00:02:56.599> took<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:57.560> microphone

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
for the adapter so I took the microphone

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.570 
for the adapter so I took the microphone
clip<00:02:58.400> off<00:02:59.650> then<00:03:00.650> I<00:03:00.770> took<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:01.040> two<00:03:01.190> nuts<00:03:01.430> that

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
clip off then I took the two nuts that

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.640 
clip off then I took the two nuts that
are<00:03:01.640> mentioning<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.150> tool<00:03:02.360> list<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.840> two<00:03:03.020> 3/8

are mentioning the tool list the two 3/8

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.640 
are mentioning the tool list the two 3/8
inch<00:03:04.160> nuts<00:03:04.819> and<00:03:05.120> then<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:05.930> attached<00:03:06.290> them<00:03:06.590> to

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
inch nuts and then I attached them to

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.030 
inch nuts and then I attached them to
the<00:03:07.220> end<00:03:07.459> of<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:07.670> threaded<00:03:08.030> rod<00:03:08.860> one<00:03:09.860> at<00:03:09.980> a

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
the end of the threaded rod one at a

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.780 
the end of the threaded rod one at a
time<00:03:11.200> at<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.349> very<00:03:12.530> end<00:03:12.800> so<00:03:13.250> that<00:03:13.550> they<00:03:13.730> were

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
time at the very end so that they were

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.690 
time at the very end so that they were
together<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.989> then<00:03:15.140> I<00:03:15.200> took<00:03:15.260> both<00:03:16.250> pairs<00:03:16.550> of

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
together and then I took both pairs of

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.770 
together and then I took both pairs of
pliers<00:03:17.500> gripped<00:03:18.500> both<00:03:18.980> nuts<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:20.180> went<00:03:20.720> ahead

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
pliers gripped both nuts and went ahead

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.770 
pliers gripped both nuts and went ahead
and<00:03:21.049> turned<00:03:21.290> them<00:03:21.940> against<00:03:22.940> each<00:03:23.000> other<00:03:23.239> to<00:03:23.660> go

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
and turned them against each other to go

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.870 
and turned them against each other to go
ahead<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.019> tighten<00:03:24.319> them<00:03:24.440> up<00:03:24.640> so<00:03:25.640> that<00:03:25.760> they

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
ahead and tighten them up so that they

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.860 
ahead and tighten them up so that they
would<00:03:26.060> not<00:03:26.269> move<00:03:28.060> after<00:03:29.060> I<00:03:29.330> did<00:03:29.510> that<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.690> know<00:03:29.840> I

would not move after I did that I know I

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.410 
would not move after I did that I know I
had<00:03:29.989> a<00:03:30.019> firm<00:03:30.290> place<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.799> grip<00:03:31.209> threaded<00:03:32.209> rod

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
had a firm place to grip threaded rod

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.839 
had a firm place to grip threaded rod
without<00:03:32.630> damaging<00:03:33.319> it<00:03:33.440> and<00:03:33.680> I<00:03:34.220> turned<00:03:34.549> the

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
without damaging it and I turned the

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.809 
without damaging it and I turned the
handle<00:03:35.410> until<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.709> threaded<00:03:37.069> rod<00:03:37.099> collapsed

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
handle until the threaded rod collapsed

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.729 
handle until the threaded rod collapsed
into<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.030> handle<00:03:38.480> until<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.380> nuts<00:03:39.590> actually

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
into the handle until the nuts actually

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.360 
into the handle until the nuts actually
touched<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.340> top<00:03:40.519> of<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.760> handle<00:03:42.190> once<00:03:43.190> that

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
touched the top of the handle once that

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.210 
touched the top of the handle once that
was<00:03:43.489> done<00:03:43.670> I<00:03:43.730> went<00:03:43.940> ahead<00:03:44.030> and<00:03:44.150> removed<00:03:44.599> the

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
was done I went ahead and removed the

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.530 
was done I went ahead and removed the
two<00:03:46.220> nuts<00:03:47.200> separated<00:03:48.200> them<00:03:48.349> by<00:03:48.380> turning<00:03:48.830> them

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
two nuts separated them by turning them

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.640 
two nuts separated them by turning them
opposite<00:03:50.540> of<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:50.900> way<00:03:51.019> that<00:03:51.170> I<00:03:51.260> tightened

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
opposite of the way that I tightened

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.039 
opposite of the way that I tightened
them<00:03:51.769> so<00:03:52.370> they<00:03:52.519> were<00:03:52.609> both<00:03:52.790> loose<00:03:53.090> then<00:03:53.870> I<00:03:53.900> went

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
them so they were both loose then I went

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.920 
them so they were both loose then I went
ahead<00:03:54.140> and<00:03:54.320> took<00:03:54.410> them<00:03:54.560> both<00:03:54.680> off<00:03:55.010> and<00:03:55.930> put

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
ahead and took them both off and put

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.349 
ahead and took them both off and put
them<00:03:56.989> in<00:03:57.109> my<00:03:57.200> parts<00:03:57.530> bin<00:03:57.769> because<00:03:58.160> their<00:03:59.000> job

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
them in my parts bin because their job

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.470 
them in my parts bin because their job
here<00:03:59.600> was<00:03:59.690> done<00:04:00.730> so<00:04:01.730> now<00:04:01.850> I've<00:04:01.910> got<00:04:02.060> a<00:04:02.090> handle

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
here was done so now I've got a handle

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.080 
here was done so now I've got a handle
with<00:04:02.660> three-eighths<00:04:03.590> inch<00:04:03.980> rod<00:04:04.310> sticking<00:04:04.970> out

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
with three-eighths inch rod sticking out

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.210 
with three-eighths inch rod sticking out
of<00:04:05.209> the<00:04:05.269> top<00:04:05.299> I<00:04:05.840> could<00:04:06.410> now<00:04:06.590> take<00:04:07.069> my

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
of the top I could now take my

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.580 
of the top I could now take my
microphone<00:04:07.700> clip<00:04:08.000> and<00:04:08.450> go<00:04:08.930> ahead<00:04:09.140> and<00:04:09.350> put<00:04:09.470> it

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
microphone clip and go ahead and put it

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.000 
microphone clip and go ahead and put it
back<00:04:10.120> onto<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.329> thread<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.079> tighten<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:12.799> down

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
back onto the thread and tighten it down

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.620 
back onto the thread and tighten it down
until<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.430> plastic<00:04:14.140> met<00:04:15.140> plastic<00:04:15.739> on<00:04:16.010> the

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
until the plastic met plastic on the

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.110 
until the plastic met plastic on the
microphone<00:04:17.630> clip<00:04:17.900> was<00:04:18.440> now<00:04:18.590> firmly<00:04:19.120> connected

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
microphone clip was now firmly connected

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.469 
microphone clip was now firmly connected
to<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:21.680> painters<00:04:22.010> pull<00:04:22.220> handle<00:04:25.180> okay<00:04:26.180> so<00:04:26.240> now

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
to the painters pull handle okay so now

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.850 
to the painters pull handle okay so now
we've<00:04:26.660> got<00:04:26.780> this<00:04:26.930> thing<00:04:26.990> built<00:04:27.380> what<00:04:27.560> do<00:04:27.620> we<00:04:27.710> do

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
we've got this thing built what do we do

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.110 
we've got this thing built what do we do
with<00:04:27.979> it<00:04:28.160> well<00:04:28.340> as<00:04:28.580> mentioned<00:04:29.000> earlier

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
with it well as mentioned earlier

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.760 
with it well as mentioned earlier
because<00:04:29.660> it's<00:04:29.840> based<00:04:30.110> on<00:04:30.289> a<00:04:30.350> paint<00:04:30.680> roller

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
because it's based on a paint roller

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.219 
because it's based on a paint roller
handle<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.520> will<00:04:31.639> fit<00:04:31.850> inside<00:04:32.060> I'll<00:04:32.900> fit<00:04:33.110> on

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
handle it will fit inside I'll fit on

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.980 
handle it will fit inside I'll fit on
top<00:04:33.380> of<00:04:33.500> any<00:04:33.820> painters<00:04:34.820> pole<00:04:35.090> or<00:04:35.360> extension

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
thread here that you've probably seen

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.400 
thread here that you've probably seen
before<00:04:39.340> you<00:04:40.340> can<00:04:40.490> use<00:04:40.760> any<00:04:41.120> different<00:04:41.930> lengths

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
before you can use any different lengths

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.620 
before you can use any different lengths
of<00:04:42.470> extensions<00:04:43.039> this<00:04:43.610> will<00:04:43.789> screw<00:04:44.090> right<00:04:44.300> down

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
of extensions this will screw right down

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.510 
of extensions this will screw right down
onto<00:04:44.990> this<00:04:45.110> and<00:04:45.289> if<00:04:45.380> you're<00:04:45.500> in<00:04:45.560> a<00:04:45.620> pinch<00:04:45.830> you

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
onto this and if you're in a pinch you

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.340 
onto this and if you're in a pinch you
can<00:04:46.610> always<00:04:46.789> unscrew<00:04:47.300> a<00:04:47.330> broom<00:04:47.780> handle<00:04:47.990> any

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
can always unscrew a broom handle any

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.860 
can always unscrew a broom handle any
broom<00:04:48.650> handle<00:04:49.070> will<00:04:49.940> fit<00:04:50.150> into<00:04:50.330> this<00:04:50.510> as<00:04:50.690> well

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
broom handle will fit into this as well

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.500 
broom handle will fit into this as well
so<00:04:51.200> that<00:04:51.470> can<00:04:51.590> be<00:04:51.710> pretty<00:04:51.860> handy<00:04:52.310> now<00:04:52.850> of

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
so that can be pretty handy now of

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.210 
so that can be pretty handy now of
course<00:04:53.690> if<00:04:54.020> you<00:04:54.169> put<00:04:54.410> your<00:04:54.500> microphone<00:04:54.710> in

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
course if you put your microphone in

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.620 
course if you put your microphone in
this<00:04:55.460> you're<00:04:55.820> gonna<00:04:55.970> get<00:04:56.120> a<00:04:56.180> lot<00:04:56.300> of<00:04:56.360> pull

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
this you're gonna get a lot of pull

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.080 
this you're gonna get a lot of pull
noise<00:04:56.930> or<00:04:57.169> operator<00:04:57.530> noise<00:04:57.800> because<00:04:58.280> all<00:04:58.580> of

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
noise or operator noise because all of

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.950 
noise or operator noise because all of
that<00:04:59.240> sound<00:04:59.570> or

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
that sound or

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.570 
that sound or
hands<00:05:00.169> moving<00:05:00.530> along<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.830> pole<00:05:01.069> or<00:05:01.310> whatever

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
hands moving along the pole or whatever

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.710 
hands moving along the pole or whatever
is<00:05:01.669> gonna<00:05:01.850> transmit<00:05:02.210> right<00:05:02.509> to<00:05:02.630> the

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
is gonna transmit right to the

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.210 
is gonna transmit right to the
microphone<00:05:03.199> so<00:05:03.889> we<00:05:04.130> are<00:05:04.280> going<00:05:04.550> to<00:05:04.699> put<00:05:04.970> the

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
microphone so we are going to put the

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.499 
microphone so we are going to put the
frugal<00:05:07.220> shockmount<00:05:07.699> here<00:05:08.000> that<00:05:08.120> we<00:05:08.180> built<00:05:08.419> a

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
frugal shockmount here that we built a

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.080 
frugal shockmount here that we built a
long<00:05:08.720> time<00:05:08.990> ago<00:05:09.259> right<00:05:10.039> into<00:05:10.280> this<00:05:10.370> device<00:05:10.759> and

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
long time ago right into this device and

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.999 
long time ago right into this device and
now<00:05:11.810> we<00:05:11.870> have<00:05:12.110> this<00:05:12.229> shock<00:05:12.530> mount<00:05:12.770> that<00:05:12.889> will

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
now we have this shock mount that will

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.430 
now we have this shock mount that will
insulate<00:05:13.460> our<00:05:13.610> microphone<00:05:14.090> and<00:05:14.419> any<00:05:15.020> kind<00:05:15.319> of

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
insulate our microphone and any kind of

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.350 
insulate our microphone and any kind of
pull<00:05:15.770> noise<00:05:16.039> on<00:05:16.310> any<00:05:16.460> kind<00:05:16.699> but<00:05:16.849> most<00:05:17.030> most

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
pull noise on any kind but most most

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.730 
pull noise on any kind but most most
noise<00:05:17.569> will<00:05:17.750> be<00:05:17.840> insulated<00:05:18.110> as<00:05:18.380> long<00:05:18.500> as<00:05:18.590> we're

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
noise will be insulated as long as we're

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.800 
noise will be insulated as long as we're

is<00:05:21.050> now<00:05:21.860> suspended<00:05:22.400> now<00:05:23.090> you<00:05:23.150> might<00:05:23.419> also

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 
is now suspended now you might also

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.219 
is now suspended now you might also
notice<00:05:23.930> that<00:05:24.699> when<00:05:25.699> this<00:05:25.940> is<00:05:26.330> not<00:05:26.569> on<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:27.050> pole

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
notice that when this is not on the pole

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:29.050 
notice that when this is not on the pole
when<00:05:27.560> it's<00:05:27.710> not<00:05:27.860> an<00:05:28.009> extension<00:05:28.370> pole<00:05:28.699> it<00:05:28.910> now

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
when it's not an extension pole it now

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.939 
when it's not an extension pole it now
becomes<00:05:29.419> a<00:05:29.569> nice<00:05:29.750> little<00:05:30.110> pistol<00:05:30.500> grip<00:05:30.710> so<00:05:30.860> if

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
becomes a nice little pistol grip so if

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.550 
becomes a nice little pistol grip so if
you<00:05:31.039> want<00:05:31.190> to<00:05:31.220> collect<00:05:31.460> any<00:05:31.669> audio<00:05:32.560> handheld

this little device is now a pistol grip

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.490 
this little device is now a pistol grip
something<00:05:38.060> I<00:05:38.360> didn't<00:05:38.539> have<00:05:38.599> before<00:05:38.810> but<00:05:39.229> but

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
something I didn't have before but but

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.830 
something I didn't have before but but
now<00:05:39.620> I<00:05:39.650> do<00:05:39.880> also<00:05:40.880> I<00:05:41.030> want<00:05:41.270> to<00:05:41.300> point<00:05:41.360> out<00:05:41.630> that

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
now I do also I want to point out that

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.310 
now I do also I want to point out that
if<00:05:41.960> you're<00:05:42.139> not<00:05:42.349> using<00:05:42.590> a<00:05:42.800> shotgun<00:05:43.120> mic<00:05:44.320> clip

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
if you're not using a shotgun mic clip

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.740 
if you're not using a shotgun mic clip
like<00:05:45.650> I'm<00:05:45.830> using<00:05:46.070> this<00:05:46.400> half-inch<00:05:46.880> PVC<00:05:47.270> pipe

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
like I'm using this half-inch PVC pipe

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.999 
like I'm using this half-inch PVC pipe
from<00:05:47.930> the<00:05:47.990> shock<00:05:48.229> mount<00:05:48.470> will<00:05:48.590> not<00:05:48.740> fit<00:05:48.979> in

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
from the shock mount will not fit in

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:51.339 
from the shock mount will not fit in
here<00:05:49.340> so<00:05:49.490> you'll<00:05:50.120> need<00:05:50.270> to<00:05:50.419> make<00:05:50.570> an<00:05:50.690> adapter<00:05:51.139> I

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.349 
here so you'll need to make an adapter I

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:53.409 
here so you'll need to make an adapter I
show<00:05:51.919> it<00:05:52.039> how<00:05:52.099> to<00:05:52.159> do<00:05:52.250> that<00:05:52.370> in<00:05:52.520> my<00:05:52.610> other<00:05:53.060> video

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
show it how to do that in my other video

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.950 
show it how to do that in my other video

and<00:05:58.520> I'll<00:05:58.699> show<00:05:58.880> you<00:05:58.940> how<00:05:59.090> to<00:05:59.120> make<00:05:59.389> an

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
and I'll show you how to make an

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.570 
and I'll show you how to make an
inexpensive<00:06:00.199> adapter<00:06:00.979> that<00:06:01.099> will<00:06:01.190> work<00:06:01.370> on<00:06:01.520> a

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
inexpensive adapter that will work on a

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.939 
inexpensive adapter that will work on a
larger<00:06:02.150> more<00:06:02.599> common<00:06:03.050> mic<00:06:03.259> clip<00:06:03.530> these<00:06:03.740> are

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:03.949 
larger more common mic clip these are

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:05.920 
larger more common mic clip these are
these<00:06:04.280> are<00:06:04.520> less<00:06:04.759> common<00:06:05.150> this<00:06:05.270> came<00:06:05.509> with<00:06:05.750> my

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
these are less common this came with my

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.390 
these are less common this came with my
shotgun<00:06:06.229> microphone<00:06:06.740> so<00:06:06.860> that's<00:06:07.009> why<00:06:07.130> I<00:06:07.159> have

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
shotgun microphone so that's why I have

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.520 
shotgun microphone so that's why I have
it<00:06:07.659> something<00:06:08.659> else<00:06:08.750> you<00:06:08.960> can<00:06:09.080> do<00:06:09.199> with<00:06:09.349> this

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
it something else you can do with this

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.570 
it something else you can do with this
is<00:06:09.860> you<00:06:10.820> can<00:06:10.849> unscrew<00:06:11.780> the<00:06:12.770> microphone<00:06:13.310> clip

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
is you can unscrew the microphone clip

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.719 
is you can unscrew the microphone clip
that<00:06:14.330> will<00:06:14.449> expose<00:06:14.840> the<00:06:14.900> 3/8<00:06:15.830> inch<00:06:16.099> thread<00:06:16.490> on

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
head on the top of a pole and this is

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.120 
head on the top of a pole and this is
1/4<00:06:35.150> 20<00:06:35.419> mm<00:06:35.750> which<00:06:35.960> will<00:06:36.080> go<00:06:36.169> into<00:06:36.409> any<00:06:36.560> camera

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
1/4 20 mm which will go into any camera

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.589 
1/4 20 mm which will go into any camera
so<00:06:37.639> you<00:06:37.729> can<00:06:37.880> essentially<00:06:38.330> have<00:06:38.449> an

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 
so you can essentially have an

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.300 
so you can essentially have an
inexpensive<00:06:38.810> crane<00:06:39.440> put<00:06:39.740> your<00:06:39.860> camera<00:06:40.039> on<00:06:40.190> the

inexpensive crane put your camera on the
end<00:06:40.340> of<00:06:40.460> the<00:06:40.550> pole<00:06:40.759> of<00:06:41.210> course<00:06:41.360> you<00:06:41.419> won't<00:06:41.479> be

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 
end of the pole of course you won't be

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:42.610 
end of the pole of course you won't be
able<00:06:41.719> to<00:06:41.780> see<00:06:42.050> the<00:06:42.199> monitor

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
able to see the monitor

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.320 
able to see the monitor
it's<00:06:43.070> a<00:06:43.159> figure<00:06:43.370> out<00:06:43.460> some<00:06:43.699> way<00:06:43.789> of<00:06:43.820> monitoring

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330 
it's a figure out some way of monitoring

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.890 
it's a figure out some way of monitoring
it<00:06:44.509> like<00:06:44.719> a<00:06:44.750> crane<00:06:45.139> but<00:06:46.070> you<00:06:46.159> can<00:06:46.310> also<00:06:46.460> add<00:06:46.900> any

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
it like a crane but you can also add any

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.719 
it like a crane but you can also add any
digital<00:06:48.469> audio<00:06:48.740> recorder<00:06:49.219> a<00:06:49.250> lot<00:06:49.460> of<00:06:49.520> people

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:49.729 
digital audio recorder a lot of people

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:51.189 
digital audio recorder a lot of people
are<00:06:49.820> using<00:06:50.090> digital<00:06:50.270> audio<00:06:50.659> recorders<00:06:51.080> like

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 
are using digital audio recorders like

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:55.080 
are using digital audio recorders like
the<00:06:51.320> zoom<00:06:51.500> h1<00:06:51.680> h4n<00:06:52.840> task<00:06:53.840> cam<00:06:54.139> models<00:06:54.620> as

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.090 
the zoom h1 h4n task cam models as

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.740 
the zoom h1 h4n task cam models as
microphones<00:06:56.090> instead<00:06:56.419> of<00:06:56.509> using<00:06:56.719> a

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:56.750 
microphones instead of using a

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.540
