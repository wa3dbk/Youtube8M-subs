00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.280
 hello everyone welcome to institute in 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.680
 this time we are going to solve a 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.709
 exercise of selectivity physics 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.860
 optics theme tell us that a ray of 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:17.160
 Wavelength light in vacuum 650 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.710
 nanometer strikes from the air on the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.240
 end of an optical fiber forming a 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.520
 teat angle with fiber axis 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:31.039
 being the and the refractive index n1 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:34.610
 within the fiber equal to 148 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.430
 it has been enough to ask us when 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.250
 is the wavelength of the light inside 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.050
 of fiber 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.900
 well then the first thing we have to 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.239
 know is that the frequency of a wave 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.230
 luminous does not change when passing from a medium 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.690
 to another 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.050
 so if the wavelength in the 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.620
 empty is the zero wave it will have 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.570
 a frequency 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.239
 what will we clear from the next 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.790
 expression we have that speed is 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.050
 same 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:09.190
 in the vacuum and multiplied frequency 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.370
 by the wavelength in the vacuum 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.830
 and here we clear the frequency and go to 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.770
 be the speed of the vacuum that is the 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.340
 speed of light e match by 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.340
 wavelength 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.630
 when incising inside the fiber optic 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.620
 we have to speed the fiber 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:32.290
 optics will be equal to efe per band 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.780
 efe as we have said the frequency is 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.180
 maintains 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.210
 and from here we clear the wavelength 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.610
 and it will be equal to speed the fiber 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.610
 optical match x 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.740
 which is equal to speed the fiber optic 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.330
 party x 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.770
 people wave length of vacuum 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.770
 this would be the same 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:03.850
 party why 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:07.710
 x the wavelength in a vacuum and as 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:11.350
 we know the refractive index is equal 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.720
 to the wavelength in the speed of 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.280
 the light in the vacuum divided by the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:23.470
 speed in that medium so the wave 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.900
 it's the same we have a match for c so 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.310
 that we would have landa sub zero match 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:35.760
 by the refractive index 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:40.910
 landa subcero is 650 nanometers and the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.910
 refractive index of 1.48 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:49.080
 so we get a wavelength 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:51.890
 in the fiber of 439 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.890
 two meters 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.800
 well in the second section they tell us 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.470
 that the fiber is coated with a 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.519
 material with refractive index n2 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:07.480
 equal to 1.44 and asks us what is the 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:13.170
 maximum value of theta angle so that 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.170
 total internal reflection occurs in p 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.680
 asking for a section of 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.350
 well here we had the other 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.480
 matter 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.760
 here we have the figure 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.520
 and on this side we will also have the 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.870
 Coating material 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.440
 we passed an axis 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.850
 here the light strikes 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.850
 with a theta angle 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:48.310
 and we are going to have a first refraction 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.310
 this would be the angle of refraction 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.920
 and they are traveling by fiber optics 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.370
 we would arrive at the p 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.810
 ah 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.390
 and in it 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.170
 we will have an incident angle that we're going 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.730
 to call l 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:10.099
 and the angle of refraction as they tell us 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.170
 how you have to produce reflection 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:20.370
 total internally then the range 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.370
 of refraction has to be 90 degrees 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.770
 Well, what we are going to do is 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.440
 apply the snl law of the changes of 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.420
 half at the beginning we have the emptiness with 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.889
 the angle tita incident so 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.219
 we will have 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:38.520
 the index the void through the 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:41.400
 angle of incidence that this is has 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.580
 that be equal to the fiber index 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.580
 optics 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:51.340
 sine of the refractive angle that is 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.230
 and applying again the law of snl 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:57.830
 we propose a second equation that 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:02.540
 says that the index 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.010
 of fiber multiplied by the breast of 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:08.050
 incident angle in the next 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:10.300
 material the angle is l 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:15.669
 it has to be equal to the index of the 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:18.940
 material that is n 2 x the breast and how we 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.440
 they say there is total reflection internally 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.720
 So it is 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.090
 the breast of 90 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.570
 from here we clear 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:33.580
 the angle l and we have that is equal 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:43.000
 speak with sine 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:46.710
 of 1.44 that is n 2 / 1.48 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.310
 that is so we get that lifts her 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.310
 it's 70 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.870
 64 degrees 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.390
 well and as we see the triangle that 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:04.410
 we have inside the figure we have r 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:09.430
 the an angle of 90 how they have to add 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:15.180
 the sum 180 then we will have 180 is 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.180
 equal to the angle of 90 plus the most 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:22.220
 so I 'll be 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.680
 it has to be equal to 90 and here 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:33.009
 we took the angle r 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:33.009
 that has to be equal to 13.35 degrees 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:40.870
 and once we have this angle then 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:44.980
 we can act on the first equation 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:48.740
 and we will have the breast 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:53.249
 beteta is equal 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:59.249
 to 1.48 which is the index 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:07:02.030
 n 1 of fiber x is the breast of this 

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:04.670
 angle is 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:07.040
 13.35 

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:16.690
 so from here we're going to jump doing 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:16.690
 the breast arch that teta is worth 19.98 degrees 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:21.870
 Well, this is the end of the exercise 

00:07:20.249 --> 00:07:24.270
 you know you can save it and share it 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.889
 in your account and create many notes 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.419
 thanks and you know you have more 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:29.419
 examples in institute
