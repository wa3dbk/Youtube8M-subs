00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.249 
sense is anybody's guess and why this is
even<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.700> problem<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.329> guess<00:01:39.479> other<00:01:39.900> than<00:01:40.079> the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
even a problem I guess other than the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.230 
even a problem I guess other than the
unfortunate<00:01:40.860> shape-shifting<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.670> man<00:01:41.880> into

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
unfortunate shape-shifting of a man into

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.120 
unfortunate shape-shifting of a man into
water-based<00:01:42.689> mammal<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.170> will<00:01:43.619> never<00:01:43.829> know

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
water-based mammal I will never know

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.100 
water-based mammal I will never know
look<00:01:44.520> there's<00:01:44.970> every<00:01:45.240> chance<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.600> wasn't

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
look there's every chance that wasn't

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.960 
look there's every chance that wasn't
even<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.409> plot<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.890> yet<00:01:47.130> somehow<00:01:47.399> that's

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
even the plot and yet somehow that's

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.859 
even the plot and yet somehow that's
what<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.240> took<00:01:48.360> away

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
what I took away

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.569 
what I took away
it's<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.590> watching<00:01:49.710> Star<00:01:50.159> Wars<00:01:50.399> and

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
it's like watching Star Wars and

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.609 
it's like watching Star Wars and
thinking<00:01:51.060> incest<00:01:51.600> was<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.930> big<00:01:52.110> takeaway

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
thinking incest was the big takeaway

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.330 
thinking incest was the big takeaway
from<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.860> movie<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:54.270> was<00:01:54.420> pretty<00:01:54.689> weird<00:01:54.869> oh

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
from that movie that was pretty weird oh

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.969 
from that movie that was pretty weird oh
oh<00:01:56.340> good<00:01:57.180> grief<00:01:57.479> why<00:01:58.170> do<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.560> inflict

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
oh good grief why do you inflict

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.800 
oh good grief why do you inflict
