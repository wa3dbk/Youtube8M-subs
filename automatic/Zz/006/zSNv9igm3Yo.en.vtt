00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
often overlooked kettlebell exercise and

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.750 
often overlooked kettlebell exercise and
that's<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.049> kettlebell<00:00:16.470> clean<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.130> even

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
of overlooked as far exactly how

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.580 
of overlooked as far exactly how
valuable<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.670> for<00:00:24.180> us<00:00:24.420> especially<00:00:24.900> as

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
valuable it is for us especially as

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.589 
valuable it is for us especially as
mountain<00:00:26.220> bikers<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.029> what<00:00:27.150> I'm<00:00:27.240> gonna<00:00:27.330> do<00:00:27.480> is

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
mountain bikers so what I'm gonna do is

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.390 
mountain bikers so what I'm gonna do is
show<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.960> kettlebell<00:00:28.439> clean<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.039> then

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
show you the kettlebell clean and then

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.769 
show you the kettlebell clean and then
break<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.789> down<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.970> little<00:00:30.150> bit<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.420> explain

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
break it down a little bit and explain

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.209 
break it down a little bit and explain
to<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:31.050> how<00:00:31.199> it's<00:00:31.380> gonna<00:00:31.500> help<00:00:31.740> us<00:00:31.920> on<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
to you how it's gonna help us on the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.610 
to you how it's gonna help us on the
trail<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.270> clean<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.899> built<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
trail so the clean is built on the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.750 
trail so the clean is built on the
foundation<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.329> your<00:00:36.410> swing<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.920> basic

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
foundation of your swing so the basic

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.560 
foundation of your swing so the basic
idea<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.800> creating<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.219> hip<00:00:41.579> hinge<00:00:41.879> to

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
idea of creating this hip hinge to

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.479 
idea of creating this hip hinge to
create<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> movement<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> same<00:00:44.190> thing

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
create the movement is the same thing

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.720 
create the movement is the same thing
the<00:00:44.910> difference<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.570> instead<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.770> doing<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
the difference is instead of doing a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.150 
the difference is instead of doing a
swing<00:00:48.149> where<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.660> arm<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.440> hand<00:00:49.649> are<00:00:49.860> coming

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
swing where the arm and hand are coming

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.069 
swing where the arm and hand are coming
out<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.280> front<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.789> us<00:00:50.940> what<00:00:51.480> we're<00:00:51.660> gonna<00:00:51.780> do

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
out in front of us what we're gonna do

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.450 
out in front of us what we're gonna do
is<00:00:52.320> pull<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.309> ah<00:00:54.199> the<00:00:55.199> kettlebell<00:00:55.620> up<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.399> our

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
is pull it ah the kettlebell up to our

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.540 
is pull it ah the kettlebell up to our
rack<00:00:56.730> position<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.870> we'll<00:00:57.989> come<00:00:58.199> from<00:00:58.410> here<00:00:58.920> up

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
rack position so we'll come from here up

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.939 
rack position so we'll come from here up
to<00:00:59.879> here<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.480> I'll<00:01:01.140> show<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.379> how<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.710> looks

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
to here so I'll show you how this looks

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.859 
to here so I'll show you how this looks
in<00:01:02.070> action<00:01:02.520> again<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:04.320> set<00:01:04.710> hike<00:01:05.309> back

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
in action again it's set hike back

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.179 
in action again it's set hike back
catching<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.170> rack<00:01:07.350> position<00:01:07.590> and

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
catching it in your rack position and

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.060 
catching it in your rack position and
again<00:01:08.909> once<00:01:09.150> you've<00:01:09.420> got<00:01:10.409> up<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> rack

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
again once you've got up to the rack

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.490 
again once you've got up to the rack
position<00:01:11.310> if<00:01:11.790> you're<00:01:11.939> if<00:01:12.240> you're<00:01:12.270> doing<00:01:12.930> more

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
position if you're if you're doing more

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.469 
position if you're if you're doing more
than<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:13.860> then<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.580> would<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:14.909> come<00:01:15.240> down

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
than one then you would just come down

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.100 
than one then you would just come down
and<00:01:16.439> then<00:01:16.590> back<00:01:16.740> up<00:01:17.299> and<00:01:18.299> then<00:01:18.420> back<00:01:18.600> up<00:01:18.810> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
and then back up and then back up and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.690 
and then back up and then back up and
again<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.830> real<00:01:20.040> important<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
again it's real important one of the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.160 
again it's real important one of the
common<00:01:20.970> mistakes<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.479> people<00:01:21.570> make<00:01:22.020> with

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
common mistakes that people make with

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.130 
common mistakes that people make with
this<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.590> dropping<00:01:23.520> down<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:24.240> then<00:01:24.810> trying<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
this is dropping down and then trying to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.080 
this is dropping down and then trying to
pull<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.619> back<00:01:26.430> up<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.750> at<00:01:28.110> my<00:01:28.619> bottom

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
pull it back up so this at my bottom

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.899 
pull it back up so this at my bottom
position<00:01:30.090> here<00:01:30.619> right<00:01:31.619> here<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.549> shouldn't

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
position here right here you shouldn't

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.120 
position here right here you shouldn't
be<00:01:33.000> able<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.270> tell<00:01:33.659> whether<00:01:34.530> I'm<00:01:34.740> doing<00:01:34.950> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
be able to tell whether I'm doing a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.210 
be able to tell whether I'm doing a
swing<00:01:35.549> or<00:01:35.909> clean<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:37.530> should<00:01:37.740> look<00:01:37.890> exactly

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
swing or clean this should look exactly

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.170 
swing or clean this should look exactly
the<00:01:38.520> same

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the same

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.749 
the same
this<00:01:39.329> shouldn't<00:01:39.689> change<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> drop<00:01:40.799> up<00:01:41.159> and

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
this shouldn't change to a drop up and

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.230 
this shouldn't change to a drop up and
down<00:01:42.000> instead<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.020> forward<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.649> backward

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
down instead of forward and backward

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.060 
down instead of forward and backward
projection<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.329> energy<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.680> want<00:01:46.920> with

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
projection of energy that you want with

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.999 
projection of energy that you want with
a<00:01:47.100> swing<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.409> one<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.590> things<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.890> really

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
a swing so one of the things that really

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.420 
a swing so one of the things that really
helps<00:01:50.640> with<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.270> exercise<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.369> having<00:01:53.369> a

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
helps with this exercise is having a

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.940 
helps with this exercise is having a
good<00:01:53.670> strong<00:01:54.060> rack<00:01:54.450> position<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.710> means

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
good strong rack position and that means

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.880 
good strong rack position and that means
you've<00:01:56.130> got<00:01:56.159> your<00:01:56.670> thumb<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.570> line<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.530> or

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
you've got your thumb in line with or

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.319 
you've got your thumb in line with or
maybe<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.189> little<00:01:59.460> bit<00:01:59.579> below<00:01:59.759> your<00:01:59.850> collarbone

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
maybe a little bit below your collarbone

where the kettlebell comes in and
crashes<00:02:48.710> into<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.310> so<00:02:49.760> you<00:02:49.850> got<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.090> keep<00:02:50.330> it

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
crashes into you so you got to keep it

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.990 
crashes into you so you got to keep it
nice<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:50.720> tight<00:02:50.960> and<00:02:51.500> you<00:02:51.890> do<00:02:52.130> that<00:02:52.370> by

keeping that bicep attached to the rib
there's<00:02:56.060> no<00:02:56.270> reason<00:02:56.720> for<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.260> come<00:02:57.770> away<00:02:58.450> if

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
there's no reason for it to come away if

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.750 
there's no reason for it to come away if

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
that bicep attached to the ribs when

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.990 
that bicep attached to the ribs when
you're<00:03:09.110> doing<00:03:09.410> them<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.770> it'll<00:03:10.430> really<00:03:10.670> help

another<00:03:13.760> thing<00:03:13.850> that<00:03:14.030> will<00:03:14.270> help<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.770> timing

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
another thing that will help is timing

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.620 
another thing that will help is timing
your<00:03:16.070> breath<00:03:16.490> and<00:03:16.760> it's<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.240> little<00:03:17.450> bit

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
your breath and it's a little bit

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.050 
your breath and it's a little bit
different<00:03:18.140> than<00:03:18.290> a<00:03:18.320> swing<00:03:18.800> so<00:03:19.160> I<00:03:19.190> did<00:03:19.580> a<00:03:19.610> video

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
different than a swing so I did a video

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.580 
different than a swing so I did a video
a<00:03:20.240> little<00:03:20.300> bit<00:03:20.540> back<00:03:20.780> or<00:03:21.080> a<00:03:21.140> little<00:03:21.350> while<00:03:21.470> ago

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
a little bit back or a little while ago

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.729 
a little bit back or a little while ago
on<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:23.270> swing<00:03:23.600> when<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:23.840> talked<00:03:24.080> about<00:03:24.200> timing

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
on the swing when I talked about timing

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.560 
on the swing when I talked about timing
your<00:03:24.830> breath<00:03:25.100> with<00:03:25.340> your<00:03:25.370> hips<00:03:25.820> and<00:03:26.150> how<00:03:26.510> you

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
your breath with your hips and how you

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.090 
your breath with your hips and how you
want<00:03:26.780> to<00:03:26.840> sniffing<00:03:27.260> on<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.500> way<00:03:27.590> down<00:03:27.830> and

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
want to sniffing on the way down and

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.910 
want to sniffing on the way down and
then<00:03:28.730> breathe<00:03:29.000> out<00:03:29.120> when<00:03:30.050> the<00:03:30.170> hips<00:03:30.380> lock<00:03:30.680> out

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
then breathe out when the hips lock out

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.010 
then breathe out when the hips lock out
with<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:32.000> clean<00:03:32.330> it's<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:32.630> little<00:03:32.900> bit

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
with the clean it's a little bit

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.420 
with the clean it's a little bit
differently<00:03:33.470> because<00:03:33.650> you're<00:03:33.890> going<00:03:34.070> to<00:03:34.130> use

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
differently because you're going to use

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.250 
differently because you're going to use
your<00:03:34.610> breath<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:34.970> help<00:03:35.420> you<00:03:35.600> absorb<00:03:35.750> the

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
your breath to help you absorb the

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.350 
your breath to help you absorb the
impact<00:03:36.739> and<00:03:36.980> this<00:03:37.400> is<00:03:37.640> where<00:03:37.940> one<00:03:38.180> of<00:03:38.209> the

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
impact and this is where one of the

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.130 
impact and this is where one of the
overlooked<00:03:39.040> benefits<00:03:40.040> of<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.550> clean<00:03:41.110> can<00:03:42.110> be

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
overlooked benefits of the clean can be

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.870 
overlooked benefits of the clean can be
really<00:03:42.470> important<00:03:42.860> for<00:03:43.040> us<00:03:43.160> as<00:03:43.280> mountain

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
really important for us as mountain

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.330 
really important for us as mountain
bikers<00:03:44.270> and<00:03:44.510> it's<00:03:44.870> that<00:03:45.080> ability<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.980> time

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
bikers and it's that ability to time

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.160 
bikers and it's that ability to time

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
impact and on the trail that's really

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.630 
impact and on the trail that's really
helpful<00:03:50.989> because<00:03:51.260> you<00:03:51.680> don't<00:03:52.160> want<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.550> be

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
ability to time absorbing impacts is is

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.460 
ability to time absorbing impacts is is
really<00:04:08.330> important<00:04:08.720> for<00:04:08.900> us<00:04:09.020> and<00:04:09.140> again<00:04:09.320> it's

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
really important for us and again it's

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.160 
really important for us and again it's
something<00:04:09.560> that<00:04:09.800> you<00:04:09.920> can<00:04:10.160> work<00:04:10.670> on<00:04:11.020> with<00:04:12.020> the

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
something that you can work on with the

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.640 
something that you can work on with the
clean<00:04:12.470> if<00:04:12.620> you<00:04:12.650> think<00:04:12.860> about<00:04:12.950> how<00:04:13.100> to<00:04:13.160> time

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
clean if you think about how to time

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.920 
clean if you think about how to time
breath<00:04:13.860> absorbing<00:04:14.430> that<00:04:14.549> impact<00:04:14.939> so<00:04:15.180> how<00:04:15.750> this

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
breath absorbing that impact so how this

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.629 
breath absorbing that impact so how this
is<00:04:16.079> gonna<00:04:16.199> work<00:04:16.560> is<00:04:16.829> we're<00:04:17.009> still<00:04:17.130> gonna<00:04:17.280> sniff

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
is gonna work is we're still gonna sniff

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.939 
is gonna work is we're still gonna sniff
in<00:04:17.820> on<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.030> way<00:04:18.150> back<00:04:18.359> but<00:04:19.350> on<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.560> way<00:04:19.650> up

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
in on the way back but on the way up

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.760 
in on the way back but on the way up
we're<00:04:20.400> gonna<00:04:20.549> hold<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.030> breath<00:04:21.239> in<00:04:21.509> until<00:04:22.199> we

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
we're gonna hold the breath in until we

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.230 
we're gonna hold the breath in until we
actually<00:04:22.949> catch<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.400> kettlebell<00:04:24.000> at<00:04:24.090> which

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
actually catch the kettlebell at which

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.230 
actually catch the kettlebell at which
point<00:04:24.509> we're<00:04:24.630> gonna<00:04:24.720> use<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.080> breath<00:04:25.289> to

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
point we're gonna use the breath to

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.210 
point we're gonna use the breath to
catch<00:04:27.240> it<00:04:27.449> it's<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.960> guess<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.860> best

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
catch it it's I guess the best

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.920 
catch it it's I guess the best

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
and it's that that pressurization of the

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
breathing down so again in action that's

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.770 
breathing down so again in action that's
gonna<00:04:54.270> look<00:04:54.389> like<00:04:54.570> this<00:04:54.840> and<00:04:55.020> if<00:04:55.139> in<00:04:59.630> so<00:05:00.630> again

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
gonna look like this and if in so again

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.300 
gonna look like this and if in so again
you<00:05:01.050> can<00:05:01.199> see<00:05:01.410> when<00:05:01.530> I<00:05:01.560> catch<00:05:01.860> it<00:05:03.860> I'm<00:05:04.860> timing

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
you can see when I catch it I'm timing

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.370 
you can see when I catch it I'm timing
catching<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.180> kettlebell<00:05:06.630> when<00:05:06.780> it<00:05:06.930> hits<00:05:07.199> me

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
catching the kettlebell when it hits me

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.279 
catching the kettlebell when it hits me
I<00:05:07.620> use<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.610> breath<00:05:08.849> to<00:05:08.910> help<00:05:09.780> me<00:05:09.960> catch<00:05:10.260> it

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
I use the breath to help me catch it

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.540 
I use the breath to help me catch it
then<00:05:10.680> I<00:05:10.770> sniff<00:05:11.039> it<00:05:11.190> on<00:05:11.280> the<00:05:11.340> way<00:05:11.430> down<00:05:13.039> so<00:05:14.039> that

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
then I sniff it on the way down so that

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.659 
then I sniff it on the way down so that
timing<00:05:15.180> is<00:05:15.360> an<00:05:15.780> important<00:05:16.259> part<00:05:16.560> of<00:05:16.710> it<00:05:17.130> so

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
timing is an important part of it so

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.839 
timing is an important part of it so
again<00:05:18.030> if<00:05:18.389> you<00:05:18.570> focus<00:05:18.960> on<00:05:19.430> those<00:05:20.430> couple

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
again if you focus on those couple

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:22.760 
again if you focus on those couple
things<00:05:21.150> you're<00:05:21.690> not<00:05:21.870> going<00:05:22.260> up<00:05:22.380> and<00:05:22.620> down

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
things you're not going up and down

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.290 
things you're not going up and down
