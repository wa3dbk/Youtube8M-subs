00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 in this video at once, only mine 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.130
 Subjective opinion 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.680
 security bachar then not seen 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.769
 allowed to view to persons under 16 years old 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.710
 all hello klepach with you is the second 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.500
 release of inspection games and today I would like to 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.400
 Announce a week can even a month of shit 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.250
 on my channel 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.130
 although shit on it was not arguing before 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.859
 but this time will still be gorenje 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.070
 we will review such games that 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.810
 more more or less though no they mostly 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.440
 very popular with schoolchildren 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.879
 Well, that is, a person 10 and can even from 8 to 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.930
 14 years can even more black and 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.140
 today under my close attention 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.190
 get a game in which I myself played so 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.200
 mesyatsok God but she was miserable in 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.160
 general comes on the scene 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.649
 A. p. Well, I would like to start with an explanation 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.570
 you probably don't even know what pb is 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.170
 At least I hope that you don’t 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.860
 You know, so this game is like gta 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.200
 only two sides of crime and trash 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.540
 must perform missions while 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.549
 fought each other in general idea 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.280
 itself is quite good at it implemented 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.530
 wildly God probably begin with the mission 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.780
 missions here is the biggest problem 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.930
 not all monotonous are not related between 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.119
 yourself yes you could make such 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.220
 missions like dates in the same 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.840
 most ppv so here in this fucking 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:34.290
 damn pb but make them connected like 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.229
 you or something and mission 1 is worth from 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.740
 3 to 10 steps to perform 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.479
 gradually if you for example do not know there 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.579
 there is such a chain sieve cases necessary 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.549
 defend some territory 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.170
 if you defended it then the mission can 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.540
 end in the second stage 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.060
 not reaching 4 but if you need her 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.880
 grab a point then you pissed away if you 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.820
 not capture can be done as we 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.950
 it would be cool but real that's when you 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.140
 you pass these paths no buns 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.220
 give you just mind to the next and 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.290
 all why it is necessary why 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.090
 arrange immediately the last stage or else 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.630
 anything but it was just wild 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.370
 gadfly 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.740
 I already said that they are both wild 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.230
 monotonous because in an hour of play you 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.930
 can get caught the same mission before 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.120
 20 times fucking up to 20 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.550
 but of course it is diluted by the fact that 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.650
 remember everything in different places and everything 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.200
 but still opponents are different but opponents 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.420
 this is also a separate topic you go into 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.570
 play you there for example 1 lvl how much 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.640
 remember 1 and you can be given a command 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.280
 the same first runs and against you 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.740
 there will be 200 and 300 which bend you over 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.410
 do not fuck here at all there is no balance 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.200
 you are not even accustomed to the game and you already 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.530
 Immediately put on dick where such fucking still 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.470
 fucking view and you know what this game 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.300
 just fucking schoolchild I am 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.890
 I answer with who would not play what 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.200
 I would not come across such an opponent 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.990
 Allies I did not come across, not all 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.870
 close school children when you kill them 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.330
 they write to you serve as a rat from behind 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.070
 Now get ban or even call you in 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.260
 skype when you come skype they 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.790
 They say that they have micro broke fucking 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.670
 what is this fucking such 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.560
 these damn schoolchildren don't even know 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.810
 English I met the guy Snip 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.160
 foger through russian pour from one to 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.920
 it's just fucked up 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.720
 another drawback of this game is the cards 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.420
 they are there all the door and you have them 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.790
 perform missions there is still incremental 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.769
 who work like a stupid shooter but they 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.620
 nikhera are not interesting and that on them 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.690
 you just have to play masochist 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.200
 the first map is the waterfront she 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.720
 scanty as a dick Chinese 2 cards this 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.510
 business district and it is even smaller than a member 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.250
 Chinese I'm not kidding try the map yourself 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.850
 from start to finish you can drive past 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:56.390
 ten fucking minutes on any machine not 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.790
 On the principle of cards made so-so as 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.489
 so so above average but still and 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.470
 fuck them just not interested further on 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.970
 we will go machines and our weapons 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.410
 please machines is the only one 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.440
 good thing in the game 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.500
 as for machines cars there 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.690
 I won’t say much 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.280
 just a lot of them can be obtained from 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.470
 related and on which you have to 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.250
 work but don't think 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.740
 the gameplay is not interesting there 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.960
 why do we need cars there they are not fucking 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.390
 needed because the card can be just 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.690
 run from the point it is so easy to sit down 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:34.710
 a minute drive around the corner get out there all 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.840
 More Maha fuck you do not need nor any 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.380
 no cool tricks done like gta 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.320
 for example , a day is just stupid 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.090
 decoration on fuck anyone needs everyone 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.040
 fuck places leafy cars were hellish 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.900
 schoolboy do not have to fucking rub me 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.910
 what look what's my oil for i 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.010
 the wreckage took 50 rubles looking for something on 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.110
 hlebushek paid off fucking poppy on the left 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.660
 the game is just wild fucking 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.510
 but we must pay tribute to the mother and there 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.840
 really cool look cool but they're there 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.390
 fuck don't give up as for weapons she 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.180
 divided in this game into two types of dan 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.790
 hell not given hell if dad wait 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.950
 hell are you all bend 6 is no longer given 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.650
 hellish you bend eat not all but at least 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.390
 someone and with this weapon so much 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.120
 different the fact that just fucked them not 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.479
 characteristics generally not clear for example 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.300
 mom x will damage less than a rifle but 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:29.940
 at the same time she kills faster as I do 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.060
 just dont understand fuck well it's just 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.550
 fucked up hellish ways they are not well 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.530
 say such expensive ones like runway for example 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.930
 but they are also expensive go with them but 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.790
 again the same schoolchildren who else with them 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.580
 sometimes go by mail 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:48.000
 those who do not know walk 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.340
 Not much for just 10 days and fucking for 10 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.770
 days you do not have time to come back 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.750
 again the gameplay who cerato 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.729
 you are there even nifiga not purely on the farm 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.680
 for example the same good brand 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.380
 or a good gun for that you need 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.710
 buy premium and premium as far as i'm 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:08.070
 I remember it costs 300 rubles 300 damn 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.650
 rubles for an award to the game which is fucking 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.870
 playing is not even interesting but still 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.090
 there are people who are drowning in this wildly 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.990
 game but again we return to 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.450
 schoolchildren 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:22.770
 you know in my relationship will die such 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:24.479
 vasche games and they need more danitsa why 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.300
 generally need Fogeym why not buy 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.789
 steam steam is a really cool thing 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.889
 bathroom here on advertising doing by 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:34.169
 game is just a fucking opsoss 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:37.520
 Now he is from daddy fucking Che 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:41.789
 deviating constantly a pb full shit 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:45.240
 all that is good in it is the stage graphics 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:47.939
 she's probably old and cars and 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.569
 so this game gives me 4 of 

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:52.680
 ten 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:55.020
