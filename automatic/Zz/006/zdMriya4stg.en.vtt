a truck but didn't work out too good

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.090 
a truck but didn't work out too good
so<00:01:05.430> right<00:01:05.610> there<00:01:06.380> this<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.680> was<00:01:07.860> black

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
so right there this is it was black

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.179 
so right there this is it was black
color<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.060> see<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.840> end<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.380> I

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
color as you can see the end of it so I

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.969 
color as you can see the end of it so I
use<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> scuff<00:01:12.240> pad<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:15.049> stuff<00:01:16.049> make<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.770> so

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
use the scuff pad to stuff make it so

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.469 
use the scuff pad to stuff make it so
the<00:01:17.159> morning<00:01:17.490> any<00:01:18.330> shiny<00:01:18.659> from<00:01:19.409> them<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:21.450> make

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
the morning any shiny from them to make

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.679 
the morning any shiny from them to make
the<00:01:21.720> paint<00:01:21.960> pretty<00:01:22.110> much<00:01:22.290> dough<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.340> can

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
the paint pretty much dough so I can

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.080 
the paint pretty much dough so I can
spray<00:01:24.689> paint<00:01:24.720> with<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.350> two<00:01:25.530> coats<00:01:25.740> of

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
spray paint with the two coats of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.770 
spray paint with the two coats of
self-etching<00:01:27.090> primer<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:28.939> paint<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.750> that

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
self-etching primer and paint so that

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.819 
self-etching primer and paint so that
way<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.320> will<00:01:31.950> last<00:01:32.159> longer<00:01:32.610> than<00:01:32.880> original

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
way this will last longer than original

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.160 
way this will last longer than original
dipstick<00:01:34.829> because<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> original<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.390> rusted

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
dipstick because the original is rusted

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.310 
dipstick because the original is rusted
halfway<00:01:37.650> through<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.930> pretty<00:01:39.930> much<00:01:40.049> broke

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
halfway through and in pretty much broke

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.980 
halfway through and in pretty much broke
off<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:41.009> its<00:01:41.189> own<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.939> basically<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.840> what

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
off on its own so basically this is what

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.080 
off on its own so basically this is what
it<00:01:43.079> looks<00:01:43.259> like

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
it looks like

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.940 
it looks like
abra<00:01:45.090> new<00:01:45.240> OEM<00:01:46.009> original<00:01:48.320> dipstick<00:01:49.320> tube<00:01:49.560> mine

abra new OEM original dipstick tube mine

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.819 
abra new OEM original dipstick tube mine
is<00:01:50.189> broke<00:01:50.460> off<00:01:50.640> about<00:01:50.970> about<00:01:51.689> half<00:01:52.259> way<00:01:52.530> about

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
is broke off about about half way about

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:53.660 
is broke off about about half way about
at<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.189> point

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
at this point

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.800 
at this point
so<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.630> took<00:01:54.780> took<00:01:55.680> me<00:01:55.850> quite<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:57.090> time<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.479> get

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
so it took took me quite of time to get

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.260 
so it took took me quite of time to get
it<00:01:57.960> out<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:59.040> pretty<00:01:59.219> much<00:01:59.460> what<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.030> want<00:02:00.180> to

some<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.350> those<00:02:04.439> cheaper<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:05.060> haven't<00:02:06.060> found<00:02:06.240> so

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
some of those cheaper I haven't found so

and let me show you what it takes to

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.880 
and let me show you what it takes to

as<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.100> can<00:02:15.220> see<00:02:15.430> exhaust<00:02:15.970> manifold<00:02:16.900> had<00:02:17.050> to

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
as you can see exhaust manifold had to

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.220 
as you can see exhaust manifold had to
be<00:02:17.260> removed<00:02:17.700> from<00:02:18.700> this<00:02:18.940> one<00:02:19.210> and<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.960> reason

be removed from this one and the reason

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.530 
be removed from this one and the reason
why<00:02:20.410> because<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:21.070> decided<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.880> replace<00:02:22.090> all<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
why because I decided to replace all the

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.200 
why because I decided to replace all the
hoses<00:02:22.770> because<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:24.070> hose<00:02:24.280> radiator<00:02:25.060> hose

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
hoses because the hose radiator hose

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.420 
hoses because the hose radiator hose
bottom<00:02:25.540> radiator<00:02:25.900> hose<00:02:26.080> clamp<00:02:26.680> broke<00:02:27.010> off<00:02:27.190> and

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
bottom radiator hose clamp broke off and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.760 
bottom radiator hose clamp broke off and
recalled<00:02:27.730> all<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.060> any<00:02:28.180> phrase<00:02:28.450> so<00:02:29.410> since

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
recalled all the any phrase so since

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.590 
recalled all the any phrase so since
that<00:02:30.010> since<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.610> happened<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.060> decided<00:02:31.390> it's

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
that since it happened I decided it's

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.420 
that since it happened I decided it's
time<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:32.050> replace<00:02:32.290> not<00:02:32.620> just<00:02:32.800> that<00:02:32.950> not<00:02:33.190> all

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
time to replace not just that not all

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.750 
time to replace not just that not all
the<00:02:33.550> hoses<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.030> clamps<00:02:34.180> but<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.900> replace<00:02:35.200> the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
the hoses and clamps but to replace the

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.250 
the hoses and clamps but to replace the
engine<00:02:36.760> or<00:02:37.180> dipstick<00:02:37.480> tube<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:37.960> as<00:02:38.020> you<00:02:38.140> can

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
engine or dipstick tube so as you can

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.340 
engine or dipstick tube so as you can
see<00:02:40.740> manifold<00:02:41.740> is<00:02:41.980> gone<00:02:42.880> but<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.450> exhaust<00:02:43.930> is

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
see manifold is gone but the exhaust is

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.040 
see manifold is gone but the exhaust is
still<00:02:44.620> there<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.300> it's<00:02:46.300> very<00:02:46.540> difficult<00:02:46.780> to

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
still there and it's very difficult to

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.280 
still there and it's very difficult to
it<00:02:47.800> actually<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:48.880> can't<00:02:49.120> even<00:02:49.209> see<00:02:49.630> where

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
it actually it can't even see where

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.030 
it actually it can't even see where
exactly<00:02:50.670> it's<00:02:51.670> supposed<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.150> be<00:02:53.040> going

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
exactly it's supposed to be going

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.860 
exactly it's supposed to be going
because<00:02:54.160> it's<00:02:54.820> so<00:02:55.000> tight<00:02:55.209> right<00:02:55.450> there

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
because it's so tight right there

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.810 
because it's so tight right there
I<00:02:56.140> can<00:02:56.320> zoom<00:02:56.350> in<00:02:56.650> but<00:02:57.010> tell<00:02:57.190> me<00:02:57.220> if<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.490> can<00:02:57.640> see

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
I can zoom in but tell me if you can see

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
I can zoom in but tell me if you can see
a<00:02:58.450> lot<00:02:59.050> actually<00:02:59.950> right<00:03:00.760> where<00:03:01.390> those<00:03:01.540> two

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
a lot actually right where those two

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.880 
a lot actually right where those two
studs<00:03:02.830> that<00:03:03.100> little<00:03:04.380> they're<00:03:05.380> opening<00:03:05.770> up

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
studs that little they're opening up

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.520 
studs that little they're opening up
there<00:03:06.100> see<00:03:07.000> if<00:03:07.060> I<00:03:07.120> can<00:03:07.270> show<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:07.540> what<00:03:08.380> it's

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
there see if I can show you what it's

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.850 
there see if I can show you what it's
going<00:03:08.590> actually

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:23.510 

right<00:03:16.630> right<00:03:17.630> up<00:03:17.840> there

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.790 

if<00:03:24.240> you<00:03:24.330> can<00:03:24.480> see<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:24.750> or<00:03:24.900> not<00:03:24.930> here<00:03:25.290> right<00:03:25.530> up

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
if you can see it or not here right up

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.430 
if you can see it or not here right up
there<00:03:26.010> that's<00:03:26.310> what<00:03:26.490> it's<00:03:26.610> going<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.790> be<00:03:26.880> going

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
there that's what it's going to be going

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.160 
there that's what it's going to be going
so<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.650> remove<00:03:28.920> what<00:03:29.070> I<00:03:29.720> had<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.870> remove<00:03:31.080> the

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
so to remove what I had to remove the

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.310 
so to remove what I had to remove the
exhaust<00:03:31.380> manifold<00:03:31.950> because<00:03:32.910> it<00:03:33.750> was<00:03:33.900> rusted

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
exhaust manifold because it was rusted

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.910 
exhaust manifold because it was rusted
let<00:03:34.470> me<00:03:34.560> show<00:03:34.710> you<00:03:34.770> how<00:03:34.950> bad<00:03:35.130> it<00:03:35.160> was<00:03:35.340> rusted
