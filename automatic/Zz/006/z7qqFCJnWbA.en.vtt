 the person takes mine there is how to survive 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.489
 and so it was with the work of each 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.250
 producers in the region. 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.190
 was growing all production seeks the 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.560
 sustainable development, ie 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.540
 concerned about protecting the environment and 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.540
 who wins with this is also the producer 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.080
 the majority of our farmers are 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.840
 are lay people and have little schooling 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.840

 should not knock a pad down 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.400
 otherwise you have to plant another produce 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.069
 force their bees keeps you a

 It happens that beekeepers are needed. 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.769
 awareness at the real beekeeper

 to produce with structure and 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.110
 training 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.329
 there are a large number of beekeepers 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.359
 but they could not access this 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:17.370
 market for the quality of the product 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.229
 they had available for this they 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.510
 needed that they needed 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.039
 equipment similar to those 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.900
 equipment of the large industry 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.410
 private industries then codevasf 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.310
 just as other institutions have entered 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.680
 providing such equipment 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.080
 structuring these productive chains 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.650
 which made possible a higher level of 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.110
 organization and 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.419
 directs all its production to a 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.970
 big agribusiness 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.949
 all production is delivered to the 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.520
 semi - arid beekeeping cooperatives 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:51.160
 Brazilian known as casa apis 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.139
 It is here that every product is processed and 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.199
 packaged to go straight to the shelves 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.840
 supermarkets and abroad 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.090
 the apis house has the capacity to 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.960
 up to two thousand tons of honey 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.139
 per annum 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.110
 the honey is delivered by the producer in the house 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:10.750
 You get my pass and get my for one. 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.120
 processing system that at the end 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.889
 This process of mine can 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.710
 be available for the external market 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.120
 mainly in bulk or for the 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.210
 internal market 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.090
 My split to end this process 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.070
 commercialization of this product 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.680
 to that beekeeper who delivered my 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.599
 at the beginning of the chain. 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.270
 honey that goes to supermarkets is 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:36.190
 the label has information about the 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.650
 as nutritional value 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.260
 the recommendation for consumption and the seal 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.580
 organic certification that ensures that 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.010
 the production of honey 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.800
 from the installation of apiaries to here 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.870
 complied with conservation standards 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:53.139
 environment is far from contamination by 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.889
 products as agricultural pesticides and 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.550
 now the big challenge is to win more 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.099
 markets 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.659
 we have a growth margin 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:04.810
 as it was once before 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:07.120
 in our per capita consumption of honey is 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.270
 very low when compared to other 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.860
 countries we have the idea to a 15 times a 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.430
 more to grow in terms of consumption 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.590
 honey 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.090
 the market is there the small farmer 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.139
 is being provoked for this to people 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.650
 want more 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:24.570
 so now you can not go back 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.570
 now it is advancing to move forward and
