were flying around this is effects he's
only<00:03:50.760> level<00:03:51.000> 72<00:03:51.360> I<00:03:52.170> think<00:03:52.830> we<00:03:52.920> start<00:03:53.130> dueling<00:03:53.400> a

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
only level 72 I think we start dueling a

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.110 
only level 72 I think we start dueling a
bit<00:03:53.760> now<00:03:53.940> let's<00:03:54.330> see<00:03:54.510> yes<00:03:54.870> we<00:03:55.019> are<00:03:55.910> there<00:03:56.910> we<00:03:56.970> go

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
head pulling these waste leaguers

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.409 
head pulling these waste leaguers
actually<00:05:26.219> doesn't<00:05:26.430> give<00:05:26.550> us<00:05:26.699> any<00:05:26.879> experience

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
actually doesn't give us any experience

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.019 
actually doesn't give us any experience
at<00:05:27.539> least<00:05:27.750> in<00:05:27.930> this<00:05:28.050> area<00:05:28.490> we're<00:05:29.490> pulling<00:05:29.969> a

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:30.029 
at least in this area we're pulling a

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.879 
at least in this area we're pulling a
lot<00:05:30.120> of<00:05:30.300> them<00:05:30.449> but<00:05:30.599> they're<00:05:30.900> not<00:05:31.349> really<00:05:31.409> any

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
lot of them but they're not really any

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.899 
lot of them but they're not really any
point<00:05:32.400> really<00:05:32.879> so<00:05:33.419> yeah<00:05:33.800> so<00:05:34.800> we<00:05:35.639> eventually

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
point really so yeah so we eventually

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.240 
point really so yeah so we eventually
stopped<00:05:36.629> trying<00:05:37.199> to<00:05:37.319> kill<00:05:37.469> these<00:05:37.589> mobs<00:05:37.830> as<00:05:38.009> I

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
stopped trying to kill these mobs as I

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.790 
stopped trying to kill these mobs as I
not<00:05:38.430> as<00:05:38.699> we<00:05:39.000> are<00:05:39.180> as<00:05:39.419> I<00:05:40.139> noticed<00:05:40.589> we're<00:05:40.680> not

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
not as we are as I noticed we're not

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:47.839 
not as we are as I noticed we're not
getting<00:05:41.039> an<00:05:41.129> experience<00:05:41.699> so<00:05:42.509> yeah<00:05:46.580> so<00:05:47.580> we<00:05:47.669> just

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
getting an experience so yeah so we just

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:49.809 
getting an experience so yeah so we just
start<00:05:48.089> killing<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:48.479> massive<00:05:49.289> bird

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:49.819 
start killing the massive bird

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:52.459 
start killing the massive bird
disemboweled<00:05:50.819> giant<00:05:51.210> type<00:05:51.509> of<00:05:51.659> things<00:05:51.839> to<00:05:52.199> get

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:52.469 
disemboweled giant type of things to get

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:54.379 
disemboweled giant type of things to get
experience<00:05:52.800> as<00:05:53.580> you<00:05:53.699> can<00:05:53.819> see<00:05:53.940> we<00:05:54.060> are<00:05:54.089> getting

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
experience as you can see we are getting

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.420 
experience as you can see we are getting
extremely<00:05:54.539> close<00:05:55.020> now<00:05:55.469> we<00:05:55.529> can<00:05:55.740> barely<00:05:56.009> see

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
extremely close now we can barely see

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.600 
extremely close now we can barely see
the<00:05:56.699> gap<00:05:57.569> now<00:05:57.900> between<00:05:57.930> experience<00:05:58.800> I<00:05:58.979> fixed

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
the gap now between experience I fixed

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.399 
the gap now between experience I fixed
somehow<00:05:59.759> managed<00:06:00.120> to<00:06:00.180> fall<00:06:00.449> down<00:06:00.479> somehow<00:06:01.050> and

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.409 
somehow managed to fall down somehow and

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:03.050 
somehow managed to fall down somehow and
we<00:06:02.099> get<00:06:02.250> owned<00:06:02.430> here<00:06:02.759> as<00:06:02.879> you<00:06:02.939> can<00:06:02.969> probably

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
we get owned here as you can probably

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.450 
we get owned here as you can probably
see<00:06:03.389> what<00:06:04.050> slop<00:06:04.349> gets<00:06:04.589> owned<00:06:04.830> I<00:06:05.159> somehow

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
see what slop gets owned I somehow

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.570 
see what slop gets owned I somehow
managed<00:06:05.849> to<00:06:05.879> survive<00:06:07.159> so<00:06:08.159> that's<00:06:08.310> good<00:06:08.550> I

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
managed to survive so that's good I

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.760 
managed to survive so that's good I
think<00:06:08.759> I<00:06:08.969> don't<00:06:09.569> read<00:06:09.810> slop<00:06:10.169> because<00:06:10.500> he<00:06:10.589> ran

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
think I don't read slop because he ran

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.559 
think I don't read slop because he ran
away<00:06:10.889> from<00:06:11.039> I<00:06:11.580> don't<00:06:11.879> stop<00:06:12.060> right<00:06:12.270> well<00:06:12.539> I

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:12.569 
away from I don't stop right well I

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:14.300 
away from I don't stop right well I
don't<00:06:12.689> them<00:06:12.990> Rebs<00:06:13.379> lopping<00:06:13.770> off<00:06:13.860> right<00:06:14.129> I'm
