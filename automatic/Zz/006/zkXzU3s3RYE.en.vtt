 interest since in this video I'm going to 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.770
 teach how to stamp against the ground 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.860
 It is worth standing technical rule that 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.080

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.150

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.220
 please, but I uncle what happens to the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.509
 my God's people lad 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.779

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.640
 mother and a half that please what bad 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.890
 education goddess entered her city in

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.370
 guys, we're here again inside 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.870
 from the same place where they have previously 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.400
 riddled to shot really do not know 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.810
 why I take the man burst to the head 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.920
 the truth for the boys of the case already 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.750
 we are in this video but it will be necessary 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.980
 teach something quite curious and that 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.180
 surely you are interested as they should 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.350
 teach the second of these unique 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.000
 Indians who sometimes just go up 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.620
 channel in which one as the sites 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.060
 that are little known by the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.320
 people and surely most of 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.880
 you when you have no idea that 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.470
 this site exists there will be people who do 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.760
 as I always say but good this video 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.990
 has focused for people who do not have 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.309
 idea of this site and well I tell you 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.630
 I communicate so that more people can 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.110
 enjoy these sites 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.820
 new of the saints has taught that there 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.490
 here in the garage as you can see here is 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.320
 fast here outside 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:21.299
 the garage the bush of people to 5 like 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.590
 everything except the musicians of the case if we 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.640
 we just joined this location the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.840
 I'm seeing on the screen that you 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.060
 I recommend that you enter with a little bit 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.280
 so carefully and slowly since common 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.079
 it's a little bit abrupt like I have 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.049
 done as a couple then those that can 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.819
 explain the head as you have seen the 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.229
 case if come by here in the location 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.539
 who ended up saying look at it like again from 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.280
 new here just because we can not 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.840
 find a kind of house in which 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.069
 Power knew that everyone will know that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.990
 the house is that we can find 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.429
 because it is 5 because it has in door 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.840
 obviously a man houses 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.340
 obviously 50 damage that the things that 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.289
 you say but look for example if not 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.880
 we come to not be a house any time 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.170
 we will open here to see it 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.700
 find a door of a house look at the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.289
 face I do not find doors look for 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.060
 This example is if we try to enter 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.610
 I will not leave the room 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.799
 stay closed and so with 99% of the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.119
 of the gta 52 houses in a second 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.950
 well in this location as I say we can 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.329
 find a house which seems to be 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.890
 a normal house as you see 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.270
 that is in which downloaded that is 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.860
 a little played with him to taste 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.170
 and well, this house has something 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.030
 special and it's like a house 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.590
 normal as you see here with the window and 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.390
 it seems that when we enter for that 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.590
 door if we could enter then we 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.150
 we will find what is the hall of the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.280
 house with its kitchen with its bathroom 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.540
 and such but if we enter inside this 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.370
 house we will not find a house 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.890
 normal inside but we 're going to 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.420
 find a room and its small or 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.640
 be it the simple fact of being able to enter 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.800
 here is something quite curious and quite 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.180
 mysterious since as you already know 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.980
 you can enter almost none by not 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.720
 say no door there is any 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.730
 house in some house vegetation with line 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.770
 but if it is that we enter and it is not a house 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.510
 normal is that a quarter a quarter 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.700
 point from when you see something like that I do not know to 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.500
 who goes here the showcase I say 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.970
 the window of the house the roof the 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.320
 graphic on this side because there is a 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.850
 pretty big house precincts with the 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.740
 put and no house were two is 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.240
 only one quart and enough 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.650
 quite strange that so you do not see 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.120
 It was quite impressive to be able to enter this 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.280
 sort of the fourth and we've left 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.600
 pretty july in curiosity inside 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.340
 and said is all this is self-controlled 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.990
 subscriber me to come here show me 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.460
 not to say ana look where I am 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.960
 they want us plasma had like little in the 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.580
 center and not what is it because it is 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.960
 door then good guys it was 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.880
 I basically wanted to teach him the truth 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.450
 something pretty cool that just does not 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.250
 I know because as 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:27.480
 that door opens and the doors of 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:32.970
 other doors of the game have fired from 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:35.670
 again to die all the same as the 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.860
 godmother and that has locked very boys that 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.760
 I say here I say goodbye with these people who 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.319
 It is very bad people want to see us 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.060
 I recommend this neighborhood to live are 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.440
 very aggressive madryn and others and they kill me 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.160
 after this video you can subscribe 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.160
 goodbye
