00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:04.160
 Your competent partner for customized robot solutions 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.060
 The robot welding system equipped with a double curve power source 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.790
 allows a market-based production data use 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.790
 different food tasks 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:21.420
 Here were filmed 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.710
 is a Europe that welds plant 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.830
 which has some special features the plant consists of a robot 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.099
 also lengthened 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.070
 and a hay tedder of a span of four mothers 50 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.030
 has what his wife can be called unique 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.540
 The special feature of the system is the two different welding tasks 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.740
 can be performed with a welding machine 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.610
 Main components of the plant left no Kuka robot with extended arm and 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.480
 meant the walls positioned more 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.750
 this position of their with horizontal the stock has a span of 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.690
 four and a half meters 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.860
 the load is Fischer's coined time as 750 kilograms 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.920
 to the exact position of the welds of Essiens at complicated 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.690
 Determining the part of the geometry The component is the food mushroom 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.900
 measured by laser 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.350
 This can compensate for TUI and location shifts 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.450
 To protect the measuring system, a protective cover was built around the wind players 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.360
 the housing is dedicated to the food climatically open 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.100
 During welding, the housing is over-pressurized 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.070
 surcharge 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.760
 to ascend the sweat smoke as well as splashes of which the houses 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.310
 keep 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.730
 This is the highly sensitive device estimated 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.360
 in this case, in the first step, a spiral on more distant 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.060
 welded 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.220
 For this purpose, a stand is used the welding set mountain town and procedures 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.600
 In this game a victory in a second step an upward reaction 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.600
 Wear protection applied 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.110
 you do not need a second power source 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.180
 The robot only has to after welding in the spiral the wire for 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.969
 change the system 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:13.109
 This trainer has his own kicked suitcase and specifically the 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.989
 Addition of active ingredient 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.730
 after the change in Bremen, the spiral with the order situation something 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.679
 pull 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:24.889
 Thus, they can serve high loads the courtship exposed to the use 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:27.119
 are longer withstand 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:32.049
 the change from bond to job welding is fully automatic and 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.769
 with the least amount of time 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.060
 These two processes are controlled by the same true crisis 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:44.370
 For this, the company IBM developed a dual-clutch power source she adds 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:47.699
 seamlessly into the bus system 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:51.879
 In order to keep team all sweat results, the trainer goes programmed 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.419
 Cleaned intervals 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:55.549
 while the wire is cut off 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.019
 and the gas crisis Figgis stuck 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.189
 After a rinse with an Antich Platzes letter, the coach can 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:04.169
 Continue work 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:07.409
 An overview of the attachment to pouplin you love and and 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.480
 There is process monitoring they would need through the fires 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:14.659
 around the operator our but the swiss plant 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.159
 Dr handling is easy to do 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.270
 we have one 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.570
 where the hall of the company Siemens type mp3 70 deployment 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:26.739
 this device will show the operator the condition of the system at all times 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.280
 and makes it possible to interact with certain functions from the outside as well 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:35.519
 Welder Butler Plant for pickling production develops the areal one 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.639
 previously unique Switzerland applications 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.659
 Trust in our robot know-how 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.569
 what can we do faster for them with their employees 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:46.060
 solutions
