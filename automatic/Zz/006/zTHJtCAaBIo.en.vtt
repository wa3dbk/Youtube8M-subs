00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.929
 each manufacturer has its own approach to 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.150
 creating devices someone is chasing 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.370
 adaptability someone behind the power 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.320
 There is a brand for which the main design 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.180
 and eiser when creating smartphones 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.310
 seeks to reach the golden mean 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.140

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.420
 devices today we will consider the novelty 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.550
 from eiser smartphone liquid e1 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.590

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.980
 Immediately it should be noted that the smartphone 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.260
 supports work with two sim cards 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.329
 which make it possible to combine two 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.700
 tariff plans in one device 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.430
 model liquid e1 is made of plastic 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.829
 but the material is good and the build is good 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.750
 very pleased with tangible texture on the back 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.940

 microusb to connect with computer and 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.260
 battery charging that in general 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.420
 expected for such devices zest 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.270

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.060
 gigabyte also works with it 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.369
