 here as much of the pepper as 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:38.190
 of garlic because this is spreading the flavor 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.500
 better, slower in the car here, okay? 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.490

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.130

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.490
 glass of very dry white wine 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.730
 important in dry gent 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.900
 the wine may even be red but always 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.900
 It will have to be dry. 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:19.400
 we just put the laurel leaves here 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:24.530
 so take a turn at the rib and go 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:28.519
 let marinate for 12 hours after 12 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:32.750
 hours of marinating our prime rib 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:35.689
 Look what beauty looks at this cut. 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:51.409
 the rib is just so far, that's it 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:54.109
 here is a good deal of pork loin to 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:56.420
 first time we put this 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:59.599
 in the ember she should keep the paper 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.549
 aluminum to cook a little she 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:06.799
 stay very soft after we retire 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:08.930
 this paper and gives a golden one in it then the 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.549
 our rib's already wrapped in 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.720
 this number is important because 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:17.090
 he holds the seasoning in and goes 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.959
 slowly cooking the costa lincon 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.959
 adapt to the embers 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:35.310

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.350
 covered by foil and the other 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.130
 An hour later we'll have a golden one. 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.410
 in her 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.230
 this rib can also be baked 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.540

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.980

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:56.940
 aluminum tray also covered 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.850

 rib does not dry 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.580
 then she stays one hour covered with 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.930
 then pull out the paper 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.930
