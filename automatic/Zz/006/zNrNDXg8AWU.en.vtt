00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
asking their horse to canter is that

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.270 
asking their horse to canter is that
they<00:02:57.950> want<00:02:58.159> to<00:02:58.219> dip<00:02:58.519> their<00:02:58.730> shoulders<00:02:59.120> forward

the<00:03:01.280> problem<00:03:01.669> with<00:03:01.879> this<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.329> it<00:03:02.629> puts<00:03:02.840> your

the problem with this is it puts your

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.780 
the problem with this is it puts your
weight<00:03:03.169> forward<00:03:03.680> onto<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:04.010> horses<00:03:04.400> shoulders
