00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.259
 on 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:39.940
 You've seen 2 rhythms like this 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:44.230
 Well, these days there are some ligament fires and lots of patterns coming out. 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:49.420

 Give me a day on the circle and give it to me. 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.350

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:28.000
 You do not have to do it all the time. 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:33.820
 When you add, you press the knife to squeeze the squeeze. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:39.280
 You can stop your hand by one hand, so it's always a pearl or a 2v
