it<00:00:11.880> can<00:00:12.060> be<00:00:12.180> really<00:00:12.480> confusing<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:13.320> figure<00:00:13.440> out

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
it can be really confusing to figure out

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.300 
it can be really confusing to figure out
how<00:00:13.980> much<00:00:14.220> to<00:00:14.580> feed<00:00:14.820> your<00:00:15.030> puppy<00:00:16.310> oftentimes

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
how much to feed your puppy oftentimes

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.240 
how much to feed your puppy oftentimes
it<00:00:17.760> really<00:00:18.480> depends<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.380> size<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.650> the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
it really depends on the size and the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.580 
it really depends on the size and the
breed<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:21.540> very<00:00:21.810> important<00:00:22.350> to

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
breed and so it's very important to

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.130 
breed and so it's very important to
check<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.160> your<00:00:23.279> vet<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.850> terms<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
check with your vet in terms of the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.790 
check with your vet in terms of the
amount<00:00:25.579> to<00:00:26.579> feed<00:00:26.790> your<00:00:27.150> pup<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.650> consider<00:00:28.650> it

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
amount to feed your pup and consider it

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.260 
amount to feed your pup and consider it
the<00:00:28.950> kind<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.220> food<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.520> you're<00:00:29.640> feeding<00:00:29.700> a

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
the kind of food that you're feeding a

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.600 
the kind of food that you're feeding a
lot<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.869> people<00:00:31.140> choose<00:00:31.380> kibble<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.189> there

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
lot of people choose kibble and there

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.310 
lot of people choose kibble and there
are<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:32.970> many<00:00:33.090> kibbles<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.810> market<00:00:34.140> now

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
are so many kibbles on the market now

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.890 
are so many kibbles on the market now
and<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.850> think<00:00:36.060> it's<00:00:36.150> really<00:00:36.329> important<00:00:36.840> to

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
and I think it's really important to

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.710 
and I think it's really important to
find<00:00:37.050> something<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:38.130> made<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:38.820> really

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
find something that is made with really

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.200 
find something that is made with really
high<00:00:40.050> quality<00:00:40.590> products<00:00:41.580> and<00:00:41.880> not<00:00:42.000> buy

times<00:00:50.130> a<00:00:50.310> day<00:00:50.390> but<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:52.080> not<00:00:52.320> just<00:00:52.530> what<00:00:52.710> they

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
important again to talk about to have

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.800 
important again to talk about to have
them<00:00:58.490> take<00:00:59.490> a<00:00:59.520> meal<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.880> they<00:01:00.150> have<00:01:00.450> to<00:01:00.660> eat

more<00:01:03.630> satisfying<00:01:04.379> for<00:01:04.559> them<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.580> slows

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
more satisfying for them and it slows

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.399 
more satisfying for them and it slows
down<00:01:05.939> their<00:01:06.330> eating<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.720> they<00:01:07.079> can<00:01:07.200> get<00:01:07.290> their

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
down their eating and they can get their

down their eating and they can get their
kibble<00:01:07.650> out<00:01:07.829> rather<00:01:08.040> than<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:08.549> serving<00:01:08.850> them

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180

kibble out rather than just serving them
their<00:01:09.450> meal<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:10.259> we're<00:01:10.470> waiters<00:01:10.829> in<00:01:10.979> a
