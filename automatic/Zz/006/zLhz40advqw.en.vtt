00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.700
 we remain at the trip sommaruga state beekeeper of the verbano cusio ossola in the 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.810
 his laboratory 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.870
 in the united states they say there has been an elusive return of the apps 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.710
 iphone for bahamas people like 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.100
 the world level situation is still not pleasant because we are witnessing 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.660
 even at the Italian European level it has a series of mortality borne by the hives 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.199
 whose causes are not yet night 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.050
 currently it is a series of concause there are aspects of typical pathology the 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.480
 Recipes of the hives bacteria and mushrooms recipe that have always been there but that 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.520
 are intensifying in recent years 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.989
 climate change 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.469
 however it is a reality take the pics authors realize that the bees do not give 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.070
 more than normal seasonal behavior as it was up to ten 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.969
 years ago so there is something more there is the problem of the environment I am not 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:57.109
 many cases were caused by insecticides new families of the sites where 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.659
 famous neonicotinoids sell their feet which unfortunately are not limited to only 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.950
 corn with beetroot etc. are now very large insecticides. 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.640
 copy in agriculture culture publishers but also the dumb culture and many people that 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.690
 they make the garden at home maybe organic consecrated when there is the presence of 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.619
 header data of plant games 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.280
 zither they go like any shop unconsciously meet denis et i 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.899
 foods that belong to this category which will have these 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.340
 characteristics of being persistent and systemic 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.470
 persistent means that they have an insecticidal activity that can be 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.610
 of several weeks systems it means that once they are moved 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.070
 on plants plants absorb insecticide and move it to all 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.170
 parts for which there is no certainty but the concern that 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.650
 2 people unknowingly using these insecticides 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.260
 consumption you cannot produce with the presence still hsbc monte sant'angelo 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
 and that beard since he thought he felt tears 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.510
 I also talked about it with some more cultures in the mandate area than the crisis 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.830
 he feels like he sent him about ten years to confirm this roughly yes 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.410
 then there are other remedies that have never had problems, all 15 all 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.299
 years lose 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:21.400
 and this in part owed the beekeeper's skills, but sometimes yes 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.219
 assists you in the near future also by beekeepers who are gods 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:26.229
 very good at pc 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:30.539
 flowers I've got of the country most affected by the crisis of for boxed there is a 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:31.859
 gradient for example 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.319
 it's a bit of a leopard the notifications I get to 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.269
 I drive contact with beekeeping a little in all of Italy, even in the south there are gods 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:40.960
 problems 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.270
 it would seem - 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.950
 perhaps they are more favored by less industrialization but there are some 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.350
 areas where there have been depopulation due to and probably insecticides 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.249
 melena 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:56.589
 intensive cultivation area of ​​fruit growing horticulture and there too 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:03:01.299
 have been problems here in the north for several years throughout the range that goes 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.449
 from the piedmont to the friuli just in concomitance now established with the 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:09.439
 corn sowing there was this release of my little nephew invites whom 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.199
 it is estimated that every year it has been to be 50 60 minutes 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:16.209
 here are the scientific tests complete with analysis 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.549
 fat carry out from the various regions that have shown me bees dead with 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.859
 that poisoning symptomatology 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.199
 these were then found of these sites called pan 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:31.849
 tfr calculation from the family is depopulated because these 16v are so toxic 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.869
 for the joints just minutes from the contamination I am unable to fly 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:38.379
 so the live at is not coming back either 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.150
 we moved to the museum above the ocean now that we have the 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.019
 our state of trust some information on Puglia and theirs 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.769
 important first of all which are the most important ones for me 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.799
 Pollination and therefore talking to the Federica are all important 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:58.949
 pd 954 were counted among the very many species of acqui day films from Italy 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:03.929
 especially every species has its important role of pollination because 

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:05.410
 some expenses for example 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.209
 I'm able to pollinate 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.590
 a single vegetable plant whose presence is therefore conditioned by the 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.150
 presence of this pride of duty vice versa 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.610
 there are others that instead attend + plant species and therefore are in theirs 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.730
 complex absolutely not last indispensable for the cultivations but 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.680
 even for all those nights on TV 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.680
 so-called wild plant species that are part of our environment 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.080
 without these April it is the there would be at least 80% of this plant species 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.870
 exactly a solitary cleaning 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.790
 what kind of animal the best known among the Apulian day certainly not bred on 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.539
 bumblebee that has an action 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:50.020
 pollinators if that even more valid than our activities are 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.610
 can you develop colonies in environments that would not be appropriate for 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.129
 our tea in the mountains never happened to find bumblebees that pollinators 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:05.300
 sheets up to 2500 meters height where our bees would not succeed 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.909
 instead survive the reproduction of plant species guaranteed by the 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.029
 then pollination by this evening 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:17.269
 win a verbano-cusio-ossola the capoliveri populations as they are 

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:21.069
 Information about it there are many things because I have heard that 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:23.229
 information here of the verbano 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:28.960
 I'm not here in the Verbano cusio ossola but Italian leader we are little news 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.810
 on the presence of the Apulian days 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.650
 the most data 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.210
 recent complete we have been the census of guido straw anacreon 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.530
 turin dock for which we turned 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.990
 to deepen the project the problem get date of the numbers that came from 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:51.020
 a national project called project loves 3 97 2003 exey numbers are 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.020
 royalty 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.420
 missing some hundreds of species of aquileia compared to 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.020
 previous census 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:04.229
 then the concern that the environment insecticides human activities if from a 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:05.470
 danilo side 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.870
 related vitality problem 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.680
 honey that we see as we breed we still don't know what it is 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.130
 the impact of human activities on these wild April 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.870
 then the white stage project is precisely to prepare a series of 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.930
 shelters huts to favor the nesting of these wild pride 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.360
 and therefore during the deposition of the new go to see which species yes 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.729
 treats for the future TV and I believe the situation could escalate 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.279
 further 

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:40.439
 I am optimistic and insects exist on earth 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:44.270
 hahaha at least 100 million years 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.360
 there are at least one million two hundred thousand night spitting on the earth 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:56.190
 come out to adapt to climates and environments to variations of the globe so large that 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.790
 surely they will have the ability to be here even when maybe the man 

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:05.599
 will have some problems more then we thank listened to angel sommaruga e 

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:08.129
 we could also feel like a photographer
