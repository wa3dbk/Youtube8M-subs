only<00:02:50.010> barely<00:02:50.600> baseball<00:02:51.600> game<00:02:51.780> with<00:02:51.930> the

running man unit and you can see the

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.280 
running man unit and you can see the
guys<00:02:53.730> there<00:02:54.030> they<00:02:54.209> run<00:02:54.360> around<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.720> bases<00:02:54.840> and

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
guys there they run around the bases and

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.620
