lay it right in the score line and I

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:38.300 
lay it right in the score line and I
make<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> deeper<00:01:26.070> score<00:01:28.070> keep<00:01:29.070> going<00:01:37.250> now<00:01:38.250> you

make a deeper score keep going now you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.429 
make a deeper score keep going now you
notice<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:38.970> instead<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.840> me<00:01:39.960> holding<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
notice that instead of me holding the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.969 
notice that instead of me holding the
chisel<00:01:40.979> up<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.790> down<00:01:41.939> straight<00:01:42.509> I'm<00:01:42.979> tilting

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
chisel up and down straight I'm tilting

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.330 
chisel up and down straight I'm tilting
it<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.460> ever<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.479> slightly<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> undercut

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
it in ever so slightly so to undercut

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.520 
it in ever so slightly so to undercut
this<00:01:47.640> board<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:48.960> there<00:01:49.229> won't<00:01:49.320> be<00:01:49.470> any

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
this board so that there won't be any

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.980 
this board so that there won't be any
pieces<00:01:50.009> left<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.759> interfere<00:01:51.329> when<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:51.720> drop

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
pieces left to interfere when we drop

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.260 
pieces left to interfere when we drop
the<00:01:52.140> new<00:01:52.259> piece<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:53.210> all<00:01:54.210> right<00:01:54.390> tap<00:01:54.689> it

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.540 

all<00:01:58.270> right<00:01:58.510> once<00:01:58.960> we<00:01:59.080> get<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.380> middle<00:01:59.740> pulled

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
all right once we get the middle pulled

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.969 
all right once we get the middle pulled
out<00:02:00.790> of<00:02:00.970> here<00:02:01.210> we'd<00:02:01.450> now<00:02:01.659> have<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:01.990> void<00:02:02.620> or<00:02:02.920> a

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
out of here we'd now have a void or a

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.370 
out of here we'd now have a void or a
space<00:02:03.430> for<00:02:04.180> this<00:02:04.330> section<00:02:04.750> of<00:02:04.870> the<00:02:04.960> board<00:02:05.229> to

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
space for this section of the board to

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.090 
space for this section of the board to
come<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.830> so<00:02:06.040> we're<00:02:06.160> gonna<00:02:06.250> knock<00:02:06.550> that<00:02:06.820> out<00:02:08.100> go

come to so we're gonna knock that out go

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.960 
come to so we're gonna knock that out go
out<00:02:09.130> sit<00:02:09.610> this<00:02:09.759> one<00:02:13.680> there<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:14.980> one<00:02:15.700> side

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
out sit this one there it is one side

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:24.270 
out sit this one there it is one side
get<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:16.750> out<00:02:20.040> get<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.070> board<00:02:21.520> right<00:02:21.760> out<00:02:23.280> this

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
get it out get that board right out this

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.800 
get it out get that board right out this
side<00:02:24.580> over<00:02:24.760> here<00:02:24.910> should<00:02:25.270> come<00:02:25.390> on<00:02:25.510> even

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
side over here should come on even

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.840 
side over here should come on even
easier<00:02:28.230> okay<00:02:29.230> now<00:02:29.530> we<00:02:29.890> still<00:02:30.220> have<00:02:30.370> one<00:02:30.640> more

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
easier okay now we still have one more

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:31.680 
easier okay now we still have one more
thing<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.360> do

the<00:02:31.750> board<00:02:32.020> is<00:02:32.200> cut<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:33.010> length<00:02:33.190> fits<00:02:33.730> perfect

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
the board is cut to length fits perfect

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.120 
the board is cut to length fits perfect
but<00:02:34.420> we<00:02:34.540> can't<00:02:34.900> get<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.290> in<00:02:35.440> because<00:02:35.860> this
