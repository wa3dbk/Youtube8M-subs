00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.539
 very close to the one who won the 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.739
 mythical hill climb of pikes peak 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:30.040
 in the colorado in 2012 and 2013 with the 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:31.599
 Corsican driver bruno langlois then the 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.120
 road version sports a painting 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.219
 special red and white and 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.320
 many carbon parts like the 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.990
 little skips the ducts 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.990
 intake the cylinder head covers or 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.610

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:53.140
 lightened to specific drawing an output 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.970
 Exhaust Termignoni the saddle 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.899
 red stitching is also peculiar to 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.649
 this multistrada sporty 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.320
 the instrumentation is fully 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.379
 digital archi complete with a 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.420
 computer on board evolves and one finds 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.110
 several modes of driving that modifies 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.750
 the throttle response 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.970
 electronic the sensitivity of the decline 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.950
 or the degree of intervention ssi 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.470
 skating the fork and the damper 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.490
 electrically adjustable back 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.720
 also adapts according to the embedded load 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.229
 to start we have a map 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.549
 hands free 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.940
 then you have to lower the small latch 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.940
 their rise 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.210
 if we are high we dominate the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.210
 road it's very nice 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:52.320
 we realize that the lever 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.320
 clutch is still quite flexible 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.070
