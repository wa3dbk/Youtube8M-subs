description<00:01:29.100> as<00:01:29.700> always<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:31.020> basically<00:01:31.850> what

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
description as always so basically what

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.399 
description as always so basically what
we<00:01:32.939> can<00:01:33.030> do<00:01:33.180> with<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:33.990> kind<00:01:34.259> of

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
we can do with this is just kind of

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.620 
we can do with this is just kind of
stick<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:35.159> your<00:01:35.220> iPad<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.329> will<00:01:36.540> also

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
stick it on your iPad this will also

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.340 
stick it on your iPad this will also
work<00:01:36.810> for<00:01:37.140> any<00:01:37.290> eye<00:01:37.820> devices<00:01:38.900> anything<00:01:39.900> with

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
work for any eye devices anything with

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.100 
work for any eye devices anything with
touch<00:01:40.619> screen<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:42.060> but<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.630> probably<00:01:42.990> works

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
touch screen so but it probably works

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.569 
touch screen so but it probably works
better<00:01:43.229> with<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> tablet<00:01:44.009> because<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.340> bigger

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
better with a tablet because it's bigger

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.160 
better with a tablet because it's bigger
and<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.060> probably<00:01:45.240> play<00:01:45.570> with<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.930> more<00:01:46.110> than

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
and you probably play with it more than

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.899 
and you probably play with it more than
on<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.799> iPhone<00:01:47.100> if<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.369> don't<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:47.610> gonna

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909

on the iPhone if you don't like gonna
play<00:01:48.090> minecraft<00:01:48.299> or<00:01:48.659> something<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.079> has

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.950 
play minecraft or something that has
like<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.770> keypad<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.939> tablet<00:01:51.329> our<00:01:51.509> iPhone

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
like a keypad on the tablet our iPhone

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.249 
like a keypad on the tablet our iPhone
or<00:01:52.229> Android<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.270> will<00:01:54.450> work<00:01:54.600> for<00:01:54.840> Android

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
or Android so this will work for Android

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.800 
or Android so this will work for Android
too<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:56.549> basically<00:01:56.909> as<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.180> can<00:01:57.299> see<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> am

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
too so basically as you can see I am

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.770

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
basically turning and moving left moving

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.770 
basically turning and moving left moving
right<00:02:04.969> moving<00:02:05.969> forward

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
right moving forward

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.600 
right moving forward
moving<00:02:08.649> backwards<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:10.710> so<00:02:11.710> forth<00:02:12.040> so<00:02:12.280> this<00:02:12.460> is

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
moving backwards and so forth so this is

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.000 
moving backwards and so forth so this is
really<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:13.060> for<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.300> tablet<00:02:13.720> so<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.440> really
