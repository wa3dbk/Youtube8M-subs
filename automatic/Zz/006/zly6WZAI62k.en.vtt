you<00:04:02.030> got<00:04:02.359> the<00:04:02.569> mortars<00:04:03.049> more<00:04:03.440> towards<00:04:03.680> the

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
you got the mortars more towards the

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.620 
you got the mortars more towards the
outside<00:04:03.859> than<00:04:04.190> I'd<00:04:04.310> like<00:04:04.340> but<00:04:04.910> it<00:04:05.480> also

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
outside than I'd like but it also

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.199 
outside than I'd like but it also
creates<00:04:06.109> a<00:04:06.200> ring<00:04:06.500> it<00:04:06.769> does<00:04:07.609> sort<00:04:07.910> of<00:04:07.970> create<00:04:08.180> a

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
creates a ring it does sort of create a

creates a ring it does sort of create a
ring<00:04:08.420> there<00:04:08.690> is<00:04:08.930> that<00:04:09.290> one<00:04:09.889> defense<00:04:10.700> right<00:04:11.359> in

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
ring there is that one defense right in

ring there is that one defense right in
the<00:04:11.569> core<00:04:11.810> that's<00:04:12.680> your<00:04:12.920> air<00:04:13.160> defense<00:04:13.519> and<00:04:13.870> it

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
the core that's your air defense and it

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
something they're not going to be able

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.820 
something they're not going to be able

that's what they're after with their
hogs<00:04:23.210> they<00:04:23.450> might<00:04:23.630> bring<00:04:23.930> a<00:04:23.990> hog

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
hogs they might bring a hog

hogs they might bring a hog
b<00:04:24.480> 1<00:04:24.630> i've<00:04:24.750> seen<00:04:24.930> it<00:04:25.020> before<00:04:25.320> fog<00:04:26.130> heavy<00:04:26.340> and

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
b 1 i've seen it before fog heavy and

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.340 
b 1 i've seen it before fog heavy and
then<00:04:26.670> deploy<00:04:26.970> some<00:04:27.240> air<00:04:27.390> troops<00:04:27.660> but<00:04:28.230> they're

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
then deploy some air troops but they're

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.660 
then deploy some air troops but they're
not<00:04:28.440> going<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.620> get<00:04:28.770> that<00:04:28.920> Center<00:04:29.160> one<00:04:29.400> that

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
not going to get that Center one that

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.730 
not going to get that Center one that
center<00:04:30.000> one<00:04:30.180> is<00:04:30.360> protected<00:04:30.960> from<00:04:31.080> hogs<00:04:31.380> so<00:04:31.620> if

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
center one is protected from hogs so if

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.590 
center one is protected from hogs so if
they<00:04:31.830> do<00:04:31.950> a<00:04:31.980> mix<00:04:32.280> attack<00:04:32.580> you<00:04:33.090> should<00:04:33.300> be<00:04:33.450> all

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
they do a mix attack you should be all

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.960 
they do a mix attack you should be all
right<00:04:33.630> but<00:04:34.320> that's<00:04:34.500> it<00:04:34.770> for<00:04:35.070> this<00:04:35.160> speed<00:04:35.700> build

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970
