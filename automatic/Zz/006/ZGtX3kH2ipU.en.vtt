most people are speculating that Rick

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.980

Disney<00:01:16.380> Lucasfilm<00:01:17.070> merger<00:01:17.549> Disney<00:01:18.360> is

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
Disney Lucasfilm merger Disney is

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.210 
Disney Lucasfilm merger Disney is
gutting<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:18.960> restructuring<00:01:19.650> which<00:01:19.890> isn't<00:01:20.070> a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
gutting and restructuring which isn't a

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.100 
gutting and restructuring which isn't a
bad<00:01:20.400> thing<00:01:20.460> don't<00:01:21.420> get<00:01:21.570> me<00:01:21.689> wrong<00:01:21.720> it's

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
bad thing don't get me wrong it's

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.080 
bad thing don't get me wrong it's
perfectly<00:01:22.560> logical<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.159> Rick<00:01:23.460> saw<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.880> as

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
perfectly logical that Rick saw this as

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.270 
perfectly logical that Rick saw this as
an<00:01:24.240> opportunity<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:25.080> skirt<00:01:25.530> out<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.830> door<00:01:26.070> and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
an opportunity to skirt out the door and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.609 
an opportunity to skirt out the door and
to<00:01:26.640> step<00:01:26.939> down<00:01:27.210> from<00:01:27.390> his<00:01:27.570> position<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:28.439> it's

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
to step down from his position but it's

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.289 
to step down from his position but it's
more<00:01:28.740> fun<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.070> think<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.520> Disney<00:01:29.700> laying<00:01:30.090> down

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
more fun to think of Disney laying down

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.760 
more fun to think of Disney laying down
the<00:01:30.420> law<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.810> trying<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.200> bring<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> Star

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
the law and trying to bring the Star

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.710 
the law and trying to bring the Star
Wars<00:01:31.979> trilogy<00:01:32.280> back<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.970> its<00:01:33.090> original<00:01:33.540> roots

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
Wars trilogy back to its original roots

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.140 
Wars trilogy back to its original roots
and<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.350> think<00:01:34.680> that's<00:01:34.920> more<00:01:35.220> likely<00:01:35.460> Rick

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
and I think that's more likely Rick

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.460 
and I think that's more likely Rick
McCallum<00:01:36.479> has<00:01:36.780> been<00:01:36.869> talking<00:01:37.110> about<00:01:37.350> a
