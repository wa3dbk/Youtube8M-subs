00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:22.170
 We are going to use cardboard recycling sheets 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.350
 wire a pencil glue drilling machine 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.449
 you get an exact brooch because to 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.859
 wrap another one to laminate and 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.600
 optional a cabbage leaf 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.440
 the first thing is going to be to cut two pieces 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.899
 of the canton of 10 x 15 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.980
 let's take one of them let's 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.519
 mark two centimeters on the sides 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.539
 shorts 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:57.829
 let's join and again we're going to mark 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:01:00.309
 every centimeter and we will try in 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.309
 our brands 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.730
 and we're going to cure to end 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.950
 the whole length of forgiveness 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.830
 You may be wrong and that is 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.300
 something a little done but we did not pass 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.280
 why and we are going to use the same Tuesday 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.610
 what we did to drill the second 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.410
 cardboard stage so we will ensure 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.330
 of this correspondence lighting 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.050
 the following will be subject not only 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.490
 recycling with the help of our clamp 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.160
 Firmly attach to a piece of cardboard 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.090
 and about that start cutting with help 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.179
 from the jumper 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.179
 ah 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.940
 advice is that the packets in the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.440
 few leaves 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.950
 i 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.950
 ah 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.620
 and so we're going to have all the sheets of the 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.620
 size of our notebook 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.299
 Y 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.740
 let's start by putting together your notebook 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.990
 see that it has the size that the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.579
 way and now what follows is to drill 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.399
 the parent sheets where we are going to 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.979
 help from one of the covers to a clamp 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.560
 to join that they do not move and every 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.190
 few leaves zones 56 depends on how 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.220
 sharp three punches we're going to go 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.220
 Marking through the holes 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.220
 ah 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.550
 is the recipe grabbing shape 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:36.159
 the next thing is to erase each of the 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.200
 walkways first with a paper for 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.200
 wrap and then fonts 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.930
 Y 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.200
 possibly when lining in 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.730
 discover the perforations does not matter 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.530
 if they put it on it is a piece of tape 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.530
 Thomas to be able to prepare again 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.860
 in this case I'm going to take one of the 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.019
 leftovers to do a technique that is 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.940
 technique so that it lasts until I have a 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.599
 small agreement to put costs and 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.599
 visits 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.120
 then we also remember this 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.120
 small to the we will form 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.830
 everything has been lined up let's proceed to 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.820
 place the others you need are papers 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.820
 contact 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.770
 this trick of lining and plasticizing and 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.300
 then place the spiral that can be 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.340
 It is not also to line your notebooks 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.320
 that you bought in the store like this 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.550
 you have a higher quality result and 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.550
 they are much more protected 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:14.470
 what without developing our wire 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:16.180
 that can be an old spiral we're going 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.800
 to roll on the tits using the 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.230
 marker so that it is more or less 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.720
 thick 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.790
 once it's rolled up let's move on 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.340
 this spiral through the holes for the 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.340
 notepad and betting caps 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:34.149
 to wind carefully each one of 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:37.889
 the holes and in the end we're going to fold 

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:37.889
 spiral in such a way that it does not come off 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.830
 new notebook
