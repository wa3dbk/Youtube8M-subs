00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.540
 A trend that has been going on in the auto industry 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.910
 Watching a few years is that 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.170
 Equip of normal 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.910
 Road vehicles with a little higher 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.040
 laid vehicle and all around 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.260
 decorative elements to make them look like 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.420
 you could drive it into the ground a 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.980
 opposite trend that exists 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.740
 but it is not longer 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.840
 quite as popular is the equip of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.859
 with normal road vehicles 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.810
 all wheel drive 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.269
 Of course you can not do that either 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.880
 drive into the terrain but it helps 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.390
 The street is a bit safer 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.739
 an example of this is the seat leon sp 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.719
 For today I am testing the leon ass 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.390
 de lists an extrovert 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.890
 sporty edgy exterior to more 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.410
 Dynamics also carries the backwards 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.270
 sloping roofline at the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.610
 compared to his company brother the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.219
 skoda octavia of his mark as well 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.649
 acts as a sporting combinatorial available 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.710
 the leon es dfl indesign younger and 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.710
 fresh 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.200
 unlike the sport version of the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.970
 skoda octavia octavia rs for us 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.770
 just two engines a petrol engine 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.479
 and there is a diesel for that 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.240
 leon sp. fr 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.740
 a total of three engines in five 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.180
 different power levels 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.910
 two of them are diesel engines once with 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.820
 135 kw 2 liter tdi and once this 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.180
 here also a two liter tdi with 110 kw 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.180
 power 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.540
 they want a flattened down 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.020
 Steering wheel and red stitching to the driver 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.110
 say I'm athletic at least in the sd 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.700
 fr you still do not have to 587 liters 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.700
 refrain from luggage space volume 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.119
 which I do not understand but that is included 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.310
 Almost all car manufacturers the same 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.170
 These are these metal afford here 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.840
 The loading edge that they initially 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.760
 Nice but if you were a few times something 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.519
 one has unloaded and then that is in 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.810
 usually scrapped and then that is 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.340
 not so nice anymore if it is not there 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.340
 There is some other possibility 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.260
 but now he was standing long enough 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.879
 quietly, you finally buy the 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.190
 Sport variant especially on the way 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.870
 He learns how to drive 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.970
 but behave quite 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.060
 unproblematic and of course by 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.000
 the four-wheel drive much more neutral 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.099
 as the leon with front wheel drive in 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.170
 fast driven curves but like times 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:53.690
 under controls our test car with one 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.000
 power of 110 kw enough around the 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.750
 using all four wheels in 8.7 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.500
 seconds to accelerate to 100 km h 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.420
 29 1290 euro costs the sdr at least 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.430
 In Germany the consumption should be at 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.430
 4.8 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:19.319
 In practice, however, one ends up 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:21.750
 at just over 6 liters one 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.810
 helps sport version he has rarely 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.790
 a gentle gas foot and how does he look 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.739
 leon in the highest equipment line 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.659
 I think that's a pity for them 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.370
 used material here in the interior 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:39.209
 especially here at the door 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.040
 the car has now 3700 kilometers only 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.680
 down and you can see everywhere 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.200
 on this plastic water stains that 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.010
 Of course, there's nothing wrong with a door 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.019
 extraordinary yes you open it up 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.150
 it is raining it gets wet and then it is 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.790
 water on it but then you would have to 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.760
 but take a material where no 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.000
 Residues on it remain beautiful I think 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.700
 that there is something shiny around here 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.930
 ventilation and the infotainment system and 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.000
 also here on the other side of 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.459
 instrument that is beautiful that would have been nice 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.709
 I actually wanted more often 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.739
 see here in the car to ask more because 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.120
 the rest especially here too 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:20.510
 navigation system that affects everything 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:23.580
 a little loveless a lovable one 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.940
 equipment detail costs at the leon 970 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.130
 Euro 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.880
 It is in the roof and pleased 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.880
 Matt is very nice 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.030
 nice is the panoramic sunroof for 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:38.520
 There is hardly any wind noise when you see it 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:43.849
 but you still have one 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:47.580
 the feeling you sit in the open air 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:50.190
 a green combination with alex and outside like 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:56.069
 inside sporty there one hardly expects 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:57.479
 that he has a price certain good I mean 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.580
 the fr version is of course the 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.159
 sportiest there it is clear that the 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.740
 seats offer good lateral support for this 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:07.830
 this car also costs just under 30,000 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.639
 euro in the basic equipment, however 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.289
 with extras for around 5 6000 euro in 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:19.340
 Germany is then full 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:19.340
 equipped are there 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.460
 All in all, I like the seat leon 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.950
 it's very good even if the name is something 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.750
 long and difficult to remember is the 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.650
 Four-wheel drive is my personal 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:35.620
 highlight because in a sports version of 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:38.290
 octavia you will not find four -wheel drive 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.770
 But that just gives the vehicle 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.090
 Personally, I find the last bit 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.450
 driving stability what you really need 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.970
 to speed on the highway and in 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.880
 there are curves on the way unfortunately 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:56.170
 the four- wheel drive in the seat leon str 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:06:00.810
 only in the 110 kw variant and not in 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.810
 the strongest 135 kw variant
