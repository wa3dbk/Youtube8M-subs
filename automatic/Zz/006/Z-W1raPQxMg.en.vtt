00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
based on basically barbarians with

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.910 
based on basically barbarians with
technology<00:04:05.390> so<00:04:05.660> of<00:04:05.900> course<00:04:06.110> they<00:04:06.260> know<00:04:06.380> metal

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
technology so of course they know metal

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.350 
technology so of course they know metal
works<00:04:07.130> and<00:04:07.430> stuff<00:04:07.670> so<00:04:07.880> I<00:04:07.910> really<00:04:08.060> thought

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
works and stuff so I really thought

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.330 
works and stuff so I really thought
about<00:04:08.570> that<00:04:08.750> when<00:04:08.870> I<00:04:08.930> was<00:04:09.080> doing<00:04:09.410> this<00:04:09.560> you

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
about that when I was doing this you

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.820 
about that when I was doing this you
know<00:04:10.370> based<00:04:10.730> in<00:04:10.910> a<00:04:11.030> real<00:04:11.239> world<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:11.989> I<00:04:12.769> took

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
know based in a real world and I took

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.850 
know based in a real world and I took
out<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.519> deckle<00:04:14.269> fortunately<00:04:15.200> I<00:04:15.230> did<00:04:15.470> save<00:04:15.739> it

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
out the deckle fortunately I did save it

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.620 
out the deckle fortunately I did save it
and<00:04:15.950> I<00:04:15.980> turned<00:04:16.220> it<00:04:16.310> into<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:16.549> fridge<00:04:16.850> magnet<00:04:17.030> but

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
and I turned it into a fridge magnet but

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.120 
and I turned it into a fridge magnet but
I<00:04:17.660> think<00:04:18.049> I'm<00:04:18.169> just<00:04:18.320> I<00:04:18.530> don't<00:04:18.770> know<00:04:18.890> what<00:04:19.010> I'm

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
I think I'm just I don't know what I'm

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.279 
I think I'm just I don't know what I'm

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
the old designs of the Hema and stuff

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.410 
the old designs of the Hema and stuff
but<00:04:59.980> it<00:05:00.980> was<00:05:01.130> all<00:05:01.250> ripped<00:05:01.520> off<00:05:01.730> and<00:05:02.060> shredded

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
but it was all ripped off and shredded

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.820 
but it was all ripped off and shredded
so<00:05:02.570> I<00:05:02.600> didn't<00:05:02.870> save<00:05:03.080> it<00:05:03.110> turn<00:05:03.470> it<00:05:03.590> into<00:05:03.710> a

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
so I didn't save it turn it into a

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.450 
so I didn't save it turn it into a
fridge<00:05:04.100> magnet<00:05:04.280> but<00:05:05.030> I<00:05:06.160> definitely<00:05:07.160> wanted<00:05:07.340> to

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
fridge magnet but I definitely wanted to

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.820

throne<00:05:11.780> was<00:05:11.930> broke<00:05:12.140> and<00:05:12.320> it<00:05:12.410> didn't<00:05:12.680> work<00:05:12.710> so<00:05:12.830> I

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
throne was broke and it didn't work so I

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.380 
throne was broke and it didn't work so I
had<00:05:13.070> to<00:05:13.220> do<00:05:13.340> something<00:05:13.670> different

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
had to do something different

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.570 
had to do something different
this<00:05:15.050> still<00:05:15.260> works<00:05:15.470> fine<00:05:15.710> with<00:05:16.280> the<00:05:16.400> weight

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
this still works fine with the weight

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.050 
this still works fine with the weight
and<00:05:17.000> everything<00:05:17.180> it<00:05:17.540> doesn't<00:05:17.720> hang<00:05:18.020> up<00:05:18.970> but<00:05:19.970> if

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
and everything it doesn't hang up but if

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.409

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.560 
it's still got a long way to go because
I<00:05:33.740> mean<00:05:34.010> it<00:05:34.160> does<00:05:34.370> look<00:05:34.400> rather<00:05:34.850> plain<00:05:35.300> to<00:05:35.540> me

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
I mean it does look rather plain to me

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.390 
I mean it does look rather plain to me
and<00:05:35.840> I<00:05:36.050> want<00:05:36.200> to<00:05:36.290> get<00:05:36.350> the<00:05:36.500> old<00:05:36.620> cutouts<00:05:37.100> I

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
and I want to get the old cutouts I

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.370 
and I want to get the old cutouts I
found<00:05:37.700> them<00:05:37.850> online<00:05:38.000> just<00:05:38.540> Google<00:05:38.870> Grayskull

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
found them online just Google Grayskull

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.920 
found them online just Google Grayskull
cardboard<00:05:39.979> cutouts<00:05:40.360> and<00:05:41.360> you<00:05:41.510> can<00:05:41.660> probably

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
cardboard cutouts and you can probably

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.469 
cardboard cutouts and you can probably
print<00:05:42.140> them<00:05:42.260> off<00:05:42.410> yourself<00:05:42.890> or<00:05:43.210> and<00:05:44.210> they<00:05:44.360> also

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
print them off yourself or and they also

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.690 
print them off yourself or and they also
have<00:05:44.690> the<00:05:44.810> deckle<00:05:45.110> sheets<00:05:45.320> there<00:05:45.590> that's<00:05:46.580> how

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
have the deckle sheets there that's how

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.219 
have the deckle sheets there that's how
I<00:05:46.729> found<00:05:47.000> them<00:05:47.270> I<00:05:47.360> just<00:05:47.570> haven't<00:05:47.750> I<00:05:47.960> don't<00:05:48.050> have

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
I found them I just haven't I don't have

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:50.440 
I found them I just haven't I don't have
a<00:05:48.260> printer<00:05:48.620> so<00:05:49.520> I<00:05:49.580> haven't<00:05:49.729> done<00:05:49.940> it<00:05:50.030> yet<00:05:50.180> so

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
a printer so I haven't done it yet so

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.940 
a printer so I haven't done it yet so
I'll<00:05:50.570> probably<00:05:50.720> go<00:05:50.900> someplace<00:05:51.169> pro<00:05:51.620> and<00:05:51.830> get

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
I'll probably go someplace pro and get

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.850 
I'll probably go someplace pro and get
them<00:05:52.040> done<00:05:52.310> up<00:05:52.460> really<00:05:52.880> really<00:05:53.000> nicely<00:05:53.860> that's
