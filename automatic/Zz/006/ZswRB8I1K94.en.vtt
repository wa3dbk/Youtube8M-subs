00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 Hey, people, my name is bruno andrade. 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.840
 Let's go to another video lesson and more. 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.639
 a video tutoring notebook maintenance 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.059
 today will be a video lesson on trading 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.690
 memory or memory upgrade or 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.510
 literally the component exchange 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.410
 I'm going to use a notebook is a time that 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.680
 Lenovo 410 asks for this model is not 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.630
 new it has a particularity is 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.399
 it has a memory module in the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.700
 bottom of the equipment on the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.649
 and another memory module is in the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.350
 direction of the keyboard that we have to 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.550
 removed the keyboard to be able to exchange this 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.309
 hot memory 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.230
 so let's go the step by step with which the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.840
 people will make this exchange and remember 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.520
 always on a rubberized surface or 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.530
 damage the equipment will become a 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:01:01.530
 I always take the battery and I will not 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.809
 have no equipment or remove this 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.810
 first lid is very simple on the 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.400
 his home icon comes a drawing in the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.680
 memory house 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.939
 so it 's also a strategy that I 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.869
 I'm single, both here already have access 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.650
 the memory 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.750
 I have a bike moto memory module 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.390
 southall way to drop is simple 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.240
 also has two beams on the side only 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.030
 pushed through the ends of the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.650
 memory goes up alone then remove this 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.900
 memory and upgrade the troop in order to 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.079
 to make sense even though I always 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.460
 enters with it inclined from the 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.869
 The moment I put her in the hospital 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.970
 until the end to the ro I down these 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.860
 delay but alone 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.570
 So far so good, it's a simple business to 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.270
 a great majority of the people know how to do 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.280
 this procedure now go to the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.280
 particularity of the equipment that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.090
 memory change on the inside of the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.979
 equipment 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.619
 come on guys who move the lid 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.990
 removed the first 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:14.140
 memory has finally been upgraded 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.050
 consider the following as I know these 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.180
 lenovo notebooks in the specific case there 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.110
 the lenovo ibm 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.320
 this has everything a part of the screw here 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.150
 Everything is drawn in the house so I know 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.890
 What are the screws for the 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.170
 keyboard and I need to release the keyboard. 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.690
 to access a memory student is 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.430
 below him so I let go already 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.200
 only have all the screws of the 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.240
 rule the keyboard or turn a notebook I 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.190
 sign a tip that I have there was one 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.160
 of the first video lessons on the channel there 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.600
 that the keyboard switch of the notebook 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.220
 anyone who wants can take a look at this 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.070
 viola that will have a better sense of 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.320
 How to remove you will notice that there I 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.280
 I dropped a power suit here on a panel 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.340
 front 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.110
 then remove the keyboard from those 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.910
 specific models just a little bit 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.240
 to remove keyboard 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.430
 mouse or t3 for base usage I can 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.770
 put a space there is to use the 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.550
 spatula the same amount per 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.610
 dentists and I will make a bank already 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:22.600
 starts to come out easy keyboard remembering is 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.270
 always careful because there down here 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.730
 If I can get down here, there's a 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.390
 Flash cheese and the flash is stuck in 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.790
 board 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:35.590
 I do not need to take the game flat. 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:39.100
 keyboard there already has a wide view 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.600
 here where will power plate processor 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.490
 online 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.280
 and then my memory hidden here 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.830
 underneath that plastic film 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.630
 I have one more memory module then 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.510
 sometimes you think you only have the 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.760
 option to change the memory and not make 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.840
 upgrade and itaipu has a memory 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.270
 Hidden Memory and Lenovo Equipment 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.760
 the same way I did in the first 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.240
 module 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.700
 changed took less places others do 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.740
 the upgrade leaves off 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.260
 there goes from every one any idea 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.810
 any intention of doing so 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.930
 this memory access way of putting 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.389
 always the same 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.820
 There's nothing I'm going to download, we ask. 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.550
 to volume in my notebook is medium 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.259
 dirty with bad contact that is now me 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.289
 I have already brought to mind that the 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:33.590
 open and make a preventive on it or 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:36.660
 until a very superficial cleaning 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.240
 I indicate this guy here is clean with 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.680
 tata on propaganda no but it's 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.630
 matic contact 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.139
 in my opinion is one of the best is a 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:49.500
 contact clear electronic contact is he 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:52.320
 to be a producer of potentiometer wave 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.520
 connectors and lady at last 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:00.030
 so what I do a little contact 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:03.090
 to ensure that it will relieve this 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:06.090
 plate is any kind of bad oxidation 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.470
 contact I can use on no board 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.110
 There is no problem 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.090
 This is it in 30 seconds and 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.590
 It's logical, I'll keep a 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:19.190
 distance of at least 10 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:22.169
 centimeters and the spray left out 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:25.229
 again in memory and put in training 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:32.010
 always putting a notebook 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:34.680
 ok it was to the end below the clasp back 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.110
 Positional keyboard always 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.830
 worry fits perfectly into the 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:43.260
 locks and then I'll hit the keyboard 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.900
 until you are sure that you are 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:49.970
 completed work done or 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:52.349
 close the lot back in the original position 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.840
 close the memory cover 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:58.220
 published matter protest let's go there 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.220
 fire will call to protest 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:04.650
 I closed to do as the text sent 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:10.500
 head and upgrade cleaning 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:16.289
 preventative anyway take notebook there and see 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:19.080
 Working there she gave xiao to save 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.909
 windows start if you have some 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.550
 Memory conflict obviously not 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:25.860
 maybe it would not even start right? 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.600
 So this is another video lesson. 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.790
 about how to 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.160
 I heard a church from memory or a thunderbolt. 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.540
 maybe even preventive maintenance snow 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.450
 the guy is thinking that the greatest talent 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:39.270
 finally he goes there and will take the comb out of 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.220
 memory of them will play a spray and 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.650
 clean tell that here we find 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:47.220
 people who are paulo meet in the center 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:50.340
 of the city around 10 to 15 reais a 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:53.400
 tube since hard enough it's very useful 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:55.350
 not just in a notebook or video game 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.390
 tablets and cell phone 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.130
 the staff comes very used a lot 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.560
 This here is so a tip is a lot 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:05.400
 good to always have the product had to 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:08.190
 hand but he is to buy the staff has 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.250
 also from some silicone does not 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:14.670
 silicone always clean contact for nothing 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:16.830
 wd and nothing ever oil clean 

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:19.320
 aerosol contract 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:21.840
 then the timbu to start is already in my 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:24.330
 screen of the perfect goal completed more 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.790
 one more video lesson our more 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.140
 how to replace the 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.600
 memory 

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.490
 I hope you enjoyed it I enjoyed it 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.680
 to sign up for the online channel on 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.230
 video on making your comment lets you 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.160
 your doubt that as far as possible I 

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.930
 I'll answer 

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.930
 Thank you and a hug to everyone.
