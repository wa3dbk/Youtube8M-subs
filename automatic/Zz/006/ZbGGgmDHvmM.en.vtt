anyways this is the practice course that

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.510 
anyways this is the practice course that
are<00:01:21.420> two<00:01:21.600> sections<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.960> go<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:23.130> first<00:01:23.340> one

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
are two sections you go to the first one

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.700 
are two sections you go to the first one
I<00:01:23.820> probably<00:01:24.210> took<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> most<00:01:24.810> time<00:01:24.990> out<00:01:25.500> of

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
I probably took the most time out of

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.039 
I probably took the most time out of
sizes<00:01:25.979> right<00:01:26.490> entertaining<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
sizes right entertaining this is the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.249 
sizes right entertaining this is the
farm<00:01:28.470> area<00:01:28.770> or<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.009> pond<00:01:29.159> area<00:01:30.049> basically<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
farm area or the pond area basically the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.350 
farm area or the pond area basically the
rest<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.560> they're<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.770> chickens<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:33.329> I

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
rest is they're just chickens and I

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.880 
rest is they're just chickens and I
believe<00:01:33.720> if<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.049> chase<00:01:34.380> them<00:01:34.560> around

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
believe if you chase them around

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.289 
believe if you chase them around
something<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> pin<00:01:35.880> or<00:01:36.000> something

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
something to like a pin or something

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.260 
something to like a pin or something
you<00:01:36.900> want<00:01:37.049> like<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.229> track<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.920> believe<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.579> New

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
the wall actually in practice mode it

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.649 
the wall actually in practice mode it
doesn't<00:02:59.700> matter<00:02:59.909> how<00:02:59.970> many<00:03:00.030> times<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.419> bump

new template ever really lived near the
beaches<00:03:31.229> right<00:03:31.530> so<00:03:31.769> I<00:03:32.510> remember<00:03:33.510> back<00:03:33.659> in<00:03:33.690> my

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
beaches right so I remember back in my

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.909 
beaches right so I remember back in my
element<00:03:34.169> here<00:03:34.199> school<00:03:34.470> we<00:03:34.620> used<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:34.799> have<00:03:34.889> a

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
element here school we used to have a

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.729

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
bit more of the time trial just because

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.940 
bit more of the time trial just because
I<00:04:38.300> was<00:04:38.600> a<00:04:38.630> little<00:04:38.960> bit<00:04:39.260> more<00:04:39.530> generous<00:04:40.840> and

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
I was a little bit more generous and

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.530 
I was a little bit more generous and
again<00:04:42.950> less<00:04:43.190> I<00:04:43.370> said<00:04:43.610> friends<00:04:43.820> of<00:04:43.970> Canali<00:04:44.210> I

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
again less I said friends of Canali I

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.870 
again less I said friends of Canali I
didn't<00:04:45.020> show<00:04:45.200> completely<00:04:45.890> in<00:04:46.160> fact<00:04:46.370> much<00:04:46.580> of

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
didn't show completely in fact much of

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.480 
didn't show completely in fact much of
the<00:04:47.060> time<00:04:47.210> trials<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:48.470> so<00:04:48.770> this<00:04:48.980> is<00:04:49.130> basically

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
the time trials and so this is basically

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.740 
the time trials and so this is basically
the<00:04:49.670> mini<00:04:49.880> four<00:04:50.090> time<00:04:50.210> trials

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
the mini four time trials

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.930 
the mini four time trials
I<00:04:50.900> basically<00:04:51.320> you<00:04:51.770> just<00:04:52.040> do<00:04:52.160> selected<00:04:52.670> track

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
I basically you just do selected track

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.940 
I basically you just do selected track
then<00:04:53.270> you<00:04:53.360> could<00:04:53.480> see<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:53.810> records<00:04:54.170> just

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
then you could see the records just

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.880 
then you could see the records just
first<00:04:55.130> a<00:04:55.280> and<00:04:55.790> you're<00:04:56.180> good<00:04:56.390> to<00:04:56.510> go

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
first a and you're good to go

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.410 
first a and you're good to go
so<00:04:57.890> I<00:04:58.310> have<00:04:58.550> a<00:04:58.580> list<00:04:58.820> of<00:04:58.880> all<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.180> tracks

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
so I have a list of all the tracks

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.150 
so I have a list of all the tracks
except<00:04:59.840> for<00:05:00.020> that<00:05:00.200> other<00:05:00.500> track<00:05:00.800> which<00:05:00.980> I
