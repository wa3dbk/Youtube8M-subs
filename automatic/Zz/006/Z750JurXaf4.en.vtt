00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.070
 hello how are you welcome today what 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.049
 let's do is order my wardrobe / closet that 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.980
 I bought some people who already came 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:21.820
 looking for time that are these 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:26.740
 that are very well finite to understand 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:30.759
 It takes up very little space they are pretty 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:33.910
 big ones seem like very square in their 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:39.070
 way and what this does is keep the 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:40.960
 garment straight and well shaped and makes 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.989
 that the shoulders of overcoat of 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.040
 toys on garlic do not fall and 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.230
 the garment is not available 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.720
 Laps here to hang up if it's any 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.940
 dress or some blouse complete the 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.969
 finite and they are also velvet 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.239
 So what this does is that the 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.460
 pledge do not skid like in your business 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.930
 of clothes with the basic move aesthetics of 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.140
 all good should have our 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.979
 I bought these fake ones in sodimac 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.360
 pack of 10 people needed pesos and it is 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.840
 how good are we going to try to see how 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.910
 they remain and if they optimize the little space 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.500
 that as they see hairstyle what also 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:26.430
 I bought 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:28.300
 The more these containers are boxes 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.270
 drawer organizers 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.240
 what are really acrylic these 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.060
 I bought them to find an interior 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.760
 to put the stockings and all those things 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.100
 that are small there but always 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.890
 they are like very scattered the drawer is 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.840
 they lose space is not optimized well 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.790
 let's see how it is with this I 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.130
 I have little clothes but what I want is 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.800
 have it well or well ordered well 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.330
 hung to be able to choose easier 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.330
 time to get dressed 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.799
 Hello 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.500
 girls want to tell you something that one of 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.350
 the things that I bought once for 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.960
 remove the space is this hanger that is 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.110
 to hang pants that comes four 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.360
 pasta in one actually and that in 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.240
 terms of spaces and an optimist 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.770
 before because they look at the arito that yes 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.650
 we can hang four pants but 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.240
 practical value is not practical at all 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.130
 because when hanging the four 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.130
 pants the part becomes 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.500
 extremely heavy to take out and 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.270
 when you want to take off a pair of pants 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.730
 great if you want to take the top one 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:07.320
 but if you want to get this out of here you have 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:11.510
 that raise this well take this out if 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:14.130
 you want to hang up or tell you is another Chinese 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.960
 another one of the things when you lower the 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.330
 hangers is always that claw is not 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.430
 you're always going to grab your finger is a 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.520
 thing that but I do not really know in 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.610
 elements to me did not turn out to be for 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.570
 that these letters are clearly going 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.570
 of my plate no 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.150
 what I'm going to do is line the drawers 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.520
 with a cardboard so that the clothes do not 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.560
 lean directly on the wood and 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.560
 also to make it aesthetically more 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.220
 no no 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.740
 I recommend you use a book or a 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.470
 magazine I use my ipad to double the 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.200
 Sweaters and T-shirts all the same and with 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.300
 the same width they put it in the middle of the 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.200
 neck and fold the sleeves using the 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.200
 book as diaz 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.639
 all right 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.030
 It is advisable to stack the sweaters or 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:35.129
 t-shirts interspersing the senses for 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.340
 that the stack is armed couple and occupy 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:40.500
 less space another save option is 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.080
 fold the garment in half and store it 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.909
 stop the good thing is that they enter more 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.849
 clothes in the drawer and that also 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:50.189
 can better visualize each one the bad 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.879
 is that especially the shirts are wrinkled 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:52.879
 too 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.150
 well that's how I stay then 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.650
 ordered the wardrobe / closet note these are 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.319
 the common letters to camps and 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.080
 pants because in reality minds of 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:15.970
 these new letters that you buy but the 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.820
 space that occupy four of these 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:23.210
 letters and the space they occupy 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.820
 which occupies four of these is much much 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.270
 the youngest the skirts I have the 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.650
 typical hangers of skirts 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.450
 but I know that from this same line of 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.210
 the marches I bought come the 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:41.139
 hooks very similar to these 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.030
 that are attached to this hanger but 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.669
 when I went to buy they were not so 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:49.349
 I'll wait to get those and 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.349
 change these hangers that come 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.470
 Hello 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.310
 and
