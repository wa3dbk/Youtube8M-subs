00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
this is what most people are thinking

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.560 
this is what most people are thinking
about<00:00:41.960> starting<00:00:42.960> out<00:00:43.140> with<00:00:43.380> and<00:00:44.360> I'm<00:00:45.360> going<00:00:45.540> to

about starting out with and I'm going to
discourage<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.290> 100%<00:00:47.120> I'm<00:00:48.120> going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.360> say<00:00:48.480> if

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
you're going to start relighting in any

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.370 
you're going to start relighting in any
way<00:00:50.040> shape<00:00:50.399> or<00:00:50.550> form<00:00:50.840> you<00:00:51.840> need<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.079> start<00:00:52.260> with

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 
way shape or form you need to start with

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.990 
way shape or form you need to start with
pistol<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.310> I<00:00:54.180> get<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.450> feel<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:56.000> go

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
pistol and I get the feel for it and go

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.890 
pistol and I get the feel for it and go
from<00:00:57.180> there

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
from there

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.340 
from there
and<00:00:59.140> I<00:00:59.560> guess<00:00:59.800> people<00:01:00.160> are<00:01:00.340> worried<00:01:01.240> about

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
and I guess people are worried about

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.620 
and I guess people are worried about
having<00:01:02.350> food<00:01:02.850> one<00:01:03.850> of<00:01:03.880> these<00:01:04.089> things<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:07.390> I

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
having food one of these things and I

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.870 
having food one of these things and I
understand<00:01:08.080> that's<00:01:08.740> half<00:01:09.250> paid<00:01:09.550> attention

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
understand that's half paid attention

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.560 
understand that's half paid attention
and<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.780> ammo<00:01:11.140> is<00:01:11.200> gone<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:12.390> there's<00:01:13.390> also

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
and the ammo is gone and there's also

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.300 
and the ammo is gone and there's also
some<00:01:13.900> problems<00:01:14.260> in<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.440> relighting<00:01:14.890> world<00:01:15.100> as

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
some problems in the relighting world as

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.700 
some problems in the relighting world as
well<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.630> I'll<00:01:17.619> go<00:01:17.830> into<00:01:18.010> that<00:01:19.410> so<00:01:20.410> if<00:01:20.530> you're

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
you're going to start reloading with a

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.930 
you're going to start reloading with a
progressive<00:02:22.240> press<00:02:22.480> as<00:02:22.870> your<00:02:23.050> first<00:02:23.290> press

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
progressive press as your first press

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.760 
progressive press as your first press
you<00:02:24.940> want<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.180> kind<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.420> try<00:02:25.599> to<00:02:25.660> simulate<00:02:26.050> as

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
you want to kind of try to simulate as

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.790 
you want to kind of try to simulate as
much<00:02:27.099> as<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.370> can<00:02:27.959> making<00:02:28.959> it<00:02:29.200> into<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.470> single

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
much as you can making it into a single

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.309 
much as you can making it into a single
stage<00:02:30.130> press<00:02:30.430> or<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.940> know<00:02:31.150> close<00:02:31.540> anyway<00:02:32.020> and

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
stage press or you know close anyway and

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.309 
stage press or you know close anyway and
I'm<00:02:32.980> going<00:02:33.099> to<00:02:33.160> start<00:02:33.370> by<00:02:33.930> removing<00:02:34.930> this

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
I'm going to start by removing this

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.620 
I'm going to start by removing this
block<00:02:35.620> which<00:02:35.970> cycles<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.090> primer<00:02:37.330> feed

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
block which cycles the primer feed

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.350 
block which cycles the primer feed
feeder<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.349> I'll<00:02:38.500> show<00:02:38.770> you<00:02:38.830> why

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
feeder and I'll show you why

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.510 
feeder and I'll show you why
alright<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:40.540> I'm<00:02:40.630> going<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.900> cycle<00:02:41.530> primer

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
alright so I'm going to cycle primer

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.570 
alright so I'm going to cycle primer
feature<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.500> see<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.590> first<00:02:44.770> primer<00:02:45.160> show<00:02:45.430> up

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
feature I see the first primer show up

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.050 
feature I see the first primer show up
and<00:02:46.000> there<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.510> is<00:02:46.599> right<00:02:46.780> there<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.970> know

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
and there it is right there and I know

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.010 
and there it is right there and I know
that<00:02:49.620> it's<00:02:50.620> not<00:02:50.800> going<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.010> cycle<00:02:51.160> another<00:02:51.550> one

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
that it's not going to cycle another one

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.540 
that it's not going to cycle another one
so<00:02:53.020> instead<00:02:53.140> of<00:02:53.380> using<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.830> case<00:02:54.010> feeder<00:02:54.310> I'm

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
so instead of using the case feeder I'm

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.600 
so instead of using the case feeder I'm
just<00:02:54.910> going<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.150> drop<00:02:55.360> them<00:02:55.569> in<00:02:55.690> one<00:02:55.720> at<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:56.080> time

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
just going to drop them in one at a time

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.500 
just going to drop them in one at a time
I'm<00:02:57.610> going<00:02:57.730> to<00:02:57.819> put<00:02:57.970> them<00:02:58.030> right<00:02:58.180> there<00:02:58.239> in

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
I'm going to put them right there in

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.800 
I'm going to put them right there in
that<00:02:58.569> little<00:02:58.690> bottle

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.319 

so<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:02.840> would<00:03:03.049> recommend<00:03:03.200> patients<00:03:03.939> the<00:03:04.939> reason

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
so I would recommend patients the reason

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.530 
so I would recommend patients the reason
I'm<00:03:05.959> showing<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.409> to<00:03:06.530> you<00:03:06.650> like<00:03:06.799> this<00:03:07.510> so<00:03:08.510> that

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
a problem there but primers going to be

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.170 
a problem there but primers going to be
number<00:03:51.290> one<00:03:51.500> I<00:03:51.739> don't<00:03:52.459> care<00:03:52.670> what<00:03:52.879> kind<00:03:53.150> of

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
I think I don't mean to make it sound

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:10.500 
I think I don't mean to make it sound
easy<00:04:06.530> and<00:04:07.400> eventually<00:04:07.910> we<00:04:08.060> will<00:04:08.949> the<00:04:09.949> point

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
easy and eventually we will the point

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.360 
easy and eventually we will the point
that<00:04:11.510> when<00:04:11.750> everything<00:04:12.470> supposed<00:04:13.040> to<00:04:13.160> feel
