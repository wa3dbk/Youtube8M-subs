00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.899
 very good girls very good guys 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.900
 polemic in fifa 14 is iker squares the 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.170
 best goalie in the game will be valdez 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.480
 among the top 10 goalkeepers in what 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.980
 it's being the player's valuation 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.690
 in the global final score 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.220
 Attentive points because there are so many 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.410
 surprises and not just with the goalkeepers 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.119
 but for example with a bale card that does not 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.689
 is not even among the 10 players 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.909
 best game and is that squares is not 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.370
 good of khaled, what could we 

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:37.979
 discuss because still he has not yet 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.620
 proved if you want to debate this is 

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:42.149
 this thing does not gareth bale it but 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.979
 at least he is a very good player not 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.549
 I think that among the top ten yes 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:49.319
 they are and boxes because it is not the 

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:51.449
 unquestionable goalkeeper of the game the best 

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:53.609
 world's goalkeeper but he is buffoon 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.370
 above him you want buffon is 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:59.659
 above the web ine in all three 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.449
 tied jester squares and neuer for that 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.500
 order and then it will be peter cech the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.810
 chelsea goalkeeper 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.170
 cry to 15 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.200
 wa 15 how to pronounce forgiven 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.329
 handanovic sirigu marketing and adler and 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.610
 these are the top ten in terms of 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:21.119
 valuation and already very much the attention 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.880
 that is neither valdés nor courtney the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.729
 madrid courtois goalkeeper 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.119
 among the first 10 curtois as 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.130
 say sorry forgive me do not mess me 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.810
 with the cult languages to we go to 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.049
 call like that among the top ten 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.470
 really who has made these 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.330
 valuations the valuations but that 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.299
 Victor Vctor is not among the ten 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.340
 best goalkeepers in the world I think 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.319
 being from Madrid as I am, it seems like a 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.450
 very important offense for this 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.520
 sport and I think they should 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.720
 modify because valdés is without any 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.330
 kind of doubts among the top five 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.649
 goalkeepers of the world to this day and 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.840
 it also calls me a lot of attention 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.250
 that is neither of gea 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.890
 neither die lopez nor 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.470
 many goalkeepers who are very good 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.509
 goalkeepers and to this day are some of the 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.330
 best goalkeepers in the world because they are 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:18.350
 more and more sheet turn so there's 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.330
 a lot of controversy in the forums as 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.670
 if people what is commenting what 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.040
 is saying and on the same page where 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:31.140
 the source of the news begins to 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.910
 say that they seem an outrage and 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.530
 I'm speechless I want me 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.270
 comment and not only has happened with that 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.040
 but with gareth bale I also comment 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.810
 is not have one has an evaluation 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.959
 very high neither in the game now not 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.810
 I would know how to tell you but it does not have a 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.240
 evaluation pose to be among the 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.880
 five first or the first ten or 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.850
 something like that I do not remember well so I want 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.040
 that you tell me guys from sybase this 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.040
 you have to modify the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.720
 statistics of the players because I 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.730
 it seems that they are quite unbalanced 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.870
 without anything faithful to the reality as soon as 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.530
 at least as regards the 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.970
 goalkeepers and I have a little bit of fear in 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.100
 this aspect so I want me to 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.480
 comment like and favorites and see you 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.480
 in the next chao
