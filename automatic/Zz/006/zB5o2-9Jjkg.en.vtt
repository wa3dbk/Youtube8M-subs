get all on Android every day anyway I'm

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.009 
get all on Android every day anyway I'm
doing<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.830> front<00:00:08.250> camera<00:00:08.519> test<00:00:08.880> with<00:00:09.330> S<00:00:09.630> 4<00:00:09.990> from

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
doing a front camera test with S 4 from

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.789 
doing a front camera test with S 4 from
the<00:00:10.349> same<00:00:10.679> location<00:00:10.920> I<00:00:11.610> used<00:00:12.389> my<00:00:12.809> AC<00:00:12.990> one<00:00:13.349> just

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
the same location I used my AC one just

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.120 
the same location I used my AC one just
now<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:15.049> you'll<00:00:16.049> see<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.410> difference<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
now and you'll see the difference in the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.779 
now and you'll see the difference in the
wider<00:00:17.369> angle<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.779> HTC<00:00:19.140> One<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.789> yeah

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
wider angle of the HTC One and yeah

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.130 
wider angle of the HTC One and yeah
maybe<00:00:20.939> it's<00:00:21.449> not<00:00:21.600> as<00:00:21.840> as<00:00:22.279> um<00:00:23.279> as<00:00:23.720> wide<00:00:24.720> as<00:00:24.960> I

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
maybe it's not as as um as wide as I

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.950 
maybe it's not as as um as wide as I
thought<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.400> does<00:00:26.640> certainly<00:00:26.910> look<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.660> lot

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
thought but it does certainly look a lot

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.700 
thought but it does certainly look a lot
a<00:00:28.380> lot<00:00:28.830> more<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.699> there<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.179> right<00:00:30.240> there

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
a lot more so there it is right there

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.100 
a lot more so there it is right there
that<00:00:31.710> was<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.189> angle<00:00:32.610> there<00:00:32.910> gaita<00:00:33.780> it's

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
that was the angle there gaita it's

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.900 
that was the angle there gaita it's
actually<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> lot<00:00:34.620> wider<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.550> get<00:00:35.700> about

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
actually a lot wider you get about

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.540 
actually a lot wider you get about
twenty<00:00:36.270> percent<00:00:36.600> wider<00:00:37.020> view<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.129> really

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
twenty percent wider view so I really

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.569 
twenty percent wider view so I really
like<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.910> feature<00:00:39.140> now<00:00:40.140> I've<00:00:40.800> set<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.340> good

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
like that feature now I've set to good

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.450 
use this is popular to use this thin
aluminum<00:01:08.729> pot<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.540> actually<00:01:09.960> called<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
aluminum pot it's actually called the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.219 
aluminum pot it's actually called the
aluminum<00:01:11.460> Korean<00:01:11.880> pot<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.330> they<00:01:12.659> use<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.020> for

aluminum Korean pot and they use it for
cooking<00:01:13.409> noodles<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.369> reason<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:14.909> metal

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
cooking noodles the reason is that metal

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.160 
cooking noodles the reason is that metal
heats<00:01:16.740> are<00:01:16.890> very<00:01:17.130> quick<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.689> also<00:01:18.689> cools<00:01:19.020> down

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
heats are very quick and also cools down

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.289 
heats are very quick and also cools down
very<00:01:19.650> quick<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.310> when<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:20.640> hot<00:01:21.290> you<00:01:22.290> know<00:01:22.409> it

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
very quick but when it's hot you know it

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.420 
very quick but when it's hot you know it
gets<00:01:24.299> very<00:01:24.420> hot<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.259> that's<00:01:25.710> one<00:01:25.950> thing<00:01:26.130> we're

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
gets very hot so that's one thing we're

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.700 
gets very hot so that's one thing we're
versus<00:01:26.850> plastic<00:01:27.659> or<00:01:27.869> actually<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.500> not

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
versus plastic or actually it's not

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.469 
versus plastic or actually it's not
plastic<00:01:28.950> they<00:01:29.640> used<00:01:29.820> car<00:01:30.259> polycarbonate<00:01:31.259> and

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
plastic they used car polycarbonate and

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.749 
plastic they used car polycarbonate and
it<00:01:33.479> doesn't<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.350> know<00:01:34.380> absorb<00:01:35.159> heat<00:01:35.430> as<00:01:35.579> much

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
it doesn't you know absorb heat as much

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.630 
it doesn't you know absorb heat as much
so<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.060> not<00:01:36.270> going<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.540> feel<00:01:36.840> as<00:01:37.140> hot<00:01:37.579> one<00:01:38.579> of

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
so it's not going to feel as hot one of

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.130 
so it's not going to feel as hot one of
the<00:01:38.729> things<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.479> I'm<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:39.750> pointing<00:01:39.930> out

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
the things that I'm just pointing out

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.550 
the things that I'm just pointing out
and<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.220> fact<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.939> know<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.200> know

states<00:01:59.159> maybe<00:01:59.340> Canada<00:01:59.880> definitely<00:02:00.780> HTC<00:02:01.409> one

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
states maybe Canada definitely HTC one

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.740 
states maybe Canada definitely HTC one
might<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:02.130> great<00:02:02.579> way<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.790> go<00:02:03.000> kind<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.509> use

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
might be a great way to go kind of use
