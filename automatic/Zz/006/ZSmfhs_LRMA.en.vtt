things<00:02:33.820> so<00:02:34.090> they<00:02:34.209> start<00:02:34.480> double<00:02:34.810> chroming<00:02:35.230> or

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
things so they start double chroming or

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.759 
things so they start double chroming or
chroming<00:02:35.830> parts<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:37.600> extend<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.170> life<00:02:38.380> and

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
chroming parts to extend the life and

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.360 
chroming parts to extend the life and
now<00:02:38.890> we've<00:02:39.130> got<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.400> machine<00:02:39.580> that<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:42.130> cage

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
now we've got a machine that the cage

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.520 
now we've got a machine that the cage

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
combines is hard to get that

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.869 
combines is hard to get that
because<00:03:16.590> I'm<00:03:16.739> combining<00:03:17.250> out<00:03:17.459> in<00:03:17.579> the<00:03:17.670> fall

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
because I'm combining out in the fall

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.250 
because I'm combining out in the fall
when<00:03:18.060> they<00:03:18.209> last<00:03:18.450> fall<00:03:18.750> I've<00:03:18.989> looked<00:03:19.170> around

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
when they last fall I've looked around

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.110 
when they last fall I've looked around
like<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:19.890> just<00:03:20.040> bought<00:03:20.310> five<00:03:20.489> other<00:03:20.760> cleaners

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
like I just bought five other cleaners

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.729 
like I just bought five other cleaners
in<00:03:21.269> other<00:03:21.390> fields<00:03:21.629> and<00:03:22.049> I<00:03:22.109> thought<00:03:22.260> that's

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
in other fields and I thought that's

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.099 
in other fields and I thought that's
pretty<00:03:22.950> neat<00:03:23.250> see<00:03:23.909> that<00:03:24.060> many<00:03:24.239> have<00:03:24.840> been<00:03:24.930> that

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
pretty neat see that many have been that

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.979 
pretty neat see that many have been that
shorter<00:03:25.469> distance<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:27.030> think<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:27.659> that

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
shorter distance I think that that

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.890 
shorter distance I think that that
speaks<00:03:28.079> not<00:03:28.439> only<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:29.840> machinery<00:03:30.840> and

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
speaks not only of the machinery and

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.250 
speaks not only of the machinery and
equipment<00:03:30.989> also<00:03:31.469> to<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.920> Driscoll's<00:03:33.260> do

- hang in there I think that farming is
still<00:04:21.480> a<00:04:21.660> lifestyle<00:04:22.350> but<00:04:22.740> it's<00:04:22.920> much<00:04:23.790> more

enough that in the past for businessmen

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.340 
enough that in the past for businessmen
but<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:33.030> business<00:04:33.420> environment<00:04:33.630> didn't
