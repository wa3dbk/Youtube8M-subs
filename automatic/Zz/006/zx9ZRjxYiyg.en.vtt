00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
creatures that way they look like they

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.450 
creatures that way they look like they
could<00:02:22.550> be<00:02:22.670> fighting<00:02:23.330> weapons<00:02:23.750> now<00:02:24.650> let<00:02:25.370> me

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
could be fighting weapons now let me

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.280 
could be fighting weapons now let me
show<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:25.730> her<00:02:26.120> tail<00:02:26.390> real<00:02:26.750> quick

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
show you her tail real quick

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.180 
show you her tail real quick
that's<00:02:28.010> her<00:02:28.250> tail<00:02:29.260> okay<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:30.470> know<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:31.010> can't

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
that's her tail okay I know you can't

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.490 
that's her tail okay I know you can't
really<00:02:31.490> see<00:02:31.730> too<00:02:31.910> well<00:02:31.940> but<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:32.960> actually<00:02:33.140> has

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
really see too well but it actually has

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.960 
really see too well but it actually has
a<00:02:33.530> lot<00:02:33.800> of<00:02:33.830> detail<00:02:34.310> on<00:02:34.340> there<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:37.580> her

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
a lot of detail on there so her

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.510 
a lot of detail on there so her
transformation<00:02:38.810> is<00:02:38.990> actually<00:02:39.470> quite<00:02:40.250> nice

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
transformation is actually quite nice

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.760 
transformation is actually quite nice
she<00:02:41.390> has<00:02:41.510> legs<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:41.990> pop<00:02:42.290> out<00:02:42.470> which<00:02:42.680> I

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
she has legs that pop out which I

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:43.540 
she has legs that pop out which I
haven't<00:02:42.950> done

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
haven't done

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.870 
haven't done
I<00:02:43.580> usually<00:02:44.510> don't<00:02:44.900> really<00:02:45.230> like<00:02:46.040> like<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.730> do

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
I usually don't really like like to do

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.170 
I usually don't really like like to do
that<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.300> lot<00:02:47.480> of<00:02:47.600> times<00:02:48.520> in<00:02:49.520> her<00:02:49.700> case<00:02:49.940> you

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
that a lot of times in her case you

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.800 
that a lot of times in her case you
almost<00:02:50.480> don't<00:02:50.600> need<00:02:50.810> them<00:02:50.990> you<00:02:51.230> know<00:02:52.810> another

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
almost don't need them you know another

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.560 
almost don't need them you know another
thing<00:02:54.110> is<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:54.380> really<00:02:54.860> like<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.820> ones<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:56.420> are

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
thing is I really like the ones that are

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.430 
thing is I really like the ones that are
based<00:02:56.840> off<00:02:57.140> of<00:02:57.440> Greek<00:02:58.400> mythology<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.810> a

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
based off of Greek mythology and a

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.720 
based off of Greek mythology and a
harpus<00:03:01.040> is<00:03:01.310> based<00:03:01.670> off<00:03:01.910> from<00:03:02.300> a<00:03:02.510> heart<00:03:02.870> beat<00:03:03.050> so

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
harpus is based off from a heart beat so

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.450 
harpus is based off from a heart beat so
that's<00:03:04.730> just<00:03:05.000> a<00:03:05.210> one<00:03:05.810> more<00:03:06.050> cool<00:03:06.380> feature<00:03:06.680> for

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
that's just a one more cool feature for

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.930 
that's just a one more cool feature for
me<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:08.560> another<00:03:09.560> reason<00:03:09.860> why<00:03:10.130> she's<00:03:10.430> so<00:03:10.610> cool

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
me and another reason why she's so cool

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.050 
me and another reason why she's so cool
is<00:03:11.300> because<00:03:11.660> she's<00:03:11.990> one<00:03:12.230> of<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.530> few<00:03:13.060> Bakugan

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
is because she's one of the few Bakugan

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.550 
is because she's one of the few Bakugan
that<00:03:14.780> can<00:03:14.960> fuse<00:03:15.730> right<00:03:17.020> what<00:03:18.020> I<00:03:18.050> mean<00:03:18.320> by<00:03:18.530> that

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
that can fuse right what I mean by that

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.780 
that can fuse right what I mean by that
is<00:03:18.980> if<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.220> have<00:03:19.580> two<00:03:19.910> of<00:03:20.270> these<00:03:21.170> two<00:03:21.800> harpus

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
is if you have two of these two harpus

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.120 
is if you have two of these two harpus
okay

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
okay

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.030 
okay
even<00:03:25.130> her<00:03:25.250> marble<00:03:25.730> form<00:03:26.620> you<00:03:27.620> can<00:03:27.800> combine

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
even her marble form you can combine

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.130 
even her marble form you can combine
them<00:03:28.370> together<00:03:28.550> and<00:03:29.270> you<00:03:29.510> have<00:03:29.690> like<00:03:29.960> these

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
them together and you have like these

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.470 
them together and you have like these
two<00:03:30.440> marbles<00:03:31.070> that<00:03:31.160> are<00:03:31.340> stuck<00:03:31.580> together<00:03:31.790> and

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
two marbles that are stuck together and

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.250 
two marbles that are stuck together and
that's<00:03:32.690> kind<00:03:32.930> of<00:03:32.990> cool

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
that's kind of cool

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.350 
that's kind of cool
you<00:03:33.950> know<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:34.130> can<00:03:34.310> roll<00:03:34.520> them<00:03:34.670> that<00:03:34.820> way<00:03:35.000> and

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
you know you can roll them that way and

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.030 
you know you can roll them that way and
it's<00:03:35.750> fun

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
it's fun

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.990 
it's fun
I<00:03:37.090> think<00:03:38.090> that's<00:03:38.240> mega<00:03:38.600> cool<00:03:38.900> actually<00:03:39.610> so<00:03:40.610> I

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
I think that's mega cool actually so I

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.820 
I think that's mega cool actually so I
can't<00:03:41.450> show<00:03:41.510> you<00:03:41.720> right<00:03:41.960> now<00:03:42.020> because<00:03:42.410> I<00:03:42.770> don't

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
can't show you right now because I don't

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.910 
can't show you right now because I don't
have<00:03:43.250> another<00:03:43.610> harpist<00:03:44.150> with<00:03:44.330> me<00:03:44.510> but<00:03:45.350> I<00:03:45.680> have

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
have another harpist with me but I have

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.280 
have another harpist with me but I have
done<00:03:46.160> it<00:03:46.340> firsthand<00:03:46.850> so<00:03:47.630> I'm<00:03:47.750> not<00:03:47.900> just<00:03:47.959> making

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
done it firsthand so I'm not just making

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.130 
done it firsthand so I'm not just making
this<00:03:48.530> up<00:03:49.330> it<00:03:50.330> does<00:03:50.780> really<00:03:51.080> work<00:03:51.350> so<00:03:52.660> just<00:03:53.660> for

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
this up it does really work so just for

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.530 
this up it does really work so just for
those<00:03:54.290> reasons<00:03:54.560> that<00:03:55.070> I've<00:03:55.880> mentioned<00:03:56.090> so<00:03:56.510> far

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
those reasons that I've mentioned so far

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.959 
those reasons that I've mentioned so far
I<00:03:57.440> think<00:03:57.830> harpist<00:03:58.520> is<00:03:58.610> a<00:03:58.670> really<00:03:59.180> great<00:03:59.690> catch
