00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.960
 today decided to make a review about my 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.170
 motorcycle 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:19.470
 ruffs for those who are just going 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.990
 buy here or someone has difficulty 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.680
 choosing yes yes between this model and 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.920
 by others 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.539
 Well , firstly, I want to say that a person 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.009
 should decide for himself what he is 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.300
 buys this device if 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.749
 man needs to dangle circle for 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.899
 movement in the city there for working with 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:42.449
 work home amendments pending to promise 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:47.280
 then this is not his landing option 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:51.299
 so very low so let's say everything will be 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.649
 hurt back hands swell here that is not 

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:58.440
 suitable their motorcycles for this type 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.280
 pokatushek. those motorcycle still created 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.890
 more for a track to shoot into a folder in 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.880
 home town 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:12.570
 so when you think what to take 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.580
 in general, that is, sport is sport 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.160
 This note if you still 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.810
 you take a bike you want a sport 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:24.420
 have a ride so let's say or force 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.760
 in prostration, there is already a choice then 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.640
 Is this model or competitors allowed ? 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.920
 there, too, honda assume for yourself 600rr 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.240
 which is the most so let's say the main 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.880
 competitor 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.850
 one difference here immediately apparent appearance 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.780
 it seems clear to me the bird seems to me 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.670
 there is no prettier moto ie externally he 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.630
 just like a bomb here 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.289
 And on driving on its own with honda naturally 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:55.399
 could more say serbian sharp very 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:58.770
 tough in everything that is on the suspension 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.960
 switch control ie 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.549
 so say that there is a motorcycle for 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:09.090
 fund track in this plan more pleasant 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:12.500
 people for the driver that's why look 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:17.330
 room but also how would drive such a fund 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:20.900
 here carrier will not give when you are here it is 6 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.489
 the act of plus or minus mucho principle 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.410
 plus here is one continuous plus with 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.980
 motorcycle is taken for a drive i.e. 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:32.819
 drive at night on empty roads 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.370
 everything is great minus one for 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.489
 me at least that i found it 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:43.829
 how would it be for everyone for anyone who has 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:45.320
 height below 70 meter even below 75 meter 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.359
 Me height 75 meter 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.740
 you are the main problem on this model 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.800
 honda will be lowered 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.810
 They say that you can see the height 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.290
 my feet i barely get it 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.630
 serious minus if you go with a passenger 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.670
 that is, between the rows for somewhere there all with 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.850
 border that is it all fluctuates 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.490
 unstable you can fall here is my how 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.940
 would be used that is, I knew about it when 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:20.970
 buying a new program for me is such 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:24.390
 a serious minus as it were, in principle, everything 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.390
 slender apparatuses 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:31.150
 if as they say there are means and 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.069
 desire to buy will not regret very 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.040
 good good stuff 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.590
