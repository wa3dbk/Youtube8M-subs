00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
notebook and I actually have a notebook

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.090 
notebook and I actually have a notebook
that<00:03:09.739> is<00:03:10.959> maybe<00:03:11.959> double<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.560> size<00:03:12.709> give<00:03:13.040> me

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
that is maybe double the size give me

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.039 
that is maybe double the size give me
not<00:03:13.220> quite<00:03:13.370> double<00:03:13.579> but<00:03:14.209> it<00:03:14.480> was<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.870> same

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
not quite double but it was the same

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.440 
not quite double but it was the same
design<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:15.829> this<00:03:15.920> is<00:03:16.040> me<00:03:16.160> die<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:16.549> and<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:17.269> has

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
design and this is me die so and it has

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.390 
design and this is me die so and it has
a<00:03:17.480> lot<00:03:17.810> of<00:03:17.840> pages<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:18.530> like<00:03:18.709> fat<00:03:18.920> notebooks

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
so I'm actually happier with the smaller

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.229 
so I'm actually happier with the smaller
size<00:03:22.760> because<00:03:23.269> it<00:03:24.110> fits<00:03:24.290> in<00:03:24.410> my<00:03:24.590> purse<00:03:24.769> better

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239

pieces<00:05:19.349> and<00:05:19.650> again<00:05:20.070> it's<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.910> see-through

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
pieces and again it's the see-through

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.570 
pieces and again it's the see-through
stickers<00:05:21.780> and<00:05:21.990> then<00:05:22.080> the<00:05:22.370> glittery<00:05:23.370> ones

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
stickers and then the glittery ones

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.360 
stickers and then the glittery ones
where<00:05:23.910> you<00:05:23.940> go<00:05:24.270> and<00:05:24.930> then<00:05:25.139> this<00:05:25.260> one<00:05:25.320> is<00:05:25.680> a<00:05:25.800> bear

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
where you go and then this one is a bear

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.430 
where you go and then this one is a bear
theme<00:05:26.639> I<00:05:26.820> think<00:05:27.060> Rock<00:05:27.240> Ernest<00:05:27.570> surely<00:05:28.080> like

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
theme I think Rock Ernest surely like

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.600 
theme I think Rock Ernest surely like
these<00:05:28.650> but<00:05:29.340> um<00:05:29.669> I<00:05:30.650> got<00:05:31.650> these<00:05:31.919> because<00:05:32.400> they

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
these but um I got these because they

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.510 
these but um I got these because they
were<00:05:32.669> bears<00:05:33.000> actually<00:05:33.240> reminded<00:05:33.930> me<00:05:34.020> of<00:05:34.050> her

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
were bears actually reminded me of her

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.760 
were bears actually reminded me of her
so<00:05:35.520> yeah<00:05:36.330> again<00:05:36.840> these<00:05:37.020> are<00:05:37.080> the<00:05:37.380> see-through

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
so yeah again these are the see-through

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.469 
so yeah again these are the see-through
stickers<00:05:38.130> and<00:05:38.310> then<00:05:38.430> the<00:05:38.610> glittery<00:05:39.150> stickers

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
stickers and then the glittery stickers

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.300 
stickers and then the glittery stickers
and<00:05:39.810> I<00:05:40.650> guess<00:05:40.800> that's<00:05:40.950> why<00:05:41.039> they're<00:05:41.190> more

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
and I guess that's why they're more

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.640 
and I guess that's why they're more
expensive<00:05:41.550> but<00:05:42.180> yeah<00:05:42.599> they<00:05:42.780> had<00:05:42.960> other<00:05:43.320> themes

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
expensive but yeah they had other themes

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.890 
expensive but yeah they had other themes

too and I really really wanted them but

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.339 
too and I really really wanted them but
