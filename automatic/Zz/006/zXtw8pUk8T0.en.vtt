00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
to make one drive and the speed is just

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.810 
to make one drive and the speed is just
a<00:00:24.810> mint<00:00:25.050> okay<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.650> then<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.890> have<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.609> rape

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
one which is a mirror of two drives so

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.470 
one which is a mirror of two drives so
that<00:00:29.400> way<00:00:29.490> whatever<00:00:29.670> goes<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.210> drive

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
that way whatever goes on this drive

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.410 
that way whatever goes on this drive
goes<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.140> drive<00:00:31.349> as<00:00:31.500> well<00:00:31.580> so<00:00:32.580> if<00:00:33.030> you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.480 
goes on this drive as well so if you
have<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> raid<00:00:33.750> 10<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.410> have<00:00:34.590> these<00:00:34.830> two<00:00:35.130> drives

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.560 
set as one drive and whatever goes on
these<00:00:37.530> two<00:00:37.770> go<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.130> these<00:00:38.430> two<00:00:38.640> as<00:00:38.760> well<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.510> you

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
these two go on these two as well so you

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.410 
these two go on these two as well so you
have<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.840> speed<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.470> the<00:00:40.530> backup<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.790> red<00:00:42.180> one

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.190 
have the speed and the backup of red one
and<00:00:42.690> raid<00:00:43.200> 0<00:00:43.560> so<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.880> also<00:00:45.150> in<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:45.660> draw<00:00:45.930> of

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
and raid 0 so and also in this draw of

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.510 
and raid 0 so and also in this draw of
this<00:00:46.530> custom<00:00:47.460> built<00:00:47.640> here<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.540> have<00:00:48.810> a<00:00:49.520> nice

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
this custom built here we have a nice

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.910 
this custom built here we have a nice
water-cooled<00:00:51.330> system<00:00:52.130> it<00:00:53.130> is<00:00:53.190> actually<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
water-cooled system it is actually a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.440 
water-cooled system it is actually a
self-contained<00:00:55.920> water<00:00:56.820> cooling<00:00:57.120> system

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
self-contained water cooling system

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.540
