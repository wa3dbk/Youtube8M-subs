of<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.899> transformation<00:02:07.380> his<00:02:07.860> legs<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.429> been

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
of the transformation his legs have been

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.690 
of the transformation his legs have been
given<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.660> lot<00:02:10.170> more<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.770> Clayton<00:02:11.009> now<00:02:11.280> he's<00:02:11.489> got

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
given a lot more to Clayton now he's got

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.300 
given a lot more to Clayton now he's got
needs

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
needs

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.490 
needs
and<00:02:12.490> he's<00:02:12.850> got<00:02:13.060> ankles<00:02:13.510> because<00:02:13.990> that's<00:02:14.290> all

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
and he's got ankles because that's all

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.010 
and he's got ankles because that's all
because<00:02:14.710> of<00:02:14.890> transformation<00:02:15.810> he's<00:02:16.810> got<00:02:16.990> a

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
because of transformation he's got a

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.230 
because of transformation he's got a
beautiful<00:02:17.410> alt<00:02:17.980> mode<00:02:18.550> which<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:18.910> will<00:02:19.060> show

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
beautiful alt mode which I will show

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.100 
beautiful alt mode which I will show
later<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:20.070> shoulders<00:02:21.070> are<00:02:21.220> still<00:02:21.490> on<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:22.120> ball

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
later the shoulders are still on a ball

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.410 
later the shoulders are still on a ball
joints<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:24.130> hinge<00:02:24.400> joint<00:02:24.760> goes<00:02:25.090> in<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:25.360> out

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
joints and a hinge joint goes in and out

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.420 
joints and a hinge joint goes in and out
because<00:02:25.720> of<00:02:25.870> transformation<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.980> hips<00:02:27.220> are

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
because of transformation the hips are

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.690 
because of transformation the hips are
still<00:02:27.610> in<00:02:27.730> ball<00:02:27.940> joints<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.600> that's<00:02:29.050> about<00:02:29.320> it

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
still in ball joints and that's about it

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.580 
still in ball joints and that's about it
really<00:02:30.700> nothing<00:02:31.180> much<00:02:31.300> to<00:02:31.360> say<00:02:31.720> except<00:02:32.560> for

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
really nothing much to say except for

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.870 
really nothing much to say except for
the<00:02:32.800> new<00:02:33.130> our<00:02:33.430> articulation<00:02:33.790> on<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.580> legs

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
the new our articulation on the the legs

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.270 
the new our articulation on the the legs
so<00:02:38.370> focus<00:02:39.370> on<00:02:39.490> that<00:02:39.640> again<00:02:40.500> here<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.709> size

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
so focus on that again here is a size

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.240 
so focus on that again here is a size
comparison<00:02:42.520> can<00:02:43.300> you<00:02:43.540> believe<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.380> even

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
comparison can you believe it the even

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.490 
comparison can you believe it the even
in<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.520> légion<00:02:45.940> class<00:02:46.209> Legends<00:02:47.110> class<00:02:47.290> they

in the légion class Legends class they

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.979 
in the légion class Legends class they
have<00:02:47.709> shrunk<00:02:48.130> their<00:02:48.310> figures<00:02:48.750> Hasbro<00:02:49.750> is

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
have shrunk their figures Hasbro is

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.220 
have shrunk their figures Hasbro is
really<00:02:50.950> really<00:02:51.190> cutting<00:02:51.580> costs<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.360> giving<00:02:53.110> a

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
really really cutting costs and giving a

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.890 
really really cutting costs and giving a
smaller<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:54.010> smaller<00:02:54.580> figures<00:02:55.270> as<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:56.590> as

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
smaller and smaller figures as the as

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.180 
smaller and smaller figures as the as
paramount<00:02:58.900> comes<00:02:59.200> up<00:02:59.380> with<00:02:59.530> more<00:02:59.739> movies<00:03:00.070> I

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
paramount comes up with more movies I

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.270 
paramount comes up with more movies I
suppose<00:03:00.520> in<00:03:00.730> now<00:03:00.880> when<00:03:01.630> if<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:02.709> when

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
suppose in now when if and when

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.270 
suppose in now when if and when
transformers<00:03:04.120> 4<00:03:04.420> does<00:03:05.260> happen<00:03:05.800> we'll

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
transformers 4 does happen we'll

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.920 
transformers 4 does happen we'll
probably<00:03:06.489> have<00:03:06.790> Eligius<00:03:07.209> classified<00:03:07.570> it's<00:03:07.810> a

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
probably have Eligius classified it's a

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.780 
probably have Eligius classified it's a
lot<00:03:08.260> more<00:03:08.620> smaller<00:03:09.040> than<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.430> which<00:03:09.610> is

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
lot more smaller than that which is

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.760 
lot more smaller than that which is
really<00:03:10.180> just<00:03:10.209> a<00:03:10.480> shame<00:03:10.720> because<00:03:11.530> the

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
really just a shame because the

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.280 
really just a shame because the
engineering<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.580> design<00:03:13.420> of<00:03:13.450> these<00:03:13.720> guys<00:03:14.020> are

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
engineering and design of these guys are

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.699 
engineering and design of these guys are
really<00:03:14.470> nice<00:03:14.709> for<00:03:14.770> small<00:03:15.670> figures<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:17.470> anyway

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
really nice for small figures so anyway

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.600 
really nice for small figures so anyway
that's<00:03:17.860> that<00:03:18.040> transform<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:18.910> very<00:03:19.180> easy<00:03:20.610> maybe

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
that's that transform it very easy maybe

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.220 
that's that transform it very easy maybe
I<00:03:21.670> should<00:03:21.820> have<00:03:21.940> done<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.299> yeah<00:03:22.480> I<00:03:22.570> fine

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
I should have done that yeah I fine

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.860 
I should have done that yeah I fine

let<00:04:20.660> me<00:04:20.840> see<00:04:21.670> transform<00:04:22.670> this<00:04:22.790> guy<00:04:23.980> and<00:04:24.980> I

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
let me see transform this guy and I

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.010 
let me see transform this guy and I
really<00:04:25.820> like<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.240> fact<00:04:26.420> that<00:04:26.510> it<00:04:26.630> did<00:04:26.780> away

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
really like the fact that it did away

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.170 
really like the fact that it did away
with<00:04:27.050> that<00:04:27.250> transformation<00:04:28.250> this<00:04:28.760> is<00:04:28.820> from

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
with that transformation this is from

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.080 
with that transformation this is from
The<00:04:29.300> Revenge<00:04:29.540> of<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.840> Fallen<00:04:30.080> obviously<00:04:34.090> as

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
The Revenge of the Fallen obviously as

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.590 
The Revenge of the Fallen obviously as
you<00:04:35.330> can<00:04:35.450> see<00:04:36.460> I'm<00:04:37.460> not<00:04:37.850> sure<00:04:38.120> which<00:04:38.360> one's

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
you can see I'm not sure which one's

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.330 
you can see I'm not sure which one's
more<00:04:38.750> accurate<00:04:39.200> I<00:04:39.380> think<00:04:39.710> this<00:04:39.860> one<00:04:40.040> is<00:04:40.070> more

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
more accurate I think this one is more

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.820 
more accurate I think this one is more
movie<00:04:40.760> accurate<00:04:41.140> but<00:04:42.140> I'm<00:04:42.230> really<00:04:42.620> really

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
movie accurate but I'm really really

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.860 
movie accurate but I'm really really
liking<00:04:43.520> this<00:04:43.670> sleek<00:04:44.030> design<00:04:44.390> it's<00:04:44.570> a<00:04:44.660> lot

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
liking this sleek design it's a lot

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.640 
liking this sleek design it's a lot
smaller<00:04:45.320> a<00:04:45.970> length<00:04:46.970> wise<00:04:47.330> there<00:04:47.750> is<00:04:48.230> it's

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
smaller a length wise there is it's

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.890 
smaller a length wise there is it's
smaller<00:04:48.980> I<00:04:49.280> mean<00:04:49.490> really<00:04:49.730> has<00:04:50.030> rows<00:04:50.360> crimped

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
smaller I mean really has rows crimped

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.950 
smaller I mean really has rows crimped
on<00:04:51.110> these<00:04:51.740> figures<00:04:51.980> the<00:04:52.820> width<00:04:53.330> is<00:04:53.510> obviously

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
on these figures the width is obviously

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.070 
on these figures the width is obviously
a<00:04:54.110> lot<00:04:54.380> thinner<00:04:54.620> but<00:04:54.890> I<00:04:54.920> like<00:04:55.490> this<00:04:55.700> one<00:04:55.940> I<00:04:56.180> like

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
a lot thinner but I like this one I like

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.080 
a lot thinner but I like this one I like
it<00:04:57.230> a<00:04:57.260> lot<00:04:57.380> better<00:04:57.560> than<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:58.010> old<00:04:58.160> version<00:04:58.280> for

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
it a lot better than the old version for

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.060 
it a lot better than the old version for
some<00:04:59.300> reason<00:04:59.720> written<00:05:00.410> regardless<00:05:00.860> of<00:05:00.980> the

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
some reason written regardless of the

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.350 
some reason written regardless of the
paint<00:05:01.310> apps<00:05:01.520> I'm<00:05:01.700> not<00:05:01.850> talking<00:05:02.090> about<00:05:02.120> a<00:05:02.240> pen

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
paint apps I'm not talking about a pen

paint apps I'm not talking about a pen
I'm<00:05:02.450> talking<00:05:02.690> about<00:05:02.720> the<00:05:02.930> design<00:05:03.290> I'm

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950
