far up the bar your weights gonna kind
of<00:03:29.000> come<00:03:29.150> forward<00:03:29.510> which<00:03:29.599> will<00:03:29.780> make<00:03:29.900> you<00:03:30.019> a

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
of come forward which will make you a

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.569 
of come forward which will make you a
lot<00:03:30.230> weaker<00:03:30.440> on<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.709> lift<00:03:30.919> and<00:03:31.130> that<00:03:31.459> will

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
lot weaker on the lift and that will

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.580 
lot weaker on the lift and that will
affect<00:03:31.639> your<00:03:31.940> lockout<00:03:32.329> as<00:03:32.419> well<00:03:32.630> it'll<00:03:33.470> make

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
affect your lockout as well it'll make

affect your lockout as well it'll make
you<00:03:33.739> weaker<00:03:34.010> on<00:03:34.099> the<00:03:34.160> lock<00:03:34.340> up<00:03:34.690> so<00:03:35.690> that's

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
you weaker on the lock up so that's

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.990 
you weaker on the lock up so that's
basically<00:03:36.349> what<00:03:36.530> I<00:03:36.590> do<00:03:36.650> for<00:03:36.889> the<00:03:36.980> deadlift<00:03:37.280> now

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000

outside and then I'm gonna have the man

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.170 
outside and then I'm gonna have the man
called<00:04:10.390> like<00:04:10.629> this<00:04:14.310> go<00:04:15.310> on<00:04:15.340> traditional<00:04:16.000> good

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
called like this go on traditional good

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.939 
called like this go on traditional good
hammer<00:04:16.389> is<00:04:16.630> that<00:04:16.870> becomes<00:04:17.199> quite<00:04:17.470> easy<00:04:17.500> over

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
hammer is that becomes quite easy over

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.509 
hammer is that becomes quite easy over
time<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:18.489> this<00:04:19.479> is<00:04:19.660> a<00:04:19.690> way<00:04:19.900> that<00:04:20.199> I<00:04:20.380> do<00:04:20.500> I<00:04:20.919> make

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
time and this is a way that I do I make

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.860 
time and this is a way that I do I make
it<00:04:21.549> more<00:04:21.760> difficult<00:04:21.970> I<00:04:24.210> got<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:25.240> set<00:04:25.479> too<00:04:25.630> far

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
it more difficult I got a set too far

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.680 
it more difficult I got a set too far
back<00:04:26.110> here<00:04:26.550> so<00:04:27.550> I'm<00:04:27.610> gonna<00:04:27.729> pull<00:04:27.970> this<00:04:28.120> forward

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.890 

I'm<00:04:31.690> not<00:04:31.960> sure<00:04:32.200> so<00:04:32.470> it'll<00:04:32.770> be<00:04:32.889> better<00:04:33.660> but<00:04:34.660> one

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
I'm not sure so it'll be better but one

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.340 
I'm not sure so it'll be better but one
way<00:04:35.080> you<00:04:35.139> can<00:04:35.380> make<00:04:35.560> it<00:04:35.740> more<00:04:36.400> difficult<00:04:36.460> is

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
way you can make it more difficult is

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.620 
way you can make it more difficult is
you<00:04:38.350> can<00:04:38.650> pause<00:04:38.889> about<00:04:39.130> halfway<00:04:39.460> up<00:04:39.700> and<00:04:40.030> then

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
you can pause about halfway up and then

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.050 
you can pause about halfway up and then
finish<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:41.080> rep<00:04:41.400> or<00:04:42.400> you<00:04:42.580> can<00:04:42.729> hold<00:04:42.910> like<00:04:43.000> a

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
finish the rep or you can hold like a

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.930 
finish the rep or you can hold like a
45-pound<00:04:43.810> plate<00:04:44.340> another<00:04:45.340> thing<00:04:45.550> you<00:04:45.639> can<00:04:45.760> do

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
45-pound plate another thing you can do

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.320 
45-pound plate another thing you can do
you<00:04:46.900> take<00:04:47.080> this<00:04:47.229> bag<00:04:47.530> and<00:04:48.000> put<00:04:49.000> around<00:04:49.150> your

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
you take this bag and put around your

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.250 
you take this bag and put around your
neck<00:04:49.389> like<00:04:49.720> this<00:04:50.100> can<00:04:51.100> you<00:04:51.130> try<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.400> swallow<00:04:52.300> as

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
neck like this can you try to swallow as

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.290 
neck like this can you try to swallow as
fast<00:04:53.530> as<00:04:53.710> possible<00:04:54.160> so<00:04:56.910> those<00:04:57.910> are<00:04:58.060> kind<00:04:58.240> of

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
fast as possible so those are kind of

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.560 
fast as possible so those are kind of
the<00:04:58.360> variations<00:04:58.990> I<00:04:59.110> like<00:04:59.289> to<00:04:59.410> use<00:04:59.590> on<00:04:59.860> that

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
the variations I like to use on that

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.450 
the variations I like to use on that
great<00:05:01.570> lockout<00:05:01.960> exercise<00:05:02.470> and<00:05:03.039> I've<00:05:03.160> got<00:05:03.310> one

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
great lockout exercise and I've got one

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:10.320 
great lockout exercise and I've got one
more<00:05:03.639> over<00:05:03.820> here

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.029 

this<00:05:11.330> is<00:05:11.509> what<00:05:11.659> we<00:05:11.750> call<00:05:12.020> the<00:05:12.259> 45<00:05:12.770> degree

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
this is what we call the 45 degree

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.909 
this is what we call the 45 degree
hyperextension<00:05:13.879> and<00:05:14.650> traditionally<00:05:15.650> I<00:05:15.680> see<00:05:15.889> a

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
hyperextension and traditionally I see a

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.409 
hyperextension and traditionally I see a
lot<00:05:16.039> of<00:05:16.069> people<00:05:16.370> do<00:05:16.490> this<00:05:16.610> in<00:05:16.759> the<00:05:16.849> gym<00:05:17.060> holding

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
lot of people do this in the gym holding

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.450 
lot of people do this in the gym holding
a<00:05:17.479> plate<00:05:17.750> but<00:05:18.500> that<00:05:18.650> becomes<00:05:18.889> way<00:05:19.099> too<00:05:19.129> easy

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
a plate but that becomes way too easy

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.010 
a plate but that becomes way too easy
that's<00:05:19.909> not<00:05:20.180> really<00:05:20.449> going<00:05:20.539> to<00:05:20.629> help<00:05:20.719> your<00:05:20.900> dad

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
that's not really going to help your dad
