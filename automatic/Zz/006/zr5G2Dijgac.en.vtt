involve with competition with obviously

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.740 
involve with competition with obviously
competitor<00:00:39.440> tires<00:00:40.090> what<00:00:41.090> better<00:00:41.270> way<00:00:41.450> to<00:00:41.480> come

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
competitor tires what better way to come

competitor tires what better way to come
in<00:00:41.900> with<00:00:42.050> this<00:00:42.170> asymmetric<00:00:42.860> what<00:00:43.490> they've

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
in with this asymmetric what they've

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.330 
in with this asymmetric what they've
done<00:00:43.850> obviously<00:00:44.450> is<00:00:45.050> done<00:00:45.470> three<00:00:45.710> compounds

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
done obviously is done three compounds

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.880 
done obviously is done three compounds
and<00:00:46.610> you<00:00:47.360> know<00:00:47.600> a<00:00:47.630> harder<00:00:48.110> compound<00:00:48.290> obviously

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
and you know a harder compound obviously

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.250 
and you know a harder compound obviously
down<00:00:49.040> the<00:00:49.160> center<00:00:49.400> of<00:00:49.520> the<00:00:49.580> tire<00:00:49.790> Ross<00:00:50.060> and<00:00:50.840> on

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
down the center of the tire Ross and on

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.200 
down the center of the tire Ross and on
the<00:00:51.440> left<00:00:51.620> side<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:52.070> or<00:00:52.520> right<00:00:52.940> side

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
the left side and or right side

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.870 
the left side and or right side
different<00:00:54.170> compounds<00:00:54.650> left<00:00:55.340> side<00:00:55.550> would<00:00:55.700> be

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
different compounds left side would be

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.730 
different compounds left side would be
depending<00:00:56.630> on<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:56.810> racetrack<00:00:56.960> it<00:00:57.410> would<00:00:57.560> be<00:00:57.710> a

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:57.740 
depending on the racetrack it would be a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.410 
depending on the racetrack it would be a
softer<00:00:58.100> compound<00:00:58.250> right<00:00:58.790> side<00:00:59.030> a<00:00:59.060> little<00:00:59.240> bit

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
softer compound right side a little bit

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.480 
softer compound right side a little bit
harder<00:00:59.750> but<00:01:00.290> what's<00:01:00.710> great<00:01:00.920> about<00:01:00.950> this<00:01:01.280> tire

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.490 
harder but what's great about this tire

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.470 
harder but what's great about this tire
being<00:01:01.730> asymmetric

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
being asymmetric

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.259 
being asymmetric
if<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:03.170> racetrack<00:01:03.620> seems<00:01:04.189> to<00:01:04.309> be<00:01:04.430> running

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
if the racetrack seems to be running

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.749 
if the racetrack seems to be running
more<00:01:05.600> particularly<00:01:06.229> right<00:01:06.920> hand<00:01:07.159> corners<00:01:07.580> or

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
more particularly right hand corners or

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.370 
more particularly right hand corners or
left-hand<00:01:08.180> corner<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:08.509> you<00:01:08.570> can<00:01:08.630> easily<00:01:08.960> turn

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
left-hand corner so you can easily turn

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.190 
left-hand corner so you can easily turn
this<00:01:09.560> tire<00:01:09.799> around<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:11.030> obviously<00:01:11.900> go<00:01:12.049> the

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
this tire around and obviously go the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.489 
this tire around and obviously go the
opposite<00:01:13.100> way<00:01:13.159> with<00:01:13.520> it<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:14.259> for<00:01:15.259> me<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:15.469> have

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:15.499 
opposite way with it and for me to have

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:17.590 
opposite way with it and for me to have
that<00:01:15.770> option<00:01:15.979> on<00:01:16.369> a<00:01:16.729> racetrack<00:01:17.030> it's<00:01:17.420> just

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
that option on a racetrack it's just

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.330 
that option on a racetrack it's just
just<00:01:18.229> incredible<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:18.890> have<00:01:19.009> that<00:01:19.189> on<00:01:19.310> the

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
just incredible to have that on the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.719 
just incredible to have that on the
fingertips<00:01:19.909> we've<00:01:20.149> always<00:01:20.659> talked<00:01:21.109> about
