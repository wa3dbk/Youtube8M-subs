first line of the summary which says

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.870

calling<00:00:24.000> them<00:00:24.150> blasphemies<00:00:24.810> against<00:00:25.260> nature

I<00:00:25.859> kind<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.130> glanced<00:00:26.640> over<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.910> rest<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
I kind of glanced over the rest of the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.939 
I kind of glanced over the rest of the
summary<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.779> assume<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.500> horses

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
summary so I assume that the horses

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.830 
summary so I assume that the horses
would<00:00:29.070> play<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> major<00:00:29.580> part<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:30.240> all<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.570> this

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
would play a major part in all of this

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.380 
would play a major part in all of this
and<00:00:31.140> they<00:00:31.470> don't<00:00:31.769> really<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.820> book<00:00:33.059> is

what I really like about the author's
way<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.500> writing<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.219> stuff<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.850> never

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
way of writing is that stuff is never

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.139 
way of writing is that stuff is never
really<00:02:06.450> described<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.829> detail<00:02:08.670> he<00:02:09.000> does

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
really described in detail he does

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.870 
really described in detail he does
describe<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.750> scenery<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.319> detail

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
describe the scenery in detail

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
but sometimes you'll suddenly be

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.530 
but sometimes you'll suddenly be
surprised<00:02:13.040> because<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.730> author<00:02:13.910> kind<00:02:14.390> of

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
surprised because the author kind of

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.960 
surprised because the author kind of
didn't<00:02:15.050> mention<00:02:15.680> something<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.790> kind

didn't mention something that you kind

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.520 
didn't mention something that you kind
of<00:02:17.030> feel<00:02:17.390> like<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.750> were<00:02:17.840> supposed<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.350> know

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
of feel like you were supposed to know

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
it kind of keeps it interesting for

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.760 
it kind of keeps it interesting for
example<00:02:20.540> when<00:02:20.660> I<00:02:20.720> found<00:02:20.960> out<00:02:21.020> that<00:02:21.200> David<00:02:21.560> had

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
example when I found out that David had

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.310 
example when I found out that David had
a<00:02:21.950> special<00:02:22.400> deviation<00:02:23.300> I<00:02:23.480> was<00:02:23.900> kind<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.140> caught

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
a special deviation I was kind of caught

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.260 
a special deviation I was kind of caught
off<00:02:24.500> guard<00:02:24.530> because<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.250> wasn't<00:02:25.640> slowly

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
off guard because it wasn't slowly

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.360 
off guard because it wasn't slowly
introduced<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:27.020> was<00:02:27.110> just<00:02:27.350> mentioned<00:02:28.190> because

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
introduced it was just mentioned because

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.190 
introduced it was just mentioned because
you<00:02:28.580> kind<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.790> dropped<00:02:29.150> into<00:02:29.630> his<00:02:29.810> life<00:02:29.990> at

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200

you kind of dropped into his life at
some<00:02:30.380> point<00:02:30.650> another<00:02:31.130> thing<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.460> I<00:02:31.490> really

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
some point another thing that I really

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.850 
some point another thing that I really
like<00:02:31.970> about<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.690> writing<00:02:33.080> is<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.260> sometimes

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
like about the writing is that sometimes

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.560 
like about the writing is that sometimes
very<00:02:34.100> shocking<00:02:34.520> events<00:02:34.970> will<00:02:35.090> happen<00:02:35.240> but

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
very shocking events will happen but

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.420 
very shocking events will happen but
they<00:02:35.720> won't<00:02:35.990> be<00:02:36.200> described<00:02:36.800> as<00:02:37.160> something

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
they won't be described as something

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.520 
they won't be described as something
shocking<00:02:37.850> you<00:02:38.270> read<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:38.900> then<00:02:39.200> you<00:02:39.260> have

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
shocking you read it and then you have

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.230 
shocking you read it and then you have
to<00:02:39.620> go<00:02:39.740> back<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.280> check<00:02:40.490> if<00:02:40.640> that's<00:02:40.880> really

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
to go back and check if that's really

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.980 
to go back and check if that's really
what<00:02:41.450> happened

thought<00:02:43.880> his<00:02:44.030> younger<00:02:44.360> sister<00:02:44.870> who<00:02:45.260> also<00:02:45.560> as<00:02:45.650> a

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
thought his younger sister who also as a

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.950 
thought his younger sister who also as a
deviation<00:02:46.310> was<00:02:46.640> way<00:02:47.120> more<00:02:47.330> interesting

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
deviation was way more interesting

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.150 
deviation was way more interesting
towards<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.470> end<00:02:48.560> of<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.710> book<00:02:48.830> there<00:02:48.860> was<00:02:49.070> a

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
lot of action I wasn't so much

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.780 
lot of action I wasn't so much
interested<00:02:51.260> in<00:02:51.380> that<00:02:51.650> as<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.340> dynamics

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
interested in that as the dynamics

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.850 
interested in that as the dynamics
between<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.150> characters<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:54.380> kind<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:54.650> that

hints so we're in the middle of reading

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.220 
hints so we're in the middle of reading
this<00:03:07.520> I<00:03:07.730> kind<00:03:08.000> of<00:03:08.060> stopped<00:03:08.450> reading<00:03:08.750> for<00:03:09.170> a

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
this I kind of stopped reading for a

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.600 
this I kind of stopped reading for a
week<00:03:09.500> or<00:03:09.680> two<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:09.890> I<00:03:09.980> wish<00:03:10.190> I<00:03:10.310> hadn't<00:03:10.550> done

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
week or two and I wish I hadn't done

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.680 
week or two and I wish I hadn't done
that<00:03:10.940> because<00:03:11.060> I<00:03:11.210> think<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.480> would<00:03:11.600> have

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
that because I think I would have

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.780 
that because I think I would have
enjoyed<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.990> even<00:03:12.290> more<00:03:12.740> if<00:03:13.040> I<00:03:13.370> just<00:03:13.580> kept

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
enjoyed it even more if I just kept

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.670 
enjoyed it even more if I just kept
reading<00:03:13.910> so<00:03:14.270> I<00:03:14.300> think<00:03:14.420> this<00:03:14.780> definitely<00:03:15.140> one

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
reading so I think this definitely one

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.490 
reading so I think this definitely one
to<00:03:16.040> reread<00:03:16.640> even<00:03:17.060> though<00:03:17.210> I<00:03:17.450> did<00:03:17.870> really<00:03:18.110> enjoy

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
to reread even though I did really enjoy

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.690 
to reread even though I did really enjoy
it<00:03:18.680> on<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.010> first<00:03:19.250> read

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
it on the first read

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.550 
it on the first read
I<00:03:19.730> still<00:03:20.060> think<00:03:20.180> Dave<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.600> Triffids<00:03:21.110> is<00:03:21.230> my

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
I still think Dave the Triffids is my

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.290 
I still think Dave the Triffids is my
favorite<00:03:22.010> but<00:03:22.250> if<00:03:22.490> you<00:03:22.580> like<00:03:22.730> apocalyptic
