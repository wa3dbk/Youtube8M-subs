00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
them rejoin instantly this explains why

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.790 
them rejoin instantly this explains why
they<00:03:45.240> are<00:03:45.390> also<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.930> cyclic<00:03:46.380> light<00:03:46.530> the

they are also the cyclic light the

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.310 
they are also the cyclic light the
explanation<00:03:47.490> may<00:03:47.820> be<00:03:47.850> less<00:03:48.270> complicated<00:03:48.630> as

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320

to how they stay together as opposed to

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
what execute actually are but there is

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.000 
one thing I wanted to address before I
do<00:03:56.760> conclude<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:57.780> execute<00:03:58.500> can<00:03:58.650> learn<00:03:58.860> the

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
do conclude this execute can learn the

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.550 
do conclude this execute can learn the
attack<00:03:59.280> egg<00:03:59.490> bomb<00:03:59.760> as<00:04:00.030> previously<00:04:00.870> covered<00:04:01.350> so

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
attack egg bomb as previously covered so

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.530 
attack egg bomb as previously covered so
you<00:04:01.770> can<00:04:01.920> call<00:04:02.100> this<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.310> mini<00:04:02.820> theory<00:04:03.360> if<00:04:03.510> you

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
you can call this a mini theory if you

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.380 
you can call this a mini theory if you
want<00:04:03.900> but<00:04:04.230> here<00:04:04.530> is<00:04:04.709> my<00:04:04.920> idea<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.610> continuity

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
want but here is my idea the continuity

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.840 
want but here is my idea the continuity
of<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.870> anime<00:04:07.290> and<00:04:07.500> games<00:04:07.800> is<00:04:08.100> not<00:04:08.130> good<00:04:08.610> to

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
of the anime and games is not good to

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:09.530 
of the anime and games is not good to
say<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.180> least

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
say the least

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.350 
say the least
one<00:04:09.720> minute<00:04:10.160> explosion<00:04:11.160> causes<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:11.940> Pokemon

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
one minute explosion causes the Pokemon

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.540 
one minute explosion causes the Pokemon
to<00:04:12.600> die<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.140> disappear<00:04:13.350> and<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.070> next<00:04:14.400> it

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
to die and disappear and the next it

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.060 
to die and disappear and the next it
just<00:04:14.790> fainted<00:04:15.300> so<00:04:15.450> I<00:04:15.480> feel<00:04:15.810> egg<00:04:16.140> bomb<00:04:16.470> is<00:04:16.799> the

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
just fainted so I feel egg bomb is the

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.310 
just fainted so I feel egg bomb is the
same<00:04:17.340> way<00:04:17.640> when<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:17.970> pokémon<00:04:18.209> like<00:04:18.600> execute

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
same way when a pokémon like execute

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.250 
same way when a pokémon like execute
uses<00:04:19.709> otherwise<00:04:20.280> after<00:04:20.970> 6<00:04:21.239> texts<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:21.840> Pokemon

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
uses otherwise after 6 texts the Pokemon

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.409 
uses otherwise after 6 texts the Pokemon
would<00:04:22.410> be<00:04:22.590> destroyed<00:04:22.950> but<00:04:23.160> then<00:04:23.310> after<00:04:23.850> one<00:04:24.090> it

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
would be destroyed but then after one it

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.120 
would be destroyed but then after one it
would<00:04:24.570> cause<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.930> Pokemon<00:04:25.350> to<00:04:25.590> be<00:04:25.710> unable<00:04:25.890> to

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
would cause the Pokemon to be unable to

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.400 
would cause the Pokemon to be unable to
survive<00:04:26.400> without<00:04:26.910> all<00:04:27.300> six<00:04:27.600> eggs<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:28.230> would

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
survive without all six eggs you would

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.590 
survive without all six eggs you would
just<00:04:28.590> fall<00:04:28.830> flat<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.400> most<00:04:29.669> ridiculous<00:04:30.450> of

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
just fall flat the most ridiculous of

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.930 
just fall flat the most ridiculous of
all<00:04:30.900> of<00:04:31.080> this<00:04:31.260> though<00:04:31.590> is<00:04:31.770> that<00:04:31.860> it<00:04:32.370> evolves

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
all of this though is that it evolves

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.150 
all of this though is that it evolves
into<00:04:33.150> a<00:04:33.300> palm<00:04:33.600> tree<00:04:33.720> with<00:04:34.080> no<00:04:34.290> arms<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:34.860> three

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
heads and executives heads can fall off

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.220 
heads and executives heads can fall off
and<00:04:38.220> become<00:04:38.460> execute<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.090> when<00:04:39.390> this<00:04:39.840> will
