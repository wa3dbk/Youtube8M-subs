00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
have used too much of it because when I

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.290 
have used too much of it because when I
put<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.520> sat<00:00:50.789> on<00:00:50.820> my<00:00:51.059> hair

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
put it on it just so just sat on my hair

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.810 
put it on it just so just sat on my hair
and<00:00:51.510> was<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.780> like<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> hunk<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.379> white<00:00:53.219> nasty

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and was just like a hunk of white nasty

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.720 
and was just like a hunk of white nasty
mess<00:00:54.030> but<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.360> mean<00:00:54.539> eventually<00:00:54.780> dissolved<00:00:55.730> and

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
mess but I mean eventually dissolved and

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.090 
mess but I mean eventually dissolved and
I<00:00:56.850> got<00:00:57.000> picked<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.360> hole<00:00:57.600> from<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.260> as<00:00:58.980> you

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
I got picked a hole from it and as you

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.349 
I got picked a hole from it and as you
see<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.460> twist<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.059> very<00:01:00.329> defined<00:01:02.359> so

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
see the twist that is very defined so

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.850 
see the twist that is very defined so
yeah<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.629> will<00:01:03.840> probably<00:01:03.989> use<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.409> pause<00:01:04.619> again

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860
