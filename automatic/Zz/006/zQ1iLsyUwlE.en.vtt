00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.490
 Oh dear 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.190
 Do you feel that the key has been slightly improved in the future? 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.220
 Yup 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.100
 The future deck is my own 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.790

 It is a guy man elite type 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:54.929
 It feels like there is a seal blur. 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:58.760
 It is round one and it was recorded that I put a boo Noumi on a battle line area

 Well this two people no ability triggered 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:22.009
 Leave only not in light of the time that Well I wonder, this guy abilities did not trigger Well 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:24.900
 It will be a deck position, and it is necessary for these two people to compensate for this bt to be triggered 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:30.660
 When you save 10 required a hero energy 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:33.259
 Wide Do child guess that is to say this guy abilities of their team is straight and a to 2 times 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.259

 It's double it plus it's super powerful damage 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:59.180

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:08.590
 Maa usually is this version 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:11.480
