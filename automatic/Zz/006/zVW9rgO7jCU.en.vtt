00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.620
 Hi, how are you on YouTube but they are still 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:14.170
 less wrong the dawn and we are in 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.890
 another video tutorial note but this time 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:22.210
 of how to make a building if you follow a 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.680
 building in a matter of seconds and see 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.180
 what is the first thing we have to do 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.510
 and well we have to build a 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.850
 good as the size you want so 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.230
 the building is going to be the size that 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.750
 you want 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.989
 afterwards when you're going to start 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.989
 build a platform 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.960
 there is a platform the size of the size 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:52.890
 that you want but I'm going to make a 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.289
 rectangle and to see good after that 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.960
 we have more or less the size that good 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.659
 the structure that we want we have to 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.530
 remove this that is good that is good 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:06.949
 the tail that had been here good 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.949
 we remove it 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.260
 we are going to remove all that well sexy from a 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.690
 minute that is giving me peace of mind 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.280
 utility tranquility and once it 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.680
 we have everything good is everything is 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.900
 destroyed and we already have the thing is here 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.110
 we take the cubes of the fertilizer and boom 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.980
 we started putting them like this all over the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:33.160
 outline of what was and what was missing 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.670
 everything for that must be done calmly 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.220
 and good once today 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:45.630
 let's wait here for the lava to fall 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:49.370
 your damn process and all 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.370
 and good to see 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.640
 of good here sheets do not know services 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.500
 as everything is falling in like this with 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.750
 equal loops 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:05.180
 and well once it is not once 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.220
 already covered everything we take a 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.259
 water cube good and nothing more than 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.550
 finish to finish this thing and lava 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.640
 We know it's a little bit true 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.210
 but good not least we wait a little bit 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.510
 to speak it 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.510
 and good look at this 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:34.550
 Let's see, we are waiting, we stopped, almost 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:37.970
 finish this and that is it and once you have 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.820
 finished we took the water cube we 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.560
 we go up we're going to go up and put it 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:47.400
 here here also here almost everywhere 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.520
 sides 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.030
 It was 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.040
 and so we wait for the water to go 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.340
 going down and once everything is fine 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.110
 covered the water and going down goes going as 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.480
 that to transform all this lava into 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.130
 stone Ivan is already seeing all the 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.680
 structure if everything goes well 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.120
 my god how the sink going down is going 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.790
 building the stone and so not 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.140
 we know a little more time in this 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.200
 about a lot to see here they were and they were 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.380
 here is already building good what 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.880
 that was lava in stone and these the 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.440
 milestones that are like they are pretty 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.290
 pimps 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.700
 when we stick to everything is formed 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:36.550
 so stone and already and as great already 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.640
 he will have created his damn structure if 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.250
 everything is super great but there is still 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.260
 water but what do I do now if I did 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.660
 like everything all everything and clogging and everything 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.030
 that's good because it's super super super 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.860
 simple no more where we have put the 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.960
 buckets of water because nothing else we put 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.000
 I know, but well with this, I do not know 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.130
 it's over then we're waiting for you but 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.020
 see nothing after we put here where 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.930
 there is good water where we do not see 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:07.300
 current 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:08.920
 I understand here here here here here and 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.540
 well and good so they would already have their 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.700
 superstructure without having pennant 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.100
 giving everything and that's the whole tutorial well 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.280
 they save a lot of time they do not put us 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.549
 This will cover all this and that's me 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.549
 dismissal
