noticeable on these bigger parts we

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.729 
noticeable on these bigger parts we
needed<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.780> that's<00:02:22.049> why<00:02:22.170> I'm<00:02:22.260> doing<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.530> this

way and then little little bit of

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.340 
way and then little little bit of
radical<00:02:27.900> EQ<00:02:28.290> here<00:02:29.120> just<00:02:30.120> just<00:02:30.450> some<00:02:30.660> repair

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
radical EQ here just just some repair

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.670 
radical EQ here just just some repair

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
doing here I'm sending several things to

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.100 
doing here I'm sending several things to
this<00:03:07.200> track<00:03:08.120> here<00:03:09.120> against<00:03:09.480> just<00:03:09.810> subtle

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
this track here against just subtle

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.850 
this track here against just subtle
stuff<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:11.130> what<00:03:11.220> this<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.550> doing<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:15.860> more

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
stuff so what this is doing is more

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.640 
stuff so what this is doing is more
mid-range<00:03:17.130> then<00:03:18.030> this<00:03:18.240> guy<00:03:18.450> I<00:03:18.870> don't<00:03:19.500> know

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
mid-range then this guy I don't know

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.620 
mid-range then this guy I don't know
what<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:19.980> hell<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.220> does<00:03:20.430> but<00:03:20.670> it's<00:03:21.360> doing

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
what the hell it does but it's doing

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.490 
what the hell it does but it's doing
something<00:03:21.870> between<00:03:22.260> these<00:03:22.380> two<00:03:22.560> frequencies

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.050 

rounds<00:03:28.500> out<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.740> bottom<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.310> then<00:03:29.640> let's

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
rounds out the bottom and then let's

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.540 
rounds out the bottom and then let's
check<00:03:30.120> these<00:03:30.360> effects

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
check these effects

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.860 
check these effects
okay<00:03:33.020> now<00:03:34.020> the<00:03:34.080> fix<00:03:34.500> are<00:03:34.650> gonna<00:03:34.740> I<00:03:35.040> want<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.340> fix

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
okay now the fix are gonna I want to fix

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.240 
okay now the fix are gonna I want to fix
once<00:03:36.870> he's<00:03:37.020> on<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.350> effects<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.709> do<00:03:37.890> it's<00:03:38.040> kind

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
once he's on the effects to do it's kind

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
once he's on the effects to do it's kind
of<00:03:38.459> smooth<00:03:39.209> out<00:03:39.450> some<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.970> human<00:03:41.970> this<00:03:42.090> is

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
of smooth out some of the human this is

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.670 
of smooth out some of the human this is

now we've gone over this this guy here

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.670 
now we've gone over this this guy here
it<00:04:17.829> here<00:04:18.070> this<00:04:18.220> little<00:04:18.430> split<00:04:18.699> harm<00:04:18.940> guy

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
it here this little split harm guy

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.719 
it here this little split harm guy
essentially<00:04:20.680> it's<00:04:20.829> just<00:04:20.979> a<00:04:21.100> doubler<00:04:21.519> hand

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
essentially it's just a doubler hand

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.960 
essentially it's just a doubler hand
left<00:04:21.910> and<00:04:22.120> right<00:04:22.270> I've<00:04:22.389> got<00:04:22.509> a<00:04:22.710> 1419

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
left and right I've got a 1419

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.340 
left and right I've got a 1419
millisecond<00:04:24.970> delay<00:04:25.060> well<00:04:25.509> within<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:25.960> hosta

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
millisecond delay well within the hosta

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.210 
millisecond delay well within the hosta
thick<00:04:26.590> just<00:04:27.340> light<00:04:27.550> detuning<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:28.660> and<00:04:29.220> sharp

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
thick just light detuning and and sharp

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.730 
thick just light detuning and and sharp
on<00:04:30.690> opposite<00:04:31.690> sides<00:04:32.280> a<00:04:33.280> little<00:04:33.699> bit<00:04:33.820> of<00:04:33.970> EQ<00:04:34.740> and

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
on opposite sides a little bit of EQ and

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.909 
on opposite sides a little bit of EQ and
then<00:04:35.949> widening<00:04:36.430> it<00:04:36.580> a<00:04:36.610> little<00:04:36.789> bit<00:04:37.380> and<00:04:38.380> a

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
then widening it a little bit and a

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.100 
then widening it a little bit and a
little<00:04:39.610> bit<00:04:39.820> of<00:04:39.880> chorus<00:04:41.190> and<00:04:42.190> then<00:04:42.669> a<00:04:43.300> parallel

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
little bit of chorus and then a parallel

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.960 
little bit of chorus and then a parallel
compressor<00:04:44.620> chain<00:04:44.919> that's<00:04:45.280> it<00:04:45.370> fancy

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
compressor chain that's it fancy

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.230 
compressor chain that's it fancy
just<00:04:46.150> your<00:04:46.630> standard<00:04:46.720> thing<00:04:47.289> and<00:04:47.740> then<00:04:48.490> let's

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
just your standard thing and then let's

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.430 
just your standard thing and then let's
see<00:04:49.330> what<00:04:49.389> I'm<00:04:49.509> using<00:04:49.630> for<00:04:49.750> delay<00:04:50.169> cause<00:04:50.410> a

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
see what I'm using for delay cause a

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.200 
see what I'm using for delay cause a
delay<00:04:50.650> is<00:04:50.860> pretty<00:04:51.400> important<00:04:51.789> on<00:04:51.880> this<00:04:52.030> song

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
delay is pretty important on this song

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.230 
delay is pretty important on this song
if<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.360> delay<00:04:55.630> is<00:04:55.780> echo<00:04:56.050> farm<00:04:56.470> and<00:04:57.240> we're

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
if the delay is echo farm and we're

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.370 
if the delay is echo farm and we're
using<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:01.750> one<00:05:01.870> that<00:05:01.900> has<00:05:02.050> a<00:05:02.080> little

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
using the one that has a little

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.020 
using the one that has a little
distortion<00:05:02.919> and<00:05:03.099> I<00:05:03.220> can't<00:05:03.490> remember<00:05:03.639> the<00:05:03.849> name

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
distortion and I can't remember the name

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.330 
distortion and I can't remember the name
of<00:05:04.060> it<00:05:04.210> but<00:05:04.810> you<00:05:04.990> can<00:05:05.050> see<00:05:05.260> my<00:05:05.409> bitrate<00:05:05.680> is<00:05:06.130> like

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
of it but you can see my bitrate is like

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.620 
of it but you can see my bitrate is like
in<00:05:06.490> about<00:05:06.760> 11<00:05:07.539> o'clock<00:05:08.280> some<00:05:09.280> repeats<00:05:09.699> I'm

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
in about 11 o'clock some repeats I'm

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.960 
in about 11 o'clock some repeats I'm
sending<00:05:10.960> that<00:05:10.990> to<00:05:11.289> true<00:05:11.530> verb<00:05:11.789> sending<00:05:12.789> that
