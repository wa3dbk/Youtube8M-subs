zip it off pop it in the fridge and use
it<00:01:49.649> again<00:01:49.829> later<00:01:49.860> now<00:01:50.820> these<00:01:51.299> are<00:01:51.509> sandwich

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
it again later now these are sandwich

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.130 
it again later now these are sandwich
bags<00:01:52.229> they're<00:01:52.979> relatively<00:01:53.549> thin<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.780> can

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
bags they're relatively thin so you can

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.499 
bags they're relatively thin so you can
use<00:01:55.409> them<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.340> find<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.850> can't<00:01:57.149> reuse

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
use them but I find that you can't reuse

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.480 
use them but I find that you can't reuse
them<00:01:57.869> very<00:01:58.049> very<00:01:58.530> much<00:01:58.680> because<00:01:59.070> they<00:01:59.159> tend<00:01:59.399> to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
them very very much because they tend to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.819 
them very very much because they tend to
want<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.880> break<00:02:00.390> down<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.990> icing<00:02:01.560> comes<00:02:01.710> out

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
want to break down and icing comes out

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.580 
want to break down and icing comes out
the<00:02:01.950> side<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.430> what<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.729> use<00:02:03.060> instead<00:02:03.479> are<00:02:04.469> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
the side so what I use instead are the
