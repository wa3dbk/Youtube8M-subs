00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.270 

so<00:00:00.690> let's<00:00:00.930> go<00:00:01.079> into<00:00:01.290> our<00:00:01.319> browser<00:00:01.650> and<00:00:02.100> click

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
so let's go into our browser and click

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.970 
so let's go into our browser and click
refresh<00:00:02.580> and<00:00:03.149> we<00:00:03.240> shared<00:00:03.659> yet<00:00:04.440> there<00:00:04.650> we<00:00:04.710> go

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
refresh and we shared yet there we go

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.130 
refresh and we shared yet there we go
so<00:00:05.460> now<00:00:05.609> what<00:00:05.790> we've<00:00:05.940> got<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.180> an<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.569> textual

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
so now what we've got is an a textual

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.990 
so now what we've got is an a textual
representation<00:00:07.649> or<00:00:08.580> an<00:00:08.670> image

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
representation or an image

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.120 
representation or an image
representation<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.960> our<00:00:10.080> text<00:00:10.650> by<00:00:11.099> using

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
representation of our text by using

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.860 
representation of our text by using
these<00:00:11.790> functions<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.480> I've<00:00:12.599> already

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
these functions that I've already

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.640 
these functions that I've already
mentioned<00:00:13.110> so<00:00:14.059> really<00:00:15.059> it's<00:00:15.330> quite<00:00:15.540> simple<00:00:16.109> if

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
mentioned so really it's quite simple if

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.320 
mentioned so really it's quite simple if
you<00:00:16.859> remember<00:00:17.310> these<00:00:17.460> functions<00:00:17.910> remember

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
you remember these functions remember

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.179 
you remember these functions remember
what<00:00:18.420> they<00:00:18.539> do<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.020> also<00:00:19.560> remember<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
what they do and also remember the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.359 
what they do and also remember the
parameters<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:20.939> which<00:00:21.150> order<00:00:21.660> they<00:00:21.779> go<00:00:22.369> it

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
parameters and in which order they go it

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.060 
parameters and in which order they go it
hasn't<00:00:23.640> taken<00:00:23.789> me<00:00:24.090> long<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.480> learn<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:25.070> you

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
hasn't taken me long to learn this you

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.710 
hasn't taken me long to learn this you
do<00:00:26.220> forget<00:00:26.460> after<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.910> while<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.269> have<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.539> sort

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
do forget after a while you have to sort

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.540 
do forget after a while you have to sort
of<00:00:27.779> refer<00:00:28.080> back<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.349> things<00:00:28.710> but<00:00:29.310> it's

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
of refer back to things but it's

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.950 
of refer back to things but it's
generally<00:00:29.970> pretty<00:00:30.119> simple<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.810> get

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
generally pretty simple and you get

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.930 
generally pretty simple and you get
quite<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> neat<00:00:31.529> output<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.730> quite

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
quite a neat output so this is quite

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.410 
quite a neat output so this is quite
cool

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
cool

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.350 
cool
we've<00:00:33.840> got<00:00:33.989> example<00:00:34.380> at<00:00:34.469> example.com<00:00:35.329> like<00:00:36.329> I

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
we've got example at example.com like I

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.540 
we've got example at example.com like I
said<00:00:36.660> earlier<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> tutorial<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.980> want<00:00:38.430> this

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
said earlier in the tutorial I want this

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.850 
said earlier in the tutorial I want this
to<00:00:38.700> be<00:00:38.730> dynamic<00:00:39.360> for<00:00:39.660> example<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.500> could<00:00:40.649> keep

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
to be dynamic for example you could keep

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.100 
to be dynamic for example you could keep
your<00:00:40.920> generate<00:00:41.430> PHP<00:00:42.149> file<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.570> your<00:00:42.690> website

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
your generate PHP file on your website

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.049 
your generate PHP file on your website
somewhere<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.770> refer<00:00:44.370> back<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.820> every

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
somewhere and refer back to it every

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.940 
somewhere and refer back to it every
time<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.450> wanted<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.870> convert<00:00:46.050> say<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> public

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
time you wanted to convert say a public

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.020 
time you wanted to convert say a public
email<00:00:47.129> address<00:00:47.579> that's<00:00:47.730> going<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:47.969> be

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
email address that's going to be

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.510 
email address that's going to be
displayed<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:49.020> an<00:00:49.140> image<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.160> want<00:00:50.430> to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
displayed to an image so you want to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.560 
displayed to an image so you want to
make<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:51.289> stat<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.530> static<00:00:53.180> variable<00:00:54.180> that

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
make this stat the static variable that

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.540 
make this stat the static variable that
we've<00:00:54.719> got<00:00:54.870> here<00:00:55.020> more<00:00:55.199> dynamic<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:56.309> want

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
we've got here more dynamic so we want

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.599 
we've got here more dynamic so we want
to<00:00:56.699> take<00:00:56.879> user<00:00:57.329> input<00:00:57.480> or<00:00:58.340> input<00:00:59.340> that's<00:00:59.460> going

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
to take user input or input that's going

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.950 
to take user input or input that's going
to<00:00:59.670> be<00:00:59.760> processed<00:01:00.030> through<00:01:01.789> out<00:01:02.789> our<00:01:03.329> code

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
to be processed through out our code

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.870 
to be processed through out our code
eventually<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.159> what<00:01:05.280> I'm<00:01:05.369> going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.549> do<00:01:05.700> is

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
eventually so what I'm going to do is

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.120 
eventually so what I'm going to do is
modify<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.780> change<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.619> get<00:01:08.630> email

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
modify this and change it to get email

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.580 
modify this and change it to get email
in<00:01:11.130> fact<00:01:11.970> probably<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.750> best<00:01:13.020> thing<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> do

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
in fact probably the best thing to do

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.899 
in fact probably the best thing to do
would<00:01:13.830> be<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.070> make<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.090> bit<00:01:15.540> more<00:01:16.790> just<00:01:17.790> a

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
would be to make this a bit more just a

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.060 
would be to make this a bit more just a
bit<00:01:18.119> more<00:01:18.409> flowing<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.530> working<00:01:19.920> properly

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
bit more flowing and working properly

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.179 
bit more flowing and working properly
I'm<00:01:20.700> going<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.030> say<00:01:21.210> if<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.930> set<00:01:22.470> dollar

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
I'm going to say if is set dollar

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:30.880 
I'm going to say if is set dollar
underscore<00:01:23.700> get<00:01:25.100> email<00:01:28.220> then<00:01:29.220> set<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.670> to

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
underscore get email then set that to

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.280 
underscore get email then set that to
then<00:01:31.890> set<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.490> email<00:01:32.850> otherwise<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:34.110> want

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
then set that to email otherwise I want

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.969 
then set that to email otherwise I want
to<00:01:34.470> say<00:01:35.090> echo<00:01:36.090> oh<00:01:36.420> no<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.110> add<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.409> want<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.650> echo

to say echo oh no so add I want to echo

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.719 
to say echo oh no so add I want to echo
no<00:01:38.340> no<00:01:38.520> no<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.880> want<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.479> say<00:01:39.570> email<00:01:40.079> equals<00:01:40.729> no

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
no no no I want to say email equals no

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.859 
no no no I want to say email equals no
email<00:01:43.310> specified<00:01:44.310> okay<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.570> what's<00:01:45.720> going<00:01:45.750> to

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
email specified okay so what's going to

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:46.940 
email specified okay so what's going to
happen<00:01:46.140> now<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.290> we're<00:01:46.500> going<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.680> check<00:01:46.920> for

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
happen now is we're going to check for

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.590 
happen now is we're going to check for
this<00:01:47.189> get<00:01:47.430> variable<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.119> if<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.390> we're<00:01:48.509> going

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
this get variable and if so we're going

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.770 
this get variable and if so we're going
to<00:01:48.689> put<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.930> into<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.409> email<00:01:50.630> variable<00:01:51.630> that's

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
to put it into the email variable that's

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.870 
to put it into the email variable that's
going<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.020> be<00:01:52.079> used<00:01:52.380> by<00:01:52.500> our<00:01:52.740> program<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.759> we're

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
going to be used by our program so we're

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.230 
going to be used by our program so we're
now<00:01:54.000> working<00:01:54.119> with<00:01:54.659> more<00:01:55.020> dynamic<00:01:55.649> input

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
now working with more dynamic input

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.270 
now working with more dynamic input
otherwise<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:58.259> email<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.890> just<00:01:59.100> going<00:01:59.189> to

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
otherwise the email is just going to

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.550 
otherwise the email is just going to
equal<00:01:59.520> no<00:01:59.700> email<00:02:00.090> specified<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:01.259> let's<00:02:01.439> go

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
equal no email specified so let's go

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.319 
equal no email specified so let's go
into<00:02:01.740> my<00:02:01.829> generator<00:02:02.280> here<00:02:02.610> again<00:02:02.939> just<00:02:03.149> hit

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
into my generator here again just hit

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
refresh no email specified so now what I

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.900 
refresh no email specified so now what I
can<00:02:06.780> do<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.439> can<00:02:07.500> specify<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.250> email<00:02:08.340> here

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
can do is I can specify the email here

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.360 
can do is I can specify the email here
and<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.090> can<00:02:09.239> say<00:02:09.390> email<00:02:09.840> equals<00:02:10.470> exactly

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370

Academy<00:02:15.209> that<00:02:15.390> all<00:02:15.569> just<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.200> we've<00:02:16.379> got<00:02:16.769> a<00:02:16.800> bit

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
Academy that all just so we've got a bit

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.860 
Academy that all just so we've got a bit
of<00:02:16.980> change<00:02:17.280> going<00:02:17.550> on<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.480> can<00:02:18.629> see<00:02:18.780> that

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
of change going on and you can see that

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.440 
of change going on and you can see that
that<00:02:19.019> email<00:02:19.230> address<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.980> now<00:02:20.220> written<00:02:20.489> out<00:02:20.819> so

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
that email address is now written out so

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.369 
that email address is now written out so
let's<00:02:21.629> try<00:02:21.959> putting<00:02:22.200> some<00:02:23.450> long<00:02:24.450> value<00:02:25.080> in<00:02:25.230> it

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
let's try putting some long value in it

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.229 
let's try putting some long value in it
so<00:02:25.830> let's<00:02:26.069> just<00:02:26.280> say<00:02:26.400> example<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.060> Peoria

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
so let's just say example a Peoria

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.449 
so let's just say example a Peoria
chemita<00:02:27.690> org<00:02:27.930> again<00:02:28.290> but<00:02:28.920> we'll<00:02:29.040> copy<00:02:29.280> and

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
chemita org again but we'll copy and

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.089 
chemita org again but we'll copy and
paste<00:02:29.700> this<00:02:29.910> over<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:30.360> over<00:02:30.390> again<00:02:30.629> just<00:02:31.530> so

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
paste this over and over again just so

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.699 
paste this over and over again just so
we<00:02:32.220> can<00:02:32.370> see<00:02:32.640> how<00:02:32.879> the<00:02:33.360> length<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:34.049> this<00:02:34.260> image

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
we can see how the length of this image

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.530 
we can see how the length of this image
changes<00:02:35.430> now<00:02:36.180> let's<00:02:36.569> say<00:02:36.810> we<00:02:37.019> were<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.379> just

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
changes now let's say we were to just

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.720 
changes now let's say we were to just
specify<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.900> width<00:02:40.349> for<00:02:40.680> ourselves<00:02:40.769> we<00:02:41.519> could

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
specify a width for ourselves we could

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.309 
specify a width for ourselves we could
I'm<00:02:42.150> going<00:02:42.299> to<00:02:42.360> cut<00:02:42.599> this<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:42.959> can<00:02:43.110> use<00:02:43.290> it

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
I'm going to cut this so I can use it

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.400 
I'm going to cut this so I can use it
again<00:02:43.590> later<00:02:43.620> let's<00:02:44.579> take<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.790> 20<00:02:45.480> for<00:02:45.840> example

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
again later let's take a 20 for example

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.350 
again later let's take a 20 for example
now<00:02:47.040> let's<00:02:47.220> go<00:02:47.340> into<00:02:47.459> our<00:02:47.519> generate<00:02:47.970> file<00:02:48.209> and

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
now let's go into our generate file and

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.690 
now let's go into our generate file and
you<00:02:48.420> can<00:02:48.569> see<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.840> it's<00:02:49.049> only<00:02:49.370> just<00:02:50.370> giving

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
you can see that it's only just giving

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.640 
you can see that it's only just giving
us<00:02:50.849> a<00:02:51.420> bit<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.560> this<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:53.069> bit<00:02:53.459> of<00:02:53.700> this<00:02:53.910> image<00:02:54.900> so

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
us a bit of this a bit of this image so

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.470 
us a bit of this a bit of this image so
we're<00:02:55.860> using<00:02:56.069> this<00:02:56.340> function<00:02:56.849> we're<00:02:57.360> not

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
we're using this function we're not

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.140 
we're using this function we're not
we're<00:02:57.840> not<00:02:57.870> we're<00:02:58.290> not<00:02:58.319> creating<00:02:59.250> any<00:02:59.400> code

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
we're not we're not creating any code

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.640 
we're not we're not creating any code
for<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.480> sake<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.989> we're<00:03:01.140> doing<00:03:01.379> this<00:03:01.470> so

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
for the sake of it we're doing this so

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.220 
for the sake of it we're doing this so
everything<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.370> dynamically<00:03:02.940> updated<00:03:03.629> and<00:03:04.110> we

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
everything is dynamically updated and we

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.949 
everything is dynamically updated and we
don't<00:03:04.440> lose<00:03:04.709> out<00:03:04.980> on<00:03:05.010> any<00:03:05.220> data<00:03:05.579> and<00:03:06.120> also<00:03:06.390> this

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
don't lose out on any data and also this

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.280 
don't lose out on any data and also this
this<00:03:07.349> also<00:03:07.709> means<00:03:07.980> I'm<00:03:08.569> sorry<00:03:09.569> this<00:03:10.110> also

this also means I'm sorry this also

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.780 
this also means I'm sorry this also
means<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.680> we<00:03:10.860> what<00:03:11.250> we're<00:03:11.400> doing<00:03:11.579> is<00:03:11.670> we're

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
means that we what we're doing is we're

means that we what we're doing is we're
not<00:03:11.940> wasting<00:03:12.599> any<00:03:12.870> data<00:03:13.170> I<00:03:13.319> mean<00:03:13.530> we<00:03:13.680> could<00:03:13.860> say

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
not wasting any data I mean we could say

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.059 
not wasting any data I mean we could say
well<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.879> image<00:03:15.030> width<00:03:15.359> could<00:03:15.720> be<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:16.200> thousand

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
well the image width could be a thousand

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.059 
well the image width could be a thousand
you<00:03:17.670> know<00:03:17.700> pixels<00:03:18.299> long<00:03:18.540> or<00:03:18.840> ten<00:03:19.560> thousand

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
you know pixels long or ten thousand

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.949 
you know pixels long or ten thousand
pixels<00:03:20.250> long<00:03:20.639> or<00:03:20.819> something<00:03:20.970> but<00:03:21.600> we're<00:03:21.750> only

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
pixels long or something but we're only

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.460 
pixels long or something but we're only
creating<00:03:22.769> it<00:03:22.889> here<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:24.480> size<00:03:24.750> we<00:03:24.989> actually

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
creating it here the size we actually

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.960 
creating it here the size we actually
need<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.920> was<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.160> is<00:03:26.280> saving<00:03:26.700> up<00:03:26.819> on

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
say email it should break down a line

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.000 
say email it should break down a line
and<00:03:48.510> then<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:48.780> should<00:03:48.900> output<00:03:49.049> this<00:03:49.560> image

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
and then it should output this image

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.490 
and then it should output this image
when<00:03:50.549> in<00:03:50.639> actual<00:03:51.060> fact<00:03:51.269> when<00:03:51.840> we<00:03:51.989> refresh<00:03:52.230> the

when in actual fact when we refresh the
page<00:03:52.650> we<00:03:53.010> get<00:03:53.160> all<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.700> this<00:03:53.819> gobbledygook

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
page we get all of this gobbledygook

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.539 
page we get all of this gobbledygook
come<00:03:54.750> up<00:03:54.930> cannot<00:03:55.620> modify<00:03:55.950> header<00:03:56.220> information

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
come up cannot modify header information

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.539 
come up cannot modify header information
headers<00:03:57.269> already<00:03:57.599> sent<00:03:57.959> in<00:03:58.260> this<00:03:58.919> page<00:03:59.250> and

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
headers already sent in this page and

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.599 
headers already sent in this page and
then<00:03:59.639> we<00:03:59.790> get<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.359> literal<00:04:00.900> um<00:04:01.549> sort<00:04:02.549> of

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
then we get the literal um sort of

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.509 
then we get the literal um sort of
textual<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.900> know<00:04:04.370> representation<00:04:05.370> of<00:04:05.430> the

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
textual you know representation of the

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.640 
textual you know representation of the
JPEG<00:04:05.940> as<00:04:06.090> if<00:04:06.209> you<00:04:06.299> were<00:04:06.419> to<00:04:06.540> open<00:04:06.690> it<00:04:06.959> up<00:04:07.079> in<00:04:07.319> a

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
JPEG as if you were to open it up in a

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.550 
JPEG as if you were to open it up in a
text<00:04:08.040> editor<00:04:08.099> so<00:04:08.910> this<00:04:09.060> looks<00:04:09.269> a<00:04:09.389> massive<00:04:10.290> mess

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
text editor so this looks a massive mess

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.250 
text editor so this looks a massive mess
at<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.829> moment<00:04:11.150> and<00:04:12.150> we<00:04:12.269> also<00:04:12.450> can't<00:04:12.989> put

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
at the moment and we also can't put

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.360 
at the moment and we also can't put
output<00:04:14.130> within<00:04:14.459> our<00:04:14.579> code<00:04:14.849> so<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.209> could<00:04:15.510> say

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
output within our code so I could say

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.039 
output within our code so I could say
well<00:04:17.370> after<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.329> header<00:04:18.539> then<00:04:18.780> we

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
well after the header then we

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.979 
well after the header then we
can<00:04:19.169> say<00:04:19.759> email<00:04:20.759> and<00:04:20.909> then<00:04:21.000> a<00:04:21.030> break<00:04:21.329> but<00:04:21.900> if

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
can say email and then a break but if

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.290 
can say email and then a break but if
you<00:04:22.049> refresh<00:04:22.590> you<00:04:23.460> see<00:04:23.639> that<00:04:23.789> nothing<00:04:24.090> comes

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
you refresh you see that nothing comes

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.809 
you refresh you see that nothing comes
up<00:04:24.509> now<00:04:24.690> because<00:04:24.840> you<00:04:25.139> ruined<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:26.159> content<00:04:26.699> of

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:26.819 
up now because you ruined the content of

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:28.700 
up now because you ruined the content of
your<00:04:26.849> page<00:04:27.240> this<00:04:27.810> content<00:04:28.379> type<00:04:28.590> is

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
your page this content type is

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.219 
your page this content type is
image/jpeg<00:04:29.129> it's<00:04:29.759> nothing<00:04:30.180> else<00:04:30.330> no<00:04:30.720> texts

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
image/jpeg it's nothing else no texts

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:31.760 
image/jpeg it's nothing else no texts
nothing

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
nothing

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.830 
nothing
we're<00:04:32.129> just<00:04:32.430> outputting<00:04:33.210> an<00:04:33.300> image<00:04:33.659> and

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
we're just outputting an image and

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.869 
we're just outputting an image and
that's<00:04:33.960> here<00:04:34.289> so<00:04:34.860> how<00:04:35.039> do<00:04:35.099> we<00:04:35.280> go<00:04:35.400> about<00:04:35.490> doing

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:35.879 
that's here so how do we go about doing

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.029 
that's here so how do we go about doing
this<00:04:35.970> because<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.780> image<00:04:37.080> now<00:04:37.319> exists<00:04:37.800> as<00:04:37.979> a

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
this because the image now exists as a

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.990 
this because the image now exists as a
PHP<00:04:38.490> file<00:04:38.970> if<00:04:39.120> you<00:04:39.240> look<00:04:39.419> in<00:04:39.569> here<00:04:39.979> where<00:04:41.000> we're

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
PHP file if you look in here where we're

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.309 
PHP file if you look in here where we're
essentially<00:04:42.509> dealing<00:04:42.930> with<00:04:43.020> what's<00:04:43.199> a

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:43.319 
essentially dealing with what's a

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.339 
essentially dealing with what's a
dynamic<00:04:43.979> JPEG<00:04:44.550> we've<00:04:44.970> got<00:04:45.150> generate<00:04:45.539> PHP<00:04:46.259> and

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
dynamic JPEG we've got generate PHP and

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.409 
dynamic JPEG we've got generate PHP and
we've<00:04:46.470> got<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.770> an<00:04:47.190> argument<00:04:47.789> after<00:04:47.909> he'll<00:04:48.270> or

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
we've got a an argument after he'll or

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.619 
we've got a an argument after he'll or
an<00:04:48.629> input<00:04:48.780> variable<00:04:49.169> after<00:04:49.860> here<00:04:50.419> so<00:04:51.419> how<00:04:51.569> are

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:51.629 
an input variable after here so how are

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:54.080 
an input variable after here so how are
we<00:04:51.719> going<00:04:51.870> to<00:04:51.930> insert<00:04:52.500> this<00:04:52.830> what<00:04:53.819> we've<00:04:53.940> got

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
we going to insert this what we've got

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.930 
we going to insert this what we've got
here<00:04:54.650> let<00:04:55.650> me<00:04:55.680> just<00:04:55.919> highlight<00:04:56.129> it<00:04:56.430> and<00:04:56.610> icon

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
here let me just highlight it and icon

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.909 
here let me just highlight it and icon
so<00:04:57.389> what<00:04:57.960> we're<00:04:58.050> going<00:04:58.139> to<00:04:58.199> do<00:04:58.319> to<00:04:58.620> put<00:04:58.830> this

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
so what we're going to do to put this

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.249 
so what we're going to do to put this
email<00:04:59.340> address<00:04:59.610> inside<00:05:00.150> a<00:05:00.210> natural<00:05:00.690> image<00:05:01.050> on

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
email address inside a natural image on

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.170 
email address inside a natural image on
our<00:05:01.379> page<00:05:01.680> because<00:05:02.190> we<00:05:02.280> can't<00:05:02.550> use<00:05:02.819> this<00:05:03.030> at

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
our page because we can't use this at

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.089 
our page because we can't use this at
the<00:05:03.240> moment<00:05:03.389> as<00:05:03.690> it<00:05:03.840> is<00:05:04.020> well<00:05:04.710> that's<00:05:04.830> where

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
the moment as it is well that's where

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.339 
the moment as it is well that's where
index<00:05:05.430> dot<00:05:05.639> PHP<00:05:05.669> come<00:05:06.360> comes<00:05:06.810> in<00:05:06.960> like<00:05:07.169> I

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
index dot PHP come comes in like I

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.499 
index dot PHP come comes in like I
mentioned<00:05:07.680> earlier<00:05:08.039> I'm<00:05:08.430> going<00:05:08.490> to<00:05:08.909> set<00:05:09.180> up<00:05:09.330> a

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509 
mentioned earlier I'm going to set up a

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.969 
mentioned earlier I'm going to set up a
a<00:05:09.690> profile<00:05:10.349> page<00:05:10.590> if<00:05:10.860> you<00:05:11.009> like<00:05:12.500> with<00:05:13.500> exactly

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
a profile page if you like with exactly

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.279 
a profile page if you like with exactly
how<00:05:14.460> I<00:05:14.490> do<00:05:14.759> it<00:05:15.090> normally<00:05:15.509> set<00:05:15.750> what<00:05:15.870> I<00:05:15.900> wouldn't

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
how I do it normally set what I wouldn't

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:17.839 
how I do it normally set what I wouldn't
do<00:05:16.409> it<00:05:16.440> normally<00:05:16.830> like<00:05:17.009> this<00:05:17.250> but<00:05:17.490> let's<00:05:17.699> say

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
do it normally like this but let's say

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.170 
do it normally like this but let's say
we've<00:05:18.000> got<00:05:18.030> a<00:05:18.810> name<00:05:19.409> and<00:05:19.770> that<00:05:20.520> equals<00:05:20.909> some

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
we've got a name and that equals some

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.640 
we've got a name and that equals some
dynamic<00:05:21.719> value<00:05:22.169> so<00:05:22.409> it<00:05:22.500> could<00:05:22.650> be<00:05:22.770> Alex<00:05:24.650> then

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
dynamic value so it could be Alex then

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.350 
dynamic value so it could be Alex then
we'll<00:05:25.889> break<00:05:26.099> down<00:05:26.400> a<00:05:26.430> couple<00:05:26.669> more<00:05:26.909> times<00:05:27.090> and

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
we'll break down a couple more times and

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.260 
we'll break down a couple more times and
we'll<00:05:27.479> say<00:05:27.659> email<00:05:28.319> or<00:05:29.039> break<00:05:29.310> down<00:05:29.580> now<00:05:30.060> what

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
we'll say email or break down now what

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.909 
we'll say email or break down now what
we<00:05:30.360> want<00:05:30.569> to<00:05:30.659> do<00:05:30.779> is<00:05:30.900> we<00:05:31.020> want<00:05:31.229> to<00:05:31.319> output<00:05:31.529> this

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
we want to do is we want to output this

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.180 
we want to do is we want to output this
image<00:05:32.370> from<00:05:32.610> generate<00:05:33.090> PHP<00:05:33.840> in<00:05:34.050> here<00:05:34.469> so<00:05:35.069> how

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
image from generate PHP in here so how

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.830 
image from generate PHP in here so how
we're<00:05:35.310> going<00:05:35.400> to<00:05:35.490> go<00:05:35.550> about<00:05:35.699> doing<00:05:35.759> that<00:05:36.150> well

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
we're going to go about doing that well

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.899 
we're going to go about doing that well
we're<00:05:37.529> going<00:05:37.680> to<00:05:37.740> create<00:05:37.949> an<00:05:38.039> image<00:05:38.370> like<00:05:38.699> we

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
we're going to create an image like we

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:42.379 
we're going to create an image like we
would<00:05:39.090> in<00:05:39.409> also<00:05:40.409> not<00:05:40.650> double<00:05:40.889> equals<00:05:41.190> an<00:05:41.909> image

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
would in also not double equals an image

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.659 
would in also not double equals an image
like<00:05:42.659> we<00:05:42.840> normally<00:05:43.050> would<00:05:43.289> in<00:05:43.500> HTML<00:05:44.069> and<00:05:44.279> we'd

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
like we normally would in HTML and we'd

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:48.670 
like we normally would in HTML and we'd
normally<00:05:44.849> say<00:05:45.330> something<00:05:45.779> like<00:05:46.340> image<00:05:47.569> jpg

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
normally say something like image jpg

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.510 
normally say something like image jpg
here<00:05:49.680> or<00:05:50.419> email<00:05:51.419> jpg<00:05:52.409> or<00:05:52.560> something<00:05:52.979> but<00:05:53.400> what

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
here or email jpg or something but what

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.189 
here or email jpg or something but what
we<00:05:53.669> can<00:05:53.789> actually<00:05:54.270> do<00:05:54.509> that<00:05:54.750> you<00:05:54.840> might<00:05:55.020> not

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
we can actually do that you might not

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.290 
we can actually do that you might not
already<00:05:55.379> know<00:05:55.650> is<00:05:55.949> we<00:05:56.430> can<00:05:56.639> insert<00:05:57.120> the

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
already know is we can insert the

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.749 
already know is we can insert the
contents<00:05:57.870> of<00:05:57.960> a<00:05:58.080> file<00:05:58.409> in<00:05:58.680> here<00:05:58.710> and<00:05:59.159> because

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 
contents of a file in here and because

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.059 
contents of a file in here and because
generate<00:06:00.240> PHP<00:06:00.960> is<00:06:01.050> being<00:06:01.289> processed<00:06:01.590> as<00:06:02.039> an

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:02.069 
generate PHP is being processed as an

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:04.700 
generate PHP is being processed as an
image<00:06:02.580> type<00:06:02.940> it<00:06:03.330> will<00:06:03.870> actually<00:06:04.139> pick<00:06:04.680> up

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
image type it will actually pick up

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.309 
image type it will actually pick up
inside<00:06:05.340> image<00:06:05.669> source<00:06:06.060> as<00:06:06.330> an<00:06:06.659> image<00:06:06.900> itself

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:07.319 
inside image source as an image itself

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:09.439 
inside image source as an image itself
so<00:06:08.009> what<00:06:08.129> we<00:06:08.250> can<00:06:08.340> do<00:06:08.490> is<00:06:08.610> we<00:06:08.729> can<00:06:08.849> say<00:06:09.029> generate

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
so what we can do is we can say generate

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.469 
so what we can do is we can say generate
dot<00:06:09.629> PHP<00:06:10.520> and<00:06:11.520> what<00:06:11.699> that's<00:06:11.879> going<00:06:12.029> to<00:06:12.090> do<00:06:12.270> now

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
dot PHP and what that's going to do now

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.390 
dot PHP and what that's going to do now
obviously<00:06:13.080> we<00:06:13.169> haven't<00:06:13.440> specified<00:06:13.650> an<00:06:14.039> image

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
obviously we haven't specified an image

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.550 
obviously we haven't specified an image
so<00:06:14.669> this<00:06:15.479> part<00:06:15.779> of<00:06:15.840> our<00:06:15.930> code<00:06:16.229> is<00:06:16.379> going<00:06:16.500> to

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
so this part of our code is going to

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.820 
so this part of our code is going to
take<00:06:16.800> action<00:06:18.110> so<00:06:19.110> let's<00:06:19.289> go<00:06:19.379> ahead<00:06:19.710> and

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
take action so let's go ahead and

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.890 
take action so let's go ahead and
refresh<00:06:19.919> the<00:06:20.279> page<00:06:20.460> the<00:06:20.789> index<00:06:21.330> page<00:06:21.599> this

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
refresh the page the index page this

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.469 
refresh the page the index page this
time<00:06:22.110> not<00:06:22.379> the<00:06:22.529> generate<00:06:22.889> dot<00:06:23.039> PHP<00:06:23.550> page<00:06:23.580> so

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
time not the generate dot PHP page so

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:25.990 
time not the generate dot PHP page so
index<00:06:24.960> dot<00:06:25.169> PHP

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
index dot PHP

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.960 
index dot PHP
you<00:06:26.780> can<00:06:26.960> see<00:06:27.140> that<00:06:27.290> we've<00:06:27.380> got<00:06:27.410> name<00:06:28.190> Alex<00:06:28.790> and

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
you can see that we've got name Alex and

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.600 
you can see that we've got name Alex and
an<00:06:29.030> email<00:06:29.480> no<00:06:29.810> email<00:06:30.170> specified<00:06:30.740> so<00:06:31.370> now

inside<00:06:32.240> image<00:06:32.750> source<00:06:33.080> we<00:06:33.440> can<00:06:33.620> now<00:06:33.860> start<00:06:33.920> pre

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
inside image source we can now start pre

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.830 
inside image source we can now start pre
defining<00:06:35.380> post<00:06:36.380> or<00:06:36.710> using<00:06:37.550> get<00:06:37.760> variables<00:06:38.360> so

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.990 
going to talk about it briefly if you've
dealt<00:07:42.380> with<00:07:42.500> databases<00:07:43.070> and<00:07:43.430> retrieving

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 
dealt with databases and retrieving

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.540 
dealt with databases and retrieving
values<00:07:44.450> from<00:07:44.660> databases<00:07:45.500> what<00:07:46.130> we<00:07:46.250> could<00:07:46.400> do

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:46.550 
values from databases what we could do

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.580 
values from databases what we could do
is<00:07:46.669> we<00:07:46.700> could<00:07:46.940> say<00:07:47.150> email<00:07:47.750> equals<00:07:48.320> and<00:07:48.500> we

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:48.590 
is we could say email equals and we

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.980 
is we could say email equals and we
could<00:07:48.740> maybe<00:07:48.919> supply<00:07:49.430> a<00:07:49.460> user<00:07:50.060> ID<00:07:50.390> here

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:50.990 
could maybe supply a user ID here

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.290 
could maybe supply a user ID here
instead<00:07:51.470> now<00:07:52.160> that<00:07:52.340> user<00:07:52.610> ID<00:07:52.910> might

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:53.300 
instead now that user ID might

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.780 
instead now that user ID might
correspond<00:07:53.990> to<00:07:54.080> a<00:07:54.169> value<00:07:54.260> in<00:07:54.830> a<00:07:54.919> database<00:07:55.460> in

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:55.790 
correspond to a value in a database in

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.409 
correspond to a value in a database in
which<00:07:55.850> it<00:07:56.570> an<00:07:56.750> email<00:07:57.050> address<00:07:57.169> is<00:07:57.500> stored<00:07:58.419> in

00:07:59.409 --> 00:07:59.419 
which it an email address is stored in

00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:01.240 
which it an email address is stored in
fact<00:07:59.810> let's<00:07:59.990> go<00:08:00.110> ahead<00:08:00.350> and<00:08:00.470> quickly<00:08:00.800> make<00:08:01.100> an

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:01.250 
fact let's go ahead and quickly make an

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.620 
fact let's go ahead and quickly make an
example<00:08:01.580> and<00:08:02.060> we're<00:08:02.210> going<00:08:02.330> to<00:08:02.360> need<00:08:02.510> to

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:02.630 
example and we're going to need to

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.390 
example and we're going to need to
connect<00:08:02.870> to<00:08:02.990> our<00:08:03.080> database<00:08:03.229> but<00:08:03.830> if<00:08:04.070> you've

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 
connect to our database but if you've

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.680 
connect to our database but if you've
already<00:08:04.490> look<00:08:04.850> at--look<00:08:05.270> to<00:08:05.419> that<00:08:05.540> you<00:08:05.660> should

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:05.690 
already look at--look to that you should

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.800 
already look at--look to that you should
be<00:08:05.960> comfortable<00:08:06.229> with<00:08:06.620> this
