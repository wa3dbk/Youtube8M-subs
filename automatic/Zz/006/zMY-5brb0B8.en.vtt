well I started working with cheetahs

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.740 
well I started working with cheetahs
back<00:01:14.110> in<00:01:14.400> 1974<00:01:15.400> and<00:01:15.850> I<00:01:16.090> was<00:01:16.240> in<00:01:16.330> a<00:01:16.390> wildlife

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
park in Oregon and I was very interested

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.740 
park in Oregon and I was very interested
in<00:01:20.680> learning<00:01:20.740> about<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.520> cheetah<00:01:21.759> and<00:01:21.880> as<00:01:22.330> I

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
in learning about the cheetah and as I

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.930 
in learning about the cheetah and as I
wrote<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.140> people<00:01:23.290> around<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.800> world<00:01:23.979> I<00:01:24.340> found

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
wrote to people around the world I found

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.550 
wrote to people around the world I found
out<00:01:25.149> that<00:01:25.300> not<00:01:25.450> very<00:01:25.509> many<00:01:25.750> people<00:01:25.960> knew<00:01:26.530> very

out that not very many people knew very
much<00:01:26.950> about<00:01:27.220> cheetahs<00:01:27.670> that<00:01:28.570> although

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
much about cheetahs that although

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.030 
much about cheetahs that although
cheetahs<00:01:31.630> had<00:01:31.780> been<00:01:31.960> living<00:01:32.170> with<00:01:32.290> humans<00:01:32.740> for

cheetahs had been living with humans for
about<00:01:33.820> 6,000<00:01:34.690> years<00:01:34.990> we<00:01:35.590> found<00:01:35.890> that<00:01:36.100> very<00:01:36.550> few

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
about 6,000 years we found that very few

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.850 
about 6,000 years we found that very few

breeding<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.850> numbers<00:01:40.180> were<00:01:40.360> declining

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
breeding the numbers were declining

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.410 
breeding the numbers were declining
worldwide<00:01:41.530> and<00:01:41.979> nobody<00:01:42.790> was<00:01:42.880> spending<00:01:43.240> any

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
worldwide and nobody was spending any

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.890 
worldwide and nobody was spending any
time<00:01:43.510> actually<00:01:44.260> looking<00:01:45.100> at<00:01:45.250> how<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.700> save<00:01:46.630> the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
time actually looking at how to save the

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.800 
time actually looking at how to save the
species<00:01:47.170> especially<00:01:47.710> in<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.220> wild<00:01:48.610> so<00:01:49.360> I

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
species especially in the wild so I

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.890 
species especially in the wild so I
became<00:01:50.770> very<00:01:50.979> involved<00:01:51.640> with<00:01:51.940> it<00:01:52.180> I<00:01:52.360> came<00:01:52.690> to

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
became very involved with it I came to

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.700 
became very involved with it I came to
Namibia<00:01:53.140> here<00:01:53.530> first<00:01:53.799> in<00:01:54.240> 1977<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:56.020> do<00:01:56.260> a<00:01:56.290> study

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
Namibia here first in 1977 to do a study

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.740 
Namibia here first in 1977 to do a study
and<00:01:56.950> research<00:01:57.100> project<00:01:57.850> on<00:01:57.970> cheetahs<00:01:58.510> and

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
and research project on cheetahs and

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.570 
and research project on cheetahs and
that's<00:01:59.560> where<00:01:59.770> I<00:01:59.799> learned<00:02:00.010> about<00:02:00.280> the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
that's where I learned about the

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.179 
that's where I learned about the
conflict<00:02:01.210> between<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:02.170> farmers<00:02:02.680> and

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
conflict between the farmers and

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.630 
conflict between the farmers and
cheetahs<00:02:03.909> and<00:02:04.540> I<00:02:05.350> realised<00:02:05.830> that<00:02:06.100> something

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
cheetahs and I realised that something

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.639 
cheetahs and I realised that something
needed<00:02:06.939> to<00:02:07.090> be<00:02:07.180> done<00:02:07.360> to<00:02:07.570> help<00:02:07.689> save<00:02:08.049> the<00:02:08.080> wild

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
needed to be done to help save the wild

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.759 
needed to be done to help save the wild
cheetah<00:02:09.130> so<00:02:10.060> I<00:02:10.450> kept<00:02:10.840> coming<00:02:11.019> back<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.530> forth

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
cheetah so I kept coming back and forth

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.070 
cheetah so I kept coming back and forth
to<00:02:12.010> Namibia<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.700> realized<00:02:13.420> that<00:02:13.600> in<00:02:13.780> order<00:02:13.930> to

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
to Namibia and realized that in order to

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.979 
to Namibia and realized that in order to
do<00:02:14.320> something<00:02:14.799> that<00:02:15.370> I<00:02:15.790> needed<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.390> move<00:02:16.570> here

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
do something that I needed to move here

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.770 
do something that I needed to move here
and<00:02:17.080> actually<00:02:17.980> address<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:19.120> problem<00:02:19.630> with

and actually address the problem with

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.020 
and actually address the problem with
