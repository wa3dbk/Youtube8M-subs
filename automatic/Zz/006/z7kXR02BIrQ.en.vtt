you've got the tripod mount and the
lanyard<00:01:03.070> fixture<00:01:04.070> on<00:01:04.280> there<00:01:05.260> then<00:01:06.260> here<00:01:06.799> we've

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
lanyard fixture on there then here we've

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.569 
lanyard fixture on there then here we've
got<00:01:07.189> where<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:08.030> SD<00:01:08.450> card<00:01:08.479> goes<00:01:09.079> in<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:09.650> there

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579 
got where the SD card goes in and there

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.440 
got where the SD card goes in and there
she<00:01:10.790> is<00:01:12.520> normally<00:01:13.520> there<00:01:13.729> would<00:01:13.759> be<00:01:13.880> a<00:01:14.030> battery

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
she is normally there would be a battery

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.870 
she is normally there would be a battery
underneath<00:01:14.930> it<00:01:15.110> but<00:01:15.400> this<00:01:16.400> has<00:01:16.579> got<00:01:16.790> an

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.770 
chuffed with and I was quite impressed
with<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:25.950> actually<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.460> be<00:02:26.490> honest<00:02:26.820> compared

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
with it actually to be honest compared

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.890 
with it actually to be honest compared
with<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.620> zeal<00:02:29.220> x3<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:29.970> thought<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.780> the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
with the zeal x3 I thought that the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.260 
with the zeal x3 I thought that the
glare<00:02:31.140> shield<00:02:31.380> did<00:02:31.710> a<00:02:31.740> really<00:02:32.040> good<00:02:32.250> job<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.790> I

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
glare shield did a really good job and I

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.120 
glare shield did a really good job and I
would<00:02:33.510> assume<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.320> little<00:02:34.560> thing

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
would assume that that little thing

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.350 
would assume that that little thing
there<00:02:35.430> is<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.480> sensor<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.410> helps<00:02:37.770> to<00:02:37.920> gauge

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
there is the sensor that helps to gauge

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.600 
there is the sensor that helps to gauge
the<00:02:39.360> light<00:02:39.630> in<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.680> will<00:02:40.800> do<00:02:41.580> the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
the light in so that it will do the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.360 
the light in so that it will do the
automatic<00:02:42.300> glare<00:02:42.750> shield<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.740> we<00:02:43.980> know<00:02:44.160> what

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
automatic glare shield so we know what

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.540 
automatic glare shield so we know what
the<00:02:44.460> share<00:02:44.700> button<00:02:45.030> does<00:02:45.860> so<00:02:46.860> let's<00:02:47.160> see<00:02:47.370> what

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
the share button does so let's see what

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.630 
the share button does so let's see what
this<00:02:47.670> button<00:02:47.910> does<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.570> swaps<00:02:49.140> between<00:02:49.640> the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
this button does this swaps between the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.050 
this button does this swaps between the
video<00:02:51.210> option<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.680> press<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:53.730> then

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
video option and you press it and then

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.870 
video option and you press it and then
it<00:02:54.210> puts<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.600> two<00:02:54.900> steals<00:02:55.260> now<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:56.220> think<00:02:56.580> it's

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
it puts you two steals now I think it's

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.060 
it puts you two steals now I think it's
only<00:02:57.120> 5<00:02:57.510> megapixels<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.410> you've<00:02:58.560> got<00:02:58.830> I

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
only 5 megapixels that you've got I

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.760 
only 5 megapixels that you've got I
think<00:02:59.760> the<00:03:00.030> effects<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:01.200> can<00:03:01.440> use<00:03:01.620> the

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
think the effects you can use the

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.420 
think the effects you can use the
effects<00:03:02.160> in<00:03:02.400> both<00:03:03.200> settings<00:03:04.200> then<00:03:04.980> we<00:03:05.160> have

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
effects in both settings then we have

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.790 
effects in both settings then we have
the<00:03:05.610> play<00:03:05.880> button<00:03:06.830> so<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:08.070> pressed<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.550> once

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
the play button so I pressed it once

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.440 
the play button so I pressed it once
press<00:03:10.800> it<00:03:10.950> again<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:12.000> gives<00:03:12.210> you<00:03:12.330> that

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
press it again and it gives you that

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.290 
press it again and it gives you that
option<00:03:12.740> press<00:03:13.740> it<00:03:13.860> again<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.190> returns<00:03:15.060> to

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
option press it again it returns to

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.170 
option press it again it returns to
their<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:16.100> basically<00:03:17.100> you<00:03:17.550> sort<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:17.880> have<00:03:18.030> the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
their so basically you sort of have the

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.370 
their so basically you sort of have the
option<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:18.860> go<00:03:19.860> through<00:03:20.190> various<00:03:20.670> different

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
option to go through various different

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.170 
option to go through various different
videos<00:03:22.380> that<00:03:22.710> you've<00:03:22.860> recorded<00:03:23.250> which<00:03:23.970> is

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
videos that you've recorded which is

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.950 
videos that you've recorded which is
quite<00:03:25.010> groovy<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.910> there<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.150> go<00:03:27.240> that's<00:03:27.570> the

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
quite groovy so there you go that's the

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.760 
quite groovy so there you go that's the
play<00:03:28.860> button<00:03:29.330> next<00:03:30.330> up<00:03:30.480> we<00:03:30.660> have<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:31.170> delete

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
play button next up we have the delete

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.310 
play button next up we have the delete
button<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.870> can<00:03:34.970> basically<00:03:35.990> you<00:03:36.990> put

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
button so you can basically you put

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.870 
button so you can basically you put
cancel<00:03:38.040> delete<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:39.510> let's<00:03:40.080> see<00:03:40.700> delete<00:03:41.700> that

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
cancel delete so let's see delete that

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.600 
cancel delete so let's see delete that
picture<00:03:42.180> it's<00:03:42.810> deleted<00:03:43.260> then<00:03:44.010> goes<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.280> the

button and it brings you into different

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.810 
button and it brings you into different
effects<00:04:06.360> I<00:04:06.540> am<00:04:07.320> going<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.590> do<00:04:07.680> a<00:04:07.740> video<00:04:07.950> showing

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
effects I am going to do a video showing

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.210 
effects I am going to do a video showing
you<00:04:09.060> what<00:04:09.420> these<00:04:10.020> effects<00:04:10.440> are<00:04:10.620> like<00:04:10.800> they're

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
you what these effects are like they're

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.740 
you what these effects are like they're
probably<00:04:11.460> going<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.760> be<00:04:11.910> quite<00:04:12.240> similar<00:04:12.720> to

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
probably going to be quite similar to

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.560 
probably going to be quite similar to
the<00:04:13.470> play<00:04:14.100> touch<00:04:14.400> well<00:04:15.030> we'll<00:04:15.180> have<00:04:15.270> to<00:04:15.360> wait

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
the play touch well we'll have to wait

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.330 
the play touch well we'll have to wait
and<00:04:15.630> see<00:04:15.780> on<00:04:15.930> that<00:04:16.049> one<00:04:16.290> then<00:04:16.980> you've<00:04:17.130> got<00:04:17.250> the

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
and see on that one then you've got the

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.060 
and see on that one then you've got the
underwater<00:04:17.760> correction<00:04:18.479> on<00:04:18.660> or<00:04:19.260> off<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.739> am

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
underwater correction on or off I am

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.090 
underwater correction on or off I am
hoping<00:04:20.520> to<00:04:20.669> do<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:20.790> bath<00:04:21.060> test<00:04:21.419> today<00:04:21.919> so<00:04:22.919> will

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
hoping to do a bath test today so will

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.660 
hoping to do a bath test today so will
be<00:04:23.190> added

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
be added

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.330 
be added
stell<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.690> underwater<00:04:25.410> correction<00:04:25.980> as<00:04:26.100> well

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
stell the underwater correction as well

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.780 
stell the underwater correction as well
so<00:04:26.640> that<00:04:26.670> be<00:04:26.850> groovy<00:04:27.290> video<00:04:28.290> resolution<00:04:29.130> so

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
so that be groovy video resolution so

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.310 
so that be groovy video resolution so
basically<00:04:30.420> you've<00:04:30.600> got<00:04:30.840> your<00:04:31.140> wvga<00:04:32.090> 720p<00:04:33.320> 30

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
basically you've got your wvga 720p 30

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.920 
basically you've got your wvga 720p 30
and<00:04:34.590> 60<00:04:34.950> frames<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.460> 1080p<00:04:35.880> there<00:04:36.540> is<00:04:36.720> no

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
and 60 frames and 1080p there is no

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.520 
and 60 frames and 1080p there is no
setting<00:04:37.290> for<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:38.580> camera<00:04:39.150> so<00:04:39.750> far<00:04:40.050> that<00:04:40.410> I've

that format memory card I wanna do that
over<00:05:50.730> and<00:05:51.540> then<00:05:51.870> about<00:05:52.170> so<00:05:52.920> let's<00:05:53.220> have<00:05:53.370> a<00:05:53.430> look

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
over and then about so let's have a look

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.440 
over and then about so let's have a look
at<00:05:53.640> the<00:05:53.790> about<00:05:54.950> 1.01<00:05:55.950> firmware<00:05:56.670> which<00:05:57.030> i<00:05:57.390> think

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
at the about 1.01 firmware which i think

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.380 
at the about 1.01 firmware which i think
is<00:05:57.750> the<00:05:57.900> latest<00:05:58.320> and<00:05:58.620> the<00:05:59.580> software<00:05:59.910> version

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
is the latest and the software version

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.790 
is the latest and the software version
so<00:06:00.810> there<00:06:00.930> you<00:06:00.960> go<00:06:01.050> that's<00:06:01.290> a<00:06:01.440> little<00:06:01.650> walk

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
so there you go that's a little walk

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.570 
so there you go that's a little walk

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
about whether it's actually going to

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.860

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
comparison between the two zx5 and

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.410 
comparison between the two zx5 and
there's<00:07:01.590> x3<00:07:02.130> and<00:07:02.400> I'll<00:07:02.460> put<00:07:02.700> them<00:07:02.820> in<00:07:03.000> I'll
