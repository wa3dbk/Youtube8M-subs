panel<00:05:26.539> defined<00:05:26.870> so<00:05:27.770> we<00:05:27.949> can<00:05:28.159> collapse<00:05:28.520> and

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 
panel defined so we can collapse and

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:30.730 
panel defined so we can collapse and
expand<00:05:29.120> by<00:05:29.270> default<00:05:29.690> when<00:05:30.110> we've<00:05:30.259> opened<00:05:30.680> the

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
expand by default when we've opened the

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.930 
expand by default when we've opened the
page<00:05:30.889> file<00:05:31.069> system<00:05:31.250> if<00:05:31.400> you<00:05:31.490> expand<00:05:31.819> it

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
page file system if you expand it

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.659 
page file system if you expand it
because<00:05:32.300> we<00:05:32.479> have<00:05:32.690> given<00:05:33.440> a<00:05:33.529> class<00:05:33.800> here<00:05:34.130> in<00:05:34.340> if

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
because we have given a class here in if

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.480 
because we have given a class here in if
we<00:05:35.029> remove<00:05:35.509> this<00:05:35.750> in<00:05:35.990> class<00:05:36.440> here<00:05:36.860> you<00:05:37.310> will

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
we remove this in class here you will

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.279 
we remove this in class here you will
see<00:05:37.759> that<00:05:38.029> it<00:05:38.360> won't<00:05:38.659> be<00:05:38.840> it<00:05:39.139> would<00:05:39.259> be

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
see that it won't be it would be

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.290 
see that it won't be it would be
collapsed<00:05:39.800> by<00:05:39.949> default<00:05:40.310> and<00:05:40.610> you<00:05:40.639> can<00:05:40.759> still

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
collapsed by default and you can still

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.450 
collapsed by default and you can still
collapse<00:05:41.569> and<00:05:41.810> open<00:05:42.020> it<00:05:42.139> but<00:05:42.740> we<00:05:42.979> will<00:05:43.279> the

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
collapse and open it but we will the

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.120 
collapse and open it but we will the
first<00:05:43.729> section<00:05:44.120> we<00:05:44.389> will<00:05:44.569> keep<00:05:45.469> it<00:05:45.680> open<00:05:45.800> by

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
first section we will keep it open by

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.890 
first section we will keep it open by
default<00:05:46.430> and<00:05:46.759> the<00:05:47.000> rest<00:05:47.180> of<00:05:47.330> the<00:05:47.419> section<00:05:47.779> we

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
default and the rest of the section we

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.249 
default and the rest of the section we
will<00:05:48.020> be<00:05:48.469> collapsed<00:05:49.779> then<00:05:50.779> we<00:05:50.900> will<00:05:51.020> run<00:05:51.169> the

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:51.259 
will be collapsed then we will run the

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:53.200 
will be collapsed then we will run the
page<00:05:51.440> first<00:05:51.650> one<00:05:51.889> so<00:05:52.610> what<00:05:52.699> we<00:05:52.789> need<00:05:52.909> to<00:05:52.969> do<00:05:53.120> is

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
page first one so what we need to do is

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.850 
page first one so what we need to do is
let's<00:05:53.360> define<00:05:53.569> two<00:05:53.750> more<00:05:53.930> section<00:05:54.319> so<00:05:54.469> simply

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
let's define two more section so simply

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.540 
let's define two more section so simply
just<00:05:55.009> copy<00:05:55.370> this<00:05:55.639> panel<00:05:56.150> penalty<00:05:56.539> for<00:05:56.810> tag<00:05:57.550> and

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
just copy this panel penalty for tag and

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:04.739 
just copy this panel penalty for tag and
we<00:05:59.389> will<00:05:59.569> pass<00:06:00.380> it<00:06:00.620> two<00:06:00.740> more<00:06:00.889> times

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:04.749 

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:07.679 

but<00:06:05.319> also<00:06:05.499> as<00:06:06.009> we<00:06:06.039> need<00:06:06.489> to<00:06:06.610> do<00:06:06.759> is<00:06:06.999> hear<00:06:07.419> that

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:07.689 
but also as we need to do is hear that

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:10.979 
but also as we need to do is hear that
we<00:06:08.319> also<00:06:08.529> in<00:06:08.949> this<00:06:09.099> second<00:06:09.759> we<00:06:10.569> will<00:06:10.719> change

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:10.989 
we also in this second we will change

00:06:10.989 --> 00:06:13.499 
we also in this second we will change
you're<00:06:11.289> saying<00:06:11.529> question<00:06:11.979> two<00:06:12.189> and<00:06:12.399> this<00:06:13.329> will

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:13.509 
you're saying question two and this will

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:18.929 
you're saying question two and this will
become<00:06:13.659> section<00:06:14.439> two<00:06:16.919> okay<00:06:17.919> and<00:06:18.189> then<00:06:18.519> the

00:06:18.929 --> 00:06:18.939 
become section two okay and then the

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:20.699 
become section two okay and then the
question<00:06:19.569> three<00:06:19.779> and<00:06:19.989> this<00:06:20.079> will<00:06:20.229> become<00:06:20.349> here

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:20.709 
question three and this will become here

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:22.169 
question three and this will become here
section<00:06:21.069> three<00:06:21.249> because<00:06:21.489> this<00:06:21.669> is<00:06:21.819> the<00:06:21.939> third

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:22.179
