00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.900
 Desert Oreo with yogurt and raspberry 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.600
 for this recipe we will need the following 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.540
 150 gr Oreo biscuits 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.660
 120 gr raspberry 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.380
 200 ml liquid whipped cream 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.020
 and 120 g of Greek yoghurt 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.560
 I'll put biscuits in a kitchen robot 

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:43.689
 I got a breadcrumb 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.000
 we transfer them to a bowl 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.140
 beat whipped cream with a mixer 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.000
 we start to beat at a slow speed and then we get bigger 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.260
 whipped cream is ready 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.900
 so it has to look 

00:01:10.753 --> 00:01:12.753
 we transfer the cream into a bowl 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.100
 I'll stop by crackling biscuits 

00:01:21.026 --> 00:01:23.026
 2 spoons for decorating 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.060
 I will put 

00:01:25.705 --> 00:01:27.705
 2 full spoons 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.560
 in whipped cream 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.240
 and we will mix 

00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:39.411
 with upward movements 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.380
 and now I will add a little bit 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.520
 until I finish the yogurt 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.380
 we will incorporate it into whipped cream 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.600
 I will start to put on biscuit bread 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.560
 I divided the composition into 3 glasses 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.380
 and now I will lay the raspberries 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.000
 on the edges of the glass 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.300
 and now 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.820
 I put the cream in a pose 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.540
 and I will fill the glasses 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.160
 now we'll make some chocolate hearts 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.620
 I leave the hearts for a few minutes aside 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.360
 and we take care of our desert 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.020
 I'll put the biscuit breadcrumbs 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.543
 all around 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.080
 I will pour the desert with a raspberry raspberry 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.960
 chocolate hearts can be taken from the paper 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.740
 but you have to wash it with cold water before it's not too hot 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.000
 because chocolate will melt very quickly 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.650
 our desert is ready 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.260
 and put it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes after which it can be served 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.120
 these were the 7th episode of a series of sweets and desserts without baking 

00:05:15.412 --> 00:05:17.412
