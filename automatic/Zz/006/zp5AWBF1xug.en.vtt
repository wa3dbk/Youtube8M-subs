00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.750
 hello again this video makes me a lot 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.200
 constitution because it's going to be the first 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:23.060
 part of what I had already commented that 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:23.060
 is that I move and the house nuanced 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.090
 then we are doing a super 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.410
 reform starting with the room 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.450
 where are we going to sleep then what am I going to 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.780
 show you how it is more or less 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.100
 missing furniture back bed part 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.100
 normal special 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.900
 and nothing starts to be taught with a 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.900
 general view now either 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.220
 we started here is the door that 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.220
 right now we are thinking whether to paint it 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.830
 of white also or not only is made 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.010
 the shit over here there's a lot of cdc shit 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.650
 back then the walls as they were 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.030
 before the panels the wall is not 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.150
 we were able to save and that therefore 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.060
 has paper that good or not so bad 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.830
 well it was full of sulfur stuck with 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.720
 glue that we had to scratch 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.690
 therefore we have made many holes 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.080
 on the wall therefore it has not been possible 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.270
 paint for really being very bad 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.509
 so we decided to make a wall with 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.300
 paper and the others as you will see that the 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.820
 we paint in white 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.070
 changes showing the switches that 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.740
 They were very old and we decided to put 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:50.540
 these in the middle of the bed 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.360
 well here is where you will go to bed in 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.740
 middle of the two switches and here 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:01.200
 you can see the paper more closely 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.390
 the paper makes like a blurred flower 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.490
 as a little faded and as if it were 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.220
 an old paper nothing that to me 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.580
 personally, I like it a lot 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.620
 we also put a few shades 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.069
 transparent white before not 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.310
 there was absolutely nothing and nothing that 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:25.260
 it's very good I'm going to pick it up and you're 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:29.019
 they are a little the views that I am going to have 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.200
 a field of something else that we did that 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.450
 why being open is fitting this 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.580
 furniture that was already in the room and 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.980
 painted white was this color 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.260
 before for price within we have 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.450
 left the same was this wood color 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.900
 clarito and we have painted it in color 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.900
 White 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.390
 this is the result there are ideas of a 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.520
 Shoemaker 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.520
 here the computer will go 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.959
 there you can also see the lack of 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.060
 the crime of the room finds out that 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.819
 I counted that there was that before and is that 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.670
 there was a double wooden ceiling so 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:16.120
 keep in mind that we were going to sweat for 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.099
 remove it good I 'm not my boy 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.709
 and finally I wanted to show you the 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.900
 lamp that we took that is this that 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.870
 it lights up a lot because the room 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.000
 in itself it was super dark before 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.280
 is the lamp I do not know if you can see it 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.299
 makes a drawing a bit because it is the same 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.299
 drawing you back 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:41.210
 That's all for nothing is going to get the 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.090
 second part of this video and at least 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:47.270
 this first hotel image so that 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.230
 You would see the work that I have been called and 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.230
 especially
