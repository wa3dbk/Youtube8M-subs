alright<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.180> let's<00:00:42.360> do<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> test<00:00:42.899> between<00:00:43.200> all

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
alright so let's do a test between all

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.930 
alright so let's do a test between all
of<00:00:43.890> these<00:00:44.040> three<00:00:44.340> phones<00:00:46.129> Sprint's<00:00:47.129> going

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
of these three phones Sprint's going

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.119 
of these three phones Sprint's going
AT&amp;T<00:00:48.809> going<00:00:49.379> Verizon<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:51.500> 3G<00:00:52.789> HSPA<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:55.129> 3G

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
AT&amp;T going Verizon going 3G HSPA and 3G

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.830 
AT&amp;T going Verizon going 3G HSPA and 3G
oh<00:00:59.539> I<00:01:00.539> should<00:01:00.809> probably<00:01:00.960> switch<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.590> one<00:01:01.800> two

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
oh I should probably switch this one two

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.789 
oh I should probably switch this one two
kilobytes<00:01:03.840> rather<00:01:04.320> than<00:01:04.559> megabits<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:06.799> then

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
kilobytes rather than megabits and then

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.859 
kilobytes rather than megabits and then
we<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.100> do<00:01:08.220> another<00:01:08.430> speed<00:01:08.729> test<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.360> megabits

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
we can do another speed test in megabits

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:20.310 
we can do another speed test in megabits
two

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.100 

all<00:01:21.320> right<00:01:23.530> so<00:01:24.530> that's<00:01:24.649> round<00:01:25.009> one<00:01:25.100> I'm<00:01:25.640> done

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
all right so that's round one I'm done

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.510 
all right so that's round one I'm done
and<00:01:27.110> you<00:01:27.170> change<00:01:27.439> this<00:01:27.619> one<00:01:27.799> really<00:01:28.039> fast<00:01:28.220> two

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
and you change this one really fast two

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.419 
and you change this one really fast two
kilobytes<00:01:28.820> oh<00:01:30.490> snap

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
kilobytes oh snap

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.919 
kilobytes oh snap
all<00:01:34.429> right<00:01:34.610> let's<00:01:35.000> restart<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.450> test

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
all right let's restart the test

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:41.219 
all right let's restart the test
sprint<00:01:36.619> going<00:01:38.170> AT&amp;T<00:01:39.170> straight<00:01:39.530> talk<00:01:39.710> going

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
sprint going AT&amp;T straight talk going

00:01:41.229 --> 00:02:03.460 
sprint going AT&amp;T straight talk going
see<00:01:42.229> red<00:01:42.860> pocket<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.429> Verizon<00:01:43.850> I'm<00:01:44.539> going

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.530 

so<00:02:04.070> as<00:02:04.160> you<00:02:04.310> can<00:02:04.430> see<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.850> Verizon<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:05.480> Sprint

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
so as you can see the Verizon and Sprint

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.770 
so as you can see the Verizon and Sprint
are<00:02:06.020> about<00:02:06.620> on<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.890> same<00:02:07.130> page<00:02:07.600> when<00:02:08.600> it<00:02:08.660> comes

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
are about on the same page when it comes

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.090 
are about on the same page when it comes
to<00:02:08.990> download<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:11.330> AT&amp;T<00:02:11.660> HSPA<00:02:12.470> which<00:02:12.740> I<00:02:12.860> pay

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
to download the AT&amp;T HSPA which I pay

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.430 
to download the AT&amp;T HSPA which I pay
significantly<00:02:13.820> more<00:02:14.060> for<00:02:14.360> is<00:02:14.570> a<00:02:14.600> lot<00:02:14.930> faster

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
significantly more for is a lot faster

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.130 
significantly more for is a lot faster
but<00:02:16.310> still<00:02:16.520> doesn't<00:02:16.730> touch<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.180> normal<00:02:17.510> HSPA

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
but still doesn't touch the normal HSPA

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.440 
but still doesn't touch the normal HSPA
and<00:02:18.260> 80<00:02:18.620> like<00:02:19.130> AT&amp;T<00:02:19.430> speeds<00:02:19.940> being<00:02:20.870> on<00:02:21.080> an<00:02:21.170> MVNO

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
and 80 like AT&amp;T speeds being on an MVNO

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.960 
and 80 like AT&amp;T speeds being on an MVNO
now<00:02:23.450> let's<00:02:23.630> go<00:02:23.720> change<00:02:23.960> it<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.880> megabits<00:02:25.880> per

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
now let's go change it to megabits per

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:38.880 
now let's go change it to megabits per
second<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:28.810> do<00:02:29.810> another<00:02:30.050> test<00:02:34.870> all<00:02:35.870> right

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:03:16.080 

sprint<00:02:39.890> go<00:02:41.170> AT&amp;T<00:02:42.520> go<00:02:43.570> Verizon<00:02:44.570> go

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.190 

all<00:03:17.090> right<00:03:17.330> so<00:03:17.450> as<00:03:17.570> if<00:03:17.720> it's<00:03:17.870> going<00:03:18.020> to<00:03:18.080> make<00:03:18.170> a

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
all right so as if it's going to make a

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.680 
all right so as if it's going to make a
difference<00:03:18.650> I'm<00:03:18.860> just<00:03:19.040> gonna<00:03:19.160> run<00:03:19.690> sprint

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
difference I'm just gonna run sprint

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.370 
difference I'm just gonna run sprint
alone<00:03:21.320> or<00:03:21.530> actually<00:03:22.690> let's<00:03:23.690> run<00:03:23.870> a<00:03:23.900> Verizon

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
alone or actually let's run a Verizon

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.130 
alone or actually let's run a Verizon
alone<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:24.860> see<00:03:25.730> if<00:03:25.850> it<00:03:25.970> changes<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.870> speed

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
alone and see if it changes the speed

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:42.100 
alone and see if it changes the speed
test

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:49.280 

all<00:03:43.110> right<00:03:43.290> so<00:03:43.530> not<00:03:43.920> really<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:48.170> won't<00:03:49.170> even

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
all right so not really I won't even

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.350 
all right so not really I won't even
bother<00:03:49.590> testing<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.340> other<00:03:50.489> to<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:50.760> but<00:03:51.239> as

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
bother testing the other to you but as

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.580 
bother testing the other to you but as
you<00:03:51.510> can<00:03:51.629> see<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:52.590> have<00:03:52.739> an<00:03:52.860> idea<00:03:53.129> of<00:03:53.430> how

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
you can see you have an idea of how

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.149 
you can see you have an idea of how
