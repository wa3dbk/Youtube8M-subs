Namaskar
Welcome to nishamadhulika.com

00:00:07.316 --> 00:00:12.920
Today we will prepare Fruit Custard which is a very delicious sweet dish.

00:00:13.504 --> 00:00:19.303
Whenever you crave for something cold and sweet after a meak, you can make this custard.

00:00:19.884 --> 00:00:23.051
It can also be served at a party.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:28.876
Ingredients required:

00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:32.603
Mangoes

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:33.558
Apples

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.471
Grapes

00:00:34.718 --> 00:00:35.996
Pomegranate

00:00:36.323 --> 00:00:49.095
Fruits can be chosen according to your likes, anything from pear, strawberry, musk melon etc.

00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:52.727
Whipped cream - 1 cup

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.991
Sugar - 3/4 cup

00:00:55.391 --> 00:00:59.312
Custard powder - a little more than 1/4 cup

00:00:59.713 --> 00:01:01.332
Milk - 3/4 cup

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.969
Milk (altogether) - 1 litre (to boil)

00:01:12.893 --> 00:01:15.417
Firstly we have to boil the milk.

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:18.349
Turn on the gas

00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:27.670
Until milk is boiled let us mix the custard powder in milk.

00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:34.931
Don't use hot/warm milk to mix dissolve this powder else lumps will be formed.

00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:40.086
Also cut the fruits and keep them ready.

00:01:41.106 --> 00:01:56.826
Put custard powder in milk and stir with a spoon to dissolve it till lumps disappear.

00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:02.649
A smooth mix is ready.

00:02:04.384 --> 00:02:07.281
Now cut the fruits.

00:02:07.545 --> 00:02:14.828
Break the grapes from their stems, remove the pomegranate seeds.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.654
Milk has come to boil so we will now prepare the custard.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.661
Simmer the gas, stir the custard mix once more (as it tends to sink at the base).

00:02:32.747 --> 00:02:36.350
Keep stirring, as you pour the custard mix into the milk.

00:02:38.135 --> 00:02:39.723
Also add sugar.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:53.758
Cook custard for 7-8 minutes while stirring continuously (stir using a spoon till the bottom preventing custard from sticking at the bottom).

00:02:54.104 --> 00:02:58.667
There will be a huge difference in taste if custard is stuck to the base of the utensil.

00:02:59.817 --> 00:03:05.539
Custard is ready, turn off the gas allowing custard to cool.

00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:10.038
Pour custard in a bowl, now that it is cooled.

00:03:12.418 --> 00:03:17.338
Firstly add the whipped cream to the custard

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:24.005
here we have taken plain cream, beaten it and made whipped cream which has become thick.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.549
Plain cream can also be used, but it is much better if the cream is  whipped to thicken

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:33.555
If you don't want to then no need to add cream, fruit custard will taste just as good.

00:03:34.336 --> 00:03:38.273
Adding cream enhances the taste of the custard.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.062
We have properly mixed the cream so let us add the fruits.

00:03:45.278 --> 00:04:07.746
Add grapes, apple, mango and
pomegranate seeds. Mix well.

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:14.785
We have used 4 different fruits with 4 different colours (red, green, white and yellow) for this custard.

00:04:14.898 --> 00:04:17.280
We can see that this combination is pleasing to the eyes.

00:04:17.544 --> 00:04:19.504
The custard is prepared.

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.158
Keep it in the fridge for 2 hours and then serve it chilled.

00:04:25.792 --> 00:04:31.824
Custard is ready and can be served.

00:04:33.252 --> 00:04:39.676
We must chill the custard before serving as the taste is heightened once custard is cold.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.545
Use some pomegranate seeds as garnish.

00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:47.781
Delicious Fruit Custard is ready

00:04:47.997 --> 00:04:56.091
it is very easy to make but we need to keep few things in mind:

00:04:56.443 --> 00:05:05.355
While mixing the custard in milk and cooking it then stir continuously with a spoon.

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:11.616
The spoon should reach the bottom of the utensil while stirring so that the custard does not stick at the base.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:18.399
If even a little custard sticks to the base the fruit custard will not taste good.

00:05:18.658 --> 00:05:22.857
Do not put water melon in custard as it contains a lot of juice.

00:05:22.846 --> 00:05:28.677
Hence, when added to the custard the watermelon makes it watery.

00:05:29.032 --> 00:05:31.636
You can put all kinds of fruits excluding watermelon.

00:05:32.155 --> 00:05:38.473
