00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:19.140
 I will teach how to download the game 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:22.510
 of deadpool by torrent fine but 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:33.380
 first let's go with the intro 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:35.920
 [Music] 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.920
 ah 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.299
 [Applause] 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.390
 good friends here we are with the 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.370
 tutorial how to download deadpool well 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.129
 the first thing they have to do is go to 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.860
 link of the description that I will leave it 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.500
 here is a page to download 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.800
 games that I use frequently for 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:04.180
 download with your tower well here what 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.520
 they do is enter and as you see here it comes out 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.770
 what platform is it for? 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.020
 and it goes well for the languages ​​in which 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.719
 it's also in Spanish it's worth it 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.039
 is in English but with subtitles of 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:19.390
 there all the options talk to 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:21.920
 subtitles in Spanish and everything ok weighs 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.829
 5.80 gigabytes 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.209
 the iso format that seems to use the 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:31.100
 montull so well we started with the 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:34.659
 tutorial well the first thing that we should 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.679
 do is give you the download torrent okay 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:41.539
 once in doing this you will need gutor 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:44.090
 I almost forgot I will be needing a 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.860
 torrent to make this step good them 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.099
 I will leave in the description a video of 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:53.160
 eat load it well they can open and 

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:54.729
 you will show them an idea gesture ok 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.689
 [Music] 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:03.290
 this good download can stop them 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.660
 let's say about four hours but 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.140
 I recommend that you like torrents 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.990
 continue the downloads and pass what 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.550
 pass the machine turn off or be clear 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.060
 no no it will download while you are 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.920
 off like this but once you 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.800
 I turn on the pc will not have to start 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.290
 again from scratch it will only resume the 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.480
 download as many already know what I say 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.590
 so they do not know well what I 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:35.870
 eliminated because I already have it not ok a 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:38.180
 once downloaded the file we go to the place 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.570
 where they downloaded it in my case is this 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.930
 and still will not have this folder will see 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.980
 this rar file we give right click 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.129
 extract here 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.849
 this appears to me because I already 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:56.640
 I have good but this may delay 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.950
 five minutes not much 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.580
 ok I canceled it because I already have it 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.740
 will leave this folder and now they will understand 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.770
 why do we need the daewoo tools 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.260
 we will need how you see this file is in 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.950
 actually the installer we open our 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.780
 of amounts and we drag the file here 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.940
 they already get the deadpool iso for 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.370
 then what we are going to do is 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.230
 find the file there I get this 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.930
 as I already told you this device 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.450
 I do it and in the first one and it comes out riding the 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.230
 image okey hope that this is something very 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.320
 short and on the computer already detected it as 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.500
 yes installation as my wild ok 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.690
 they give in to accept or good if here they 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.190
 appears in another language but Spanish lean 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.520
 well to me it appears by default in 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.930
 Spanish is good to accept next 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.990
 here they choose where they want next 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:58.440
 next I put you create access 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:04:00.990
 direct but good the following install 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.440
 I canceled it because obviously it's already 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:07.260
 slow so even though you believe not to 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.400
 a tutorial finish well what are we going 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:14.070
 to do now is to enter this folder 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.040
 in this and we copy the two files that 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.920
 jett and we go to the place where we installed 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.040
 from the pool 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:26.000
 in my case rafael tulle games ok comes in 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:29.030
 in this folder and they hit it ok 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.250
 I also get this good to you 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.660
 it will also come out and have been made 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.000
 this action for the following 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.000
 conflicts or alone or wanting to replace 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.689
 all ok 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.449
 and has already created already have 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:46.330

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.249
 I have served this tutorial a lot but 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.439
 It is not yet the farewell for 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:53.110
 people who always ask me for 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:55.299
 tutorials like this from harry potter les 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.569
 I will say that this tutorial also 

00:04:55.299 --> 00:05:00.969
 can serve them well this is the page 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:02.499
 of downloading harry potter and the 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:04.269
 mestizo prince I'm also going to 

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:06.789
 leave on the inscription along with the 

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:09.489
 deadpool and it's pretty much the same 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:12.399
 download a torrent waiting for 

00:05:09.489 --> 00:05:14.979

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:23.379

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:28.749
 torrents and as I already learned this 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:30.939
