going<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.600> make<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.750> bit<00:02:07.140> more<00:02:07.170> sense<00:02:07.740> right<00:02:08.190> and

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
going to make a bit more sense right and

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.190 
going to make a bit more sense right and
I<00:02:08.520> think<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.910> ultimately<00:02:09.119> we<00:02:09.720> need<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.020> keep

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
I think that ultimately we need to keep

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.050 
I think that ultimately we need to keep
in<00:02:10.379> mind<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.739> we're<00:02:10.950> coming<00:02:11.370> into<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.879> new

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
in mind that we're coming into a new

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.860 
in mind that we're coming into a new
moon<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:13.080> all<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.440> this

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
moon so all of this

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.380
