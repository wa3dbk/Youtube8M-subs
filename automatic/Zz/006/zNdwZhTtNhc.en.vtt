00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
was going through the test I wonder if

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.420 
was going through the test I wonder if
this<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.500> going<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.800> be<00:00:37.920> hit<00:00:38.040> another<00:00:38.219> world

record<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.760> don't<00:00:38.940> think<00:00:39.059> Charlotte<00:00:39.390> did

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
record I don't think Charlotte did

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.680

either<00:00:39.719> work<00:00:39.989> either<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.829> when<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.100> came<00:00:41.309> out

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
either work either and when we came out

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.000 
either work either and when we came out
you<00:00:42.690> know<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.840> find<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.320> he'd<00:00:43.469> actually<00:00:43.649> done

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
you know to find that he'd actually done

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.889 
you know to find that he'd actually done
that<00:00:44.250> was<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.670> bit<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.940> shot<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.270> were<00:00:45.390> both<00:00:45.750> a

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that was a bit of a shot we were both a

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.090 
that was a bit of a shot we were both a
little<00:00:46.110> detail<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.500> neither<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.800> us<00:00:46.860> had<00:00:47.010> even

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
little detail and neither of us had even

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.470 
little detail and neither of us had even
thought<00:00:47.430> about<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.030> Grand<00:00:48.239> Prix<00:00:48.390> of

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
thought about that the Grand Prix of

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900 
thought about that the Grand Prix of
course<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> warmup<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.250> not<00:00:50.370> vitally

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
course is the warmup so it's not vitally

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.880 
course is the warmup so it's not vitally
important<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.390> he<00:00:51.719> would<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:52.050> done<00:00:52.680> that

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
important that he would have done that

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.410 
important that he would have done that
but<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.129> course<00:00:53.309> once<00:00:53.670> again<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.120> know<00:00:54.239> he

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
but of course once again you know he

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.720 
but of course once again you know he
proved<00:00:54.719> just<00:00:55.350> how<00:00:55.469> masterly<00:00:56.070> he's<00:00:56.250> getting<00:00:56.640> I

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
proved just how masterly he's getting I

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.020 
proved just how masterly he's getting I
mean<00:00:56.850> he's<00:00:57.000> only<00:00:57.120> 12<00:00:57.480> years<00:00:57.690> old<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:59.030> very

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
mean he's only 12 years old and you very

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.610 
mean he's only 12 years old and you very
much<00:01:00.270> feel<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.570> actually<00:01:01.079> Charlotte<00:01:01.440> could

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
much feel like actually Charlotte could

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.020 
much feel like actually Charlotte could
get<00:01:01.800> off<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> middle<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.609> let<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> horse

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
get off in the middle and let the horse

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.369 
get off in the middle and let the horse
run<00:01:03.120> through<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> test<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.899> his<00:01:04.049> own<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.320> he

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
run through the test on his own and he

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.830 
run through the test on his own and he
still<00:01:04.650> make<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> world<00:01:05.189> record<00:01:05.640> without<00:01:06.450> of

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
still make a world record without of

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.320 
still make a world record without of
course<00:01:06.930> having<00:01:07.409> her<00:01:07.560> steering<00:01:07.890> around<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.640> you

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
course having her steering around so you

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.480 
course having her steering around so you
know<00:01:09.360> he's<00:01:09.630> obviously<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:10.080> good<00:01:10.350> form<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.799> you

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
know he's obviously on good form and you

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.800 
know he's obviously on good form and you
know<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:11.729> try<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.090> keep<00:01:12.210> his<00:01:12.420> shows<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.780> a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
know we try and keep his shows to a

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.719 
know we try and keep his shows to a
minimum<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.260> he<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.470> fresh<00:01:13.740> he<00:01:13.890> does<00:01:14.130> enjoy<00:01:14.490> it

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
minimum so he is fresh he does enjoy it

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.760 
minimum so he is fresh he does enjoy it
and<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.840> know<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:16.049> seem<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.530> found<00:01:16.650> the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
can't make a mistake because I didn't

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.370 
can't make a mistake because I didn't

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.760 
decided you know the Olympics was very
obvious<00:03:04.690> if<00:03:04.780> you'd<00:03:04.930> watched<00:03:05.140> it<00:03:05.380> and<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:05.590> saw

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
obvious if you'd watched it and you saw

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.290 
obvious if you'd watched it and you saw
her<00:03:05.980> world<00:03:06.220> record<00:03:06.520> earlier<00:03:06.820> it<00:03:07.030> was<00:03:07.120> very

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
her world record earlier it was very

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.340 
her world record earlier it was very
obviously<00:03:07.750> a<00:03:08.050> patriotic<00:03:09.010> theme<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.549> it<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:10.350> it

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
obviously a patriotic theme to it and it

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.039 
obviously a patriotic theme to it and it
was<00:03:11.530> various<00:03:12.220> types<00:03:12.519> of<00:03:12.670> music<00:03:13.120> whereas<00:03:13.480> what

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
was various types of music whereas what

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.650 
was various types of music whereas what
we<00:03:14.080> decided<00:03:14.500> here<00:03:14.890> was<00:03:15.100> just<00:03:15.430> silence<00:03:16.360> some<00:03:16.540> of

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
we decided here was just silence some of

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.300 
we decided here was just silence some of
those<00:03:16.750> critics<00:03:17.200> because<00:03:17.320> sometimes<00:03:17.799> you<00:03:18.280> know

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
those critics because sometimes you know

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.130 
those critics because sometimes you know
people<00:03:18.400> especially<00:03:19.239> very<00:03:19.510> musical<00:03:19.989> people

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
people especially very musical people

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.600 
people especially very musical people
found<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:20.739> was<00:03:20.860> a<00:03:20.890> little<00:03:21.190> bit<00:03:21.370> perhaps

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
found that it was a little bit perhaps

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.240 
found that it was a little bit perhaps
chopped<00:03:22.030> in<00:03:22.239> it<00:03:22.420> with<00:03:22.600> too<00:03:22.930> many<00:03:23.250> different

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
chopped in it with too many different

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.310 
chopped in it with too many different
themes<00:03:24.489> so<00:03:24.760> this<00:03:25.180> is<00:03:25.299> one<00:03:25.510> thing<00:03:25.780> it's<00:03:26.080> from<00:03:26.290> a

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
themes so this is one thing it's from a

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.650 
themes so this is one thing it's from a
