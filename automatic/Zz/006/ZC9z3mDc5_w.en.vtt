00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
with crop tops at the moment I think

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.210 
with crop tops at the moment I think
that<00:05:38.960> that's<00:05:39.110> kind<00:05:39.349> of<00:05:39.470> the<00:05:39.560> style<00:05:39.889> and<00:05:40.130> I

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
that that's kind of the style and I

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.620 
that that's kind of the style and I
think<00:05:40.430> it's<00:05:40.580> really<00:05:40.789> pretty<00:05:41.060> and<00:05:41.330> feminine

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.320 
think it's really pretty and feminine
and<00:05:42.370> because<00:05:43.370> their<00:05:43.550> house<00:05:43.729> repents<00:05:44.210> you're
