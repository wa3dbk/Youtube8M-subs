this in this pot it's actually kind of
overcrowding<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:38.010> could<00:00:38.160> actually<00:00:38.250> be<00:00:38.460> two

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
overcrowding this could actually be two

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.840 
overcrowding this could actually be two
or<00:00:38.820> three<00:00:38.850> pots<00:00:39.239> but<00:00:40.230> at<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.280> point<00:00:41.520> I'm<00:00:41.790> just

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
or three pots but at this point I'm just

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.340 
or three pots but at this point I'm just
going<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.510> do<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:43.520> cut<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.610> with<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.760> knife

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
going to do this cut it with a knife

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
lots of old crud or you can transfer

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.410 
lots of old crud or you can transfer
bacteria<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.760> inner<00:00:53.879> portion<00:00:54.090> which

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
bacteria to the inner portion which

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.299 
bacteria to the inner portion which
could<00:00:54.660> damage<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.410> plant<00:00:56.449> now

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
could damage the plant now

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.680 
could damage the plant now
here's<00:00:59.309> my<00:00:59.520> soil<00:01:00.329> matrix<00:01:00.770> with<00:01:02.690> fertilizer

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
here's my soil matrix with fertilizer

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.010 
here's my soil matrix with fertilizer
already<00:01:04.049> mixed<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:07.939> then

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
already mixed in then

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.180 
already mixed in then
take<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:11.720> since<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:12.870> going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.050> grow<00:01:13.290> this

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
take this since it's going to grow this

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.720 
take this since it's going to grow this
way<00:01:15.110> let's<00:01:16.110> take<00:01:16.290> these<00:01:16.500> roots<00:01:16.830> put<00:01:17.460> them<00:01:17.580> all

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
way let's take these roots put them all

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.719 
way let's take these roots put them all
through<00:01:17.760> here<00:01:19.430> call<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.640> all<00:01:20.820> around<00:01:22.520> put<00:01:23.520> this

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
through here call it all around put this

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.330 
through here call it all around put this
at<00:01:24.300> an<00:01:24.690> angle<00:01:25.880> against<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> base<00:01:27.180> okay<00:01:28.340> now

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
at an angle against the base okay now

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.070 
at an angle against the base okay now
that's<00:01:29.550> going<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.760> force<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.210> grow<00:01:30.540> this

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
that's going to force it to grow this

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.620 
that's going to force it to grow this
way<00:01:32.930> this<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.670> clean<00:01:35.670> topsoil<00:01:36.210> no

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
way this is just clean topsoil no

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.770 
way this is just clean topsoil no
fertilizer<00:01:37.940> now<00:01:39.680> I'm<00:01:40.680> also<00:01:41.540> they'll<00:01:42.540> take

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
fertilizer now I'm also they'll take

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.060 
fertilizer now I'm also they'll take
this<00:01:42.930> little<00:01:43.170> piece<00:01:43.229> here<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.680> put<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.950> in

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
this little piece here and put it in

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.300 
this little piece here and put it in
there<00:01:45.080> because<00:01:46.080> with<00:01:46.470> Hardee's<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.070> don't

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
there because with Hardee's you don't

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.219 
there because with Hardee's you don't
get<00:01:47.520> as<00:01:47.670> many<00:01:47.910> blooms<00:01:48.300> as<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.660> do<00:01:48.810> typically

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
get as many blooms as you do typically

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.249 
get as many blooms as you do typically
with<00:01:49.530> tropicals<00:01:50.300> so<00:01:51.300> about<00:01:51.540> having<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.930> couple

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
with tropicals so about having a couple

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.730 
with tropicals so about having a couple
different<00:01:52.680> ones<00:01:53.690> and<00:01:55.340> here<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:57.500> make<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
different ones and here I make the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.340 
different ones and here I make the
better<00:01:58.920> chance<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.399> much<00:01:59.700> more<00:01:59.910> blooms

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.740 

this<00:02:02.979> is<00:02:03.159> going<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.369> go<00:02:03.520> this<00:02:04.030> way<00:02:04.090> this<00:02:04.659> is

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
this is going to go this way this is

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.990 
this is going to go this way this is
going<00:02:04.869> to<00:02:04.960> end<00:02:05.049> up<00:02:05.080> growing<00:02:05.320> this<00:02:05.500> way<00:02:06.000> so

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
going to end up growing this way so

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.430 
going to end up growing this way so
that's<00:02:07.659> again<00:02:07.900> going<00:02:08.140> do<00:02:08.679> it<00:02:08.770> around<00:02:13.200> pack<00:02:14.200> it

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
that's again going do it around pack it

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.640 
that's again going do it around pack it
down<00:02:14.650> be<00:02:15.100> careful<00:02:15.489> not<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.670> damage<00:02:16.650> those

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
down be careful not to damage those

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:27.470 
down be careful not to damage those
growing<00:02:18.100> points<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:19.890> little<00:02:20.890> more<00:02:21.040> dirt

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.660 

then<00:02:28.110> just<00:02:28.560> like<00:02:28.709> we<00:02:28.739> did<00:02:29.069> with<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.940> tropical

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
then just like we did with the tropical

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.460 
then just like we did with the tropical
I'm<00:02:32.670> going<00:02:32.849> to<00:02:32.909> fill<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.209> in<00:02:33.360> on<00:02:33.930> top<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:34.379> the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
I'm going to fill it in on top of the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.030 
I'm going to fill it in on top of the
layer<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.799> sand<00:02:36.860> keep<00:02:37.860> fish<00:02:39.140> nasty<00:02:40.140> weeds<00:02:40.349> I'll

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
layer of sand keep fish nasty weeds I'll

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.030 
layer of sand keep fish nasty weeds I'll
sort<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.400> other<00:02:41.580> things<00:02:41.940> I'm<00:02:42.810> growing<00:02:46.040> once

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
sort of other things I'm growing once

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.830 
sort of other things I'm growing once
you<00:02:47.160> put<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.400> into<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.640> water<00:02:47.790> just<00:02:48.120> shake<00:02:48.810> it

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
you put it into the water just shake it

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.400 
you put it into the water just shake it
around<00:02:49.049> a<00:02:49.319> little<00:02:49.519> the<00:02:51.140> sand<00:02:52.140> will

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
around a little the sand will

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.770 
around a little the sand will
automatically<00:02:53.129> level<00:02:53.489> itself<00:02:53.819> out<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.599> it's

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
automatically level itself out and it's

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.080 
automatically level itself out and it's
okay<00:02:55.079> if<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.410> is<00:02:55.709> covered<00:02:56.010> up<00:02:56.129> because<00:02:56.790> those

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
okay if that is covered up because those

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.309 
okay if that is covered up because those
are<00:02:57.209> going<00:02:57.329> to<00:02:57.390> be<00:02:57.480> forced<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.870> grow<00:02:58.079> and

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
are going to be forced to grow and

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.050 
are going to be forced to grow and
they'll<00:02:58.440> grow<00:02:58.590> up<00:02:58.829> out<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.459> sand<00:02:59.730> within<00:02:59.970> a

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
they'll grow up out of the sand within a

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.630 
they'll grow up out of the sand within a
day<00:03:00.239> or<00:03:00.269> so<00:03:00.680> if<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.829> was<00:03:01.950> going<00:03:02.099> to<00:03:02.160> be<00:03:02.280> much

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
day or so if it was going to be much

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.569 
day or so if it was going to be much
longer<00:03:02.879> in<00:03:03.150> dark<00:03:03.480> water<00:03:04.010> dyed<00:03:05.010> water<00:03:05.310> or

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
longer in dark water dyed water or

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.490 
longer in dark water dyed water or
something<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.599> probably<00:03:06.870> want<00:03:07.079> to<00:03:07.290> go<00:03:07.379> ahead

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
something you probably want to go ahead

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.979 
something you probably want to go ahead
and<00:03:07.709> pull<00:03:07.859> it<00:03:07.890> up<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.400> little<00:03:08.609> but<00:03:09.390> for<00:03:09.930> right

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
and pull it up a little but for right

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.240 
and pull it up a little but for right
now<00:03:10.049> just<00:03:10.200> for<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> couple<00:03:10.680> days<00:03:10.890> this<00:03:11.040> would<00:03:11.160> be

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
now just for a couple days this would be

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.459 
now just for a couple days this would be
fine
