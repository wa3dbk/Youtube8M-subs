map<00:02:26.380> is<00:02:26.530> right<00:02:26.680> over<00:02:26.800> that<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.430> little

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
map is right over that that little

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.060 
map is right over that that little
mountain<00:02:27.850> reading<00:02:28.240> or<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.600> those<00:02:28.930> hills<00:02:29.260> okay

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
mountain reading or the those hills okay

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.350 
mountain reading or the those hills okay
yeah<00:02:30.220> because<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.459> train<00:02:30.670> runs<00:02:30.910> right<00:02:31.120> behind

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
yeah because the train runs right behind

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.770 
yeah because the train runs right behind
here<00:02:31.540> also<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.900> can<00:02:32.140> almost<00:02:32.230> see<00:02:32.470> them<00:02:32.650> I

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
here also you can almost see them I

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.210 
here also you can almost see them I
think<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.080> no<00:02:35.230> it's<00:02:35.380> little<00:02:35.620> ways<00:02:35.740> back<00:02:35.950> isn't

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
think so no it's little ways back isn't

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.870 
think so no it's little ways back isn't
it<00:02:36.430> yeah<00:02:36.790> I<00:02:37.540> would<00:02:37.900> say<00:02:38.080> 100<00:02:38.560> yards<00:02:38.770> but<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:39.580> far

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
it yeah I would say 100 yards but so far

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.430 
it yeah I would say 100 yards but so far
the<00:02:40.270> space<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:40.750> were<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:41.140> we're<00:02:41.290> seeing

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
the space that were that we're seeing

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.080 
the space that were that we're seeing
this<00:02:41.770> is<00:02:41.920> still<00:02:42.100> not<00:02:42.190> enough<00:02:42.250> we<00:02:42.610> got<00:02:42.700> we<00:02:42.940> got

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
this is still not enough we got we got

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.600 
this is still not enough we got we got
lots<00:02:43.300> more<00:02:43.390> space<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.870> go<00:02:45.840> no<00:02:46.840> no<00:02:47.580> they<00:02:48.580> might

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
lots more space to go no no they might

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.370 
lots more space to go no no they might
have<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:48.940> take<00:02:49.060> out<00:02:49.209> Chippendales<00:02:49.630> treehouse

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.570 

you<00:02:53.380> think<00:02:53.530> about<00:02:53.650> this<00:02:53.770> if<00:02:54.130> they<00:02:54.250> head<00:02:54.400> back

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
you think about this if they head back

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.729 
you think about this if they head back
there<00:02:54.870> then<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:55.989> land<00:02:56.170> yeah<00:02:58.260> no<00:02:59.260> no<00:02:59.500> this<00:02:59.620> is

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
there then you land yeah no no this is

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.979 
there then you land yeah no no this is
gone<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.130> think<00:03:00.489> I'll<00:03:00.640> definitely<00:03:01.090> look<00:03:01.930> a

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
gone you think I'll definitely look a

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.630 
gone you think I'll definitely look a
reason<00:03:02.530> why<00:03:02.650> I<00:03:02.680> say<00:03:02.890> that<00:03:03.040> it's<00:03:03.190> not<00:03:03.250> because

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
reason why I say that it's not because

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.040 
reason why I say that it's not because
what<00:03:03.910> it's<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.209> same<00:03:04.390> reason<00:03:04.510> why<00:03:04.690> I<00:03:04.750> think<00:03:04.870> to

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
what it's the same reason why I think to

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.050 
what it's the same reason why I think to
town<00:03:05.230> was<00:03:05.380> going<00:03:05.560> but<00:03:05.709> it's<00:03:06.370> not<00:03:06.610> we're<00:03:06.730> saving

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
town was going but it's not we're saving

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.860 
town was going but it's not we're saving
anyway<00:03:07.360> because<00:03:07.930> I<00:03:08.260> think<00:03:08.530> it's<00:03:08.890> I<00:03:09.720> guess<00:03:10.720> you

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
anyway because I think it's I guess you

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.270 
anyway because I think it's I guess you
want<00:03:11.019> how<00:03:11.170> linear<00:03:11.500> I<00:03:11.680> think<00:03:11.920> it's<00:03:12.010> gonna<00:03:12.100> be<00:03:12.220> a

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
want how linear I think it's gonna be a

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.830 
want how linear I think it's gonna be a
linear<00:03:12.610> now<00:03:12.790> it's<00:03:12.970> not<00:03:13.060> gonna<00:03:13.150> be<00:03:13.299> wide<00:03:13.570> well

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
linear now it's not gonna be wide well

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.000 
linear now it's not gonna be wide well
that's<00:03:14.019> what<00:03:14.140> I<00:03:14.200> thought<00:03:14.350> initially<00:03:14.650> what

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
that's what I thought initially what

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.770 
that's what I thought initially what
though<00:03:15.160> if<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:15.549> were<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.760> if<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.090> was<00:03:16.299> to<00:03:16.540> town

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
though if you were to if it was to town

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.229 
though if you were to if it was to town
it<00:03:16.959> would<00:03:17.019> be<00:03:17.110> more<00:03:17.230> like<00:03:17.380> a<00:03:17.519> rectangle<00:03:18.519> but

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
it would be more like a rectangle but

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.789 
it would be more like a rectangle but
the<00:03:19.450> images<00:03:19.870> that<00:03:20.019> I<00:03:20.049> was<00:03:20.230> seeing<00:03:20.410> last<00:03:20.590> night

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
the images that I was seeing last night

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.830 
the images that I was seeing last night
people<00:03:20.980> were<00:03:21.160> speculating<00:03:21.459> and<00:03:22.000> showing<00:03:22.720> what

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
people were speculating and showing what

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.000 
people were speculating and showing what
the<00:03:22.930> areas<00:03:23.200> that<00:03:23.230> they<00:03:23.380> know<00:03:23.560> that<00:03:23.590> that

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
the areas that they know that that

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.979 
the areas that they know that that
Disney<00:03:24.459> owns<00:03:24.640> or<00:03:24.940> have<00:03:25.120> recently<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:25.959> know

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
Disney owns or have recently you know

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.979 
Disney owns or have recently you know
converting<00:03:26.560> was<00:03:27.160> more<00:03:27.340> like<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.519> square<00:03:27.989> all

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
converting was more like a square all

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.479 
converting was more like a square all
right<00:03:29.049> so<00:03:29.590> that's<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:29.950> part<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.160> kind<00:03:30.370> of

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
right so that's the part that kind of

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:31.979 
right so that's the part that kind of
I'm<00:03:30.730> trying<00:03:30.820> to<00:03:30.970> get<00:03:31.060> my<00:03:31.150> head<00:03:31.299> around<00:03:31.390> let<00:03:31.900> me

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
I'm trying to get my head around let me

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.420 
I'm trying to get my head around let me
ask<00:03:32.110> you<00:03:32.200> this<00:03:32.290> so<00:03:32.380> I<00:03:32.440> just<00:03:32.590> had<00:03:32.680> a<00:03:32.709> new<00:03:32.829> thought

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.360 

where<00:03:36.430> do<00:03:36.549> you<00:03:36.640> how<00:03:37.030> do<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:37.209> blend<00:03:37.650> how<00:03:38.650> cuz

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
where do you how do you blend how cuz

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.590 
where do you how do you blend how cuz
they're<00:03:39.880> obviously<00:03:40.150> I<00:03:40.239> could<00:03:40.390> do<00:03:40.450> anything

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
they're obviously I could do anything

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.780 
they're obviously I could do anything
with<00:03:40.750> big<00:03:40.930> thunder<00:03:41.230> right<00:03:41.380> so<00:03:42.070> we're<00:03:42.519> on<00:03:42.640> the

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
with big thunder right so we're on the

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.150 
with big thunder right so we're on the
edge<00:03:42.910> of<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.450> land<00:03:43.750> right<00:03:43.930> now<00:03:44.079> right<00:03:44.500> so<00:03:44.980> how

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
edge of the land right now right so how

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.930 
edge of the land right now right so how
you<00:03:45.220> transition<00:03:45.850> into<00:03:46.150> right<00:03:46.750> what<00:03:47.730> does<00:03:48.730> Big

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
you transition into right what does Big

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.530 
you transition into right what does Big
Thunder<00:03:49.090> trail<00:03:49.480> stay<00:03:50.190> yeah<00:03:51.190> so<00:03:51.730> does<00:03:52.480> that

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
Thunder trail stay yeah so does that

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.050 
Thunder trail stay yeah so does that
become<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.470> so<00:03:54.340> that<00:03:54.489> there's<00:03:54.670> big<00:03:54.790> thunder

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
become the so that there's big thunder

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.050 
become the so that there's big thunder
trail<00:03:55.299> right<00:03:55.510> here<00:03:55.540> if<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:55.840> stays<00:03:56.610> then<00:03:57.610> what

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
trail right here if that stays then what

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.160 
trail right here if that stays then what
are<00:03:58.150> you<00:03:58.209> gonna<00:03:58.329> do<00:03:58.510> like<00:03:58.660> right<00:03:58.840> here<00:03:59.079> is

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
are you gonna do like right here is

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.530 
are you gonna do like right here is
another<00:03:59.380> you<00:03:59.799> have<00:03:59.920> to<00:03:59.980> create<00:04:00.190> some<00:04:00.370> more

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
another you have to create some more

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.630 
another you have to create some more
buffer<00:04:01.540> buffer<00:04:02.530> would<00:04:02.799> be<00:04:02.920> like<00:04:03.070> these<00:04:03.310> rocks

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
buffer buffer would be like these rocks

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.020 
buffer buffer would be like these rocks
here

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
here

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.790 
here
maybe<00:04:04.239> you<00:04:04.720> think<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.230> then

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
maybe you think and then

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.100 
maybe you think and then
trees<00:04:06.400> we<00:04:06.700> need<00:04:06.820> big<00:04:07.120> giant<00:04:07.540> trees<00:04:07.810> with<00:04:07.960> what

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
trees we need big giant trees with what

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.460
