00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.769
 when talking about cyclist equipment 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.030
 we must think essentially 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.660
 visibility to be seen by others 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.470
 users 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.730
 there are two aspects to take in 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.180
 consideration with regard to the good 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.880
 meaning 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.220
 so the cyclist's clothes go off 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.070
 principle that a cyclist must be 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.570
 dressed in clear remember each 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.099
 certainly seen encounters and at 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.559
 crusaders at 6 am 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.739
 morning tickets all black for the tourist 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.760
 it's a catastrophe 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.850
 there is only one element that is 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.090
 mandatory it's the role vest to a 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.090
 example so this fluorescent vest is 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.090
 mandatory night in open country is 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.180
 also starting from rain in weather 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.050
 dark fog against us we 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.050
 blue 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.360
 strongly advising also 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.399
 urban interurban city because in 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.500
 city ​​or interurban there are also 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.470
 shaded areas shaded area 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.460
 at sunrise at dusk 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:14.970
 and here too the saona efficiency the role 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.610
 keystroke which allows to visualize the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.360
 movements of the cyclist so we can in 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.400
 put one 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.050
 we can put two if we put two 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.259
 was one on each leg against 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.630
 if we put one we'll put it 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.530
 basically on the left leg 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.180
 the advantage is that in the headlights 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.710
 of a car we see the movement of 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.960
 legs and it's very visible 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.720
 the helmet I specify well is not 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.369
 mandatory in France 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.429
 however, it is strongly recommended 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.160
 because a cyclist remains a user 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.020
 vulnerable to the used which does not have 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.789
 bodywork like in a car so 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.159
 whenever he unfortunately has a 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.619
 accident or hanging the party 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.300
 first who is incriminated who is 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.539
 touched it's the head so you have to 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.539
 protect
