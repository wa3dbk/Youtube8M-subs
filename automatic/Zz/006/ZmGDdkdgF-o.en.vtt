WWE 2k14 game now this video is a big

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.460 
WWE 2k14 game now this video is a big
one<00:00:13.200> for<00:00:13.410> me<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.969> top<00:00:15.360> 5<00:00:15.630> game<00:00:16.260> modes

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
one for me it is the top 5 game modes

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.620 
one for me it is the top 5 game modes
I'd<00:00:16.680> like<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.980> see<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.430> game<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.880> know<00:00:18.359> all

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
I'd like to see in the game I know all

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.420 
I'd like to see in the game I know all
five<00:00:18.960> game<00:00:19.199> modes<00:00:19.380> won't<00:00:19.650> be<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.949> game<00:00:20.160> but

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
five game modes won't be in the game but

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.820 
five game modes won't be in the game but
I<00:00:20.550> think<00:00:20.970> even<00:00:21.779> if<00:00:21.990> there's<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.320> couple<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.650> days

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
I think even if there's a couple of days

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.480 
I think even if there's a couple of days
then<00:00:23.789> that's<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.660> big<00:00:24.840> score<00:00:25.140> for<00:00:25.199> me<00:00:25.439> these<00:00:26.369> are

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
then that's a big score for me these are

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.060 
then that's a big score for me these are
the<00:00:26.580> top<00:00:26.820> 5<00:00:27.060> game<00:00:27.810> modes<00:00:28.050> out<00:00:28.260> let's<00:00:28.590> see<00:00:28.830> in

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
included that in this video so I'm just

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.420 
included that in this video so I'm just
gonna<00:00:48.780> add<00:00:49.020> up<00:00:49.050> with<00:00:49.379> universe<00:00:49.829> mode<00:00:50.070> because

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
gonna add up with universe mode because

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.430 
gonna add up with universe mode because
I<00:00:50.460> used<00:00:50.850> universe<00:00:51.420> more<00:00:51.600> than<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.079> decided

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
I used universe more than so I decided

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.369 
I used universe more than so I decided
to<00:00:52.559> make<00:00:52.770> my<00:00:52.949> youtube<00:00:53.190> videos<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.379> think

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
to make my youtube videos and I think

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.110 
to make my youtube videos and I think
universe<00:00:55.739> more<00:00:55.949> that's<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:56.280> basically<00:00:56.640> good

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
universe more that's just basically good

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.959 
universe more that's just basically good

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
objectives in do and I just basically

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.240 
objectives in do and I just basically
think<00:03:21.549> that's<00:03:21.699> a<00:03:21.790> good<00:03:22.389> am<00:03:22.659> game<00:03:23.560> over<00:03:23.739> half<00:03:24.010> in

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
think that's a good am game over half in

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.750 
think that's a good am game over half in
the<00:03:24.459> game<00:03:24.669> and<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:26.590> brings<00:03:26.799> more<00:03:27.099> variety<00:03:27.639> to

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
the game and it brings more variety to

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.580 
the game and it brings more variety to
the<00:03:27.879> game<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.680> some<00:03:29.680> pack<00:03:29.889> game<00:03:30.129> modes<00:03:31.590> fifth

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
the game and some pack game modes fifth

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.439 
the game and some pack game modes fifth
and<00:03:32.769> final<00:03:33.220> game<00:03:33.370> what<00:03:33.609> I<00:03:33.639> like<00:03:33.879> to<00:03:34.000> see<00:03:34.180> is

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:34.449 
and final game what I like to see is

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.619 
and final game what I like to see is
something<00:03:35.379> that<00:03:35.530> has<00:03:35.799> pretty<00:03:36.760> unlikely<00:03:37.120> but<00:03:37.599> I

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
something that has pretty unlikely but I

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.550 
something that has pretty unlikely but I
think<00:03:37.900> it's<00:03:38.019> freaking<00:03:38.979> awesome<00:03:39.220> idea<00:03:39.729> and

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
think it's freaking awesome idea and

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.680 
think it's freaking awesome idea and
