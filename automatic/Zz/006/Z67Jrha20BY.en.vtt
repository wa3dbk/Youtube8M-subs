 in fact the basis of modern pharmacopoeia 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.640
 it will be necessary to wait until the Renaissance so that we can speak of a vegetable garden 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.820
 botanist in the short sense 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.820
 now 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.980
 the birth of the botanical garden 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.330
 and in fact linked to that of experimental science from the need of schools 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.600
 of medicine of the 500 you have to have use of freeski medicinal plants for use 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.630
 the oldest university botanical garden founded in the university

 of pisa 3543 hey 1544 from the botanical doctor lucca on tv and impacto foot 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.420
 on the scientific community of the Futani era that the most important e 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.420
 prestigious universities of the time will follow the example 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.580
 today there are more than 1,700 botanical gardens scattered around the world 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.760
 but what activity lies behind their fruits 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.160
 and what we find alone in the dark 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.490
 well of course there are the plants 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.649
 in botanical gardens plants can be bought or kept from fools obtained from 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.119
 an exchange with other botanical gardens through a convention 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.430
 international omg the funniest way by going pick them up i

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:18.389

 the whole gift world if it is a typical feces of wetland habitats 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.219
 as kanny marshes t 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.129
 shores of bosch hydrophilic rivers 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.889
 has a fairly even distribution in europe the lombardi in its presence is 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.909
 rarefied cause 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.439
 anthropic delation 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.439
 which decreases all damp environments 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:55.649
 in the Bergamo area his presence is now extinct 

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:59.049
 the first descriptor of this species in 1853

 Dr. Lorenzo Rota 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.319
 to which however it is 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:09.869
 dedicated the botanical garden of bergamo I mark it at the banks of the river adda 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:11.759
 and trade union + 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:13.289
 his in an area 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.539
 which is very similar to the one we are in today 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:20.389
 the botanical garden in 1000 993 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:26.599
 has undertaken a conservation action once the presence of this has been restored 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.159
 spice in home environments 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.119
 reported last century 

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:36.790
 since hocus bunda regal if it reproduces through spores it was if 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:41.329
 necessary to start the collaboration with the minoprio foundation which it is 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:47.339
 succeeded in reproducing this happy and providing plans 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:48.969
 like this one 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:52.469
 about 10 years and that guarantees us a u 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.879
 greater likelihood of success for this action we have undertaken 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.809
 we find ourselves in a gyroscope 

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:04.739
 in the municipal park of the mulher in val calepio a stone's throw from the Iseo lake and 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.099
 today we will try to reintroduce thirty of these in this 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.409
 environment that lends itself 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.409
 very good for this kind of action

 dark look inside the gardens 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.330
 therefore we have a specimen of Santa Claus skins typical of the real 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.229
 stenico comes and is very well found in these areas even in the summer they are 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.289
 platform of your dreams woman and her happiness 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.539
 still did not enter the systems collection 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.870
 however we can design the harvest of the plant to be able and then preserve 

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:01.089
 inside the botanical garden. 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:04.089
 to you amazon 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.960
 damon questions 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.360
 I return

 Revenge is a sample of the ancient butterfly of earth 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.830
 because he had something tattoo inside the botanical garden 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:20.999
 while 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:25.639
 this other sample was extracted without obviously the earth clod for 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.909
 which will then be allowed under lesta eeee you can this way be 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:35.949
 this method can therefore be preserved for a long time with this method 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:38.169
 prepare six plants 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:43.039
 that which are preserved and then calendars of botanical gardens and 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:48.190
 the herbarium because of its function is even called 8 8 themselves 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:52.360
 the botanical garden that has a collection of plants ran in contrast 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.120
 of the vanquished
