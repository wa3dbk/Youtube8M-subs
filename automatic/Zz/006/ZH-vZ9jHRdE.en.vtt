we<00:00:35.780> can<00:00:35.960> also<00:00:36.140> triple<00:00:37.010> our<00:00:37.160> volume<00:00:37.640> hence<00:00:38.510> the

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
we can also triple our volume hence the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.120 
we can also triple our volume hence the
reason<00:00:38.870> why<00:00:39.140> we<00:00:39.290> have<00:00:39.410> three<00:00:39.680> racks<00:00:39.890> in<00:00:40.100> the

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
reason why we have three racks in the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.930 
reason why we have three racks in the
oven<00:00:40.490> so<00:00:41.060> now<00:00:41.210> we're<00:00:41.360> getting<00:00:41.510> uniform<00:00:42.140> heat

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
oven so now we're getting uniform heat

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.630 
oven so now we're getting uniform heat
more<00:00:43.940> volume<00:00:44.650> also<00:00:46.030> reduce<00:00:47.030> cooking<00:00:47.420> time<00:00:48.640> now

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
more volume also reduce cooking time now

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.890 
more volume also reduce cooking time now
we're<00:00:49.760> going<00:00:49.850> to<00:00:49.910> check<00:00:50.120> on<00:00:50.300> those<00:00:50.450> cookies

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
we're going to check on those cookies

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.160 
we're going to check on those cookies
we're<00:00:51.110> using<00:00:51.470> true<00:00:51.740> convection<00:00:52.900> so<00:00:53.900> as<00:00:54.050> you

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
we're using true convection so as you

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.690 
we're using true convection so as you
can<00:00:54.260> see<00:00:54.320> we're<00:00:54.680> getting<00:00:54.770> a<00:00:54.950> nice<00:00:55.100> even<00:00:55.550> heat

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
can see we're getting a nice even heat

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.000 
can see we're getting a nice even heat
distribution<00:00:56.380> look<00:00:57.380> at<00:00:57.470> those<00:00:57.620> those<00:00:57.860> look

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
distribution look at those those look

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.370 
distribution look at those those look
fantastic<00:00:58.250> so<00:00:58.700> we're<00:00:58.940> getting<00:00:59.210> nice<00:00:59.810> even

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
fantastic so we're getting nice even

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.140 
fantastic so we're getting nice even
cooking<00:01:00.620> we<00:01:00.890> didn't<00:01:01.070> have<00:01:01.190> to<00:01:01.250> rotate<00:01:01.490> the<00:01:01.880> pan

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
cooking we didn't have to rotate the pan

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.020

you<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.960> turn<00:01:28.109> your<00:01:28.320> heat<00:01:28.530> up<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.920> 525<00:01:29.899> that's

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
you can turn your heat up to 525 that's

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.569 
you can turn your heat up to 525 that's
going<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.170> give<00:01:31.289> a<00:01:31.320> nice<00:01:31.619> heat<00:01:31.920> distribution

on your pizza stone now their pizza
stone<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.429> Pepita<00:01:35.850> stone<00:01:36.240> which<00:01:36.929> has

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
stone is the Pepita stone which has

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.260 
stone is the Pepita stone which has
holes<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:38.009> slotted<00:01:38.549> through<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.119> have<00:01:39.210> a

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
holes it's slotted through so you have a

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.209 
holes it's slotted through so you have a
nice<00:01:39.450> heat<00:01:39.780> distribution<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.679> it's<00:01:41.009> going<00:01:41.130> to

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
nice heat distribution and it's going to

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:51.649 
nice heat distribution and it's going to
preheat<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:42.000> stone<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> lot<00:01:42.569> faster<00:01:50.659> we'll

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
preheat that stone a lot faster we'll

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.080 
preheat that stone a lot faster we'll
check<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.110> about<00:01:52.590> 20<00:01:52.920> minutes<00:01:53.189> all<00:01:54.060> right

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
check on that about 20 minutes all right

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.249 
check on that about 20 minutes all right
so<00:01:54.329> now<00:01:54.450> we're<00:01:54.599> going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.780> check<00:01:54.959> on<00:01:55.140> that

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
so now we're going to check on that

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.289 
so now we're going to check on that
pizza<00:01:55.709> so<00:01:55.890> we<00:01:56.039> had<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.280> pizza<00:01:56.459> stone<00:01:56.849> in<00:01:57.090> I

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
pizza so we had the pizza stone in I

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.380 
pizza so we had the pizza stone in I
preheated<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:58.429> now<00:01:59.429> look<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.909> can<00:02:00.060> see<00:02:00.239> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
preheated that now look you can see the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.740 
preheated that now look you can see the
crust<00:02:00.890> rising<00:02:01.890> nice<00:02:02.099> and<00:02:02.369> evenly<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:03.479> heat

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750

preheated<00:02:05.970> it<00:02:06.119> nice<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.509> fast<00:02:06.720> you're

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
preheated it nice and fast you're

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.289 
preheated it nice and fast you're
getting<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:07.950> earth<00:02:08.220> crust<00:02:08.610> flavor<00:02:09.030> which<00:02:09.269> is

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
getting that earth crust flavor which is

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:16.680 
getting that earth crust flavor which is

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
cooking features that'll start the roast

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.190 
cooking features that'll start the roast
spinning<00:03:54.580> and<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:55.180> also<00:03:55.330> will<00:03:55.690> cycle<00:03:56.110> the

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
spinning and it also will cycle the

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.620 
spinning and it also will cycle the
broiler<00:03:56.650> on<00:03:56.860> that<00:03:57.700> creates<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.209> natural

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
broiler on that creates a natural

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.540 
broiler on that creates a natural
convection<00:03:58.810> flow<00:03:59.320> and<00:03:59.739> this<00:04:00.250> will<00:04:00.400> be<00:04:00.519> a

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
convection flow and this will be a

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.570 
convection flow and this will be a
self-basting<00:04:01.209> rose<00:04:01.690> nice<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:02.560> juicy<00:04:03.160> later

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
self-basting rose nice and juicy later

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.580 
self-basting rose nice and juicy later
on<00:04:03.790> when<00:04:03.970> it's<00:04:04.120> done<00:04:04.330> so<00:04:04.900> we'll<00:04:05.019> check<00:04:05.230> on<00:04:05.410> that

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
on when it's done so we'll check on that

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.650 
on when it's done so we'll check on that
in<00:04:05.709> about<00:04:05.890> an<00:04:06.010> hour<00:04:06.300> all<00:04:07.300> right<00:04:07.330> now<00:04:07.510> we're

going to check on that rotisserie we put

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.979 
going to check on that rotisserie we put
that<00:04:09.370> roast<00:04:09.670> in<00:04:09.910> earlier<00:04:10.360> let's<00:04:10.750> see<00:04:10.900> how

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
that roast in earlier let's see how

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.290 
that roast in earlier let's see how
we're<00:04:11.170> making<00:04:11.290> out<00:04:11.620> oh<00:04:11.860> that's<00:04:12.820> nice<00:04:13.060> and

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300
