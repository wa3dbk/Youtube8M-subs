beginners<00:01:30.299> start<00:01:31.079> off<00:01:31.229> maybe<00:01:31.470> doing<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.610> know

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
beginners start off maybe doing you know

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.390 
beginners start off maybe doing you know
three<00:01:33.000> sets<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.420> ten<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.990> work<00:01:34.770> your<00:01:34.920> way<00:01:34.979> up<00:01:35.100> I

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
three sets of ten and work your way up I

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.969 
three sets of ten and work your way up I
tend<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:36.030> about<00:01:36.240> five<00:01:36.810> sets<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.470> fifteen

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
tend to do about five sets of fifteen

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.460 
tend to do about five sets of fifteen
but<00:01:38.759> if<00:01:38.909> you're<00:01:39.119> crazy<00:01:39.479> fit<00:01:39.780> again<00:01:40.229> like

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
but if you're crazy fit again like
