00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.749 
will read the credits later on so this
is<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.410> model<00:00:13.590> map<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:13.950> because<00:00:14.130> she<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.370> top<00:00:14.400> you

is a model map is because she on top you

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.640 
is a model map is because she on top you
have<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.969> moat<00:00:15.210> which<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.990> saying<00:00:16.230> dragon

George<00:00:16.859> custom<00:00:17.220> game<00:00:17.400> mode<00:00:17.609> by<00:00:17.820> broadband<00:00:18.330> and

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
George custom game mode by broadband and

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.529 
George custom game mode by broadband and
it's<00:00:19.410> changing<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.039> another<00:00:20.100> loss<00:00:20.609> thing<00:00:21.330> so

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
it's changing to another loss thing so

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.019 
it's changing to another loss thing so
for<00:00:21.720> example<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.830> game<00:00:23.010> mode<00:00:23.279> where<00:00:23.880> was

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the bank so you just run around this map

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.910 
the bank so you just run around this map
and<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:42.420> try<00:01:42.720> not<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.990> take<00:01:43.200> me<00:01:43.560> taking<00:01:43.860> over

and you try not to take me taking over

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.569 
and you try not to take me taking over
the<00:01:44.130> dragon<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.729> try<00:01:45.659> not<00:01:46.009> like<00:01:47.009> what<00:01:47.399> she<00:01:47.430> has

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
the dragon so try not like what she has

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.510 
the dragon so try not like what she has
to<00:01:47.670> do<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.780> hide<00:01:49.020> somewhere<00:01:49.799> for<00:01:50.189> example

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
to do is to hide somewhere for example

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.069 
to do is to hide somewhere for example
here<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.820> dragons<00:01:51.090> can<00:01:51.119> not<00:01:51.360> oh<00:01:51.509> Jesus

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
here the dragons can not oh Jesus

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.050 
here the dragons can not oh Jesus
already<00:01:52.470> died<00:01:52.680> okay<00:01:53.100> I'm<00:01:53.250> pretty<00:01:53.520> bad<00:01:53.700> at<00:01:53.759> this

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
already died okay I'm pretty bad at this

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.539 
already died okay I'm pretty bad at this
map<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.509> already<00:01:55.470> see<00:01:55.710> I'm<00:01:55.799> pretty<00:01:56.009> badass<00:01:56.189> map

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
map I already see I'm pretty badass map

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.910 
map I already see I'm pretty badass map
so<00:01:57.030> what<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.200> where<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.590> spawn

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
so what is this this is where you spawn

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.429 
so what is this this is where you spawn
when<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.280> died<00:01:59.520> okay<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.600> yeah<00:02:00.930> basically<00:02:01.170> I'm

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
when you died okay so yeah basically I'm

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.050 
when you died okay so yeah basically I'm
just<00:02:01.500> back<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:01.950> his<00:02:02.070> map<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.579> died<00:02:02.729> really

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
just back in his map I just died really

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.670 
just back in his map I just died really
quickly<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.780> should<00:02:04.200> probably<00:02:04.229> already

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
quickly but I should probably already

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.859 
quickly but I should probably already
shows<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.250> had<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.000> get<00:02:06.180> used<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.689> map

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
shows that I had to get used to this map

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.630 
shows that I had to get used to this map
you<00:02:07.049> really<00:02:07.590> have<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.860> get<00:02:07.950> used<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.459> map

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
you really have to get used to this map

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.639 
you really have to get used to this map
so<00:02:09.060> basically<00:02:09.390> what<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.569> do<00:02:09.720> there's<00:02:10.379> an<00:02:10.440> area

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
so basically what you do there's an area

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.410 
so basically what you do there's an area
over<00:02:11.009> here<00:02:11.069> like<00:02:11.400> as<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:11.730> see<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.879> platform

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
over here like as you can see a platform

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.730 
over here like as you can see a platform
Anderson<00:02:12.780> house<00:02:12.930> over<00:02:13.290> here

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
Anderson house over here

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.110 
Anderson house over here

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
just can't make it anymore because you

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.580 
just can't make it anymore because you
can't<00:02:29.790> get<00:02:30.270> back<00:02:30.510> for<00:02:30.990> example<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.290> can<00:02:31.410> just

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
can't get back for example you can just

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.590 
can't get back for example you can just
hide<00:02:31.740> here<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.310> hope<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.970> any<00:02:33.150> drinks<00:02:33.480> don't

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
hide here and hope that any drinks don't

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.450 
hide here and hope that any drinks don't
see<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.050> don't<00:02:34.260> attack<00:02:34.740> you<00:02:34.950> but

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
see you and don't attack you but

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.920 
see you and don't attack you but
basically<00:02:36.090> when<00:02:36.270> you're<00:02:36.390> just<00:02:36.600> standing<00:02:36.750> on

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
basically when you're just standing on

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:37.820 
basically when you're just standing on
the<00:02:37.050> edge<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.320> can<00:02:37.350> see<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:37.740> they

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
the edge you can see is that they

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.380 
the edge you can see is that they
already<00:02:38.010> destroyed<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.550> big<00:02:38.730> part<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.210> map

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
already destroyed a big part of the map

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.180 
already destroyed a big part of the map
of<00:02:39.540> here<00:02:39.810> but<00:02:40.290> let's<00:02:40.650> take<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.830> look<00:02:40.980> if<00:02:41.070> they

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
of here but let's take a look if they

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.070 
of here but let's take a look if they
can<00:02:41.370> shoot<00:02:41.520> at<00:02:41.700> me<00:02:41.730> I'm<00:02:42.090> not<00:02:42.510> too<00:02:42.660> sure<00:02:42.870> because

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
can shoot at me I'm not too sure because

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.930 
can shoot at me I'm not too sure because
I'm<00:02:43.350> creative<00:02:43.860> mode<00:02:44.010> I've<00:02:44.130> never<00:02:44.310> really<00:02:44.910> done

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
I'm creative mode I've never really done

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.490 
I'm creative mode I've never really done
it<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.300> creative<00:02:45.600> mode<00:02:45.630> but<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.020> think<00:02:46.290> they<00:02:46.380> can

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
it in creative mode but I think they can

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.650 
it in creative mode but I think they can
shoot<00:02:46.650> at<00:02:46.830> me<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.190> BJ<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:47.940> just<00:02:48.240> have<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.480> run

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
shoot at me and BJ you just have to run

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.690 
shoot at me and BJ you just have to run
around<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.440> as<00:02:49.710> you<00:02:49.830> can<00:02:49.950> see<00:02:49.980> wells<00:02:50.310> that

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
around and as you can see wells that

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.280 
around and as you can see wells that
they<00:02:50.820> destroy<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.180> lot<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.510> stuff<00:02:51.720> for<00:02:51.960> example

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
they destroy a lot of stuff for example

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.930 
they destroy a lot of stuff for example
for<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.470> could<00:02:52.620> just<00:02:52.740> oh<00:02:52.920> that's<00:02:53.490> diamond<00:02:53.820> up

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
for you could just oh that's diamond up
