00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.050
 hello you live like your esprit home 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.780
 the winter awaits 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.630
 späth won the moment the talks 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.840
 not quite as fast on the line 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.420
 fifteenth are so who the week 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.390
 opted for good care, the 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.910
 Today it's his weekday 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.090
 do with me going to the bedroom 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.070
 and to do the best 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.149
 I'll dedicate myself to my bottom then 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.070
 I want to do that on the 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.989
 freedom you cleaned up your floor 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.760
 the less stress you have 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.800
 vision vision that is really a whole 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.870
 quick task 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.120
 Unless you have a lot of follow on the 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.030
 floor or stands for russ for clearing away 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.820
 so if you care colorfully this 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.859
 and also her bedroom and 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.379
 guests maria was standing on the ground and 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.480
 is simple but time thing for 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.520
 working to clear away after winding or 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.550
 the junk what he does not need away 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.260
 completely gone or it has a function 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.760
 a wrong place then please correct 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:19.510
 towards admits if he at in the action 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:23.220
 Since side rooms declutter at the 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:28.210
 action I am with me that a chamber 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.980
 there we have day 2 and today we have 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.680
 after the plan day of yesterday 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.910
 our goal is that as much as possible 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.530
 to declutter 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:43.270
 that means this is really going through and 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.060
 trying to clear out 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.410
 means you have things that do not work 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.790
 we tried to sort things out 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.730
 wegzuschmeißen a sales list 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.750
 give away what is still doing it 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.580
 simply cleared out away thinks fit 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.280
 again there are two different ones 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.310
 Clean up and clear out things 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.759
 these are the two pondorf clear 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.129
 means the thing has no function what 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.099
 you have it it needs me it is 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.750
 simply useless and on rome that means 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.660
 Things are in the wrong place 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.370
 it has a formation went wrong 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.450
 put it has a function but it 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.310
 is wrong 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.800
 that brings nothing to you 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.739
 basically that has the field and also 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.489
 the function that he afterwards everything 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.420
 summary does that neatly 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.750
 we do not do today 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.030
 today is really big cleared up day 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.920
 trying to clear everything you guys 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.959
 manages to go through ramming nothing 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.920
 the things we still want to have all 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.550
 make everything fly like that 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.230
 to let 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.819
 just look what you can do it and 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.360
 that just has to be our place in 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.489
 the room 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.080
 if you that has done everything he 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.459
 you have cleaned up again 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.769
 a room planning 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.140
 you have the crumbs on the 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.810
 get space and through yours 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.160
 Spatial planning and you have looked at 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:12.849
 now after easter winter things around 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.380
 summer things that you do 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.080
 somehow after these areas and 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.640
 sorted by themes now it works 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.599
 Now it's all over and rumbling what is 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.340
 because broken objects broke 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:29.650
 Items that want to be repaired 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.030
 broken garlic press broken 27 it 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.940
 There are so many broken things 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.320
 always on hitler you want to fix 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.609
 she is not gone yet 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.010
 I did not succeed later 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.290
 just go away it does not annoy you 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.209
 where you are in the end he frees then 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.310
 there are still the emergency items her 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.900
 have two garlic press no you have 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.100
 two blabla welcome for emergency and 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.310
 i can in the other educational path 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.569
 no one even breaks 241 times 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.220
 a new thought over again 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.079
 that happens that the first part of that 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.810
 What you have gone great is 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.670
 if it does not need broken items 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.670
 and you do not need a second 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.440
 emergency thing away so that emergency thing 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.269
 is exactly the same as reserves 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.170
 You do not need that much 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:17.049
 takes reserve and then that on it 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.370
 accesses again if you are there 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.870
 bedding capital in the wardrobe 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.180
 probably therefore the last week 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.620
 have sorted bedding cleaning products 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.210
 cleaning products are even worse , we write 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.450
 Just gone he has a bad feeling 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.220
 Wider grabbed the cupboard and then 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.380
 cleaning agent I told you you 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.140
 needs only as a cleaner away what also 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.760
 you always have something that hurts twice 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.860
 with the less away and lifts the up on 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.050
 and use that makes time on it whether 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.370
 He did this really to use now 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.300
 You know you did in the last half year 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:48.450
 not just look away somehow 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:52.080
 wipes have old wipes old t shirts 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.070
 how you wanted to cut it up if that 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.160
 until now have not done 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.690
 throwing away is just everything 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.940
 possible if it did not succeed 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.550
 he makes but now not so rubbish 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.500
 there is no point in what a function 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.980
 what he did not need is what's up 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:12.240
 served there because there diego 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:14.550
 give away candlesticks whatever 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.200
 Did not you use out of which 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.260
 because you are not the substance of the values 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.810
 uses because he does not make these candles 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.490
 purpose is somehow fitting made 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.930
 I had also started junk boxes 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.340
 the standard 100 years around 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:32.160
 if that does not show but someone looks 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.240
 have and oxfam or whatever 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.070
 everything comes off 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.530
 make a big box if he does 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.800
 if i want to be his bike and i want to 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.360
 that did not work 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.980
 Of course it's also about books 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.990
 and magazines that are stored there 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.980
 could be true after next books 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.750
 we have so many books 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.280
 We can actually book twice 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.680
 read or we have fitte for new 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.940
 Books There is a lot to find too much 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.000
 many ways to read books 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.590
 get rid of them okay says you everywhere 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.360
 ten pieces in the shelf to the beautiful 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.940
 they still look like their favorite books 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.470
 last together not yet to the ten 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.430
 you read here is to have available 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.240
 that 's it the rest has to beck 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.660
 magazines the same be honest 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.100
 that's not what comes with pride 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.780
 read whatever makes you look away 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.860
 time for you because it is a bad one 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.840
 make certain 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.090
 and because they always tell you you have 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.190
 not yet lived and 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.530
 With so much time to invest around them 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:31.760
 read then make them off order them 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:33.560
 but I'll put it away if you do not 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.389
 does not need it very fast 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.820
 you also save money you save with 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:40.060
 clean up always wants to clear away money 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.110
 if you pay attention to buy less 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.600
 as a decent holder not everyone 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.160
 So you can buy too 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.889
 read everything on the internet as well 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.780
 whenever that is representative in the 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:53.810
 shelf is the books or society 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:56.930
 power is gone, it makes you away 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:07:01.100
 Do you still have boxes of cartons as well? 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:03.470
 always tight or wide clothes makes way 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:07.520
 buy the new one when he is ready 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:12.169
 No matter what I have the penultimate week 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.490
 already said it today the 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:16.310
 time to sort 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.020
 loud music, a glass of sparkling wine to a 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.910
 girlfriend perhaps clearly the 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.570
 We always say when I'm alone 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:26.389
 good mood once through big box and 

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:29.300
 zack zack evening to be happy 

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:31.250
 I am satisfied with what I have achieved 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.710
 Hope he makes it so I hope you 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.970
 you have desire and energy and wishes 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:40.720
 otherwise a super nice 

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.720
 clean up in trouble ochs day
