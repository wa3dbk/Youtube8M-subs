 both it's normal i can handle it 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.300
 the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.910
 it is 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.770
 so known that the repair may be present or they also nobody who I 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.770
 be able to send trust 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.770
 the ball is present 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.810
 use the platform london 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.610
 orlando engelaar and that is a trader 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.610
 orange then he will I find it very annoying but the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.610
 that is a year 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.490
 That's what I wanted and could be busy if I assume the device is with me 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.100
 just go 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.890
 I think after years I am very new to life this narrow the teeth of it all 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.309
 not 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:13.419
 fat this scornful anyway I don't like it I am concerned that that 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:16.779
 the device is worked with care when I go along with it 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:19.559
 device then it can be in need of a repair and that shouldn't be 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.559
 be a problem 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.439
 get there 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.929
 normally that happens in the greatest secrecy 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:30.200
 come here 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.459

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.739
 they help that has 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.379
 the plan even though the room talks 9 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.790
 you will hear anp 9 how come i do 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:49.010
 after not being afraid of it 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.500
 we know that I know that psychiatry that I know the I know from the medical 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.129
 world 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.129
 that is nothing new to me, I love being there 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.250
 parkpop open 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.910
 that has calculated that I am allowing myself to eat like police boats 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:10.749
 You understand this the equipment of emotional value and I want my busy like that 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:14.139
 not all fine but then which other culprit nobody else came 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.139
 I think I can help him 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:25.620
 I have the how do you think the pole was driving the chord from which came in a row 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:31.250
 9 I understand that too 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.479
 thus could simply continue sending me on 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:38.879
 therefore simple way it was much easier for me may be easier 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.879
 you say 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:45.969
 but then 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:48.769
 now that was just fine 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.769
 jesus christ with a firearm 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.329
 the final version ready 

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:00.439

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.279

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:05.499
 I was still making a phone call 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:08.499
 I don't mind at all that you are you but you don't have to 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:09.849
 the order in 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.589
 not on the receipt for the next round 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:16.530
 I can do that I have to go back a bit later in the week of the debate 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.780
 until now, good payments were made 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.289
 I am almost out for myself now I am going to discuss some people 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.449
 and then I call him 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.449
 from what 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:41.479
 but I have been searching all my time for what he thought was the best 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.029
 and series that is called green 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:46.650
 that was renault 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.569
 washing man 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:48.759
 that goal and then 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.869
 I am only four playing the leading role one of them the ball has a chicken curry 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:58.509
 and those actors were those who aim and am fit again and so I never know if pibn 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.920
 Chicken curry played over the ball is a court number four in Belgium 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.279
 keeper played 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:07.849
