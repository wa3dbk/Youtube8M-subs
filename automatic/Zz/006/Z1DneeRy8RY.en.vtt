the<00:01:58.439> next<00:01:58.860> compartment<00:01:59.420> here<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:01.229> actually

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
the next compartment here is actually

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.690 
the next compartment here is actually
quite<00:02:01.619> big<00:02:01.890> but<00:02:01.920> what<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.159> really<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.549> that

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
quite big but what I really like is that

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.039 
quite big but what I really like is that
it's<00:02:02.880> actually<00:02:03.000> got<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> bit<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.509> stopper

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
it's actually got a bit of a stopper

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.810 
it's actually got a bit of a stopper
here<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.710> you'll<00:02:04.920> be<00:02:05.009> able<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.189> see<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.640> you

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
know if you have this full of stuff and

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.240 
know if you have this full of stuff and
you<00:02:07.259> happen<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.530> open<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.799> up<00:02:07.890> it's<00:02:08.009> not<00:02:08.099> just

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
you happen to open it up it's not just

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.710

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
stuff out because that would be the

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.720 
stuff out because that would be the
worst<00:02:11.220> especially<00:02:11.760> consider<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.420> might

want to carry your water and this
backpack<00:05:23.110> in<00:05:23.590> my<00:05:23.650> opinion<00:05:24.160> is<00:05:24.400> kind<00:05:24.639> of

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
backpack in my opinion is kind of

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.580 
backpack in my opinion is kind of
limited<00:05:24.880> for<00:05:25.270> space<00:05:25.539> so<00:05:25.810> tossing<00:05:26.199> on<00:05:26.289> a<00:05:26.350> water

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
limited for space so tossing on a water

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.620 
limited for space so tossing on a water
bottle<00:05:26.830> is<00:05:27.039> taking<00:05:27.370> up<00:05:27.490> precious<00:05:27.760> space<00:05:28.000> but

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
bottle is taking up precious space but

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.960 
bottle is taking up precious space but
you<00:05:28.750> might<00:05:28.900> need<00:05:29.050> for<00:05:29.110> other<00:05:29.410> books<00:05:29.740> and

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
you might need for other books and

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.050 
you might need for other books and
things<00:05:30.970> of<00:05:31.510> that<00:05:31.570> nature<00:05:32.010> so<00:05:33.010> anyways<00:05:33.940> with

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
things of that nature so anyways with

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.520 
things of that nature so anyways with
that<00:05:34.180> said<00:05:34.419> so<00:05:34.539> the<00:05:34.630> back<00:05:34.810> is<00:05:35.080> obviously

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
that said so the back is obviously

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.129 
that said so the back is obviously
really<00:05:36.099> really<00:05:36.400> padded<00:05:36.580> as<00:05:36.849> well<00:05:37.060> very<00:05:37.840> very

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
really really padded as well very very

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.020

the backpack here however this confused

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.040 
the backpack here however this confused
me<00:06:06.400> for<00:06:06.430> the<00:06:06.639> first<00:06:06.760> a<00:06:06.910> little<00:06:06.970> bit<00:06:07.240> I<00:06:07.419> wasn't

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
me for the first a little bit I wasn't

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.390 
me for the first a little bit I wasn't
quite<00:06:08.320> sure<00:06:08.349> what<00:06:08.500> it<00:06:08.740> was<00:06:08.830> because<00:06:09.070> it's

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
quite sure what it was because it's

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.219 
quite sure what it was because it's
about<00:06:09.580> velcro<00:06:10.120> as<00:06:10.270> well<00:06:10.510> and<00:06:10.810> it<00:06:10.960> kind<00:06:11.080> of

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
about velcro as well and it kind of

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:12.960 
about velcro as well and it kind of
comes<00:06:11.440> undone<00:06:11.889> and<00:06:12.400> I<00:06:12.460> was<00:06:12.580> wondering<00:06:12.820> what

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
comes undone and I was wondering what

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.210 
comes undone and I was wondering what
the<00:06:13.120> heck<00:06:13.150> could<00:06:13.510> that<00:06:13.570> be<00:06:13.900> four<00:06:14.169> but<00:06:14.410> I<00:06:14.440> sort

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
the heck could that be four but I sort

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.560 
the heck could that be four but I sort
of<00:06:15.280> came<00:06:15.430> to<00:06:15.580> my<00:06:15.669> own<00:06:15.820> conclusion<00:06:16.360> that<00:06:16.449> it's

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
of came to my own conclusion that it's

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.659 
of came to my own conclusion that it's
meant<00:06:16.780> for<00:06:16.870> luggage<00:06:17.680> if<00:06:17.889> you're<00:06:18.070> going<00:06:18.430> on<00:06:18.639> a
