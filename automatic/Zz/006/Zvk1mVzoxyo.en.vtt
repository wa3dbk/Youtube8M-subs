00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:03.810
 So I think so with the iPad you can work wonderfully now I'm just 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.990
 someone who works a lot on the internet so i have my notes on the net 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.369
 I have many applications as I used over the Internet and then 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:16.960
 Of course super suitable for writing you have to say percent to say that 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.640
 this keyboard is not a full-fledged keyboard so value is ten fingers 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.900
 can write 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.080
 here I have to get used to her a little bit, also solved for example 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.300
 Percent are not on the keyboard so I have to hold on and extra 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.640
 then comes that wants so I can not write with my fingers and now 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.450
 That's why the keyboard is really great 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.860
 Even with longer texts, it has so far no problems what to write 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.650
 even though Aaron does not like that, he can also use an external keyboard 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.060
 connect there is 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.440
 he is also one for the iPad 2 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.379
 but I had to fl ange keyboard or who already so Aigner 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.420
 cordless keyboard has bluetooth keyboard can connect with the iPad and 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.429
 then came on 4 quite normal to write this and then you dive the text 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.100
 may therefore 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.460
 that is also possible 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.420
 if you do not use the custom I would not use it on the go 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.119
 For example, which keyboard certainly can not take 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.110
 and at home 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.020
 then write longer stuff then maybe more on the Main 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.990
 Fechner as a disease so larger texts I do not remember who his 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.409
 Criminals always want to start writing so the music is good 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:24.700
 superior but do that 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.250
 otherwise, there are many applications familiar with how you naturally feel 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.080
 must buy 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.350
 The harvest will enable a productive work there in the text 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.220
 Processing There is more spreadsheet there is more 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.870
 Presentation software 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.710
 the percent can be used very well here that he really in 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.510
 clever doing it is but at the end 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.320
 Send May and Experiment Â«I can on an online platform 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.660
 or I can export it and then just as a PDF or 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.430
 as words time and then announce that is very convenient because I finally 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.220
 stored on it my lyrics then but rather cumbersome percent on 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.570
 The computer can then transfer via iTunes 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.840
 And sending it off via the web is the better way, but then it will be 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.559
 a very clever solution 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:14.059
 if I'm now percent on the way the presentation would have done the 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.519
 EnAW present then I can get the adapter for 30 euros 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.580
 the VGH gave the Apple buy or 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.119
 he has you just take an old one 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:26.789
 Cable shapes Alcott I have left here so that you can do it too 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:30.939
 connect the TV and then I can, for example, my pictures here 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.190
 present or 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.840
 a presentation states what the unfortunately with it or video from 20 o'clock we 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.600
 do 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.689
 which unfortunately does not work I can not show their website now 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.669
 or anything else placed on the display that does not work me 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:46.460
 can only 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.869
 Show videos 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:50.820
 Percent of either the stored or youtube videos 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.290
 I can show pictures and in Kiel or the display and educational program 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.769
 leave on it 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.840
 But as I said in the middle of May, I got it off yet 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.669
 dpa is synonymous 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:02.509
 and explains a solution
