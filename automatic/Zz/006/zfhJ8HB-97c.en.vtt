review today we're going to be shooting
three<00:00:25.590> different<00:00:25.950> arrows<00:00:26.120> one<00:00:27.120> area<00:00:27.390> was

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
three different arrows one area was

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.920 
three different arrows one area was
going<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.690> be<00:00:27.870> we<00:00:28.290> got<00:00:28.440> it<00:00:28.530> marked<00:00:28.830> here<00:00:29.040> at<00:00:29.930> 369

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
going to be we got it marked here at 369

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.960 
going to be we got it marked here at 369
grains<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:32.010> have<00:00:32.130> another<00:00:32.400> area<00:00:32.700> that's<00:00:32.790> going

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
grains we have another area that's going

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.660 
grains we have another area that's going
to<00:00:33.030> be<00:00:33.140> 415<00:00:34.140> grains<00:00:34.470> and<00:00:34.800> then<00:00:35.310> the<00:00:35.460> third

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
to be 415 grains and then the third

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.840 
to be 415 grains and then the third
arrow<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.030> going<00:00:36.150> to<00:00:36.210> be<00:00:36.680> 454<00:00:37.680> grains<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.610> then

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
arrow is going to be 454 grains and then

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.310 
arrow is going to be 454 grains and then
probably<00:00:39.210> speed<00:00:39.480> freaks<00:00:39.780> out<00:00:39.960> there<00:00:40.170> we're

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
probably speed freaks out there we're

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.920 
probably speed freaks out there we're
even<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.650> shoot<00:00:40.890> an<00:00:40.980> IBO<00:00:41.370> arrow<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:42.360> 300

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
even going to shoot an IBO arrow of 300

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.479 
even going to shoot an IBO arrow of 300
grains<00:00:43.140> out<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.500> sixty<00:00:43.890> pound<00:00:44.100> bow<00:00:44.280> just

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
grains out of the sixty pound bow just

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.340 
grains out of the sixty pound bow just
so<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.760> can<00:00:44.970> see<00:00:45.180> how<00:00:45.330> fast<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.870> insanity

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
so you can see how fast the insanity

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.200 
so you can see how fast the insanity
really<00:00:46.650> is<00:00:46.830> we're<00:00:47.520> going<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> start<00:00:47.880> out<00:00:48.059> with

really is we're going to start out with

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:57.140 
really is we're going to start out with
the<00:00:48.300> first<00:00:48.480> error<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.980> 369<00:00:49.980> grains<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:56.820> as<00:00:57.030> I

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
the first error of 369 grains and as I

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.390 
the first error of 369 grains and as I
shoot<00:00:57.420> I'm<00:00:57.660> going<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.870> record<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.530> I'm<00:00:59.250> going

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
shoot I'm going to record the I'm going

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.770 
shoot I'm going to record the I'm going
to<00:00:59.489> record<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.030> write<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.360> down<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.660> we

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
to record it and write it down as we

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:12.440 
to record it and write it down as we
shoot<00:01:01.309> first<00:01:02.309> arrow<00:01:10.700> three<00:01:11.700> hundred<00:01:12.210> and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
shoot first arrow three hundred and

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.149 
shoot first arrow three hundred and
