00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:15.450
 hello today we find ourselves for 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.050
 make a small salad with vegetables 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.730
 of season we will use for that so a 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.750
 little tamari garlic ginger of 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.910
 cabbage mushrooms and carrots 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.120
 so here I am going to use my spiral 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.600
 SRI I make a notch in my card 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.300
 which I have here like this to do 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.249
 not make spaghetti too much to make a 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.219
 little earlier noodles years and more 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:47.550
 it's more practical to eat here 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:52.920
 so I block my carrots and that's 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.499
 left to enjoy but we will be there 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.420
 to say carrot noodles 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:01:01.739
 so here I go spiral y zemmama 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.559
 whole carrots game there especially in 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.329
 my container then I cut them 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.579
 but the little mushrooms of paris 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:15.360
 so I love using the champions of 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:17.490
 paris gr marriner vintage nature here 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.670
 I like but I like to eat 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.670
 mushrooms 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:26.930
 then once my mushrooms 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.899
 will all be sliced 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.240
 I'll go to cabbage raves so the 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.950
 unemployment I would have peeled it before because 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.710
 the skin on the outside is a little bit 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.549
 thick and there is no absolutely and I 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.759
 am going to cut in hamel finals for 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.679
 then the details and in battery then 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.859
 watch your fingers see you 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.479
 as I put my hands when we arrive 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.250
 in the end like that we hold each 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.560
 side is doing that 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.179
 gently so as not to take chances and 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.149
 so then to cut sticks 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.799
 we tighten all these slats 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.880
 we go in and slide 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.280
 the blade along which of his fingers 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:18.840
 here 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:21.160
 it's to do that cautiously so here 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.890
 I can tell you two little words about 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.630
 the tamari which is a fermentation so 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.580
 of soy then to use so 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.260
 parsimonious like that you wait it's 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.890
 true that it is good the blow 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:40.030
 salads 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:43.630
 here is always the same a little de die 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.760
 hard and ginger that I crush then 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.110
 I put them in equal proportions 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.220
 is it not about the same weight of 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:56.580
 Daidou slightly to not that there 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.580
 have one that outweighs the other 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.530
 so hurry up there really is a super 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.269
 practice has a good grip it 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:14.910
 and he's pretty powerful it's a model 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.910
 from ikea 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:34.960
 and now I'm adding a 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:42.070
 soup spoon of tamari and a 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:43.690
 judo soup spoon read good here is me 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:49.540
 I do not make a drama to use it 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:51.220
 olive oil or tamari so we 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.410
 rest is one of the proportions 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.700
 Reasonable and eat lemon 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.700
 so this preparation at play of 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.380
 mixes and I'm going to put her married to 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.570
 fridge or at room temperature 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.700
 now you have only fine left and 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.400
 your preparation while waiting for the moment 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.820
 dressing your plates 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.760
 you can decorate this plate so 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:19.000
 with sprouted seeds from small 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.109
 coconut croutons as we had done here 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.890
