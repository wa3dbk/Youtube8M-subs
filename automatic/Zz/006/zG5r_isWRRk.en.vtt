00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.589
 hello, I'm Manuel Oliveres, veterinarian 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:09.480
 the veterinary clinic olivares and of your 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.250
 veterinary point info 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.780
 today I want to take up a little bit the theme that 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.490
 we had left a while ago 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.830
 was the one you'll take from our dogs 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.260
 you will catch them and those of the members 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.019
 forward we had talked about them from 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.279
 some types and today we want to refer 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:26.570
 specifically to ones that are going to affect 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.279
 to the elbow of our dogs 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.800
 these processes that appear in the 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.689
 growth of dogs development 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.730
 are going to cause dark circles that 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.220
 principle, they can be very sharp 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.680
 insidious the dog seems that one day not 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.470
 supports another yes but little by little that 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.379
 support goes going being smaller and smaller 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.730
 and a pretty apparent lameness 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.350
 when our dog has a limp 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.140
 that does not have an origin known as 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.449
 it can be one we see that there is a blow and 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.400
 within two three four days no 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.589
 the process has been solved use some 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.149
 antiinflammatory normal as you can 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.610
 make us suspect that he may have some 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.500
 most important and good process 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.479
 we must investigate what can 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.880
 be its origin then in these tests 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.770
 of lameness affecting the elbow not what 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.360
 will actually originate these tests 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.180
 of development is an incongruence in the 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.390
 articulation is not going to have a good 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.920
 elbow joint and this is good 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.600
 over time a process will degenerate 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.399
 inflammatory and one degeneration 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.729
 osteoarthritis than good because it will lead to a 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.920
 an invalidating problem in our 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.509
 in our dog because these processes that 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.310
 affect the elbow as we can 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.730
 find what is the union of the 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.970
 process with me 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.890
 it can also be the osteochondrosis of 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.140
 medial condyle of the humerus the union of the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.970
 medial condyle of the humerus 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.830
 fragmentation of the choroidal process 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.720
 medial because all this type of processes 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.250
 with these names are so rare at the end 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.260
 and finally, what they are going to originate is a 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.410
 poor congruence of the articulation of 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.080
 elbow and the limp that will originate with 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.640
 them then good when we said 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.140
 before a dog does not answer with a 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.000
 conventional treatment because we will have 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.350
 to investigate and well then, if we have 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.850
 to contact our veterinarian 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.220
 trust because you have to get to the 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.780
 process diagnosis many times 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.000
 perhaps most will require the 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.010
 sedation of our dogs to be able 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.840
 do an x-ray once we have 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.340
 located the problem already at the level of 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.160
 this box can try to make a 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.600
 X-ray and positioning the dog in 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.670
 a posture that they are uncomfortable or 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.709
 even painful and then well then 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.300
 it requires that little sedation to 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.060
 can handle it and make a radiation of 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.100
 quality because there are some of these 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.930
 processes that are a difficult diagnosis 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.450
 despite good of the limp so 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.130
 apparent that shows the animal then the 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.690
 injury is so tiny that it is very 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.940
 difficult to appreciate even with a 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.980
 good quality 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.630
 Once diagnosed and how 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.970
 process well then one will have a 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.350
 conservative treatment treatment 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.070
 doctor then based on anti-inflammatories 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.070
 analgesics and with two protectors for 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.590
 help protect the structures of 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.900
 this articulation and other times because the 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.010
 treatment is going to be surgical 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.130
 depending on the process they will be taken 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.050
 will go towards a treatment towards another and 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.700
 even though we have resorted to the 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.590
 surgery because many times we also go 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.270
 to have to resort to treatment 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.120
 protective control because that 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.030
 articulation will already be touched 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.140
 damaged forever and even the process 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.090
 may have a slower progress than if 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.270
 we would have operated but nevertheless will 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.640
 to inexorably have a final 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.170
 degenerative joint and good 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.060
 Well, let's try to make that process 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.550
 be as long as possible and of course 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.050
 as slight as possible then good then 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.850
 you know that when we have our 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.310
 but with a limp that does not respond to 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.080
 a normal treatment in 34 days always 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.300
 we must consult our 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.280
 veterinarian so nothing then we 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.770
 East makes that process can have and 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.750
 Well, what can we do? 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.190
 already known other ways that then we 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.750
 you have at your disposal in the 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:59.570
 contact phone that appears in 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:00.680
 our clinic www.twitter.com yes 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.900
 you have any doubt you already know that 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.180
 You can consult there and hope these 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.480
 talks have been useful 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.480
 Thank you
