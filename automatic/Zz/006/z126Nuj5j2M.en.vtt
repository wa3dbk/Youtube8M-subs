00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
it's kind of an old-school technique but

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.629 
it's kind of an old-school technique but

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
something I'm going to concentrate on

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.550 
something I'm going to concentrate on
and<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.920> upcoming<00:00:17.430> matches<00:00:17.760> vs<00:00:18.420> mages<00:00:18.900> so

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
and the upcoming matches vs mages so

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.529 
and the upcoming matches vs mages so
Katie<00:00:20.010> got<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> quick<00:00:20.490> snap<00:00:20.760> off<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
Katie got a quick snap off on the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.540 
Katie got a quick snap off on the
paladin<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.410> went<00:00:22.529> ahead<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.859> removed<00:00:23.220> a

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
paladin so I went ahead and removed a

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.060 
paladin so I went ahead and removed a
bunch<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.850> his<00:00:24.029> buffs<00:00:24.320> then<00:00:25.320> he<00:00:25.439> returns<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
bunch of his buffs then he returns the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.660 
bunch of his buffs then he returns the
SAP<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:27.199> mage<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.650> then<00:00:28.830> goes<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.010> town<00:00:29.340> on

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
SAP on the mage and then goes to town on

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.819 
SAP on the mage and then goes to town on
the<00:00:29.939> paladin<00:00:32.420> so<00:00:33.420> right<00:00:33.600> there<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.200> an<00:00:34.469> example

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
the paladin so right there is an example

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.190 
the paladin so right there is an example
of<00:00:35.780> shadow<00:00:36.780> or<00:00:36.930> death<00:00:37.140> machine<00:00:38.719> basically<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
of shadow or death machine basically the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.260 
of shadow or death machine basically the
idea<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.620> about<00:00:40.980> halfway<00:00:41.219> through<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.969> cast

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
idea is about halfway through the cast

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.180 
idea is about halfway through the cast
of<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.570> polymorph<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.410> cast<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.860> shadow<00:00:44.040> or

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
of the polymorph you cast a shadow or

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.549 
of the polymorph you cast a shadow or
death<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.000> mage<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.719> then<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.960> reflected

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
death on the mage and then the reflected

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.740 
death on the mage and then the reflected
damage<00:00:47.010> since<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.340> doesn't<00:00:47.489> kill<00:00:47.820> him<00:00:48.059> breaks

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
damage since it doesn't kill him breaks

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.100 
damage since it doesn't kill him breaks
your<00:00:48.870> sheep<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:51.000> really<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> big<00:00:51.750> point<00:00:52.050> of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
your sheep and really the big point of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.930 
your sheep and really the big point of
this<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.440> get<00:00:52.680> out<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.039> first<00:00:53.309> really

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
this is to get out of that first really

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.750 
this is to get out of that first really
long<00:00:54.180> duration<00:00:54.870> sheep<00:00:58.370> one<00:00:59.370> thing<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.579> noticed

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
long duration sheep one thing I noticed

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.689 
long duration sheep one thing I noticed
here<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.300> left<00:01:00.480> Katie<00:01:00.920> bound<00:01:01.920> way<00:01:02.280> too<00:01:02.340> long

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.219 
here is I left Katie bound way too long
there<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.059> should<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.449> had<00:01:03.570> him<00:01:03.719> dispelled

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
there I should have had him dispelled

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.800 
there I should have had him dispelled
earlier<00:01:04.619> than<00:01:04.920> that

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810
