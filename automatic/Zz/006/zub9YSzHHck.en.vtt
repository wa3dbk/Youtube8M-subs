00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:07.469
 we talk about rumba at 780 probably the 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:11.200
 best domestic robot in circulation 

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:13.089
 produced by the leading company robots in 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.480
 this type of product produces robots 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:18.490
 since 1990 first with robots intended for 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.220
 go to the moon or the robot for use 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.560
 military intended to de-mining and eventually 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.830
 worldwide success has come with a 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.320
 vacuum cleaner robot from the video already 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.129
 see something special like the 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.280
 robot does not fall from the table faith towards sta 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.809
 turning around and why it's two 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.239
 integrated cameras that make them 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.100
 understand if he knows where the void is and then the 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.199
 prevent falling for example from 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.730
 scales or soap a table put me it 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.120
 for example, I put on the tables of 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.980
 work and to give a police and does not fall 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.149
 never from the table and while this was the 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.340
 first proof that I did thousands in 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.620
 distinct from who I speak because I say 500 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.570
 of stuff that actually falls later on 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.579
 I put it at the top, in confidence 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.739
 in the closet and but clean the top 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.080
 of the closet where usually not not 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.720
 I never cleaned without a problem 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.330
 therefore it applies to 40 different types of 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.549
 behavior can make board edge pass 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.740
 in the middle by the mayor the king a series of 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.240
 behaviors that hardly 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.880
 explainable that is done based on a 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.579
 statistical calculation that the designers 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.780
 of the robots they put inside 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.500
 of the robot 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.229
 in addition to the type of behavior that a 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.149
 depending on the various situations therefore if 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.040
 find what your leg thinks 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.290
 of a chair or if I identify what 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.320
 be it the edge of a room or if 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.729
 identifies a carpet and therefore causes 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.560
 the wheels get up so that 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.200
 He can rise from the carpet back down 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.579
 from the carpet to the behaviors it applies 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.469
 when he thinks he's stuck 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.930
 compared to the low surface then 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.950
 they reverse in a certain way 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.969
 therefore a whole series of behaviors 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.860
 which are induced by following 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.549
 probably model models 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.530
 mathematicians 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.590
 I'll show you how it's done below 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.020
 we see 3 brushes a space from 10 to 3 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.700
 arms that collect dirt 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.500
 also from the corners even from the edge of the 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.830
 wall and make sure I'm dirty go to 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.870
 end up in the middle 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.260
 to keep in the middle it will then pass between 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.970
 to these two spaces but towards the high one 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.950
 of tires therefore also holds i 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.020
 smaller pieces and the other one throws 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.760
 in between and between these two brushes 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.220
 acts the vacuum cleaner which is a lot 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.990
 powerful then three space that do yes 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.420
 that dirt gets trapped 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.120
 in the middle and the middle there is a vacuum cleaner 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.820
 everything is then put into the 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.460
 drawer that we now see lights up 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.260
 my left one sees rumba for the first 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.060
 time might say but how to put it 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.160
 half an hour to make substance I do it 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.350
 not five minutes and it could be 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.290
 also true this idea that honors 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.320
 but the big difference is that it is the 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.840
 roomba that makes the room and it's not you who 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.120
 the room is the roomba that can enter 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.459
 running alone while you are not in 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.650
 home or if not you can operate a 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.380
 rumble and then go out or put it in one 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.110
 room and also big difference is 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.610
 which is the roomba will clean in such a way 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.770
 that you are absolutely not able 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.810
 with a normal vacuum cleaner with one 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.200
 normal broom to do because the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.670
 technology of these brushes 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.410
 as they are made they succeed in gathering 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.970
 a quantity of dirt that is 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.610
 impressive 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.800
 for this reason I invite you to read the 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.530
 reviews you find on amazon or on 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.840
 any other site because tina one 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.970
 he does not see it in action cannot be rendered 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.370
 account you want him to pass a room that 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.120
 you think you've cleaned more than that 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.450
 can 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.250
 a minute before and you will see rumba succeed 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.280
 the same to collect the drawer 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.680
 full of dust because it is really the 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.860
 how he acts under the carpets that 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.590
 it's awesome maintenance consists 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.200
 in changing when you wear the three e 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.950
 brushes in definitely emptying the 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.959
 drawer to clean the filters 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.510
 every now and then I do it with the compressor 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.310
 can also do manually and the battery 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.739
 which however very good and I own 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.170
 this appliance for almost two 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.680
 years and still is fine I think that 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.380
 will last 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.480
 long hour 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.580
 video I did a test against another 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.230
 always rumba appliance that 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.900
 however it cost half compared to 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.390
 work version that at 180 and I must say 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.970
 which eventually cleanse clean 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.030
 both however the 7 80 in addition to data of the 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.530
 extra accessories that are a base that 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.680
 prevents it from going to a particular one 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.970
 room there are limits to the areas and art 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.780
 the remote control 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.980
 actually it's really better like 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.750
 appliance is clear however it costs 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.830
 costs twice as much as for example 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.470
 cheaper versions 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.540
 in short this is a product tested by 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.850
 thousand and cini recommended by a thousand and 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.510
 Chinese somehow I was there 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:56.560
 useful let me an italic inch in 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:05:01.890
 on and I leave the link in description 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.890
 for amazon links in descriptions
