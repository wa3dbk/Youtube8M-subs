to the first generation the dimensions
are<00:00:41.850> basically<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.210> same<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.600> height<00:00:42.780> width

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079

are basically the same the height width
and<00:00:43.110> depth<00:00:43.440> are<00:00:43.680> almost<00:00:44.190> identical<00:00:44.390> but<00:00:45.390> the

and depth are almost identical but the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.970 
and depth are almost identical but the
difference<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.840> will<00:00:45.899> notice<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.379> going<00:00:46.800> to

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
difference you will notice is going to

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.590 
difference you will notice is going to
be<00:00:47.129> with<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.520> weight<00:00:47.820> where<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.420> new

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
be with the weight where this new

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.450 
be with the weight where this new
generation<00:00:48.750> iPad<00:00:49.469> Mini<00:00:49.680> comes<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.070> at<00:00:50.190> point

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
generation iPad Mini comes in at point

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.279 
generation iPad Mini comes in at point
seven<00:00:50.730> three<00:00:50.940> pounds<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.960> previous

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
seven three pounds and the previous

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.080 
seven three pounds and the previous
generation<00:00:52.350> came<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.070> at<00:00:53.219> point<00:00:53.550> six<00:00:53.940> eight

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
generation came in at point six eight

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.760 
generation came in at point six eight
pounds<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.020> reason<00:00:55.170> for<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.530> weight

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
pounds and the reason for this weight

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.229 
pounds and the reason for this weight
changes<00:00:56.100> because<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> new<00:00:56.789> addition<00:00:57.210> to

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
changes because of the new addition to

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.420 
changes because of the new addition to
the<00:00:57.539> art<00:00:57.750> where<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.559> iPad<00:00:58.949> Mini<00:00:59.129> which<00:00:59.280> is

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the art where of this iPad Mini which is

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.130 
the art where of this iPad Mini which is
the<00:00:59.550> retina<00:00:59.969> display<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.989> retina

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
the retina display and on the retina

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.990 
the retina display and on the retina
display<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.590> still<00:01:01.770> seven<00:01:02.129> point<00:01:02.340> nine<00:01:02.399> inches

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
display is still seven point nine inches

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.609 
display is still seven point nine inches
but<00:01:03.210> they<00:01:03.329> bumped<00:01:03.690> up<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.809> resolution<00:01:04.439> from

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
but they bumped up the resolution from

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.600 
but they bumped up the resolution from
1024<00:01:05.430> x<00:01:05.580> 768<00:01:06.210> all<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.930> way<00:01:06.990> up<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.170> 2048<00:01:07.979> x<00:01:08.130> 1536

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
1024 x 768 all the way up to 2048 x 1536

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.010 
1024 x 768 all the way up to 2048 x 1536
that's<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.720> make<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.840> difference

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
that's going to make a difference

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.609 
that's going to make a difference
between<00:01:10.640> 163<00:01:11.640> PPI<00:01:12.299> for<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> first<00:01:13.020> gen<00:01:13.260> all

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
between 163 PPI for the first gen all

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.429 
between 163 PPI for the first gen all
the<00:01:13.830> way<00:01:13.890> up<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.150> 326<00:01:15.150> PPI<00:01:15.509> for<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.900> second<00:01:16.259> gen

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
the way up to 326 PPI for the second gen

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.050 
the way up to 326 PPI for the second gen
and<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.979> will<00:01:17.130> notice<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.640> difference<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
and you will notice a difference the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.850 
and you will notice a difference the
first<00:01:18.330> time<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.720> turn<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.470> now<00:01:19.619> having

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
first time you turn it on and now having

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.410 
first time you turn it on and now having
a<00:01:19.920> retina<00:01:20.130> display<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.520> all<00:01:20.759> fine<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.330> dandy

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
a retina display is all fine and dandy

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.270 
a retina display is all fine and dandy
but<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.900> would<00:01:22.080> say<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.439> particular<00:01:22.770> display

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
but I would say this particular display

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.039 
but I would say this particular display
is<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.759> worst<00:01:24.090> retina<00:01:24.509> display<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.930> I've

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
that brought things down that was the

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.630 
that brought things down that was the
quality<00:05:07.960> of<00:05:07.990> the<00:05:08.290> retina<00:05:08.590> display<00:05:08.920> it<00:05:09.310> still

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640
