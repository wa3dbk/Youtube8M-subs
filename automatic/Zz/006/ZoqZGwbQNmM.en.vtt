right<00:00:49.280> from<00:00:49.309> scratch<00:00:49.789> we<00:00:50.239> decided<00:00:50.780> we<00:00:50.899> wanted

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
right from scratch we decided we wanted

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.260 
right from scratch we decided we wanted
to<00:00:51.289> build<00:00:51.500> a<00:00:51.739> high<00:00:52.219> performance<00:00:52.850> sound

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270

to build a high performance sound
reinforcement<00:00:53.539> system<00:00:54.320> that<00:00:54.859> could<00:00:55.010> be<00:00:55.129> used

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
reinforcement system that could be used

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.430 
reinforcement system that could be used
by<00:00:55.460> DJ's<00:00:55.850> that<00:00:56.239> could<00:00:56.359> be<00:00:56.420> used<00:00:56.629> by<00:00:56.750> live<00:00:57.109> sound

companies<00:00:58.039> and<00:00:58.309> we<00:00:58.820> wanted<00:00:59.239> to<00:00:59.300> go<00:00:59.570> for

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
companies and we wanted to go for

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.080 
companies and we wanted to go for
maximum<00:01:00.440> performance<00:01:00.649> which<00:01:01.129> meant<00:01:01.430> that<00:01:01.609> we

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
maximum performance which meant that we

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.880 
maximum performance which meant that we

acoustically inert and we backed it all

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.120 
acoustically inert and we backed it all
with<00:01:20.090> an<00:01:20.210> electronics<00:01:20.870> package<00:01:21.350> that's<00:01:21.830> built

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
with an electronics package that's built

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
around plasti high-efficiency switch

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.520 
around plasti high-efficiency switch
mode<00:01:25.010> amplification<00:01:25.970> for<00:01:26.690> lightweight<00:01:27.230> and

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
mode amplification for lightweight and

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.720

and<00:01:28.300> continuous<00:01:29.300> power<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:29.890> DSP<00:01:30.890> alignment

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
and continuous power and DSP alignment

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.060 
and continuous power and DSP alignment
so<00:01:32.270> we've<00:01:32.690> got<00:01:32.840> digital<00:01:33.260> signal<00:01:33.590> processing

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
so we've got digital signal processing

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.030 
so we've got digital signal processing
to<00:01:34.670> ensure<00:01:35.150> that<00:01:35.480> not<00:01:35.720> only<00:01:35.780> is<00:01:36.260> the<00:01:36.440> frequency

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
to ensure that not only is the frequency

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.610 
to ensure that not only is the frequency
response<00:01:37.210> absolutely<00:01:38.210> perfect<00:01:38.660> but<00:01:39.200> also

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
response absolutely perfect but also

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.770 
response absolutely perfect but also
there<00:01:39.800> is<00:01:39.950> built-in<00:01:40.340> limiting<00:01:40.820> protection

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
there is built-in limiting protection

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.830 
there is built-in limiting protection
and<00:01:42.050> there's<00:01:42.920> a<00:01:43.070> an<00:01:43.700> app<00:01:43.970> available<00:01:44.240> for<00:01:44.630> your

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
and there's a an app available for your

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.900 
and there's a an app available for your
iPhone<00:01:45.230> so<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:45.770> can<00:01:46.010> actually<00:01:46.310> control<00:01:46.670> the

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
iPhone so you can actually control the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.800 
iPhone so you can actually control the
volume<00:01:47.200> remotely<00:01:48.520> so<00:01:49.520> it's<00:01:49.850> great<00:01:50.210> for<00:01:50.240> a<00:01:50.510> gig

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
volume remotely so it's great for a gig

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.600 
volume remotely so it's great for a gig
where<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:51.320> DJ<00:01:52.130> shows<00:01:52.400> up<00:01:52.670> and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
where the DJ shows up and

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.520 
where the DJ shows up and
you<00:01:53.970> put<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.510> let's<00:01:54.870> say<00:01:54.990> it's<00:01:55.110> cocktail

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
you put it on let's say it's cocktail

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.870

case<00:02:22.110> as<00:02:22.350> a<00:02:22.700> wedge<00:02:23.700> exactly<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:24.600> again<00:02:24.990> you

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
case as a wedge exactly so again you

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.140 
case as a wedge exactly so again you
could<00:02:25.560> put<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.160> booth<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:27.000> could

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
could put that in the booth you could

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.080 
could put that in the booth you could
put<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.450> on<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.780> floor<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.709> could<00:02:28.890> have<00:02:29.100> and
