companies<00:00:17.640> we<00:00:17.789> saw<00:00:18.000> exploration<00:00:18.570> was<00:00:18.660> one<00:00:18.779> of

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
companies we saw exploration was one of

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.140 
companies we saw exploration was one of
the<00:00:18.930> big<00:00:19.109> cuts<00:00:19.350> made<00:00:19.619> what<00:00:20.400> kind<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.580> issues<00:00:21.000> is

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
the big cuts made what kind of issues is

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.179 
the big cuts made what kind of issues is
that<00:00:21.300> going<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.570> make<00:00:21.600> moving<00:00:22.140> forward<00:00:22.740> into

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
that going to make moving forward into

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.269 
that going to make moving forward into
the<00:00:23.430> next<00:00:23.609> few<00:00:23.880> years<00:00:24.410> well<00:00:25.410> exploration<00:00:26.160> you

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
the next few years well exploration you

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.240 
the next few years well exploration you
can<00:00:26.460> think<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.820> as<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.539> rd<00:00:28.320> arm<00:00:28.619> if<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.099> were

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
can think of as the rd arm if you were

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.859 
can think of as the rd arm if you were
like<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.519> pharmaceutical<00:00:30.390> company<00:00:30.689> or

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
like a pharmaceutical company or

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.400 
like a pharmaceutical company or
something<00:00:31.260> hey<00:00:32.300> without<00:00:33.300> expiration<00:00:34.079> you

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
something hey without expiration you

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.110 
something hey without expiration you
don't<00:00:34.710> have<00:00:34.950> projects<00:00:35.520> coming<00:00:35.730> into<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
don't have projects coming into the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.060 
don't have projects coming into the
pipeline<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.750> end<00:00:36.930> up<00:00:37.079> going<00:00:37.350> out<00:00:37.440> producing

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
pipeline that end up going out producing

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.729 
pipeline that end up going out producing
cash<00:00:38.309> as<00:00:38.640> an<00:00:38.760> operating<00:00:39.270> mine<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:40.170> if<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.530> go

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
cash as an operating mine so if you go

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.530 
cash as an operating mine so if you go
through<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> period<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.640> three<00:00:42.000> four<00:00:42.300> or<00:00:42.390> five

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
through a period of three four or five

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.990 
through a period of three four or five
years<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.200> very<00:00:43.440> low<00:00:43.710> exploration<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.789> can

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
years of very low exploration you can

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.549 
years of very low exploration you can
expect<00:00:45.390> five<00:00:45.660> or<00:00:45.840> ten<00:00:45.989> years<00:00:46.020> down<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.530> road

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
expect five or ten years down the road

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.380 
expect five or ten years down the road
you<00:00:47.070> had<00:00:47.190> very<00:00:47.399> few<00:00:47.460> money's<00:00:47.910> coming<00:00:48.210> into

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
you had very few money's coming into

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.970 
you had very few money's coming into
production<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.829> be<00:00:49.950> a

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
production so it is this going to be a

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.709 
production so it is this going to be a
troublesome<00:00:50.579> thing<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.120> maybe<00:00:51.239> ten<00:00:51.539> years

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
troublesome thing and maybe ten years

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.360 
troublesome thing and maybe ten years
down<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.989> line<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:53.010> know<00:00:53.100> companies

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
down the line if you know companies

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.740 
down the line if you know companies
don't<00:00:53.670> start<00:00:53.879> picking<00:00:54.090> up<00:00:54.149> exploration<00:00:54.570> again

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
don't start picking up exploration again

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.229 
don't start picking up exploration again
yes<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.680> but<00:00:56.039> being<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.399> explorations<00:00:57.030> I'm

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239

yes it but being in explorations I'm
feel<00:00:57.480> very<00:00:57.690> strongly<00:00:57.989> about<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.739> think

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
feel very strongly about that I think

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.020 
feel very strongly about that I think

coming year I've just been informed

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.250 
coming year I've just been informed
we've<00:02:12.300> got<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> two<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.900> half<00:02:12.989> million

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
we've got a two and a half million

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.940 
we've got a two and a half million

for<00:02:14.160> exploration<00:02:14.489> in<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.450> outside<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.900> mine

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
for exploration in and outside the mine

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.490 
for exploration in and outside the mine
so<00:02:17.209> expiration<00:02:18.209> is<00:02:18.300> going<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.569> be<00:02:18.750> pacing

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
so expiration is going to be pacing

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.770 
so expiration is going to be pacing
along<00:02:19.950> very<00:02:20.280> nicely<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.940> moving<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.629> your

continues there what's near with these
two<00:02:28.709> months<00:02:28.980> well<00:02:29.879> Bolivar<00:02:30.390> we<00:02:31.170> had<00:02:31.410> been

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
two months well Bolivar we had been

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.600 
two months well Bolivar we had been
operating<00:02:33.870> there<00:02:34.019> at<00:02:34.140> about<00:02:34.200> 300<00:02:34.769> 350<00:02:35.220> tons

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
operating there at about 300 350 tons

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.240 
operating there at about 300 350 tons
per<00:02:35.790> day<00:02:35.819> for<00:02:36.120> number<00:02:36.300> years<00:02:36.750> then<00:02:37.650> we<00:02:37.920> build<00:02:38.099> a

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
per day for number years then we build a

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.839 
per day for number years then we build a
mill<00:02:38.489> on<00:02:38.730> site<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.440> starting<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.560> 2011<00:02:41.340> we're

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
mill on site and starting in 2011 we're

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.449 
mill on site and starting in 2011 we're
processing<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.569> thousand<00:02:43.019> tons<00:02:43.230> per<00:02:43.440> day<00:02:43.470> just

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
processing a thousand tons per day just

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.910 
processing a thousand tons per day just
this<00:02:44.610> month<00:02:44.879> we<00:02:45.150> have<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.360> new<00:02:45.750> circuit<00:02:46.049> online

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
this month we have a new circuit online

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.059 
this month we have a new circuit online
so<00:02:47.849> we<00:02:48.030> are<00:02:48.150> now<00:02:48.299> processing<00:02:48.840> 2,000<00:02:49.650> tons<00:02:49.860> per

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
so we are now processing 2,000 tons per

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.740 
so we are now processing 2,000 tons per
day<00:02:50.099> so<00:02:50.730> you're<00:02:50.910> going<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.060> see<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.299> very<00:02:51.540> big

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
day so you're going to see a very big

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.780 
day so you're going to see a very big
increase<00:02:52.140> in<00:02:52.170> copper<00:02:52.680> production<00:02:52.950> from

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
increase in copper production from

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.690 
increase in copper production from
Bolivar<00:02:54.329> and<00:02:54.510> we<00:02:55.349> believe<00:02:55.769> that<00:02:55.799> in<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.579> end

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
Bolivar and we believe that in the end

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.390 
Bolivar and we believe that in the end
of<00:02:56.819> 2014<00:02:57.510> will<00:02:57.690> step<00:02:57.989> up<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.319> 3,000<00:02:58.980> tons<00:02:59.190> per

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
of 2014 will step up to 3,000 tons per

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.600 
of 2014 will step up to 3,000 tons per
day<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.840> Bolivar<00:03:01.349> is<00:03:01.560> moving<00:03:01.920> right<00:03:02.040> along<00:03:02.190> and

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
day so Bolivar is moving right along and

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.000 
day so Bolivar is moving right along and
we're<00:03:02.730> doing<00:03:02.849> exploration<00:03:03.510> they're<00:03:03.690> also<00:03:04.010> the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
we're doing exploration they're also the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.740 
we're doing exploration they're also the
big<00:03:05.250> thrust<00:03:05.549> that<00:03:05.730> accompanied<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.420> where<00:03:06.599> we

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
big thrust that accompanied and where we

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.780 
big thrust that accompanied and where we
see<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.079> greatest<00:03:07.380> or<00:03:07.680> graeme<00:03:08.010> growth<00:03:08.430> coming

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
see the greatest or graeme growth coming

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.170 
see the greatest or graeme growth coming
from<00:03:09.060> is<00:03:09.269> from<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.599> cusi<00:03:10.019> mine<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:11.180> silver

exploration and development and we have

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.640 
exploration and development and we have
for<00:03:21.720> example<00:03:21.980> in<00:03:23.120> 2012<00:03:24.120> we<00:03:24.510> mined<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.410> milled

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
for example in 2012 we mined and milled

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.090 
for example in 2012 we mined and milled
roughly<00:03:26.069> 170<00:03:26.790> tons<00:03:26.970> per<00:03:27.239> day<00:03:27.269> of<00:03:28.100> development

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.500 
looking for more cost reductions what do
you<00:05:35.630> think<00:05:36.550> cost<00:05:37.550> reductions<00:05:38.000> will<00:05:38.150> be<00:05:38.270> a<00:05:38.300> big

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
you think cost reductions will be a big

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.030 
you think cost reductions will be a big
factor<00:05:38.690> and<00:05:39.050> we're<00:05:39.230> working<00:05:39.410> on<00:05:39.680> that<00:05:39.710> at

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
factor and we're working on that at

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.070 
factor and we're working on that at
Sierra<00:05:40.370> to<00:05:40.580> we've<00:05:40.820> reduced<00:05:41.030> our<00:05:41.360> costs<00:05:41.900> of

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080

production<00:05:42.590> at<00:05:43.600> Jericho<00:05:44.600> Chia<00:05:44.810> for<00:05:44.990> example

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
production at Jericho Chia for example

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.920 
production at Jericho Chia for example
from<00:05:45.560> fifty<00:05:45.920> six<00:05:46.130> dollars<00:05:46.490> a<00:05:46.520> ton<00:05:46.640> in<00:05:47.540> the<00:05:47.720> 1st

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
from fifty six dollars a ton in the 1st

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.440 
from fifty six dollars a ton in the 1st
quarter<00:05:48.110> of<00:05:48.260> 2013<00:05:48.520> to<00:05:49.520> fifty<00:05:50.000> dollars<00:05:50.300> a<00:05:50.330> ton

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
quarter of 2013 to fifty dollars a ton

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.750 
quarter of 2013 to fifty dollars a ton
in<00:05:50.750> the<00:05:50.870> third<00:05:51.080> quarter<00:05:51.320> our<00:05:52.220> costs<00:05:52.640> of

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
in the third quarter our costs of

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.520 
in the third quarter our costs of
production<00:05:53.000> is<00:05:53.270> going<00:05:53.420> to<00:05:53.480> go<00:05:53.600> down<00:05:53.630> at<00:05:54.050> cusi

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
production is going to go down at cusi

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.530 
production is going to go down at cusi
and<00:05:54.800> Bolivar<00:05:55.250> because<00:05:55.640> we're<00:05:55.850> increasing<00:05:56.420> the

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
and Bolivar because we're increasing the

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.560 
and Bolivar because we're increasing the
production<00:05:56.980> so<00:05:57.980> everybody<00:05:58.940> will<00:05:59.150> be<00:05:59.270> cutting

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
production so everybody will be cutting

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.660 
production so everybody will be cutting
costs<00:05:59.990> the<00:06:00.680> biggest<00:06:01.100> problem<00:06:01.430> is<00:06:01.520> that

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:01.670 
costs the biggest problem is that

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.430 
costs the biggest problem is that
investors<00:06:01.940> have<00:06:02.180> wandered<00:06:02.660> away<00:06:02.810> from<00:06:03.260> the

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
investors have wandered away from the

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.890 
investors have wandered away from the
commodities<00:06:04.430> business<00:06:04.640> and<00:06:05.120> so<00:06:05.330> it's<00:06:05.690> hard

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
commodities business and so it's hard

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.710 
commodities business and so it's hard
for<00:06:05.960> companies<00:06:06.590> to<00:06:06.800> raise<00:06:07.640> money<00:06:08.030> so<00:06:08.300> if<00:06:08.570> you

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
for companies to raise money so if you

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.040 
for companies to raise money so if you
don't<00:06:08.990> have<00:06:09.200> production<00:06:09.560> in<00:06:09.920> cash<00:06:10.460> flow<00:06:10.790> that

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
don't have production in cash flow that

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.210 
don't have production in cash flow that
what's<00:06:12.050> going<00:06:12.230> to<00:06:12.320> happen<00:06:12.590> is<00:06:12.710> I<00:06:12.890> think<00:06:12.950> a<00:06:13.190> lot

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
what's going to happen is I think a lot

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.040 
what's going to happen is I think a lot
of<00:06:13.400> companies<00:06:13.880> will<00:06:14.030> have<00:06:14.180> to<00:06:14.330> turn<00:06:14.780> off<00:06:14.900> the

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
of companies will have to turn off the

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.620 
of companies will have to turn off the
lights<00:06:15.230> and<00:06:15.440> drop<00:06:16.010> their<00:06:16.190> properties<00:06:16.640> this<00:06:17.420> is

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
lights and drop their properties this is

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.270 
lights and drop their properties this is
going<00:06:17.750> to<00:06:17.840> have<00:06:17.960> a<00:06:17.990> very<00:06:18.110> negative<00:06:18.530> effect<00:06:19.100> in

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
going to have a very negative effect in

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.560 
going to have a very negative effect in
one<00:06:19.520> respect<00:06:19.790> in<00:06:20.300> that<00:06:20.330> it<00:06:20.690> will<00:06:21.160> cause<00:06:22.570> we

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
one respect in that it will cause we

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.080 
one respect in that it will cause we
talked<00:06:23.780> about<00:06:23.960> a<00:06:24.080> dearth<00:06:24.410> of<00:06:24.910> properties<00:06:25.910> and

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
talked about a dearth of properties and

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.750 
talked about a dearth of properties and
diffusion<00:06:26.360> to<00:06:26.540> be<00:06:26.600> brought<00:06:26.840> into<00:06:27.050> production

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
diffusion to be brought into production

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.640 
diffusion to be brought into production
but<00:06:28.760> it<00:06:28.880> will<00:06:29.030> create<00:06:29.650> acquisition

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
but it will create acquisition

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.020 
but it will create acquisition
opportunities<00:06:30.770> for<00:06:31.490> those<00:06:31.580> companies<00:06:31.940> that

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
opportunities for those companies that

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.420 
opportunities for those companies that
have<00:06:32.420> cash<00:06:32.780> to<00:06:33.140> be<00:06:33.830> able<00:06:33.920> to<00:06:34.130> pick<00:06:34.280> up
