00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 one 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.470
 in livestock projects you have in 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.840
 account several factors genetics the 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.390
 management in health but one that is very 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.329
 important since it is considered one of 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.489
 the highest costs the feeding by 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:25.550
 that we're going to see a parenting technique 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:27.349
 which is the grazing of rational whatsapp 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.210
 the engineer braulio quevedo who knows 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.919
 a lot of this is going to tell us what they are 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.200
 your considerations and how you have to 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.950
 work to have good results with 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.950
 grazing whatsapp 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.850
 no no 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.239
 the foundation of production in the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.760
 rational grazing system whatsapp it 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:56.070
 based on respect for physiology 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.309
 vegetable is the grass that commands the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.210
 grazing is the grass that says in what 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.030
 moment has to enter the animal how 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.490
 this behavior of the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.710
 physiology the grass after being 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.179
 cut to tooth by the animal or by 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.149
 machine starts to recover the leaves 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:21.659
 that disappeared through the 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:24.569
 utilization of accumulated nutrients 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.170
 in the root those nutrients come to 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:31.140
 help start the training process 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.170
 of the leaves because there is so little 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.330
 amount of residual leaves the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.720
 photosynthesis that occurs in that 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.479
 instant is very small is very small 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.170
 so that there is photosynthesis is needed 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.530
 of the largest number of leaves each leaf 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.890
 it works like a sensor like a panel 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.770
 of solar energy and when there are few 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.810
 leaves that catchment is also very 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.500
 small and therefore the production 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.830
 vegetable is small the engineer explained 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.170
 because it is important to respect the stages 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.989
 of pasture growth in the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.769
 rational system whatsapp if it will be cut 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:17.430
 the grass or the animal will enter again 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:20.760
 before it accumulates enough leaf the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.310
 root will not have enough nutrient 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.760
 to help grow again 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.459
 vigorous and the subsequent regrowth is going to be 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.040
 very weak very poor 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.010
 the leaves are going to be getting smaller 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.250
 and that is the process that happens in the 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:42.750
 degradation of the pasture if 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:46.560
 We wait for the plant to produce the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.739
 maximum possible number of sheets and 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.000
 begin to start are made is to be the 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.080
 first leaves 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.080
 initials then we would have a great 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.400
 amount of leaves and leaves would be 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:06.240
 in a last point of nutritional value 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.700
 for the animal at that time there is a 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.500
 nutrient balance in the animal 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:16.380
 which is fully utilized in being 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.720
 consumed by it later the 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.320
 engineer lorena quevedo who also 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.600
 works with the rational whatsapp system 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.510
 He talked about what happens with cattle 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.400
 that consume very tender grasses in the 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.470
 establishment two happy we are 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.030
 performing rational whatsapp grazing 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.280
 in this case for the best 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.950
 use of the pasture is done 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.370
 paddock with electric wiring so that 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.709
 the grass can have the necessary rest 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.709
 for example if we use the grass 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.620
 When you have a rest for 5 days, it's not going to 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.290
 have the necessary volume or value 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.530
 nutritious necessary for the animal 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.470
 can take advantage in some cases 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.050
 producers provide the animal with leaves 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.180
 very tender with a lot of protein value and 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.880
 that is lost again by the animal 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.690
 a lot of non-protein nitrogen causes 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.239
 diarrhea and other problems to the animal without 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.030
 However, if it is used in the 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.639
 right time will not happen to us 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.010
 finally the engineer quevedo us 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.919
 showed in a practical way what is the 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.710
 ideal time for the animal to 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:30.330
 consume the grass or so that it can 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:34.290
 be short we have a one a support came out 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:38.100
 of the colonial grass that was growing and 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:41.419
 where a senescent sheet has already formed is 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.289
 a leaf that is drying a leaf 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:47.710
 aged 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:50.680
 after the formation of the leaves 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.970
 the initials begin to lose 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:59.140
 photosynthetic capacity and when 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:02.440
 begin to receive little light and they stop 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:05.050
 produce or carry out photosynthesis or 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:09.010
 they are very inefficient in production 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.710
 of photosynthesis this is the moment in 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.200
 that the grass must already be consumed 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:18.060
 because we are not going to have a 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.060
 plant production improvement
