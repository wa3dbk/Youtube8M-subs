00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.400
 and to compact 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.780
 GarcÃ­a for a dream if charly does things 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.730
 unthinkable means that it is 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.770

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.500

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.830
 Dancing is real 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.830
 lesson that is interesting 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:32.380
 to florence so two notes one by the 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.380
 valley and another by ideology 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.130
 and to be adverse to the stored fas 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.450
 today they were not 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.450
 for love 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:57.070
 the king stayed behind to duty in Spain 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.380
 in catalonia there is where it would take 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.230
 out in a kind of celebration for the 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.620
 married years of King Juan Carlos but 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.050
 the neighbors say that they will not allow 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.450
 that the King of Spain can do the 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.820
 there the monarchs will celebrate 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.140
 within a few days their golden wedding 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.380
 despite being separated from fac 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.200
 The city of Berga is small the city 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.630
 berga is small has 18,000 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.409
 inhabitants and declared the king as 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.409
 ungrateful person 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:37.659
 pure logic what happened in venezuela 23 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.659
 because they beat in venezuela and paraguay 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.200
 the exile rap of the doctor to vain by 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.630
 that group that tomorrow meets the 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.789
 two sides are colonels 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.110
 with guerrillas until we do not 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.970
 let's reconcile and those two Argentines 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.869
 Argentina does not take off because that wound 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.180
 is there 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.080
 and who can reconcile those who 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.300
 they fought 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.030
 then I believe who I fight I do not 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.190
 I think he who says that I fight I do not believe 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.200
 He is saying that it had to exile 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.890
 I know a few who went into exile 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.890
 because they made him 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.250
 more and more inside tremendous debate is 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.290

 crisis or is abnormal because it is a

 inflation due to economic policy 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.720
 normal compared to Brazil 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.849
 by chile colombia or peru that are 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.920
