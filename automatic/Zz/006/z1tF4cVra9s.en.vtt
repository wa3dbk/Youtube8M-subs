00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
here the two front lights compare very

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.589 
here the two front lights compare very
well<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:25.830> mean<00:00:26.189> they're<00:00:26.369> very<00:00:26.490> similar<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
well I mean they're very similar the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.900 
well I mean they're very similar the
notes<00:00:27.840> it's<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.230> little<00:00:28.619> bit<00:00:28.740> whiter<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.429> it's

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
notes it's a little bit whiter and it's

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.299 
notes it's a little bit whiter and it's
just<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.390> tick<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.869> had<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.320> tad<00:00:31.650> brighter<00:00:31.949> here<00:00:32.189> at

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
just a tick I had a tad brighter here at

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.639 
just a tick I had a tad brighter here at
full<00:00:32.489> brightness<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:33.600> Kobo<00:00:33.930> blows<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.469> would

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
full brightness the Kobo blows I would

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.139 
full brightness the Kobo blows I would
say<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.130> doesn't<00:00:35.340> quite<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:35.940> as<00:00:36.030> much

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
say it doesn't quite have as much

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.250 
say it doesn't quite have as much
shadowing<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.840> kind<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.020> see<00:00:37.110> like<00:00:37.230> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
shadowing you can kind of see like a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.869 
shadowing you can kind of see like a
shadow<00:00:37.649> line<00:00:37.950> at<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.190> bottom<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.730> Nook

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
shadow line at the bottom but the Nook

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:39.799 
shadow line at the bottom but the Nook
could<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.210> sort<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.390> have<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> little<00:00:39.719> bit

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
could just sort of have a little bit

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.600 
could just sort of have a little bit
more<00:00:39.930> wavy<00:00:40.140> shows<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.800> little<00:00:41.219> bit<00:00:41.309> more<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.550> a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
more wavy shows a little bit more of a

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.069 
more wavy shows a little bit more of a
yellow<00:00:41.910> here<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.300> hue<00:00:42.570> down<00:00:42.780> here<00:00:42.930> at<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
yellow here of hue down here at the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.470 
yellow here of hue down here at the
bottom<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.590> guess<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.399> Kobo's<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.270> hair

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
bottom I guess the Kobo's is just a hair

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.690 
bottom I guess the Kobo's is just a hair
clearer<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.469> kind<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.890> thought<00:00:47.070> initially<00:00:47.460> that

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
clearer I kind of thought initially that

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.130 
clearer I kind of thought initially that
the<00:00:47.910> nooks<00:00:48.120> was<00:00:48.300> better<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.780> think<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
the nooks was better but I think the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.840 
the nooks was better but I think the
Cobblers<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.649> actually<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.280> little<00:00:50.520> bit<00:00:50.700> better

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
Cobblers is actually a little bit better

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.340 
Cobblers is actually a little bit better
I<00:00:51.000> don't<00:00:51.090> know<00:00:51.210> they're<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.539> similar<00:00:52.170> it's

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
I don't know they're so similar it's

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.660 
I don't know they're so similar it's
hard<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.680> compare<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.219> notes<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.550> has<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
hard to compare the notes just has a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.950 
hard to compare the notes just has a
little<00:00:53.850> bit<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.030> yellowing<00:00:54.449> down<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:54.780> but

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
little bit of yellowing down here but

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.560 
little bit of yellowing down here but
the<00:00:55.500> Kobo<00:00:55.860> Glo<00:00:56.160> doesn't<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.210> mean<00:00:57.449> it's

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the Kobo Glo doesn't but I mean it's

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.779 
the Kobo Glo doesn't but I mean it's
just<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.899> think<00:00:58.109> your<00:00:58.199> varies<00:00:58.500> between

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
just I think your varies between

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.860 
just I think your varies between
individual<00:00:59.789> units<00:01:00.149> because<00:01:00.300> both<00:01:00.480> my<00:01:00.660> other

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
individual units because both my other

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.959 
individual units because both my other
Kobo<00:01:01.140> e-reader<00:01:01.350> 's<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.949> yellow<00:01:02.489> hue<00:01:02.820> at

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
Kobo e-reader 's have the yellow hue at

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.450 
Kobo e-reader 's have the yellow hue at
the<00:01:03.300> top<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.080> actually<00:01:04.379> my<00:01:04.470> best<00:01:04.710> Kobo

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
the top so this is actually my best Kobo

bunch<00:01:23.040> already<00:01:23.340> pre-loaded<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.150> got<00:01:24.360> my

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
bunch already pre-loaded so I got my

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.969 
bunch already pre-loaded so I got my
little<00:01:24.720> are<00:01:25.020> loaded<00:01:25.320> bolts<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.680> here<00:01:25.860> right

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
little are loaded bolts on here right

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.469 
little are loaded bolts on here right
now<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.520> pretty<00:01:26.759> comparable<00:01:27.119> between

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
now so it's pretty comparable between

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.480 
now so it's pretty comparable between
the<00:01:27.570> two<00:01:27.720> units<00:01:28.020> one<00:01:28.710> thing<00:01:28.890> about<00:01:29.070> Kobler<00:01:29.430> is

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the two units one thing about Kobler is

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.050 
the two units one thing about Kobler is
also<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:29.970> go<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.270> here<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:31.439> can

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
also you can go in here and you can

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.429 
also you can go in here and you can
increase<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.270> weight<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.810> sharpness<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
increase the weight and sharpness of the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.140 
increase the weight and sharpness of the
font<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.310> can<00:01:35.430> make<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.670> appear<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.970> lot

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
font so you can make it appear a lot

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.480 
font so you can make it appear a lot
bolder<00:01:36.570> than<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.930> really<00:01:37.110> does<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:38.100> downside

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
bolder than it really does the downside

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.859 
bolder than it really does the downside
with<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.030> makes<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.299> look<00:01:39.420> more<00:01:39.450> rough

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
with that is it makes it look more rough

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.990 
with that is it makes it look more rough
around<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.799> edges<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.549> not<00:01:41.670> gonna<00:01:41.759> show<00:01:41.850> up

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
around the edges it's not gonna show up

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.429 
around the edges it's not gonna show up
on<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.180> video<00:01:42.390> but<00:01:42.630> when<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:42.960> see<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.259> person

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
on the video but when you see in person

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.590 
on the video but when you see in person
I<00:01:43.770> kind<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.640> don't<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:44.970> using<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.299> boldness

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
I kind of don't like using the boldness

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.240 
I kind of don't like using the boldness
actually<00:01:46.079> because<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:46.590> makes<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.920> text

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
actually because it just makes the text

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.370 
actually because it just makes the text
pure<00:01:47.520> appear<00:01:47.939> fuzzy<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.840> kind<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.079> got<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.259> get

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
pure appear fuzzy you kind of got to get

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.190 
pure appear fuzzy you kind of got to get
it<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.649> right<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:50.369> by<00:01:50.579> adjusting<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.960> font

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
it just right just by adjusting the font

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.710 
it just right just by adjusting the font
that<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:53.790> weight<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.420> sharpness

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
that the weight and the sharpness

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.420 
that the weight and the sharpness
because<00:01:55.079> obviously<00:01:55.439> we<00:01:55.770> want<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:55.979> just<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
because obviously we want you just the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.190 
because obviously we want you just the
way<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.850> becomes<00:01:57.119> less<00:01:57.360> sharp<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.899> kind<00:01:58.170> of

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
way it becomes less sharp so you kind of

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.020 
way it becomes less sharp so you kind of
got<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:59.070> sort<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.310> fine-tune<00:01:59.820> these

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
got a just sort of fine-tune these

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.120 
got a just sort of fine-tune these
little<00:02:00.329> sliders<00:02:01.290> here<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.619> get<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.799> exactly

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
little sliders here and get it exactly

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.160 
little sliders here and get it exactly
how<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.369> want<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:02.939> it's<00:02:03.119> just<00:02:03.210> sort<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.540> one

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
how you want it so it's just sort of one

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.569 
how you want it so it's just sort of one
of<00:02:04.259> those<00:02:04.320> advanced<00:02:04.799> features<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.430> note

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
of those advanced features that the note

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.250 
of those advanced features that the note
doesn't<00:02:05.909> have

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
doesn't have

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.840 
doesn't have
with<00:02:06.410> the<00:02:06.500> note<00:02:06.650> we<00:02:06.800> got<00:02:06.980> these<00:02:07.130> sixth

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
with the note we got these sixth

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.540 
with the note we got these sixth
pre-loaded<00:02:08.479> fonts<00:02:08.810> right<00:02:08.990> here<00:02:09.229> and<00:02:10.070> we've

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
pre-loaded fonts right here and we've

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.540 
pre-loaded fonts right here and we've
got<00:02:10.700> like<00:02:10.880> I<00:02:10.940> said<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:11.980> various<00:02:12.980> sizes<00:02:13.220> here

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
got like I said the various sizes here

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.130 
got like I said the various sizes here
and<00:02:13.790> we've<00:02:13.910> got<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.090> three<00:02:14.330> live<00:02:14.570> spaces<00:02:14.990> and

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
and we've got the three live spaces and

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.840 
and we've got the three live spaces and
three<00:02:15.290> margin<00:02:15.680> settings<00:02:16.190> going<00:02:16.580> on<00:02:16.670> there

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
three margin settings going on there

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.490 
three margin settings going on there
como<00:02:17.090> we've<00:02:17.300> got<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.510> lot<00:02:17.690> more<00:02:17.720> a-line<00:02:18.470> and

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
como we've got a lot more a-line and

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.440 
como we've got a lot more a-line and
font<00:02:19.010> adjusting<00:02:19.430> options<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:19.940> mean<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.300> can

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
font adjusting options so I mean you can

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.970 
font adjusting options so I mean you can
keep<00:02:20.630> doing<00:02:20.780> this<00:02:20.960> was<00:02:21.110> probably<00:02:21.290> like<00:02:21.500> 15

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
keep doing this was probably like 15

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.440 
keep doing this was probably like 15
settings<00:02:22.460> there's<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.000> whole<00:02:23.150> bunch<00:02:23.270> of

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
settings there's a whole bunch of

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.300 
settings there's a whole bunch of
different<00:02:23.710> settings<00:02:24.710> in<00:02:24.770> here<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.010> just<00:02:25.160> tap

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
different settings in here you just tap

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.710 
different settings in here you just tap
it<00:02:25.490> it<00:02:25.580> does<00:02:25.730> take<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.090> couple<00:02:26.360> of<00:02:26.420> seconds

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
it it does take it a couple of seconds

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.810 
it it does take it a couple of seconds
to<00:02:26.780> update<00:02:27.680> sometimes<00:02:28.130> I<00:02:28.250> think<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.550> device

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
to update sometimes I think the device

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.130 
to update sometimes I think the device
is<00:02:29.000> frozen<00:02:29.270> because<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.660> just<00:02:29.750> doesn't<00:02:29.990> do

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
is frozen because it just doesn't do

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.110 
is frozen because it just doesn't do
anything<00:02:30.440> but<00:02:30.620> then<00:02:31.190> once<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:31.520> updates<00:02:31.850> it<00:02:32.000> and

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
anything but then once it updates it and

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.850 
anything but then once it updates it and
it<00:02:32.210> shows<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.660> up<00:02:32.750> here<00:02:32.930> see<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:33.230> says<00:02:33.380> updating

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
it shows it up here see it says updating

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.470 
it shows it up here see it says updating
font<00:02:34.070> settings<00:02:34.310> at<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.610> top<00:02:34.820> it<00:02:35.000> does<00:02:35.120> take<00:02:35.330> it

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
font settings at the top it does take it

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.420 
font settings at the top it does take it
quite<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:35.660> while<00:02:35.870> sometimes<00:02:36.200> as<00:02:36.920> far<00:02:37.190> as<00:02:37.280> the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
quite a while sometimes as far as the

quite a while sometimes as far as the
Nook<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:38.000> mean<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.240> just<00:02:38.420> tap<00:02:38.570> it<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:38.900> takes

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
Nook I mean you just tap it and it takes

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.020

like<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.260> couple<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:39.620> seconds<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.040> switch<00:02:43.030> so

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
like a couple of seconds to switch so

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.430 
like a couple of seconds to switch so
I've<00:02:44.150> got<00:02:44.300> some<00:02:44.450> thicker<00:02:44.630> line<00:02:44.870> spacing<00:02:45.170> on

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
I've got some thicker line spacing on

we<00:02:48.590> have<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.770> comparable<00:02:49.190> fonts<00:02:49.490> between

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
we have the comparable fonts between

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:50.470 
we have the comparable fonts between
these<00:02:49.850> two<00:02:50.000> guys

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
these two guys

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.960 
these two guys
so<00:02:51.260> as<00:02:51.620> far<00:02:51.890> as<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.130> goes<00:02:52.190> we've<00:02:52.550> also<00:02:52.700> got

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
so as far as that goes we've also got

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.670 
so as far as that goes we've also got
the<00:02:53.120> justification<00:02:53.870> on<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.050> Kobo<00:02:54.320> so<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:54.560> can

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
the justification on the Kobo so you can

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.230 
the justification on the Kobo so you can
turn<00:02:54.800> it<00:02:54.980> left<00:02:55.160> or<00:02:55.400> right<00:02:55.430> if<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:55.970> don't<00:02:56.120> like

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
turn it left or right if you don't like

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.280 
turn it left or right if you don't like
the<00:02:56.390> weird<00:02:56.570> spacing<00:02:56.990> with<00:02:57.140> full

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
the weird spacing with full

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.380 
the weird spacing with full
justification<00:02:57.650> can<00:02:58.280> just<00:02:58.459> turn<00:02:59.030> on<00:02:59.150> left

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
justification can just turn on left

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.720 
justification can just turn on left
justification<00:03:00.170> so<00:03:00.350> that<00:03:00.560> everything's<00:03:01.459> got

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
justification so that everything's got

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.160 
justification so that everything's got
the<00:03:01.940> even<00:03:02.209> spacing<00:03:02.450> but<00:03:02.720> they<00:03:02.810> don't<00:03:02.959> have<00:03:03.080> the

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
the even spacing but they don't have the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.600 
the even spacing but they don't have the
jagged<00:03:03.350> edge<00:03:03.560> sometimes<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.370> doesn't<00:03:04.520> work

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
jagged edge sometimes it doesn't work

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
jagged edge sometimes it doesn't work
though<00:03:04.820> as<00:03:04.910> you<00:03:05.000> can<00:03:05.090> see<00:03:05.209> right<00:03:05.330> here<00:03:05.390> this

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
though as you can see right here this

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.630 
though as you can see right here this
particular<00:03:05.810> book<00:03:06.200> isn't<00:03:06.410> doing<00:03:06.709> it<00:03:06.830> or<00:03:07.490> maybe

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
particular book isn't doing it or maybe

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.340 
particular book isn't doing it or maybe
it's<00:03:07.820> just<00:03:07.850> updating<00:03:08.420> again<00:03:08.930> takes<00:03:09.200> forever

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
it's just updating again takes forever

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.800

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
sometimes it takes it forever so let's

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.290 
sometimes it takes it forever so let's
go<00:03:27.440> ahead<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:27.650> move<00:03:28.580> these<00:03:28.760> down<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.150> about

go ahead and move these down to about

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.270 
go ahead and move these down to about
half<00:03:29.600> brightness<00:03:30.050> on<00:03:30.170> both<00:03:30.320> of<00:03:30.470> these<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:30.860> don't

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
half brightness on both of these I don't

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
half brightness on both of these I don't
know<00:03:31.340> how<00:03:31.459> well<00:03:31.640> it's<00:03:31.730> gonna<00:03:31.790> show<00:03:32.030> up<00:03:32.120> in<00:03:32.239> the

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
know how well it's gonna show up in the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.400 
know how well it's gonna show up in the
lighting<00:03:32.570> in<00:03:32.630> this<00:03:32.720> particular<00:03:33.110> room<00:03:33.230> because

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
lighting in this particular room because

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.890 
lighting in this particular room because
it's<00:03:33.530> not<00:03:33.620> too<00:03:33.800> dark<00:03:34.390> but<00:03:35.390> these<00:03:35.600> are<00:03:35.750> both

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
it's not too dark but these are both

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.990 
it's not too dark but these are both
about<00:03:36.050> 50%<00:03:36.620> 48<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.280> it's<00:03:37.430> about<00:03:37.550> 50<00:03:37.850> on<00:03:37.940> the

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
about 50% 48 and it's about 50 on the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.880 
about 50% 48 and it's about 50 on the
north<00:03:38.209> so<00:03:38.930> it's<00:03:39.080> definitely<00:03:39.410> brighter<00:03:39.680> on<00:03:39.860> the

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
north so it's definitely brighter on the

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.780 
north so it's definitely brighter on the
Kobo<00:03:40.580> at<00:03:41.150> the<00:03:41.420> lower<00:03:41.750> standing<00:03:42.170> here<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:43.580> Nook

it doesn't even hardly look like it's on

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.390 
it doesn't even hardly look like it's on

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
the button there it's what I should have

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.150 
the button there it's what I should have
done<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:05.060> Kobo<00:04:05.330> it<00:04:05.420> has<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.570> button<00:04:05.810> on<00:04:05.930> top<00:04:06.170> so

done the Kobo it has a button on top so

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.320

let's<00:04:07.190> turn<00:04:07.459> the<00:04:07.550> light<00:04:07.700> off<00:04:07.730> on<00:04:07.970> both<00:04:08.120> of

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
let's turn the light off on both of

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.400 
let's turn the light off on both of
these<00:04:08.420> they<00:04:08.630> both<00:04:08.780> have<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.019> Eaton<00:04:09.230> pearl

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
these they both have the Eaton pearl

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.210 
these they both have the Eaton pearl
screen<00:04:09.680> so<00:04:09.830> this<00:04:09.950> should<00:04:10.100> be<00:04:10.130> pretty

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
screen so this should be pretty

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.640

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
estimated reading speed they've also got

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.850 
estimated reading speed they've also got
translations<00:05:04.160> so<00:05:04.700> the<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.660> Kobo<00:05:06.080> or<00:05:06.290> the<00:05:06.560> Nook

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
translations so the the Kobo or the Nook

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.800 
translations so the the Kobo or the Nook
is<00:05:06.980> a<00:05:07.070> lot<00:05:07.280> more<00:05:07.520> basic<00:05:08.120> in<00:05:08.240> that<00:05:08.360> regard<00:05:08.660> so

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
is a lot more basic in that regard so

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:09.970 
is a lot more basic in that regard so
you<00:05:08.900> just<00:05:09.050> got<00:05:09.170> the<00:05:09.260> table<00:05:09.470> of<00:05:09.530> contents<00:05:09.950> you

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
you just got the table of contents you

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.950 
you just got the table of contents you
got<00:05:10.130> search<00:05:10.400> and<00:05:10.970> you've<00:05:11.090> got<00:05:11.210> go<00:05:11.390> to<00:05:11.420> like<00:05:11.870> the

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
got search and you've got go to like the

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.780 
got search and you've got go to like the
text<00:05:12.350> adjusting<00:05:12.800> options<00:05:13.160> you've<00:05:13.610> got

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
text adjusting options you've got

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.750 
text adjusting options you've got
bookmarks<00:05:14.390> that<00:05:14.570> pretty<00:05:14.990> much<00:05:15.110> is<00:05:16.070> everything

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
bookmarks that pretty much is everything

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.340 
bookmarks that pretty much is everything
so<00:05:16.970> we've<00:05:17.210> also<00:05:17.390> got<00:05:17.660> like<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:17.990> on-screen

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
so we've also got like the on-screen

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.590 
so we've also got like the on-screen
stuff<00:05:18.590> where<00:05:18.770> if<00:05:18.890> you<00:05:19.150> hold<00:05:20.150> down<00:05:20.270> on<00:05:20.420> a<00:05:20.450> word

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
stuff where if you hold down on a word

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.930 
stuff where if you hold down on a word
you<00:05:20.780> get<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:21.160> dictionary<00:05:22.160> and<00:05:22.430> you<00:05:22.700> get<00:05:22.850> the

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
you get the dictionary and you get the

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.850 
you get the dictionary and you get the
highlights<00:05:23.300> of<00:05:23.390> notes<00:05:23.630> so<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:24.230> Kobo<00:05:24.500> has<00:05:24.650> that

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
highlights of notes so the Kobo has that

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.890 
highlights of notes so the Kobo has that
as<00:05:24.980> well<00:05:25.250> so<00:05:25.580> as<00:05:26.090> far<00:05:26.300> as<00:05:26.420> that<00:05:26.510> goes<00:05:26.570> they're

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
as well so as far as that goes they're

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.000 
as well so as far as that goes they're
very<00:05:27.050> comparable<00:05:27.380> you<00:05:28.130> can<00:05:28.250> also<00:05:30.010> translate

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
very comparable you can also translate

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.190 
very comparable you can also translate
words<00:05:31.340> on<00:05:31.520> a<00:05:31.550> Kobo<00:05:31.880> if<00:05:32.180> you<00:05:32.390> just<00:05:32.600> hope<00:05:32.930> to<00:05:33.080> do

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
words on a Kobo if you just hope to do

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.880 
words on a Kobo if you just hope to do
this<00:05:33.350> directly

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
this directly

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.940 
this directly
um<00:05:34.130> you<00:05:34.730> just<00:05:34.970> hit<00:05:35.120> down<00:05:35.270> here<00:05:35.950> translation

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
um you just hit down here translation

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.290 
um you just hit down here translation
dictionary<00:05:37.430> and<00:05:37.700> then<00:05:37.820> you<00:05:37.910> can<00:05:38.090> just

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
dictionary and then you can just

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.550 
dictionary and then you can just
translate<00:05:38.630> on<00:05:38.900> the<00:05:38.990> fly<00:05:39.170> of<00:05:39.200> some<00:05:39.440> other

translate on the fly of some other

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.150 
translate on the fly of some other
dictionary<00:05:39.950> if<00:05:40.010> you<00:05:40.070> wanted<00:05:41.710> so<00:05:42.710> the<00:05:42.890> Kobo

if you just want to use it the device

of<00:06:19.940> the<00:06:20.090> advantages<00:06:20.630> I<00:06:20.780> would<00:06:20.930> give<00:06:21.080> the<00:06:21.230> Nook

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
of the advantages I would give the Nook

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.410 
of the advantages I would give the Nook
is<00:06:21.560> the<00:06:21.770> text<00:06:22.100> just<00:06:22.310> appears<00:06:22.640> clearer<00:06:23.060> and

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:23.420 
is the text just appears clearer and

Chris
right<00:06:24.599> here<00:06:24.809> especially<00:06:25.020> I'm<00:06:25.649> a<00:06:26.039> at<00:06:26.159> a

00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:26.189 
right here especially I'm a at a

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:28.489 
right here especially I'm a at a
slight<00:06:26.490> angle<00:06:26.699> in<00:06:27.059> the<00:06:27.509> text<00:06:27.839> it's<00:06:27.959> just<00:06:28.110> it

00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:28.499 
slight angle in the text it's just it

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:29.839 
slight angle in the text it's just it
kind<00:06:28.800> of<00:06:28.830> looks<00:06:29.009> a<00:06:29.069> little<00:06:29.129> bit<00:06:29.339> fuzzy<00:06:29.550> like

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:29.849 
kind of looks a little bit fuzzy like

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:30.589 
kind of looks a little bit fuzzy like
you're<00:06:29.999> looking<00:06:30.179> through<00:06:30.330> it<00:06:30.360> through<00:06:30.569> a

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
you're looking through it through a

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:33.260 
you're looking through it through a
glass<00:06:30.869> on<00:06:31.139> the<00:06:31.229> Cobo<00:06:31.559> the<00:06:32.429> Nook<00:06:32.639> is<00:06:32.759> definitely

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
glass on the Cobo the Nook is definitely

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.699 
glass on the Cobo the Nook is definitely
clearer<00:06:33.599> I<00:06:33.689> don't<00:06:34.050> know<00:06:34.139> exactly<00:06:34.469> what<00:06:34.619> the

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:34.709 
clearer I don't know exactly what the

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:35.959 
clearer I don't know exactly what the
reason<00:06:34.949> is<00:06:35.069> they<00:06:35.219> both<00:06:35.339> have<00:06:35.550> the<00:06:35.699> infrared

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:35.969 
reason is they both have the infrared

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:37.399 
reason is they both have the infrared
touchscreen<00:06:36.539> so<00:06:36.719> you<00:06:36.809> can't<00:06:37.020> blame<00:06:37.169> it<00:06:37.289> on<00:06:37.349> a

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:37.409 
touchscreen so you can't blame it on a

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:38.719 
touchscreen so you can't blame it on a
capacitive<00:06:38.009> screen<00:06:38.249> or<00:06:38.369> anything<00:06:38.520> like<00:06:38.669> that

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
capacitive screen or anything like that

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:40.519 
capacitive screen or anything like that
so<00:06:38.909> for<00:06:39.629> whatever<00:06:39.779> reason<00:06:39.929> it's<00:06:40.289> just<00:06:40.469> a

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:40.529 
so for whatever reason it's just a

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:42.439 
so for whatever reason it's just a
little<00:06:40.770> bit<00:06:40.860> clearer<00:06:41.099> on<00:06:41.309> the<00:06:41.429> nuke<00:06:41.580> screen<00:06:41.939> of

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:42.449 
little bit clearer on the nuke screen of

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:44.839 
little bit clearer on the nuke screen of
course<00:06:42.599> you<00:06:42.749> got<00:06:42.869> the<00:06:43.069> lack<00:06:44.069> of<00:06:44.339> features<00:06:44.699> on

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:44.849 
course you got the lack of features on

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:46.939 
course you got the lack of features on
the<00:06:44.879> Nook<00:06:45.089> so<00:06:45.300> obviously<00:06:45.659> the<00:06:46.409> Kobo<00:06:46.679> was<00:06:46.800> more

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:46.949 
the Nook so obviously the Kobo was more

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:48.679 
the Nook so obviously the Kobo was more
attractive<00:06:47.339> with<00:06:47.459> the<00:06:47.580> SD<00:06:47.939> card<00:06:48.149> slot<00:06:48.419> and

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:48.689 
attractive with the SD card slot and

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:50.239 
attractive with the SD card slot and
some<00:06:48.990> of<00:06:49.080> the<00:06:49.169> advanced<00:06:49.770> features<00:06:49.860> that<00:06:50.069> it

00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:50.249 
some of the advanced features that it

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:52.100 
some of the advanced features that it
has<00:06:50.279> but<00:06:51.119> you<00:06:51.360> know<00:06:51.449> that<00:06:51.719> just<00:06:51.749> sort<00:06:52.050> of

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
has but you know that just sort of

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.239 
has but you know that just sort of
depends<00:06:52.409> on<00:06:52.499> what<00:06:52.589> you're<00:06:52.770> looking<00:06:52.800> for<00:06:53.129> from
