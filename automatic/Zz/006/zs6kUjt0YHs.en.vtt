 let's give it the language of the 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:08.220

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.510
 Well, here, patients want me 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.489

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.380
 installation 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.250
 in these options are always the ones that 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.590
 I recomend you 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.280

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.620

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.140
 complements so that the 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.720
 game so well then you can mark 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.780
 all three does not matter that it starts 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.120
 install them if you do not know anyway 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.660
 If you have them or not , I recommend you 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.370
 give him the Marquises at the end if it is 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.290
 that you already have very good and the child you 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.850
 it will indicate that you already have them 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.390
 so well for those who already 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:15.390
 they have simply giving ending now 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:18.630
 we went back to the folder where we had 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.000
 our our image made us already 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.880
 loaded and now we go to the folder that 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.510
 it's called prophet and well this is very 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:31.080
 important let's check what kind of 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.630
 system has if it's 32 or 64 bits it 's 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.270
 very simple simply start topics 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.060
 as a team you give right click and letters to 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.340
 properties and good here in this part 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.340
 it tells you what kind of system you are 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.110
 using here in the same system and 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.470
 Well once you identify what type 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.980
 of system has he just going to 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:56.580
 the crack that corresponds in my case is 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:00.950
 of 64 we just open this let's go to 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.950
 give him to copy these 2 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.500
 and now we're going to local disk 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.280
 program files and we go to the 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.800
 folder that yes no 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:18.489
 red bagels outlast here in the abyss 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:22.750
 we are going to open the 64 and here we wait for it 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.750
 let's give it to replace them 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.919
 if we want to change it 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.380
 the language of the game so good we will have 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.320
 this 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.960
 let's change it here in Spanish what 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.690
 we keep temporarily on the desk 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.240
 since in good it will not leave us 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:47.140
 move it or modify it and once 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.630
 we pass here we are going to replace 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.380
 continued and ready ok but that's it 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.390
 our crack 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.270
 we can send it to the desktop without 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.740
 no problem and well nothing friends I think 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.240
