damage<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.050> contains<00:00:43.530> antioxidants

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
furthermore it also has squalene

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
it also has an SPF of 43 so I think this

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.150 
it also has an SPF of 43 so I think this
BB<00:00:54.360> cream<00:00:54.480> only<00:00:54.930> comes<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.410> one<00:00:55.440> color<00:00:55.680> just

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
BB cream only comes in one color just

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.029 
BB cream only comes in one color just
because<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.579> cannot<00:00:57.030> find<00:00:57.360> any<00:00:57.870> shade<00:00:58.410> names<00:00:58.739> or

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
because I cannot find any shade names or

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.950 
because I cannot find any shade names or
any<00:00:59.190> numbers<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.059> packaging<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.809> think

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
any numbers on the packaging so I think

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.500 
any numbers on the packaging so I think
this<00:01:01.350> only<00:01:01.590> comes<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.070> one<00:01:02.340> shade<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.329> one

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
this only comes in one shade this is one

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.060 
this only comes in one shade this is one
of<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> first<00:01:03.930> things<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.589> liked<00:01:04.949> about

the<00:01:05.460> BB<00:01:05.790> cream<00:01:05.939> just<00:01:06.240> because<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.380> suitable

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.100 
the BB cream just because it is suitable
for<00:01:07.860> my<00:01:08.189> skin<00:01:08.549> color<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.450> not<00:01:09.659> too<00:01:09.900> dark
