 specially protected only for this Porsche built is certain 

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:12.729
 Dr 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.470
 With the rear-driven GT3 you can really fly the cow but 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.470
 Now let's reassure a few facts for the first time 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.050
 The specific power of the high revs also saw it going well at 415 horsepower 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.880
 still 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.490
 3com a 6 liter capacity grew 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.860
 Reza limit is 8400 turns 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.860
 accompanied by a infernal noise 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.229
 the gt3 possible high speed concept is mainly due to reduction 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.040
 realized the moving masses 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.820
 In addition, an optimized air flow provides a variable intake 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.260
 Plant and an exhaust system with lower back pressure 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.930
 The manual six-speed manual was the larger speed range 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.420
 adjusted by shorter gradings because of two to six 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.350
 an acceleration from 0 to 160 is supposed to get under way 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.560
 Seconds be possible 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.580
 for comparison 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.940
 the new Porsche Turbo with 84 hp, which will soon be on the market 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.900
 Coma 4 seconds only marginally faster 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.440
 the gt3's top speed the industry at 310 kilometers per hour 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.340
 the racetrack suitability underlines the first time at gt3 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.530
 used active suspension so are virtually two suspensions available 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.500
 The basic tuning is suitable for tracks with hair uneven road surface 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.569
 located 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.219
 In sports mode, the system switches to a harder damping 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:18.670
 RWE's traction control system also improves our packs 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.400
 an automatic limited slip differential and a snowmobile torque control 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:27.049
 however, shared looks that have not understood the viewer you can 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.689
 turn it off 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:34.049
 The interior design corresponds to that of the current 9 11 career models 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.539
 However, the emergency seats are in the rear 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:40.419
 On request, lightweight bucket seats made of carbon fiber instead of the 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:41.719
 Order sports seats 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:46.530
 that exactly corresponds to the Porsche philosophy and that of the GT3 buyer 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.530
 no frills 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:58.349
 Incidentally, in the autumn, the gt3 is also offered in a version by it 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.519
 and of course there is again a club sports package for missions in the 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.519
 Motorsport 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.010
 This Porsche is nothing for noisy noisy uncompromising hard and the 400 8083 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.239
 Euro 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.489
 Abandonment can just be this year as well
