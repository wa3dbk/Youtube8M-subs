00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.230
 beautiful girl juan channel for 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.410
 tell you a little about tour net mode 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.750
 which will be implemented with the dlc that 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.070
 will be released in just over two weeks yes 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.770
 disburses while for ps3 and pc 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:29.060
 you still have to wait more than one 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:33.980
 month here and in any case of this of this 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:36.260
 sweaty mode and I tell you two things 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.550
 first, however, it is information and that 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:43.130
 that you have seen on the trailer and more 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.680
 read on the forums while the second is one 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.470
 my theory on the birth of di 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.239
 this mode the first thing we start 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.890
 precisely with this information to the 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.930
 tour will be a modality one mode 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.050
 let's say in quotation marks new but not of the 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.059
 all true in this mode here it will be 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.319
 composed of a maximum of four 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.119
 players and one will be the zombie on 

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:11.539
 high 1 will be the human and the others of 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.159
 zombies when we are just human the 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:16.130
 our goal will be to kill 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.350
 more funds to get more 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.229
 high in the possible ranking of the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.670
 game as it rises when we are zombies 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.479
 our goal will be only 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.310
 that of killing kill the human for 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.830
 to make his place precisely because 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.180
 we are touring because we say 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.280
 when we decide the human he will take 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.110
 We mark our place we roles 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:45.470
 that's how liverpool works e 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.480
 nothing turns even rumors that we say 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.570
 all maps will be unlocked in 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.120
 sense also the dinner here because it was there 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.150
 an image that is precisely enclosed in the 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.740
 trailer let's say there was a piece of video 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.360
 which can be seen in this part where 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.490
 it's me now in the gameplay that 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.770
 totally random where exactly it was 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:09.200
 closed and there was not and there was no bus 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.470
 so this can make us think that it is 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.150
 which will unblock these maps here 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.190
 that I am not that they are not 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.310
 normally reachable after that 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.209
 now I'll tell you a little about mine 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:27.500
 my theory on this mode for strings 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:30.260
 played already exceeded 5 we say the 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.350
 zombies with with fashions with cars had 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.360
 friends like change and lobby and will have 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.459
 surely noticed those extra weapons 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.820
 we say that there are no norms like 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:45.230
 for example the shooting hands and others 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:48.200
 weapons that I don't remember now and it was 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:53.450
 a weapon that was called brain a or 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.250
 brain brain meant that anyway 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.010
 it has something to do with those zombies made 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.260
 we had zombie hands and we could 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.470
 make the screams from the screams from 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.239
 zombies and all the various stuffs 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.760
 probably to developers and 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.430
 like this idea here to get your hands on 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.160
 zombies and so I said but let's do one 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.200
 new mode that has never been seen and 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.350
 just add these hands to us from 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.820
 zombies and we study can not do a 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.190
 something nice and so 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.280
 probably 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.260
 this mode came up 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.560
 here that there are humans and zombies and 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.120
 stuff like that so no guys 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.700
 with that I said everything 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.590
 I remind you to comment here saying that 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.600
 if you will buy it if you have george season 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.490
 pass what you think 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.720
 and no guys in the description ie the 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.510
 my channel I wanted again 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.220
 compliment blue and others as well 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.630
 that you did a nice channel I had 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.210
 seen growing right from the beginning 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.740
 you will remember and therefore no compliments 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.740
 from the web
