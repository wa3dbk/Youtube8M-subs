so<00:00:18.390> before<00:00:18.720> we<00:00:18.840> get<00:00:18.960> started<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.380> want<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.560> make

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
so before we get started we want to make

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.769 
so before we get started we want to make
sure<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:20.010> have<00:00:20.189> our<00:00:20.340> tools<00:00:20.609> together<00:00:20.850> we're<00:00:21.689> in

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779

solder<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.040> wire<00:00:35.250> into<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.760> box<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.450> that

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
solder the wire into the box so that

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.880 
solder the wire into the box so that
there's<00:00:36.840> no<00:00:36.989> chance<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.440> it's<00:00:37.710> going<00:00:37.770> to

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
there's no chance that it's going to

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.119 
there's no chance that it's going to
come<00:00:38.070> loose<00:00:38.930> with<00:00:39.930> an<00:00:40.079> extreme<00:00:40.410> bass<00:00:40.649> note<00:00:40.920> or

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
come loose with an extreme bass note or

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.350 
come loose with an extreme bass note or
big<00:00:41.340> bumps<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.540> first<00:00:42.840> we<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:44.180> make<00:00:45.180> sure

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
big bumps so first we have to make sure

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.910 
big bumps so first we have to make sure
that<00:00:45.480> our<00:00:45.570> summary<00:00:45.989> iron<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.440> good<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.770> hot

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
that our summary iron is good and hot

the<00:00:47.520> mines<00:00:47.760> been<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.120> for<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> few<00:00:48.539> minutes<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:48.960> I

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the mines been on for a few minutes so I

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.959 
the mines been on for a few minutes so I
know<00:00:49.110> it's<00:00:49.320> good<00:00:49.500> fun<00:00:49.710> we're<00:00:50.640> gonna<00:00:50.730> take<00:00:50.940> some

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
know it's good fun we're gonna take some

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.420 
know it's good fun we're gonna take some
electrical<00:00:51.570> solder<00:00:51.980> and<00:00:52.980> we're<00:00:53.070> gonna<00:00:53.160> heat

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
electrical solder and we're gonna heat

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.479 
electrical solder and we're gonna heat
this<00:00:53.579> wire<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:55.170> we're<00:00:55.289> gonna<00:00:55.379> tin<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.010> first

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
this wire and we're gonna tin it first

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.520 
this wire and we're gonna tin it first
that<00:00:57.449> means<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.840> we're<00:00:57.960> going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.140> get<00:00:58.260> hot

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
that means that we're going to get hot

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.990 
that means that we're going to get hot
and<00:00:58.829> we're<00:00:58.949> going<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.129> flow<00:00:59.309> some<00:00:59.550> solder<00:00:59.820> on

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
and we're going to flow some solder on

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.350 
and we're going to flow some solder on
it

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.440 

do<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> same<00:01:06.690> thing<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:07.050> the<00:01:07.170> terminal<00:01:07.620> cook

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
do the same thing on the terminal cook

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:18.510 
do the same thing on the terminal cook
inside<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.659> box

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.610 

then

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.760 

sauter<00:01:21.860> positives<00:01:22.580> in<00:01:22.760> a<00:01:22.820> positive<00:01:23.300> terminal

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.330 

[Applause]

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
[Applause]

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.090 
[Applause]
to<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.460> negative<00:01:30.850> terminal

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
to the negative terminal

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.969 
to the negative terminal
so<00:01:32.700> here<00:01:32.909> we<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.409> positive<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.890> negative

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
so here we have positive and negative

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.510 
so here we have positive and negative
leads<00:01:35.450> soldered<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.870> terminal<00:01:37.260> cup<00:01:37.520> using

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
leads soldered to the terminal cup using

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.380 
leads soldered to the terminal cup using
our<00:01:38.640> solder<00:01:38.880> pencil<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:41.700> our<00:01:41.940> rosin<00:01:42.360> core

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
our solder pencil and our rosin core

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.080 
our solder pencil and our rosin core
solder<00:01:43.880> now<00:01:44.880> we're<00:01:45.030> gonna<00:01:45.619> connect<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:47.090> wire

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
solder now we're gonna connect that wire

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.709 
solder now we're gonna connect that wire
to<00:01:49.020> our<00:01:49.400> 10<00:01:50.400> inch<00:01:50.550> tick<00:01:50.790> or<00:01:50.940> sub<00:01:51.090> woofer

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:56.230 

strip<00:01:54.289> off<00:01:54.520> about<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.579> half<00:01:55.850> an<00:01:55.999> inch<00:01:56.090> of

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
strip off about a half an inch of

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.059 
strip off about a half an inch of
insulation<00:01:56.420> on<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.140> positive<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:57.740> negative

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
insulation on the positive and negative

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.719 
insulation on the positive and negative
wire<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:59.479> make<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.810> connection<00:02:00.609> to<00:02:01.609> the

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
wire and make the connection to the

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.660 
wire and make the connection to the
terminals<00:02:02.210> on<00:02:02.569> the<00:02:02.750> back<00:02:02.929> of<00:02:03.109> the<00:02:03.170> wall

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
terminals on the back of the wall

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.809 
terminals on the back of the wall
so<00:02:04.670> we're<00:02:04.850> gonna<00:02:04.939> make<00:02:05.450> sure<00:02:05.509> to<00:02:05.840> depress<00:02:06.829> the

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
so we're gonna make sure to depress the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.089 
so we're gonna make sure to depress the
terminal<00:02:08.360> far<00:02:08.810> enough<00:02:09.019> so<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.619> we<00:02:09.830> can<00:02:09.979> get

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
terminal far enough so that we can get

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.520 
terminal far enough so that we can get
the<00:02:10.190> wire<00:02:10.369> in<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.610> hole<00:02:10.789> release<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:11.780> that

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
the wire in the hole release it that

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.589 
the wire in the hole release it that
