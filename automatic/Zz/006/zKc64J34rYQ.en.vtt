00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.630
 nowadays a tree is more than evident it is a source of knowledge 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.640
 point since we have always heard that telling the friends of a trunk not 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.679
 we can determine your age 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:18.769
 and so it is 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.929
 Most of our bushes and trees add up to one million more 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:24.569
 to its trunk 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:28.819
 an annual record was formed throughout the life of the tree that reflects the 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:31.819
 climatic conditions in which they have grown 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.820
 adequate humidity and a growing season by the honda bruce rings 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.660
 wide 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.540
 while a year of drought produces a very narrow malena of principles 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.540
 of the period of growth and the end of being different and that 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.870
 makes it possible to differentiate the rings of a tree 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.850
 there are a number of factors publisher growth in such as the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.050
 climate competencies in pollution among others and in the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.390
 as its influence varies from year to year the width of the ring 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.530
 generated is different as a consequence in the trunk is formed by a sequence 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.260
 of narrow and wide children 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.870
 is the science that studies and understands these sequences is called dircom crowned 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:15.970
 lodge 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.300
 the growth rings reflect everything that the tree appeared during its 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.840
 lifetime 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.229
 and the function of the law with prolongation 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.880
 the bird identify the most important events 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.170
 technical visit developed and early 20th century are well studied and 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.409
 Applied from the University of Piura 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.320
 with the aim of making known the theoretical principles and applications of 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:43.270
 this oncology lab technique from the faculty of engineering 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.659
 carried out from February 27 to March 3 the second oncohematology course 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.080
 despite the climate threats 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.590
 participants 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.850
 a field trip 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.390
 in order to apply the techniques of collection of wood samples 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.629
 the place chosen was the long hill 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.159
 this moment of the northern kunduz 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.159
 awarded seven kilometers to the southwest 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.249
 kilometer 50 of the Pan-American North 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:25.259
 about 40 years 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.259
 data from the city of Piura 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.219
 Mmmmm no 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.759
 p 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:40.799
 despite this 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.599
 the task would be prey 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:44.929
 after 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:47.929
 add 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.329
 palm 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.779
 we go 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:54.679
 p 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:56.719
 for example when he wants 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:58.909
 science that 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:04.129
 treat the conflict an environmental leakage parameter 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.529
 that have failed in the past 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:08.039
 analyzing the 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:09.609
 I had order 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.629
 but please our main 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.529
 percent 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.859
 application that we are giving 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:23.649
 halonen from the bottom and here in the north of chile I expect yours the replacement of 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:27.729
 offering the phenomenon of the child throughout this exclusion we are going to 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:29.399
 take samples of 

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:34.629
 the woods of unemployment both in the world two of the professionals 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.809
 Ecuadorians and the five Peruvians who participated in the course learned about the 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:40.750
 Sample collection techniques 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.589
 the rotation of growth assets among other applications of this science 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:49.019
 through an agreement that we have with investments in the red cte 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:53.889
 and the cun ibércia of the year germany 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.229
 in ecuador this 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:59.939
 is trained in this of the dynamic dendrochronology of 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.939
 growth and antonio cremades 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.099
 in which west 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.120
 the pilots 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.120
 yes the swiss 8 Swiss 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.669
 this group 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.799
 rodolfo rodríguez specials has enough research west 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.400
 we do not know 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.819
 this figure 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:24.330
 our peers from the equator that 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.180
 - of the holy children are starting from 20 minutes yesterday 

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:31.050
 the enriching prisoners like 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.380
 of diversity of species that are working in the area 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.120
 in what was considered 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.249
 of the Japanese 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:39.779
 the courts 

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.460
 to confront the investigations 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.690
 the different methods that in Switzerland serve much 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:47.930
 knowledge 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.409
 several people 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:50.990
 the country 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.189
 to get the complete sequence of a living tree you do not have to cut them 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:59.159
 Using a special perforator, a small cylinder is extracted from the beam 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:02.379
 trunk with which all the heights of the andes are obtained 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:11.699
 once the samples were taken, they took a laboratory 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:16.219
 the 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.919
 look well explained 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.389
 ap panama 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:49.759
 in Peru there is nothing that is necessary an increase of this type of 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.729
 studies and research 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.880
 in order to scientifically protect and exploit forest resources 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:57.509
 if we still have
