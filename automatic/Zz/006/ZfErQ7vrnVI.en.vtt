00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:02.880
 Ilya asks the question: "Tell me about 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.300
 trading psychology how not to rush into the entrance 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.650
 and exit 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.659
 when there is a rush 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:12.739
 in a deal, it's always a problem of discipline 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:15.039
 and I probably this is the biggest problem of discipline 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.259
 it means that you don't have an algorithm 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:18.749
 decision making 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.309
 does that mean Ilya what you need 

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:23.379
 overcome this 

00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:25.719
 your psychology is possible by the fact that 

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:27.460
 you will do for yourself 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.259
 rule set 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.460
 which you undertake to honor yourself before 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.519
 a pledge not 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:36.620
 to someone, namely myself 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.900
 write: I will buy then and then 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.090
 here's the signal, here, 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.290
 here and here are such cases 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.460
 Other times I sit hands under the heel 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.930
 do not do anything 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.760
 and this is my rule, I pledge to abide by it 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.700
 and yes you will abide by the rules then 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.150
 Everything will be ok 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.750
 and so it is a fight by itself, without rules here is not enough, 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.960
 reel back and forth 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.700
 it would seem, what could be easier? But precisely 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.570
 this is a simple rule to write it and 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.640
 observe it turns out for many 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.110
 an obstacle 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.630
 need to do something, write a rule 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.850
 take a leaf 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.610
 think what signals I will 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.890
 trade what signals i am i will not trade 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.450
 and it is better to charge someone 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.290
 responsibility is when 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.700
 you have losses and I'm not guilty, but something 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.040
 another, the market is not like that, it entered too early 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.830
 actually our own fault 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.700
 what 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.080
 hurry 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.620
 no guilty 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.440
 just such moments as not 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.430
 want to invest your time in the analysis 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.070
 price movements 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.240
 I want everything at once 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.640
 woke up opened the computer 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.350
 not early in the morning, so I get up at fifteen 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.610
 six (at 05:45 am) 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.420
 doing sports later 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.810
 breakfast, then preparation for shopping 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.710
 Day - two hours it takes me. Then only 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.030
 bidding starts 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.090
 and I'm in good shape 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.140
 and most do 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.710
 woke up at half past ten or eleven 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.770
 stretched something like, scratched 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.209
 watched the news 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.169
 and decided to bargain. And got a loss 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:13.449
 what do you think who will 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:15.599
 more profit that 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.809
 prepared man 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:19.719
 who will take care of themselves 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:21.949
 behavior for their discipline 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.899
 or whoever he is from the noodle decided 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:26.769
 enter a deal 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.919
 discipline is at fault, so with not 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.169
 need to work. Force yourself to do 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:33.589
 certain things 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:35.309
 in order to make a profit 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:37.860
 yes, these things are not very good 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.679
 Yes. who likes to get up at a quarter to six 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:42.709
 Probably no one likes me either. But I know that 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:43.909
 I need it 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:44.930
 in order for a good trader
