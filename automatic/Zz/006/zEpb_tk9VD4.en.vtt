00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:12.690
 I just made the aluminum seal tape to the canopy earlier, but I made it, but one more place 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.730
 this 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.080
 It is a place where it is necessary to stick the aluminum tape for the heat dissipation of the 7.7mm machine gun of the model 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:26.070
 It is a jacket 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:27.310
 Here, I draw an aluminum seal on a pipe to express that heat radiation jacket 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.250
 But 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:36.730
 This seal is that the hole of the heat radiation is well removed by laser cut 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:41.800
 But that part of it is filled up 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:44.800
 So I have to go through all this one hole, though 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.300
 Because it is what bar aluminum tape, it is carelessly 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:52.700
 For example, bamboo skewers Gyuto come in something 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.510
 It distorted the entire If you or the one it is and say how to do Dekoko Iite 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:00.470
 there is 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.699
 First of all this a 6-17 like do this here it is c of the model of the machine gun of 7.7 mm industry 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.479
 Peel off doing 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.320
 I 'm already a little determined at this point, though 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:12.090
 Where is half more than half 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.590
 I have buried this I do not defect so that we one by one remove, but with the way 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.229
 I use masking tape 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:21.600
 Cut the masking tape to an appropriate size and look like the glued surface of the masking tape 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.619
 Here and this 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.970
 I will put together the faces of the jacket method for cooling 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:34.490
 so 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:39.520
 After this, while slowly holding the grass in and out 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:42.470
 I will remove the masking tape I just stretched 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.100
 Then I wondered 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.010
 All this 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:53.320
 I closed the hole in the masking tape 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:57.370
 The tape will remain and this one will not be beautiful 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:03.670
 Water jacket has a jacket of a clay please sorry Nee 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:04.480
 Since you can create as parts This was Do not realistic will be rewarded by winding the pipe is 7 animals order 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.620
 Isn't it 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.620
 Please try by all means try
