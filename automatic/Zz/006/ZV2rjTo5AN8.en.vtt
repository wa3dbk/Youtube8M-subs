I<00:00:10.220> love<00:00:11.220> yous<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.550> welcome<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.480> our<00:00:12.660> first

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
I love yous and welcome to our first

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.350 
I love yous and welcome to our first
race<00:00:13.350> honest<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.100> real<00:00:14.250> then<00:00:14.490> you've<00:00:15.060> seen

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
race honest the real then you've seen

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.680 
race honest the real then you've seen
the<00:00:16.010> go<00:00:17.010> on<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.430> pc<00:00:17.970> set<00:00:18.270> up<00:00:18.480> with<00:00:18.660> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
the go on the pc set up with the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.870 
the go on the pc set up with the
projector<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.290> was<00:00:19.590> done<00:00:19.740> after<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.340> this

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
projector that was done after this this

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.330 
projector that was done after this this
was<00:00:21.029> my<00:00:21.180> first<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.630> go<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:22.290> the<00:00:22.590> circuit<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.279> you

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
was my first to go on the circuit so you

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.130 
was my first to go on the circuit so you
won't<00:00:23.610> see<00:00:23.670> well<00:00:23.970> beating<00:00:24.330> lap<00:00:24.480> times<00:00:24.780> this<00:00:24.990> is

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
won't see well beating lap times this is

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.720 
won't see well beating lap times this is
me<00:00:25.290> actually<00:00:25.410> learning<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.070> circuit<00:00:26.580> I

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
me actually learning the circuit I

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.120 
me actually learning the circuit I
managed<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.120> get<00:00:27.300> one<00:00:27.360> racing<00:00:28.110> so<00:00:28.770> here<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.100> go

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
managed to get one racing so here we go

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.479 
managed to get one racing so here we go
then<00:00:29.520> down<00:00:29.820> into<00:00:30.000> turn<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:31.070> breaking<00:00:32.070> later

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
then down into turn one breaking later

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.160 
then down into turn one breaking later
than<00:00:32.760> everyone<00:00:32.820> else<00:00:33.180> they're<00:00:33.450> getting<00:00:33.930> up<00:00:33.989> on

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
than everyone else they're getting up on

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.140 
than everyone else they're getting up on
the<00:00:34.290> inside<00:00:34.680> which<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.129> nice<00:00:35.370> his<00:00:35.640> next<00:00:35.940> corner

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
the inside which is nice his next corner

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.939 
the inside which is nice his next corner
I'm<00:00:36.420> lifting<00:00:36.660> through<00:00:37.170> but<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.530> can<00:00:37.710> actually

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
I'm lifting through but you can actually

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.670 
I'm lifting through but you can actually
take<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.340> flat<00:00:38.640> out<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.150> now<00:00:40.020> know<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.290> for

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
take that flat out I now know that for

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.479 
take that flat out I now know that for
the<00:00:40.710> future<00:00:41.870> again<00:00:43.040> getting<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.159> brakes

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the future again getting on the brakes

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.610 
the future again getting on the brakes
on<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> inside<00:00:45.300> yeah<00:00:45.659> I<00:00:45.690> they<00:00:46.050> did<00:00:46.229> well<00:00:46.440> to

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
on the inside yeah I they did well to

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.780 
on the inside yeah I they did well to
avoid<00:00:46.769> me<00:00:46.979> rather<00:00:47.460> than<00:00:47.610> smacking<00:00:48.120> into<00:00:48.269> me<00:00:48.540> I

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
avoid me rather than smacking into me I

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.369 
avoid me rather than smacking into me I
have<00:00:50.790> found<00:00:50.940> there<00:00:51.150> is<00:00:51.269> an<00:00:51.360> improved<00:00:51.750> AI<00:00:51.960> so

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
have found there is an improved AI so

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.619 
have found there is an improved AI so
far<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> whole<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.489> not<00:00:53.940> completely

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
far on the whole it's not completely

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.229 
far on the whole it's not completely
blind<00:00:55.110> they<00:00:56.070> are<00:00:56.250> moving<00:00:56.460> their<00:00:56.790> jostling<00:00:57.210> for

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
blind they are moving their jostling for

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.079 
blind they are moving their jostling for
position<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.989> lot<00:00:58.110> of<00:00:58.260> people<00:00:58.409> write<00:00:59.250> AI<00:00:59.489> down

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
position a lot of people write AI down

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.630 
position a lot of people write AI down
to<00:01:00.330> term<00:01:00.690> one<00:01:01.019> they<00:01:01.650> are<00:01:01.830> struggling<00:01:02.339> with<00:01:02.400> the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
to term one they are struggling with the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.490 
to term one they are struggling with the
first<00:01:02.879> couple<00:01:03.089> of<00:01:03.269> corners<00:01:03.479> when<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.290> cars

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
first couple of corners when the cars

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.020 
first couple of corners when the cars
are<00:01:04.650> all<00:01:04.710> bunched<00:01:05.070> up<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:05.610> soon<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:05.880> they

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
are all bunched up but as soon as they

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.660 
are all bunched up but as soon as they
split<00:01:06.360> up<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.630> bit<00:01:06.840> their<00:01:07.500> place<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.770> right<00:01:08.520> up

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
split up a bit their place is right up

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.740 
split up a bit their place is right up
there<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:09.290> anyone<00:01:10.290> else<00:01:11.149> so<00:01:12.149> now<00:01:12.420> trying<00:01:12.719> to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
there with anyone else so now trying to

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.069 
there with anyone else so now trying to
work<00:01:12.930> my<00:01:13.079> way<00:01:13.110> through<00:01:13.259> I<00:01:14.420> like<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.539> circuit

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
work my way through I like this circuit

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.380 
work my way through I like this circuit
I<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> flow<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.829> it<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:18.030> was<00:01:18.180> before

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
I like the flow of it this was before

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.850 
I like the flow of it this was before
they<00:01:18.689> put<00:01:18.899> in<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.110> little<00:01:19.409> squigglies

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
they put in that little squigglies

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.770 
they put in that little squigglies
corkscrew<00:01:20.729> bit<00:01:20.969> at<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.119> end<00:01:21.210> which<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.719> never

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
corkscrew bit at the end which I never

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.080 
corkscrew bit at the end which I never
really<00:01:22.170> liked<00:01:22.409> myself<00:01:22.649> this<00:01:23.189> version<00:01:23.579> is<00:01:23.700> much

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
really liked myself this version is much

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.779 
really liked myself this version is much
more<00:01:24.299> fast<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.869> flowing<00:01:25.079> I<00:01:25.409> don't<00:01:25.979> really

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
more fast and flowing I don't really

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.209 
more fast and flowing I don't really
know<00:01:26.969> how<00:01:27.000> close<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.219> original

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:29.219 
know how close this is to the original

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:31.760 
know how close this is to the original
circuit<00:01:29.840> it's<00:01:30.840> been<00:01:30.960> some<00:01:31.200> years<00:01:31.229> since<00:01:31.619> I've

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
circuit it's been some years since I've

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.480 
circuit it's been some years since I've
seen<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.159> i'll<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.399> to<00:01:32.490> check<00:01:32.609> it<00:01:32.759> out<00:01:32.909> again

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
seen it i'll have to check it out again

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.899 
seen it i'll have to check it out again
long<00:01:35.490> corner<00:01:36.030> ends<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> lap<00:01:37.609> always<00:01:38.609> remember

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
long corner ends the lap always remember

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.359 
long corner ends the lap always remember
that<00:01:38.939> corner<00:01:39.359> in<00:01:39.590> 96<00:01:40.590> i<00:01:40.770> think<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.009> was<00:01:41.130> when

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
that corner in 96 i think it was when

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.980 
that corner in 96 i think it was when
Jack<00:01:41.549> vu<00:01:41.759> nerve<00:01:42.030> was<00:01:42.240> willed<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.570> wheel<00:01:42.780> with

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
Jack vu nerve was willed to wheel with

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.020 
Jack vu nerve was willed to wheel with
Damon<00:01:43.320> Hill<00:01:43.560> took<00:01:44.399> him<00:01:44.609> I<00:01:44.700> think<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
Damon Hill took him I think on the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.319 
Damon Hill took him I think on the
outside<00:01:45.539> of<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.869> corner<00:01:47.149> and<00:01:48.149> that

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
outside of that corner and that

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.580 
outside of that corner and that
completes<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.780> first<00:01:48.990> lap<00:01:49.170> their<00:01:49.350> insight

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
completes the first lap their insight

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.739 
completes the first lap their insight
into<00:01:49.829> lap<00:01:49.950> 2<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.999> looks<00:01:51.119> like<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.299> fool<00:01:51.630> and

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:51.749 
into lap 2 and it looks like a fool and

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:53.989 
into lap 2 and it looks like a fool and
well<00:01:51.929> behind<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.289> leaders<00:01:52.909> certainly<00:01:53.909> not

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:53.999 
well behind the leaders certainly not

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:55.760 
well behind the leaders certainly not
going<00:01:54.179> to<00:01:54.240> close<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.509> up<00:01:54.689> I'm<00:01:55.259> bit<00:01:55.499> of<00:01:55.619> a

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
going to close that up I'm bit of a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.889 
going to close that up I'm bit of a
again<00:01:56.640> I'm<00:01:56.789> lifting<00:01:56.969> there<00:01:57.420> or<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.630> shouldn't

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
again I'm lifting there or I shouldn't

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.590 
again I'm lifting there or I shouldn't
be<00:01:58.399> but<00:01:59.399> again<00:01:59.909> that's<00:02:00.090> all<00:02:00.210> part<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
be but again that's all part of the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.419 
be but again that's all part of the
learning<00:02:00.630> process<00:02:01.020> when<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.920> have<00:02:02.130> videos

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
learning process when I have videos

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.309 
learning process when I have videos
later<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:02.999> will<00:02:03.149> have<00:02:03.479> obviously<00:02:03.840> videos<00:02:04.170> of

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
later on I will have obviously videos of

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.590 
later on I will have obviously videos of
this<00:02:04.380> game<00:02:04.590> before<00:02:04.770> launch<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.399> by<00:02:06.210> then<00:02:06.450> of

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
this game before launch and by then of

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.809 
this game before launch and by then of
course<00:02:06.810> I'll<00:02:06.960> know<00:02:07.109> how<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.289> drive<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.859> and<00:02:08.009> you

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
course I'll know how to drive it and you

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.400 
course I'll know how to drive it and you
have<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.000> give<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.210> guys<00:02:09.390> some<00:02:09.600> more<00:02:10.140> more

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
have to give you guys some more more

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.760 
have to give you guys some more more
feedback<00:02:10.679> on<00:02:11.100> this<00:02:12.140> get<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> lot<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.319> wheel<00:02:13.530> spin

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
feedback on this get a lot of wheel spin

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.200 
feedback on this get a lot of wheel spin
in<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.069> car<00:02:14.340> as<00:02:14.490> well<00:02:14.670> it's<00:02:14.880> quite<00:02:15.060> tricky

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
in this car as well it's quite tricky

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.940 
in this car as well it's quite tricky
through<00:02:15.510> slow<00:02:15.810> corners<00:02:16.200> even<00:02:16.650> when<00:02:16.830> you're

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
through slow corners even when you're

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.770 
through slow corners even when you're
trying<00:02:17.070> to<00:02:17.160> progressively<00:02:17.730> accelerate<00:02:18.270> the

trying to progressively accelerate the
car<00:02:18.960> does<00:02:19.200> seem<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.410> spit<00:02:19.770> up<00:02:19.890> its<00:02:20.040> rules<00:02:20.220> quite

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
car does seem to spit up its rules quite

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.410 
car does seem to spit up its rules quite
a<00:02:20.550> bit

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
a bit

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.510 
a bit
I<00:02:21.680> was<00:02:22.680> looking<00:02:22.740> for<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.040> slightly<00:02:23.250> different

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
I was looking for a slightly different

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.250 
I was looking for a slightly different
line<00:02:23.880> there<00:02:24.180> but<00:02:24.390> getting<00:02:24.599> it<00:02:24.720> slightly<00:02:24.930> wrong

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
line there but getting it slightly wrong

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.170 
line there but getting it slightly wrong
again<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.040> breaking<00:02:26.489> point<00:02:26.730> needs<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.000> bit<00:02:27.150> of

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
again that breaking point needs a bit of

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.910 
again that breaking point needs a bit of
time<00:02:27.420> just<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.810> get<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.020> exactly<00:02:28.140> right<00:02:28.590> you

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
time just to get it exactly right you

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.370 
time just to get it exactly right you
can<00:02:29.040> carry<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.310> lot<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:29.489> speed<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.060> corner

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
can carry a lot of speed to that corner

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.470 
can carry a lot of speed to that corner
but<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.620> do<00:02:31.770> have<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.069> get<00:02:32.370> up<00:02:32.459> with<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.060> apex

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
but you do have to get up with the apex

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.180 
but you do have to get up with the apex
if<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.810> got<00:02:33.959> if<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.140> go<00:02:34.319> wide<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:34.890> are<00:02:35.040> going

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
if you got if you go wide you are going

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.820 
if you got if you go wide you are going
to<00:02:35.250> end<00:02:35.400> up<00:02:35.520> in<00:02:36.239> trouble<00:02:36.530> I'm<00:02:37.530> going<00:02:37.739> to

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
to end up in trouble I'm going to

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.770 
to end up in trouble I'm going to
slightly<00:02:38.160> wide<00:02:38.670> there<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.239> curb<00:02:39.450> saved

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
slightly wide there but the curb saved

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.229 
slightly wide there but the curb saved
me<00:02:40.280> getting<00:02:41.280> tricky<00:02:41.489> corner<00:02:41.670> here<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.120> want

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
me getting tricky corner here you want

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.550 
me getting tricky corner here you want
to<00:02:42.270> get<00:02:42.420> in<00:02:42.540> there<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:42.840> then<00:02:43.140> get<00:02:43.319> on<00:02:43.350> the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
to get in there and then get on the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.100 
to get in there and then get on the
power<00:02:44.060> but<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.180> curb<00:02:45.420> can<00:02:45.630> unbalance<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
power but that curb can unbalance the

power but that curb can unbalance the
cards<00:02:46.500> on<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.739> outside<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.370> throw<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.760> car

in their use the runoff on the outside
lots<00:02:50.550> of<00:02:50.760> track<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.000> i'm<00:02:51.239> not<00:02:51.390> using<00:02:51.630> at<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
lots of track that i'm not using at the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.720 
lots of track that i'm not using at the
moment<00:02:51.959> I'm<00:02:52.349> not<00:02:52.500> hitting<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.830> apex<00:02:53.250> ears<00:02:53.519> and

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
moment I'm not hitting the apex ears and

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.000 
moment I'm not hitting the apex ears and
I'm<00:02:53.790> not<00:02:54.030> hitting<00:02:54.420> some<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.080> curbing<00:02:55.860> and

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
I'm not hitting some of the curbing and

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.100 
I'm not hitting some of the curbing and
using<00:02:56.280> all<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:57.030> road<00:02:57.300> so<00:02:57.660> there's<00:02:57.900> loads

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
using all the the road so there's loads

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.289 
using all the the road so there's loads
more<00:02:58.290> time<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.769> find<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.190> these<00:02:59.310> laps<00:02:59.610> where

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
more time to find on these laps where

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.009 
more time to find on these laps where
are<00:03:00.480> we<00:03:00.510> this<00:03:01.410> was<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.680> one<00:03:01.950> once<00:03:02.850> 16<00:03:03.630> of<00:03:03.840> course

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
are we this was a one once 16 of course

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.300 
are we this was a one once 16 of course
on<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.230> projector<00:03:04.440> you'll<00:03:04.950> see<00:03:05.100> I'm<00:03:05.220> already

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
on the projector you'll see I'm already

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.699 
on the projector you'll see I'm already
down<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.819> 114<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.810> I'm<00:03:07.019> sure<00:03:07.200> with<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.440> few

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
down to a 114 and I'm sure with a few

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.490 
down to a 114 and I'm sure with a few
goes<00:03:07.950> you'll<00:03:08.280> be<00:03:08.430> down<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.239> a<00:03:09.269> 110<00:03:09.900> pretty

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
goes you'll be down to a 110 pretty

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.080 
goes you'll be down to a 110 pretty
quickly<00:03:12.739> and<00:03:13.739> again<00:03:14.340> all<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.610> this<00:03:14.730> was<00:03:14.910> done

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
quickly and again all of this was done

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.820 
quickly and again all of this was done
with<00:03:15.239> automatic<00:03:15.840> gears<00:03:16.110> I've<00:03:16.290> noticed<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.680> few

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
with automatic gears I've noticed a few

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.229 
with automatic gears I've noticed a few
people<00:03:17.160> mentioned<00:03:17.519> about<00:03:17.700> some<00:03:17.970> short

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
people mentioned about some short

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.789 
people mentioned about some short
shifting<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:18.959> that's<00:03:19.080> just<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.500> way<00:03:19.650> the

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
shifting and that's just the way the

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.830 
shifting and that's just the way the
automatic<00:03:20.310> gears<00:03:20.580> work<00:03:20.850> at<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.390> moment<00:03:21.540> on

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
automatic gears work at the moment on

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.020 
automatic gears work at the moment on
this<00:03:22.019> game<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.530> is<00:03:22.680> my<00:03:23.220> assumption<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.000> I

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
this game and is my assumption is and I

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.630 
this game and is my assumption is and I
don't<00:03:24.239> know<00:03:24.330> for<00:03:24.540> certain<00:03:24.660> that<00:03:25.280> that's<00:03:26.280> down

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
don't know for certain that that's down

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.960 
don't know for certain that that's down
to<00:03:27.410> reducing<00:03:28.410> wheel<00:03:28.590> spin<00:03:28.950> make<00:03:29.670> it<00:03:29.790> slightly

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
to reducing wheel spin make it slightly

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.670 
to reducing wheel spin make it slightly
easier<00:03:30.150> for<00:03:30.630> players<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:31.109> use<00:03:31.140> automatic

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
easier for players that use automatic

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.900 
easier for players that use automatic
gears<00:03:32.100> but<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.370> course<00:03:32.519> if<00:03:32.640> you're<00:03:32.730> using

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
gears but of course if you're using

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.560 
gears but of course if you're using
manual<00:03:33.209> gears<00:03:33.600> then<00:03:33.959> that's<00:03:34.560> no<00:03:34.799> concern<00:03:35.570> and

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
manual gears then that's no concern and

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.180 
manual gears then that's no concern and
of<00:03:36.840> course<00:03:36.870> with<00:03:37.109> manual<00:03:37.440> gears<00:03:37.650> I<00:03:37.739> do<00:03:37.890> feel

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
of course with manual gears I do feel

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.410 
of course with manual gears I do feel
much<00:03:38.430> more<00:03:38.700> consistent<00:03:39.950> under<00:03:40.950> braking<00:03:41.420> but

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
much more consistent under braking but

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.509 
much more consistent under braking but
that's<00:03:42.570> that's<00:03:42.870> what<00:03:43.739> a<00:03:43.769> lot<00:03:43.890> of<00:03:43.950> manual<00:03:44.280> gear

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
that's that's what a lot of manual gear

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.340 
that's that's what a lot of manual gear
players<00:03:44.790> feel<00:03:45.060> anyways<00:03:45.510> just<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.049> do<00:03:46.170> get

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
players feel anyways just you do get

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.080 
players feel anyways just you do get
that<00:03:46.470> consistency<00:03:46.650> into<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.459> corner<00:03:48.000> that

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
that consistency into a corner that

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.479 
that consistency into a corner that
consistent<00:03:48.660> speed<00:03:49.019> that<00:03:49.620> rhythm<00:03:49.920> if<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.340> like

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
consistent speed that rhythm if you like

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.280 
consistent speed that rhythm if you like
every<00:03:50.850> lap<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.329> know<00:03:51.450> going<00:03:51.600> up<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:51.959> down<00:03:52.019> the

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
every lap you know going up and down the

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.289 
every lap you know going up and down the
gears<00:03:52.530> /<00:03:52.769> corner<00:03:53.190> helps<00:03:53.730> with<00:03:53.910> your<00:03:53.970> memory

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
gears / corner helps with your memory

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.560 
gears / corner helps with your memory
for<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.600> corners<00:03:55.049> as<00:03:55.230> well<00:03:56.239> but<00:03:57.239> we're<00:03:57.390> going

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
for the corners as well but we're going

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.289 
for the corners as well but we're going
around<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.840> final<00:03:58.049> lap<00:03:58.320> now<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:59.209> little<00:04:00.209> bit

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
around the final lap now a little bit

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.259 
around the final lap now a little bit
wide<00:04:00.510> there<00:04:01.280> trying<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.340> carry<00:04:02.609> more<00:04:02.820> speed<00:04:02.970> to

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
wide there trying to carry more speed to

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.090 
wide there trying to carry more speed to
that<00:04:03.299> core<00:04:03.660> night<00:04:03.900> so<00:04:04.109> tricky<00:04:04.530> one<00:04:04.709> it's<00:04:04.980> a

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
that core night so tricky one it's a

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.430 
that core night so tricky one it's a
very<00:04:05.310> narrow<00:04:05.549> entry<00:04:06.239> so<00:04:06.600> it<00:04:06.900> will<00:04:07.079> take<00:04:07.109> some

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
very narrow entry so it will take some

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.949 
very narrow entry so it will take some
practice<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:08.010> get<00:04:08.160> that<00:04:08.250> right<00:04:08.840> that<00:04:09.840> you'll

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
practice to get that right that you'll

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.270 
practice to get that right that you'll
see<00:04:10.109> on<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.260> projector<00:04:10.410> video<00:04:10.920> that<00:04:11.250> I

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
see on the projector video that I

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.580 
see on the projector video that I
improve<00:04:11.970> their<00:04:12.420> and<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:13.140> can<00:04:13.260> see<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:13.440> a

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
improve their and you can see that a

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.380 
improve their and you can see that a
link<00:04:13.859> to<00:04:14.069> that<00:04:14.100> at<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.519> end<00:04:14.670> of<00:04:14.790> this<00:04:14.850> video<00:04:15.030> as

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
link to that at the end of this video as

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.539 
link to that at the end of this video as
well<00:04:15.420> so<00:04:15.750> that's<00:04:15.840> it<00:04:16.140> for<00:04:16.739> this<00:04:16.829> first<00:04:17.310> ever

well so that's it for this first ever

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.180 
well so that's it for this first ever
race<00:04:17.820> on<00:04:18.090> esterel<00:04:18.539> and<00:04:18.780> we'll<00:04:19.470> have<00:04:19.709> more<00:04:20.010> to

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
race on esterel and we'll have more to

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.640 
race on esterel and we'll have more to
follow<00:04:20.340> including<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.180> multicam<00:04:21.780> view<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.229> this

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
follow including a multicam view of this

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.890 
follow including a multicam view of this
race<00:04:22.950> as<00:04:23.190> well<00:04:23.220> well<00:04:23.639> that's<00:04:23.760> it<00:04:23.970> from<00:04:24.419> me<00:04:24.660> for

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
race as well well that's it from me for

00:04:24.900 --> 00:05:26.080 
race as well well that's it from me for
now<00:04:24.930> as<00:04:25.229> ever<00:04:25.800> more<00:04:26.610> soon
