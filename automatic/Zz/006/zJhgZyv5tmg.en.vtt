this<00:00:20.510> series<00:00:20.840> with<00:00:21.020> my<00:00:21.140> athletes<00:00:21.290> and<00:00:21.740> I'm

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
this series with my athletes and I'm

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.020 
this series with my athletes and I'm
growing<00:00:22.070> to<00:00:22.160> like<00:00:22.250> it<00:00:22.430> more<00:00:22.460> and<00:00:22.730> more<00:00:22.910> every

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.030 
growing to like it more and more every

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.460 
growing to like it more and more every
time<00:00:23.360> we<00:00:23.690> run<00:00:23.840> through<00:00:24.080> it<00:00:24.140> it's<00:00:24.290> great

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
time we run through it it's great

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.230 
time we run through it it's great
because<00:00:24.860> we<00:00:25.040> have<00:00:25.250> a<00:00:25.279> few<00:00:25.580> different<00:00:25.940> ways<00:00:26.029> to

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
because we have a few different ways to

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.580 
because we have a few different ways to
drill<00:00:26.450> our<00:00:26.600> own<00:00:26.750> dragon<00:00:27.170> trees<00:00:27.380> without

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
drill our own dragon trees without

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.800 
drill our own dragon trees without
stopping<00:00:28.400> while<00:00:28.700> flowing<00:00:29.119> through<00:00:29.480> the<00:00:29.570> drill

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
stopping while flowing through the drill

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.140 
stopping while flowing through the drill
and<00:00:30.050> it's<00:00:30.619> even<00:00:30.890> better<00:00:31.130> because<00:00:31.640> we<00:00:31.790> can<00:00:31.820> mix

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
and it's even better because we can mix

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.850 
and it's even better because we can mix
in<00:00:32.360> a<00:00:32.450> few<00:00:32.480> really<00:00:32.990> nice<00:00:33.140> finishes<00:00:33.680> off<00:00:33.830> the

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
in a few really nice finishes off the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.970 
in a few really nice finishes off the
armdrag<00:00:34.430> let's<00:00:35.060> just<00:00:35.330> jump<00:00:35.990> into<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.560> keys<00:00:36.770> to

simple one stayin your stance while

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.580 
simple one stayin your stance while
you're<00:00:44.240> doing<00:00:44.480> this<00:00:44.630> so<00:00:44.989> many<00:00:45.200> of<00:00:45.290> my<00:00:45.320> guys

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
you're doing this so many of my guys

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.190 
you're doing this so many of my guys
come<00:00:45.890> up<00:00:45.920> and<00:00:46.280> stand<00:00:46.790> straight<00:00:47.210> while<00:00:47.690> pulling

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
come up and stand straight while pulling

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.470 
come up and stand straight while pulling
on<00:00:48.470> the<00:00:48.620> arm<00:00:48.800> it's<00:00:49.160> not<00:00:49.310> a<00:00:49.340> real<00:00:49.580> arm<00:00:49.820> drag<00:00:50.120> the

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
on the arm it's not a real arm drag the

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.720 
on the arm it's not a real arm drag the
second<00:00:50.870> part<00:00:51.110> is<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.710> move<00:00:51.860> your<00:00:52.100> feet<00:00:52.340> that's

second part is to move your feet that's

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.280 
second part is to move your feet that's
what<00:00:52.970> makes<00:00:53.150> it<00:00:53.300> a<00:00:53.360> real<00:00:53.540> arm<00:00:53.750> jog<00:00:53.990> stay<00:00:54.230> in

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
what makes it a real arm jog stay in

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.110 
what makes it a real arm jog stay in
your<00:00:54.470> stance<00:00:54.560> move<00:00:55.010> your<00:00:55.190> feet<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:55.550> both<00:00:55.940> the

your stance move your feet and both the
offensive<00:00:56.750> and<00:00:56.930> defensive<00:00:57.200> man<00:00:57.980> should<00:00:58.280> be

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
offensive and defensive man should be

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.830

moving their feet all right

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.530 
moving their feet all right
so<00:01:00.080> the<00:01:00.260> lift<00:01:00.500> keys<00:01:00.830> to<00:01:01.040> success<00:01:01.520> are<00:01:02.270> also

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
so the lift keys to success are also

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.840 
so the lift keys to success are also
pretty<00:01:02.930> simple<00:01:03.380> stay<00:01:03.800> perpendicular<00:01:04.489> to<00:01:04.519> your

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
pretty simple stay perpendicular to your

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.429 
pretty simple stay perpendicular to your
