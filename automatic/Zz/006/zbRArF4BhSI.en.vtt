00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:14.099
 Mario Götze They stood after the game 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.750
 against portugal in the mixedzone with 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.110
 a beaming smile on his face 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.110
 had only to do with the winning yes 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.830
 mostly i think we look very much 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.550
 good tournament started 4 against portugal 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.289
 I think it can see each other 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.109
 In any case , it was not like that 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.830
 bad from the beginning reasonably 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.150
 understatement 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.920
 they sometimes work a bit like that 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.339
 that's what I was after so wanted 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.820
 a little bit 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:41.250
 possible is the right word I 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.510
 Absolutely I just believe that we 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.710
 that should not be so high 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.199
 they were still first games 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.909
 three only three frames the frame 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.890
 group and we have to focus 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:54.570
 stay we have some plans and 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.460
 so we should with a bit 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.290
 a certain euphoria brake indeed 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.239
 take it easy and the next 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.559
 next games concentrate ball flat 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.239
 Keep that beautiful but says 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.290
 yet if you have watched them then 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.060
 the impression here in brazil 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.320
 at least that's a different story 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.330
 Once inside they show another one 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.689
 Presence on the training course is deceptive 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.579
 that something i do not know how else is 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.869
 I think the conditions are 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:18.119
 Of course we have a great team 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.320
 which enormous quality we have some 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.450
 we want a good one 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.710
 World Cup and I believe 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.179
 that's more than what we mean 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.009
 simply something special is one 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:27.359
 to play world championship and therefore 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.439
 he believes everyone in his faith 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:30.390
 performance limit and of course we want 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.679
 also in the next game a good one 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.689
 show performance and that 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.979
 power ratio in the team look there 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.630
 stood against portugal at first 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.100
 ex-bavaria player a dortmunder on 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.200
 the place that was already different 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.499
 shows the dominance of the bavaria 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.090
 now also in the national team 

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:47.819
 as I do not see I believe 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.499
 that's it actually plays quite 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.639
 this is not a subordinate role either 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:52.409
 important in such a tournament I think 

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:54.060
 I understand that we as 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.639
 act and I think that 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.539
 We and systems do not succeed either 

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:58.950
 only the eleven players in the square 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.710
 but also the whole team 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.210
 and that's why the club is playing 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.899
 actually a very subordinate one 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.700
 role 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.200
 but how was that in front of the portugal? 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.440
 How do you do that when you learn? 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.000
 One is in the first eleven comes 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.110
 the coach in the individual interview or will 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.090
 it was discussed in the team 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.050
 We have a meeting before the game 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.790
 Everyone believes in the lineup 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.710
 should prepare himself as if he 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.020
 it would be important to play one 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.020
 Team and important games in front of us 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.100
 and that's why the keyboard or was it on 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.480
 morning so in the restrictions 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.030
 and the trainer had the exhibition 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.300
 you go in the morning the day before or on 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.130
 day of the game day later you have 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.700
 In the morning, testers found they were playing like that 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.140
 approximately 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.430
 ok last had a bit with his 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.020
 are struggling thigh today 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.720
 seen tomorrow how they experience him 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.070
 yes, I have seen it for a minute, but I think so 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.440
 there is a warning i think that it 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.480
 not too tragic and we will 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.460
 Seeing how we manage the process is me 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.080
 am good things 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.760
 but I know myself in medical 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.770
 of course, not so 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.870
 but I think he will be operational 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.660
 will be show the next days 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.660
 There was sheepskin round 3 in the 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.180
 campo was here with lame new müller and 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.220
 hummels is playing card games too 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.530
 unfortunately not for them so I belong 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.580
 not made off round but I did 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.080
 do not say dramatically 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.640
 we have enough in any case 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.590
 variety and exactly possibilities and 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.330
 to pass the time gives 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.990
 breakfast window from 7 am to 10 am 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.350
 30 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.610
 there are early if 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.650
 late risers in which faction are 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.490

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.800
 I'm not awake yet 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.170
 usually not at all 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.900
 is born on the stars and that also completely in 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.310

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.820

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.130

 this is the shoe work that you can do in 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.480
 Brazil definitely needs because 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.430
 You can always wear it everywhere 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.140

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.900

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.240
