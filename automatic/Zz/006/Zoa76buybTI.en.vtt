00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.660 

might<00:01:46.560> come<00:01:46.680> out<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.830> little<00:01:46.979> bit<00:01:47.160> sloppy<00:01:47.430> the

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.699

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
ok so now that I got the hot glue off

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.550 
ok so now that I got the hot glue off
should<00:02:11.709> look<00:02:11.890> like<00:02:11.920> that<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:14.140> then<00:02:14.319> I<00:02:14.349> hear

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
should look like that so then I hear

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.650 
should look like that so then I hear
that<00:02:14.709> a<00:02:14.769> little<00:02:15.040> bit<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:19.120> then<00:02:19.269> you<00:02:19.360> do<00:02:19.510> that

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
that a little bit and then you do that

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.420 
that a little bit and then you do that
with<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.900> other<00:02:20.019> side<00:02:21.780> look<00:02:22.890> if<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:24.010> wanted<00:02:24.370> to

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
with the other side look if I wanted to

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:35.789 
with the other side look if I wanted to
I<00:02:24.519> crop<00:02:24.849> a<00:02:24.880> snippet<00:02:25.209> look<00:02:25.420> right<00:02:26.110> there<00:02:34.799> the

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
I crop a snippet look right there the

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.920 
I crop a snippet look right there the
other<00:02:35.980> side's<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.400> slipped<00:02:36.700> off<00:02:39.780> it's<00:02:40.780> like

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
other side's I slipped off it's like

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.020 
other side's I slipped off it's like
that<00:02:41.880> go<00:02:42.880> ahead<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.299> put<00:02:43.569> some<00:02:43.599> on<00:02:44.019> this<00:02:44.260> side

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
that go ahead and put some on this side

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:54.650 
that go ahead and put some on this side
and<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.209> little<00:02:46.450> piece<00:02:46.569> I<00:02:46.720> just<00:02:46.930> wrap<00:02:47.170> up<00:02:52.349> here

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
and a little piece I just wrap up here

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.949 
and a little piece I just wrap up here
so<00:02:55.660> then<00:02:55.780> i<00:02:55.840> have<00:02:55.989> it<00:02:56.079> on<00:02:56.140> both<00:02:56.319> side<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.810> then

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
so then i have it on both side so then

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:14.699 
so then i have it on both side so then
once<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.200> dries<00:03:12.989> let<00:03:13.989> me<00:03:14.109> just<00:03:14.380> step<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:14.680> down

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
once that dries let me just step it down

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.949 
once that dries let me just step it down
any<00:03:15.040> more<00:03:15.250> than<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.579> will<00:03:15.670> probably<00:03:15.940> like<00:03:16.510> snap

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
any more than it will probably like snap

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.849 
any more than it will probably like snap
off<00:03:17.400> this<00:03:18.400> is<00:03:18.609> like<00:03:18.790> out<00:03:19.060> forever<00:03:19.859> because

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
off this is like out forever because

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.559 
off this is like out forever because
this<00:03:21.010> will<00:03:21.190> if<00:03:21.370> i<00:03:21.519> keep<00:03:21.700> them<00:03:21.880> off<00:03:22.090> if<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:22.420> like

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
this will if i keep them off if you like

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.260 
this will if i keep them off if you like
play<00:03:22.780> with<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.019> hard<00:03:23.170> enough
