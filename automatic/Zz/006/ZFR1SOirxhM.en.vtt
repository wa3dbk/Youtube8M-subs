00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.880 

definitely<00:03:34.870> I<00:03:34.900> see<00:03:35.290> anyway<00:03:36.270> that's<00:03:37.270> my<00:03:37.510> hoopty

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
hopefully I'll get some extra power out

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.310 
hopefully I'll get some extra power out
of<00:03:43.180> this<00:03:43.300> thing<00:03:43.540> regardless<00:03:44.050> of<00:03:44.140> how<00:03:44.260> it
