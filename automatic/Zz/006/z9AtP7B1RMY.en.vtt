00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.800
 what's up kids here the generals 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.630
 I bring a trick to the call of duty 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.220
 2 plates for zombie modes on the map 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.349
 origins and for this trick we are going to 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.840
 necessarily need the tank the 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.609
 first stop where it comes out and note that 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.830
 we have to lie down as you see in 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.050
 the video to the left and we have 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.030
 to push with the joystick towards the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.500
 left the look and the character is worth 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.750
 all that is that you have to go with desire 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.309
 knowing that we have to put ourselves here 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.190
 on the left then logically we have 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.799
 that force the character to say it of 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.960
 one way we have that with the joystick and 

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:47.159
 the character's gaze all the time 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.809
 the left moving from left to 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:50.519
 right until he gets us to put you 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.379
 once we are here we will be 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.940
 completely invincible we have all 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.710
 zombies that are going to accumulate just 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.570
 in front and we can take the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.369
 bonuses and all that is a trick 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.269
 I'm not going to say it's easy because the 

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:02.850
 truth is that it is quite difficult 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.010
 get in here no no not always go to 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.180
 get the tank a dune is not 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.770
 very easy 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.250
 the video looks easy but the truth is 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.290
 that is not not simple but it is possible not 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.260
 it means not because it's difficult 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.990
 you're not going to get a good look at the 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.570
 video rewind what you simply had to 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.370
 throw yourself people the tank lie down and like 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.590
 I said force the character so that the 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.750
 huge tank is here once here and 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.100
 I already say the frank zombies in front 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.010
 we can take the bonuses 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.990
 and everything and that 's it and pass rounds 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.729
 infinite you can also follow the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.160
 trick if you have to go ahead and jump and 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.320
 if doing will get you out of the trick 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.490
 in case you do not need something and nothing 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.930
 I hope you liked him deis light 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.850
 favorites your friendly turns if you do not 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.920
 you were and go through the channel of the ball 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.290
 also that the recorded thread has done it 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.910
 of the dance then the description left 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.910
 so nothing until the next video
