00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.880
 that's knowing how it all ends 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:14.309
 what could you advise your friends 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.430
 our viewers how to act in such 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.850
 situations when you are attacked and 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.880
 there is a threat to your life 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.130
 you know, I can't give this question 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.580
 answer for one simple reason that 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.110
 you can do the right thing and can be 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:41.059
 do the right thing right 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:45.450
 least harm to myself for myself here 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.250
 if i could come back right that day 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.320
 with all your knowledge of how it is 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.629
 end i don't know i was probably 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.210
 his teeth held on to the railing in the club did not give 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.129
 would withdraw myself saying that but i am so 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.480
 I say that not all and I do not want with them 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.210
 quarrel that let them come out 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.649
 sober up but considering the fact that 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.059
 on cameras filming no I do n't know on 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.010
 the smartphone would have typed what they want me 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.430
 beat see what all the same 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.409
 evidence was i avoided conflicts 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.220
 how could and advise everyone to avoid 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.100
 conflict here in this case I 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.580
 tried to save the life of a striker 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.700
 me man but our Themis behaves 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.240
 so she makes me about it 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.439
 to regret 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.970
 that is, if you just left it 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.799
 lies there ran away nobody would ever 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.939
 proved that I was there that had a fight 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.930
 with me and so on and so on 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.150
 similar and now it turns out so 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.479
 i'm blamed for not killing now 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.299
 The case is pending 1 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.369
 hearing but the sense is already such a judicial 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.899
 I do n't know how 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.330
 legal terms that's right 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.220
 to name 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.830
 relatives do not give up their 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.490
 claims in court did not confirm that yes 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.120
 we want 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.690
 two cars and apartments and 19 half 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.690
 million tenge 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.310
 relatives as it turned out not even 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.900
 get familiar with the case file 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.200
 in general, that is, the facts that I became 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.150
 tell the brother of the deceased they are for him 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.890
 were new he said you are lying and 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.410
 I say look please material 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.260
 conversations that came up in the same place he didn't 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.090
 said he did not even see the conclusion 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.710
 forensics claim 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.410
 about the fact that he died from my blows that is 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.360
 how would they try to get compensation 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.420
 for the death of your relative term from 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.550
 what he died as I already wrote what to see 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.680
 relative of material wealth 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.910
 which dishes they are or not so interesting 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:44.900
 probably with regard to the legal part 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:46.790
 my case is an article but there is such a case 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.940
 I just happened a lot 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.739
 familiar across kazakhstan different and we 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.920
 They did not say that relatives there are very 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:58.580
 strongly gather people there are connecting to 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.380
 your problem of various acquaintances there 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:06.080
 not at the level of some word above 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.880
 marital such say the situation here 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.260
 Well, somehow this lightly bore 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.640
 thought what wildness 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.020
 a week later i found out that not 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.270
 retrain the matter and 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.700
 retrained the case of excess 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.880
 self-defense measures that, in principle, well, how would 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.370
 I could be incriminated and I would 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.470
 could justify well this is as if logical yes 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.300
 sure me there was an attack man died 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.070
 you probably raised self defense 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.810
 be not exceeded let 's see how well 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.000
 the court would therefore not lead it to be logical but 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.320
 negligent homicide here a 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.709
 manslaughter is generally 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.580
 a completely different article which 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.780
 do not tern completely different 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.040
 Danny legal offense 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.580
 murder the deprivation of life through negligence 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.590
 under the new code so know it 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.370
 death which is allowed this consequence 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.030
 negligence 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:56.260
 or to death admitted there with some kind 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:00.260
 intended death allowed 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.390
 talked about the case there is a famous 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.300
 human rights activist zhovtis he shot down a girl yes 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.610
 you know this was an article death by 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.360
 imprudence causing death by 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.110
 carelessness 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.790
 Well, how to say that this is the same 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.640
 the very article that when I was attacked 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.959
 with a knife I defended my life and now I 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.260
 must for the same article 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.450
 to be tried it is possible to be in extreme 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.310
 degree unqualified person i'm not 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:31.000
 I know how to explain this 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.000
 forced not qualified 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.790
 irrationality did not know forced 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.560
 by their naivety they did not allow their 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.200
 such an error but now we see that 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.210
 This error does not want to correct though 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.980
 at the preliminary meeting the judge 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.560
 pointed out to them this error said what 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.110
 matter why you write such nonsense i 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.110
 I can read the last moments 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:59.570
 substitute for the new act which caused 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.570
 me the most outrage but also 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.500
 here is the damage Kuznetsov 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.210
 I also suffered damage 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.650
 indicates the circumstances of the case 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.170
 reliably confirm the fact of 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.600
 regarding him hooligan actions in 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:15.650
 honor due to which smiths a 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.650
 the result of self defense 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:23.150
 death by negligence that is by 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:27.480
 fact saying there do not know as a result 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:29.910
 as a result of one case as a result of 1 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.130
 articles hung another in fact so and 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.660
 written and throughout 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.400
 the indictment if you go in 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.020
 Facebook on my page can read 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.550
 laid it out there he does not refer to 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.960
 case materials and it can be spread 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.220
 Only the courts have opened I 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.720
 consulted about it with our 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.900
 lawyers here throughout someone 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.950
 it turns out that everything is really all 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.570
 witnesses all evidence 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.920
 unanimously argue that 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.540
 really the attack was perfect 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:06:00.920
 I really was leaving me 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:03.210
 opportunities from the fight here well there 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.310
 various intricacies but the topic of 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.569
 to 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.800
 the judge is arguing with the prosecutor on the topic 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:10.169
 let's right there under 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.539
 the indictment will fit the whole 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.939
 acts like why it is written there but it 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.830
 Generally it is just nonsense because 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:18.030
 in my opinion on the basis of the act is written 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.159
 conclusion they are the other way around 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.800
 thank you Alexander that you came to us and 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:25.650
