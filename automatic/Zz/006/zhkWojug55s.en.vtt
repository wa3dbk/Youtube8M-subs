00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.700
 very important recommendations that we

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.670
 of surgery then I want to tell you 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.500
 than 30 days before surgery 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.760
 we must consume or take a 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.930
 food that is very soft 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:11.049
 that is light try not to consume 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.909
 many condiments and foods with 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.930
 very irritating condiments that we 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:19.540
 may cause stomach upsets 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.330
 etcetera good also try to leave

 to consume fat writings and those 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.009
 things since that will also help us 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.799
 that at the time the doctor goes to 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.869
 perform surgery our our 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.420

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.600
 soft as lighter and at the moment of 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.149
 introduce introduce forgiveness the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.429
 instruments are not going to mistreat us 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.620
 so much and at the moment of awakening we 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.350
 let's feel 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.330
 a lot of pain then it 's important 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.720
 try to stop consuming fats for 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.260
 that fat does not accumulate so much 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.480
 then lower the fats as they 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.750
 had said in a video is important 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.930
 chew well every bite of food and 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.950
 try to swallow and swallow slowly 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.990
 these foods 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.220
 this is fundamental and it will serve us 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:16.020
 much in the operative coconut 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.990
 chicken meat res pork 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.270
 fish the tuna must be in 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.610
 very gentle preparations that are 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.270
 married preparations can be and 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.760
 ironed milled sweats listed not 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.010
 I know how they say in their countries where I 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.780
 are watching then so that it's like 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.850
 softer 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.970
 and we can swallow these very well 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.090
 dairy foods that are so 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.200
 general skimmed the 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:49.140
 consume yogurt fitness comics I do not know how 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.420
 they say in their countries to the yogurt that 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.260
 they are like like then I do not know if it is 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.739
 same fruits also important 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.670
 consume whole or chopped and 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.360
 get up 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.810
 and in quotation marks as refreshments and 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.000
 accompany them with a lot of water because 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.480
 water is essential to not 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.599
 dehydrate us in this surgery then 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.430
 It is very important to also take the 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.409
 vegetables consume them 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.709
 very important that we consume them 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:28.909
 cooked to be as smooth or in 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.439
 creams or pureed or in soups or mixed 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.650
 with other foods but in a way 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:36.560
 much softer in the grains like 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.609
 beans the mind hash the chickpeas and 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:44.959
 that they are liquefied in the flours 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:48.590
 consume them and cooked or mashed and a 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:51.669
 only flour in each meal and in 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:55.159
 very small portions consume quite 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:58.310
 water before or after meals and not 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:01.939
 within them to not produce a 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.889
 fill us up a lot then before and after 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:05.959
 of the meals consumed and not during 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.750
 the food because we are going to fill 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.419
 a lot and we're going to eat then it's 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.200
 important to do that also make a 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:17.139
 light dinner and walk after 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.469
 consume this food is essential 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.740
 because many of us do not know why 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:26.620
 least of my part I am in those that like 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.439
 and then it makes me sleepy and I want 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.499
 sleep then immediately I go to bed 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:34.300
 sleep and that's fatal because it's not going to 

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:36.370
 do not let's have a good 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.139

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.539
 food that we just ate then 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.909
 it is important to eat and walk eat 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:45.029
 walk to be able to make a good 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.029
 digestion 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.360
 and also learn to mobilize gases 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.330
 good 5 days before surgery 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.890
 we must consume the food in 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:01.800
 Very mild preparations like purees

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.580
 recommendations that I can make you 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.290
 they made me video they use ita and 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.240
 so I now share as you 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:34.080
 It is also very important that if the 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:38.699
 people consume alcohol 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:41.520
 or tobacco if they smoke it is important that 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:44.069
 you already know that they are going to operate and that 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.860
 have for example they are going to operate in a 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:49.080
 month in two months it is important that 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.419
 at least together two months before the 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.449
 surgery stop using the subject 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:57.120
 work to rest our 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:07:01.050
 lungs alcohol also because the 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:03.719
 alcohol is a super important source 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:06.479
 of calories then it's not going to 

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:09.330
 allow or lose a weight or not going to 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:10.909
 allow us to go down to that weight or that in 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.440
 a certain moment 

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:15.750
 let's gain weight because they have many 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.300
 calories then I hope you have them
