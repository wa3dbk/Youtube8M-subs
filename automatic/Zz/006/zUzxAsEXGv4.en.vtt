00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.200 
produces super velvety smooth I didn't
wait<00:01:45.950> too<00:01:46.250> long<00:01:46.460> before<00:01:46.759> I<00:01:46.880> put<00:01:47.090> on<00:01:47.150> my

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
wait too long before I put on my

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.390 
wait too long before I put on my
foundation<00:01:47.479> maybe<00:01:48.020> I<00:01:48.110> should've<00:01:48.409> waited<00:01:48.770> with

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
foundation maybe I should've waited with

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.969 
foundation maybe I should've waited with
a<00:01:49.430> minute<00:01:49.820> or<00:01:49.940> two<00:01:50.150> longer<00:01:50.530> but<00:01:51.530> just<00:01:51.740> smooth

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
a minute or two longer but just smooth

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.270 
a minute or two longer but just smooth
it<00:01:52.070> feels<00:01:52.399> like<00:01:52.899> super<00:01:53.899> amazing<00:01:54.320> so<00:01:54.649> I<00:01:54.890> tend<00:01:55.190> to

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
it feels like super amazing so I tend to

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.710 
it feels like super amazing so I tend to
get<00:01:55.430> really<00:01:55.490> oily<00:01:56.030> throughout<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:56.540> day<00:01:56.659> so

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
get really oily throughout the day so

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.139 
get really oily throughout the day so
I'm<00:01:57.020> going<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.200> see<00:01:57.440> how<00:01:58.340> it<00:01:58.399> holds<00:01:58.759> up<00:01:58.850> I'm<00:01:59.030> not

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
I'm going to see how it holds up I'm not

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.090 
I'm going to see how it holds up I'm not
going<00:01:59.270> to<00:01:59.330> touch<00:01:59.450> my<00:01:59.659> face<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.409> I'm<00:02:00.979> not

going to touch my face and I'm not

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.740 
going to touch my face and I'm not
really<00:02:01.280> going<00:02:01.399> outside<00:02:01.610> like<00:02:02.060> 90<00:02:02.390> degrees<00:02:02.720> so

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
really going outside like 90 degrees so

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.169 
really going outside like 90 degrees so
