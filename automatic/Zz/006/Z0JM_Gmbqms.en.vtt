00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.500
 good day turf friends for the quinté 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.210
 from monday february 10 to vincennes disputed 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.219
 at the autostart on 2100 meters 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.809
 I chose to put in the lead aida 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.039
 jars to ida much dre by robin 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.020
 baker who knows our races well 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.490
 now it's duly been prepared 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.420
 especially for this test looks 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.220
 was a good number 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.560
 she had done very well in the month of 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.089
 September after a departure where they 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.490
 had been embarrassed had done something 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.779
 big track so they were 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.550
 prepared for this test in 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.660
 the meadow the henson lamb lately I 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.980
 think it's a very good chance 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.660
 so the number three in the lead without 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.370
 hesitate the rate case goes from landry 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.930
 just played bad luck with his 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.690
 universe since she finished at the wall and 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.879
 alive in the back of the first there this 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.930
 rate passes chef jean michel baudouin that 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.640
 I had training for paris 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.379
 turf to sign as soon as his mare was 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.949
 not bad she was coming back to her best 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.829
 level 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.359
 jean michel bazire déerré much 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.579
 trumps in his game the number one 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.320
 she should be able to get out it's 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.960
 a nice chance she too the 2 jacky 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.000
 glide already bounced what was not 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.429
 dissatisfied at all with his recent performance 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.500
 privately nor manson driver by adeilson 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.820
 eric wilson who does not always have a 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.840
 great success in vincennes but good 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.880
 it's still one of the best 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.680
 Swedish pilots it must be remembered his 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.600
 acquired 'guide' with number two the 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.640
 district to the iton performed a 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.930
 back thunderous with tristan de 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.930
 genouillac since it had imposed itself 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.560
 after about two months of absence 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.600
 lately she was introducing herself 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.980
 come closer but despite that she pulled 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.310
 its pin of the game takes a beautiful 6th 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.990
 square 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.130
 me it's a beautiful is ideal I like 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.530
 a lot especially as she leaps into 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.420
 the back of jmb and passgen fl could 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.070
 quickly occupy a good place this 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.470
 number 10 3 cases of nistos a little shot 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.460
 of heart the 14 teases leisure comes 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.810
 to do a little trick is to get 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.550
 remember to our good memory he had 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.190
 nothing done for a very long time and the 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.770
 third with jérôme chavatte 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.960
 after much of it was up 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.490
 pole on a 2007 speed course 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.470
 like that still barefooted 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.540
 she should be to her advantage 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.860
 she has a chance at these 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.530
 preponderant in this quinté 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.300
 the 17 trinity of the world comes to do well 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.620
 falun facing no man's land takes a 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.260
 beautiful second place in an event 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.120
 recent while she was shod here at 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.440
 2100 she 17 it's the only loïc 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.210
 since it will be déferré of the previous ones 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.330
 this time unlike the 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.950
 last time so this trinity dumont 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.019
 with Eric Raffin who alone is 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.489
 hand could very well surprise 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.530
 despite his bad number since of 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.910
 more and more 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.410
 we see horses that do not start 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.200
 on that distance there vincennes do l 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.690
 arrival of the big start of the meeting on 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.700
 number 15 of tina dupont and will be déferré 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.220
 later facing troika of the iton 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.630
 she had emerged late when 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.980
 the victory of the resident of quebec 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.270
 but she had very well sprinted 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.510
 to come take a nice second 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.110
 square 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:41.730
 I summarize my selection on the 3rd 4 las 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:44.430
 the 2nd the 10th the 14th and the 17th and the 15th 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.610
 play advise from field 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:52.500
 reduced in multi 3,4 and basic aces with 2 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:56.310
 10 14 15 17 and 11 the same thing at 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:00.890
 quarter and quinté makes you 3 4 aces of 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:04.190
 base x with the same good game at all and 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.190
 try to touch
