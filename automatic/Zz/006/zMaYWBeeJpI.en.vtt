what<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.309> was<00:00:47.399> talking<00:00:47.550> about<00:00:47.899> during<00:00:48.899> our<00:00:49.020> last

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
what I was talking about during our last

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.200 
what I was talking about during our last
webisode<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.950> started<00:00:50.309> talking<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.969> about

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
webisode I started talking to you about

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.240 
webisode I started talking to you about
what<00:00:51.719> we<00:00:51.750> call<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.320> business<00:00:52.739> value<00:00:53.039> chain

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
what we call the business value chain

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.850 
what we call the business value chain
this<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> method<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.750> here<00:00:55.020> at<00:00:55.140> unisys<00:00:55.590> use

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
this is a method we here at unisys use

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.010 
this is a method we here at unisys use
to<00:00:56.070> drive<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> top-down<00:00:56.850> approach<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.570> managing

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
to drive a top-down approach to managing

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.099 
to drive a top-down approach to managing
IT<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:59.219> key<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.609> methodology<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.660> how<00:01:00.960> it

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
IT the key to this methodology is how it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.380 
IT the key to this methodology is how it
properly<00:01:01.530> aligns<00:01:01.920> business<00:01:02.520> demand<00:01:02.910> with<00:01:03.180> IT

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
properly aligns business demand with IT

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.780 
properly aligns business demand with IT
delivery<00:01:03.989> or<00:01:04.559> if<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.860> happen<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.250> recall<00:01:05.369> what

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
delivery or if you happen to recall what

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.760 
delivery or if you happen to recall what
we<00:01:06.119> refer<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.390> as<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> digital<00:01:07.229> supply<00:01:07.500> chain

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
we refer to as the digital supply chain

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.429 
we refer to as the digital supply chain
well<00:01:08.670> after<00:01:08.970> viewing<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.689> show<00:01:09.900> someone

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
well after viewing that show someone

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.020 
well after viewing that show someone
said<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.590> me<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:11.280> know<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.700> was<00:01:11.820> really

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
said to me you know that was really

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.940 
said to me you know that was really
interesting<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.600> makes<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.990> lot<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.170> sense<00:01:13.290> but

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
interesting and makes a lot of sense but

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.219 
interesting and makes a lot of sense but
how<00:01:14.130> does<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.310> relate<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.760> cloud<00:01:14.970> computing<00:01:15.229> so

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
how does it relate to cloud computing so

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.010 
how does it relate to cloud computing so
I<00:01:16.500> must<00:01:16.770> admit<00:01:17.040> at<00:01:17.400> first<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:18.090> kind<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.750> not<00:01:18.869> pay

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
I must admit at first I kind of not pay

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.840 
I must admit at first I kind of not pay
too<00:01:19.080> much<00:01:19.200> attention<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> question<00:01:20.280> it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
too much attention to the question it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.880 
too much attention to the question it
was<00:01:21.119> after<00:01:21.390> all<00:01:21.600> coming<00:01:22.140> from<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.409> marketing

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
was after all coming from a marketing

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.460 
was after all coming from a marketing
person<00:01:23.130> well<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.820> know<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.270> scared<00:01:24.540> me<00:01:24.689> but

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
person well you know just scared me but

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.170 
person well you know just scared me but
after<00:01:25.740> some<00:01:25.890> consideration<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.640> realized<00:01:27.030> it

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
after some consideration I realized it

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.760 
after some consideration I realized it
was<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.299> great<00:01:27.600> point<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.020> absolutely

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
was a great point and absolutely

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.670 
was a great point and absolutely
deserves<00:01:29.130> an<00:01:29.340> explanation<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.329> here<00:01:30.509> we<00:01:30.600> go

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
deserves an explanation so here we go

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.319 
deserves an explanation so here we go
cloud<00:01:31.680> computing<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.520> new<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.030> yes

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
cloud computing is a new and yes

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.929 
cloud computing is a new and yes
exciting<00:01:34.110> concept<00:01:34.650> but<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.250> fundamentally

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
exciting concept but it's fundamentally

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.899 
exciting concept but it's fundamentally
just<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.270> different<00:01:36.720> IT<00:01:36.869> delivery<00:01:37.380> method

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
just a different IT delivery method

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.460 
just a different IT delivery method
application<00:01:38.909> still<00:01:39.240> need<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.479> run<00:01:39.659> system

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
application still need to run system

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.380 
application still need to run system
still<00:01:40.740> need<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.100> patched<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.670> yes<00:01:41.909> systems

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
still need to be patched and yes systems

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.420 
still need to be patched and yes systems
still<00:01:42.540> break<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.409> unique<00:01:43.649> thing<00:01:43.710> about<00:01:43.950> cloud

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
still break the unique thing about cloud

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.580 
still break the unique thing about cloud
that<00:01:44.850> these<00:01:45.030> resources<00:01:45.600> are<00:01:45.780> elastic<00:01:46.439> and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
that these resources are elastic and

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.440 
that these resources are elastic and
resilient<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.189> autonomic<00:01:47.729> among<00:01:48.299> other

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
resilient and autonomic among other

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.359 
resilient and autonomic among other
things<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.439> when<00:01:49.619> considering<00:01:50.070> cloud

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
things so when considering cloud

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.819 
things so when considering cloud
