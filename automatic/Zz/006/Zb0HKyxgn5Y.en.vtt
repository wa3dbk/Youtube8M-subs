I've just taken delivery the black iPad

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.220 
I've just taken delivery the black iPad
Mini<00:00:11.549> from<00:00:11.820> Apple<00:00:12.240> so<00:00:12.540> I'll<00:00:12.809> do<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.110> quick

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
Mini from Apple so I'll do a quick

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.460 
Mini from Apple so I'll do a quick
unboxing<00:00:13.589> of<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.610> black<00:00:14.820> version<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.470> then

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
unboxing of the black version and then

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.560 
unboxing of the black version and then
I'll<00:00:16.620> do<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> comparison<00:00:17.760> between<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.360> black

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
I'll do a comparison between the black

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:37.240 
I'll do a comparison between the black
and<00:00:18.810> white

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.729 

so<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.430> packaging<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.090> obviously<00:00:39.739> identical

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
so the packaging is obviously identical

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.250 
so the packaging is obviously identical
to<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.340> white<00:00:41.699> I<00:00:41.940> pad<00:00:42.270> mini<00:00:42.600> apart<00:00:42.960> from<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.200 
to the white I pad mini apart from the
picture<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.739> black<00:00:43.980> iPad<00:00:44.610> Mini<00:00:44.970> on<00:00:45.090> the

picture of the black iPad Mini on the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:54.920 
picture of the black iPad Mini on the
front<00:00:50.150> and<00:00:52.220> then<00:00:53.220> inside<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.000> have<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.480> iPad

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
front and then inside you have the iPad

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.660 
front and then inside you have the iPad
Mini<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.409> the<00:00:55.530> top<00:00:56.659> and<00:00:57.949> then<00:00:58.949> underneath<00:00:59.190> you

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
Mini on the top and then underneath you

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.609 
Mini on the top and then underneath you
have<00:00:59.790> the<00:00:59.970> mains<00:01:00.210> adapter<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:03.229> USB<00:01:04.229> to

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
have the mains adapter and the USB to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.760 
have the mains adapter and the USB to
lightning<00:01:04.970> cable<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.180> then<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.289> Apple

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
lightning cable and then the Apple

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.899 
lightning cable and then the Apple
stickers<00:01:08.039> and<00:01:09.050> instruction<00:01:10.050> sheet

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.929 

so<00:01:13.719> looking<00:01:14.140> at<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:14.380> two<00:01:14.590> iPads<00:01:15.009> side-by-side

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
so looking at the two iPads side-by-side

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.850 
so looking at the two iPads side-by-side
the<00:01:16.180> black<00:01:16.390> version<00:01:16.719> is<00:01:16.990> definitely<00:01:17.229> the<00:01:17.680> more

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
the black version is definitely the more

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.459 
the black version is definitely the more
masculine<00:01:18.310> of<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.850> two<00:01:19.090> they<00:01:19.689> both<00:01:19.719> have<00:01:20.320> the

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
masculine of the two they both have the

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:22.770 
masculine of the two they both have the
same<00:01:20.500> matte<00:01:21.130> textured<00:01:21.939> finish<00:01:22.299> on<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:22.600> back

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
same matte textured finish on the back

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.319 
same matte textured finish on the back
and<00:01:23.049> the<00:01:24.039> silver<00:01:24.640> version<00:01:24.759> is<00:01:25.060> quite

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
and the silver version is quite

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.660 
and the silver version is quite
reminiscent<00:01:25.780> of<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.380> original<00:01:26.409> iPhone<00:01:27.399> the

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
reminiscent of the original iPhone the

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.660 
reminiscent of the original iPhone the
first-generation<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.770> black<00:01:30.009> version<00:01:30.250> isn't

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
first-generation the black version isn't

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.999 
first-generation the black version isn't
quite<00:01:31.119> black<00:01:31.450> it's<00:01:31.720> more<00:01:31.990> of<00:01:32.079> a<00:01:32.170> dark<00:01:32.500> grayish

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
quite black it's more of a dark grayish

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.490 
quite black it's more of a dark grayish
blue<00:01:33.399> color<00:01:33.759> and<00:01:34.000> I<00:01:34.479> found<00:01:34.750> that<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:35.049> Apple

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
blue color and I found that the Apple

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.319 
blue color and I found that the Apple
logo<00:01:35.679> on<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.369> back<00:01:36.490> of<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.789> white<00:01:36.970> version

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
logo on the back of the white version

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.450 
logo on the back of the white version
stands<00:01:37.869> out<00:01:38.170> a<00:01:38.200> lot<00:01:38.590> more<00:01:38.799> than<00:01:39.009> it<00:01:39.130> does<00:01:39.280> on

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
stands out a lot more than it does on

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:47.359 
stands out a lot more than it does on
the<00:01:39.490> black<00:01:39.759> version

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.280 

the<00:01:48.369> black<00:01:48.640> bezel<00:01:49.150> around<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.540> screen<00:01:49.869> seems

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
the black bezel around the screen seems

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.130 
the black bezel around the screen seems
to<00:01:50.619> make<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:51.159> screen<00:01:51.670> look<00:01:52.000> brighter<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:52.810> the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
to make the screen look brighter and the

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.740 
to make the screen look brighter and the
cause<00:01:53.439> more<00:01:53.799> vibrant<00:01:54.430> than<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.540> white

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
cause more vibrant than the white

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.050 
cause more vibrant than the white
version<00:01:56.140> which<00:01:56.770> obviously<00:01:57.220> is<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.549> lot<00:01:57.820> better

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
version which obviously is a lot better

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.270 
version which obviously is a lot better
for<00:01:58.270> watching<00:01:58.899> movies<00:01:59.350> or<00:01:59.619> looking<00:02:00.070> at<00:02:00.189> the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
for watching movies or looking at the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.670 
for watching movies or looking at the
photographs<00:02:00.939> and<00:02:01.210> it<00:02:01.750> doesn't<00:02:02.080> distract<00:02:02.470> your

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
photographs and it doesn't distract your

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.560 
photographs and it doesn't distract your
attention<00:02:03.310> from<00:02:03.490> what's<00:02:03.729> on<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.030> screen<00:02:04.240> like

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
attention from what's on the screen like

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.350 
attention from what's on the screen like
the<00:02:04.840> white<00:02:05.320> bezel<00:02:05.830> sometimes<00:02:06.399> has<00:02:06.640> a<00:02:06.670> tendency

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
the white bezel sometimes has a tendency

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.790 
the white bezel sometimes has a tendency
to

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.310 

the<00:02:11.610> fingerprints<00:02:12.330> seem<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.690> show<00:02:12.870> up<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.140> lot

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
the fingerprints seem to show up a lot

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.680 
the fingerprints seem to show up a lot
more<00:02:13.530> on<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.040> black<00:02:14.340> version<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.300> iPad

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
more on the black version of the iPad

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.140 
more on the black version of the iPad
they<00:02:15.960> need<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.350> on<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.770> white<00:02:16.980> version<00:02:17.370> that's

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
they need to on the white version that's

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.030 
they need to on the white version that's
not<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.630> say<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.140> fingerprints<00:02:19.800> aren't

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
not to say that the fingerprints aren't

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.860 
not to say that the fingerprints aren't
there<00:02:20.340> it's<00:02:20.520> just<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.880> they're<00:02:21.180> not<00:02:21.210> really

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
there it's just that they're not really

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.870 
there it's just that they're not really
as<00:02:22.050> noticeable<00:02:22.860> because<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.550> color<00:02:23.790> of

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
as noticeable because of the color of

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.360 
as noticeable because of the color of
the<00:02:24.150> back<00:02:24.360> whereas<00:02:25.260> on<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.620> black<00:02:25.860> version

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
the back whereas on the black version

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.490 
the back whereas on the black version
they<00:02:26.580> are<00:02:26.610> quite<00:02:27.150> noticeable<00:02:30.050> so<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.080> hope<00:02:31.350> this

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
they are quite noticeable so I hope this

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.960 
they are quite noticeable so I hope this
