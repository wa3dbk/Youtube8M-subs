00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.689
 hello everyone knows this crime 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.120
 ghostface for a new video 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:10.490

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.139
 first video that I'm going to put on 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.599
 Youtube 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.019
 so this channel is going to talk about movie 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.720
 horror 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.180
 so you can see it today a 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.210
 little review of michael myers mask 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.160
 in halloween 2 bought in america 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.740
 so me personally I bought it 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.380
 on Halloween at Isaiah the man whose who 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.440
 is an American site really the price 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.050
 of this losc was not was not expensive 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.950
 he was not expensive at all he was not 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.960
 cheap great delivery 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.420
 frankly the books have nothing to say 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.250
 I order them and on Saturday he arrived 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.720
 Thursday 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.370
 so not even a week of expectations 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.440
 Coixet 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:56.350
 and here I have had this mas what is it so 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.270
 if you want to get this mask 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.200
 you go on google you click you 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.339
 mark pardon halloween to isiah the man 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.639
 So here is an American site you 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.350
 have found easily so here we go 

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:13.960
 do a little review of this mask 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.429
 very quickly the mask itself 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:22.909
 I really think it's a very 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:26.270
 beautiful piece the hair really that's it 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:30.259
 so we'll go to the qualities or 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.240
 defects then the quality of the mask already 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.259
 here I do not know if you can not if 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:40.090
 we see well you see the mask here 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:43.819
 is pretty white and a hit the roses 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.399
 why because basically the key mayor 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:49.759
 michael myers is nothing but the mask 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.999
 kirk captain in star trek what has 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.649
 do john carpenter 

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:56.359
 he took the mask of Captain Kirk 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.340
 he painted the face in white she is 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:02.340
 the shot in pink as always power 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.479
 rose is compared to the face so 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.200
 leave the shot in pink 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.500
 he has enlarged his eyes he has removed the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.650
 eyebrows and see here the mask of the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.129
 kirk captain with rouflaquettes 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:21.110
 still see the apparent traces his 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:25.799
 part and 24 hours he then removed 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:29.099
 on the side we can see that there is a 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.590
 little hole with taste of blood it's not 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:36.360
 a defect in fact it's in halloween 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:40.019
 1 actually but that mr is getting out of 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.030
 behind couch and laurie strode him 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:48.450
 gives a blow referred to knitting 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:52.560
 right here next the hair I saw from 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.239
 three French videos where people 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.860
 said that the stitches trade 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.170
 finally the michael byers mask rather 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.920
 was losing her hair there was concern that 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.200
 then pulling yes yes also we lose his 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:10.340
 hair not see why he would have 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.340
 exceptional walnut 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.709
 here 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.470
 so what did I do what I took 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.900
 from the lacc 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.230
 I have acquiesced hair and really I 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:31.209
 no problem I have no problem with the 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.610
 then mask the size of the mask 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.650
 I had a lot of people saying that the 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.910
 mask was too big me 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.140
 personally when jacques on picture 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:46.540
 to try it I'm going nickel really he 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:48.300
 I'm going nickel what are I so I think 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.430
 that's it to hide it 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.489
