post video real quick here alright so
we're<00:00:35.640> gonna<00:00:35.730> make<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.910> really<00:00:36.120> long<00:00:36.360> really

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
we're gonna make a really long really

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.869 
we're gonna make a really long really
difficult<00:00:37.140> double<00:00:37.380> jump<00:00:37.559> here<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.760> make

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
difficult double jump here and to make

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.010 
difficult double jump here and to make
this<00:00:38.969> easy<00:00:39.030> on<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.420> guys<00:00:39.570> what<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.840> want<00:00:39.960> to

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
this easy on you guys what you want to

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
this easy on you guys what you want to
do<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.290> want<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.530> aim<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:40.920> you're

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
do is you want to aim so you're

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.860 
do is you want to aim so you're
perpendicular<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.760> sort<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.120> shutting

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
perpendicular to that sort of shutting

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.600 
perpendicular to that sort of shutting
wall<00:00:43.140> there<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.620> they<00:00:44.100> just<00:00:44.250> aim<00:00:44.399> right

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
wall there and they just aim right

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.490 
wall there and they just aim right
towards<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.090> jump<00:00:45.660> at<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.809> last<00:00:46.079> second<00:00:46.440> and

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
towards that jump at the last second and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.950 
towards that jump at the last second and
make<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> really<00:00:47.430> long<00:00:47.610> double<00:00:47.910> jump<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.300> it'll

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
make a really long double jump and it'll

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.799 
make a really long double jump and it'll
make<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.289> no<00:00:49.379> problem<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.640> super<00:00:51.180> long<00:00:51.420> double

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
make it no problem so super long double

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.779 
make it no problem so super long double
jump<00:00:52.020> get<00:00:52.590> onto<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.949> wall<00:00:53.129> there<00:00:53.340> chain

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
jump get onto the wall there chain

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.569 
jump get onto the wall there chain
another<00:00:54.180> wall<00:00:54.449> run<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.219> double<00:00:56.219> jump<00:00:56.399> over

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
another wall run and double jump over

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.160 
another wall run and double jump over
the<00:00:56.699> crates<00:00:56.969> their<00:00:57.149> wall<00:00:57.690> run<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.020> that'll

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
the crates their wall run and that'll

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.319 
the crates their wall run and that'll
put<00:00:58.289> your<00:00:58.379> right<00:00:58.559> at<00:00:58.800> sea<00:00:59.340> now<00:00:59.609> I'm<00:01:00.149> going<00:01:00.270> to

go right back to a from seek and get on
the<00:01:02.250> crates<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:02.850> jump<00:01:03.840> over<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.409> wall

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
the crates here jump over to the wall

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.690 
the crates here jump over to the wall
