is that AV connector and not the AV but

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.470 
is that AV connector and not the AV but
the<00:02:49.590> park<00:02:49.829> connector<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:50.879> are<00:02:51.090> these<00:02:51.359> are

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
the park connector this are these are
