hi GCSE biology syllabus statement 516
looking<00:00:07.350> at<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.589> term<00:00:07.970> transgenic<00:00:12.110> so<00:00:13.110> far<00:00:14.870> in

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
looking at the term transgenic so far in

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.349 
looking at the term transgenic so far in
looking<00:00:17.100> at<00:00:17.250> genetically<00:00:17.850> modified

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
looking at genetically modified

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.080 
looking at genetically modified
organisms<00:00:18.990> we've<00:00:19.740> come<00:00:19.949> across<00:00:20.039> two<00:00:20.490> examples

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
organisms we've come across two examples

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.779 
organisms we've come across two examples
of<00:00:21.300> what<00:00:21.630> we<00:00:21.750> would<00:00:21.869> call<00:00:22.109> transgenic<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
of what we would call transgenic the

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.060 
of what we would call transgenic the
first<00:00:24.119> was<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:25.019> video<00:00:26.180> 513<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.480> there<00:00:28.349> we<00:00:28.740> saw

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
first was in video 513 and there we saw

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.790 
first was in video 513 and there we saw
a<00:00:29.369> bacterial<00:00:30.240> cell<00:00:32.420> which<00:00:33.420> had<00:00:33.600> become

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
a bacterial cell which had become

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.790 
a bacterial cell which had become
transgenic<00:00:35.030> since<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.239> still<00:00:36.510> had<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:48.580 

bacterial<00:00:40.800> DNA<00:00:43.850> but<00:00:45.140> it<00:00:46.140> had<00:00:46.379> plasmids<00:00:47.239> inside

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
bacterial DNA but it had plasmids inside

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.630 
bacterial DNA but it had plasmids inside
that<00:00:49.590> carried<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.640> human<00:00:51.120> insulin<00:00:52.110> gene<00:00:52.640> here

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
that carried the human insulin gene here

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.049 
that carried the human insulin gene here
indicated<00:00:54.329> by<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.809> small<00:00:55.440> yellow<00:00:55.739> mark<00:00:56.070> that

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
indicated by a small yellow mark that

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.020 
indicated by a small yellow mark that
would<00:00:57.149> be<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.559> human<00:01:00.410> insulin

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
would be the human insulin

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.740 
would be the human insulin

so<00:01:05.380> here<00:01:05.560> we<00:01:05.680> have<00:01:05.800> an<00:01:05.860> organism<00:01:06.660> with<00:01:07.660> its

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
so here we have an organism with its

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.340 
so here we have an organism with its
original<00:01:08.410> DNA<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:09.100> with<00:01:09.820> some<00:01:10.030> human<00:01:10.360> DNA<00:01:10.930> so

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
original DNA and with some human DNA so

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.230 
original DNA and with some human DNA so
this<00:01:11.500> is<00:01:11.650> an<00:01:11.770> example<00:01:12.040> of<00:01:12.220> a<00:01:12.310> transgenic

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
this is an example of a transgenic

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.580 
this is an example of a transgenic
organism<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:15.610> second<00:01:15.970> example<00:01:16.600> that<00:01:17.200> we<00:01:17.350> saw

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
organism the second example that we saw

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:30.570 
organism the second example that we saw
was<00:01:18.220> in<00:01:19.800> 515<00:01:20.800> and<00:01:21.370> there<00:01:22.330> we<00:01:23.140> saw<00:01:24.960> maize

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:38.010 

so<00:01:31.210> we<00:01:31.360> have<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:32.590> maize<00:01:32.860> DNA<00:01:36.660> and<00:01:37.660> we<00:01:37.900> had

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
so we have the maize DNA and we had

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.170 
so we have the maize DNA and we had
transferred<00:01:38.920> into<00:01:39.280> that<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:40.090> BT<00:01:40.690> gene<00:01:42.180> which

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
transferred into that the BT gene which

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.830 
transferred into that the BT gene which
produced<00:01:43.690> a<00:01:43.810> toxin<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.620> kill<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:44.980> larvae<00:01:45.460> past

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
produced a toxin to kill the larvae past

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.230 
produced a toxin to kill the larvae past
so<00:01:46.840> we've<00:01:47.020> got<00:01:47.200> two<00:01:47.560> different<00:01:48.250> different

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
so we've got two different different

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.710 
so we've got two different different
kinds<00:01:49.750> of<00:01:49.840> DNA<00:01:50.350> from<00:01:51.280> two<00:01:51.520> species<00:01:51.880> in<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.570> one

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
kinds of DNA from two species in the one

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.350 
kinds of DNA from two species in the one
organism<00:01:53.290> so<00:01:53.830> this<00:01:54.010> is<00:01:54.190> our<00:01:54.610> second<00:01:55.240> example

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
organism so this is our second example

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.510 
organism so this is our second example
of<00:01:56.320> a<00:01:56.620> transgenic<00:01:57.510> organism
