what's<00:00:00.359> up<00:00:00.510> guys<00:00:00.719> this<00:00:01.020> week<00:00:01.199> I'm<00:00:01.410> going<00:00:01.560> to

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
what's up guys this week I'm going to

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.249 
what's up guys this week I'm going to
show<00:00:01.770> you<00:00:01.800> the<00:00:02.070> simplest<00:00:02.429> way<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:03.049> square<00:00:04.049> up

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
show you the simplest way to square up

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.519 
show you the simplest way to square up
any<00:00:04.560> board<00:00:05.040> take<00:00:05.910> this<00:00:06.180> one<00:00:06.450> for<00:00:06.660> example<00:00:06.720> it's

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
any board take this one for example it's

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.270 
any board take this one for example it's
pretty<00:00:08.490> um<00:00:08.880> it's<00:00:09.420> pretty<00:00:10.260> rough<00:00:10.590> so<00:00:11.099> I'm<00:00:11.160> going

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
pretty um it's pretty rough so I'm going

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.160 
pretty um it's pretty rough so I'm going
to<00:00:11.309> make<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:11.759> into<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.120> usable<00:00:12.420> board<00:00:12.900> today

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
to make it into a usable board today

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.770 
to make it into a usable board today
using<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:13.980> minimum<00:00:14.580> amount<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.179> tools<00:00:15.450> as

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
using the minimum amount of tools as

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.900 
using the minimum amount of tools as
possible<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:16.949> we're<00:00:17.310> going<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.490> head<00:00:17.670> over<00:00:17.699> to

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
possible so we're going to head over to

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.910 
possible so we're going to head over to
the<00:00:17.970> bandsaw<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.869> get<00:00:19.050> started<00:00:19.380> by<00:00:19.650> cutting

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
the bandsaw and get started by cutting

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.279 
the bandsaw and get started by cutting
off<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.609> major<00:00:20.970> piece<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.390> bark<00:00:21.810> that's

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
off this major piece of bark that's

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.040 
off this major piece of bark that's
pretty<00:00:22.710> much<00:00:22.890> useless<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.630> will<00:00:24.840> be

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
pretty much useless and that will be

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:43.959 
pretty much useless and that will be
where<00:00:25.350> we<00:00:25.500> start<00:00:25.769> off

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.220 

all<00:00:44.969> right<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.329> now<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.870> board

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
all right so now I have this board

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.160 
all right so now I have this board
pretty<00:00:46.649> much<00:00:46.949> the<00:00:47.850> general<00:00:48.480> size<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.050> it's

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
pretty much the general size and it's

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.590 
pretty much the general size and it's
going<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.409> be<00:00:49.589> so<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.460> cut<00:00:50.760> through<00:00:50.909> freed

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
going to be so that cut through freed

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.310 
going to be so that cut through freed
are<00:00:51.780> nice<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:53.210> stiff<00:00:54.210> quick<00:00:54.390> comment<00:00:54.839> when

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
are nice and stiff quick comment when

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.869 
are nice and stiff quick comment when
you're<00:00:55.469> working<00:00:56.039> with<00:00:56.129> power<00:00:56.370> tools<00:00:56.429> I

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
you're working with power tools I

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.430 
you're working with power tools I
wouldn't<00:00:57.269> I<00:00:57.390> wouldn't<00:00:57.719> recommend<00:00:58.079> wearing

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
wouldn't I wouldn't recommend wearing

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.799 
wouldn't I wouldn't recommend wearing
gloves<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:59.460> went<00:00:59.850> on<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.180> far<00:01:00.510> away<00:01:00.750> from

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
gloves but went on that far away from

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.750 
gloves but went on that far away from
the<00:01:01.079> board<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.589> my<00:01:01.979> hands<00:01:02.219> are<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.549> back

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
the board like my hands are on the back

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.969 
the board like my hands are on the back
here<00:01:03.119> in<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.570> glades<00:01:03.989> way<00:01:04.259> up<00:01:04.470> there<00:01:04.739> so

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
here in the glades way up there so

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.889 
here in the glades way up there so
that's<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.270> doesn't<00:01:06.600> really<00:01:06.720> matter

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
that's that doesn't really matter

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.179 
that's that doesn't really matter
secondly<00:01:07.409> caught<00:01:07.830> it

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
secondly caught it

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.130 
secondly caught it
these<00:01:08.430> are<00:01:08.610> pretty<00:01:08.789> form-fitting<00:01:09.390> gloves<00:01:09.630> but

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
these are pretty form-fitting gloves but

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.870 
these are pretty form-fitting gloves but
when<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.350> get<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.619> while<00:01:10.950> using<00:01:11.369> other<00:01:11.640> tools

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
when I get to while using other tools

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.029 
when I get to while using other tools
I'm<00:01:12.299> going<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.750> take<00:01:12.990> them<00:01:13.140> off<00:01:13.319> because<00:01:13.560> on

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
I'm going to take them off because on

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.090 
I'm going to take them off because on
the<00:01:14.520> safety<00:01:14.940> dress<00:01:15.149> that<00:01:15.360> opposes<00:01:15.929> so<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.950> I

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the safety dress that opposes so like I

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.859 
the safety dress that opposes so like I
said<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.670> what's<00:01:17.940> the<00:01:18.119> board<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.539> I<00:01:18.569> want

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
said I have what's the board that I want

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.350 
said I have what's the board that I want
already<00:01:19.649> right<00:01:20.159> here<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.940> what<00:01:21.090> I'm<00:01:21.210> going<00:01:21.299> to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
already right here so what I'm going to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.059 
already right here so what I'm going to
do<00:01:21.539> now<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.049> I'm<00:01:22.380> going<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.679> take<00:01:22.860> this

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:23.069 
do now is I'm going to take this

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:25.880 
do now is I'm going to take this
straight<00:01:23.789> edge<00:01:23.819> which<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.390> basically<00:01:25.319> a<00:01:25.440> metal

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
straight edge which is basically a metal

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.609 
straight edge which is basically a metal
pipe<00:01:26.069> and<00:01:26.490> I'm<00:01:27.149> going<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.390> lay<00:01:27.569> it<00:01:27.630> down<00:01:27.780> I'm

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
pipe and I'm going to lay it down I'm

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.279 
pipe and I'm going to lay it down I'm
going<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.860> clamp<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.429> on<00:01:29.640> here<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.630> me<00:01:30.840> what

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
going to clamp it on here to me what

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.289 
going to clamp it on here to me what
looks<00:01:31.649> straight<00:01:32.159> I'm<00:01:32.700> going<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.940> take<00:01:33.119> my

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
looks straight I'm going to take my

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.600 
looks straight I'm going to take my
circular<00:01:33.869> saw<00:01:33.950> run<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.100> against<00:01:35.429> this

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
circular saw run it against this

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.520 
circular saw run it against this
makeshift<00:01:36.090> fence<00:01:36.360> that's<00:01:36.899> going<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.229> cut<00:01:37.500> a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
makeshift fence that's going to cut a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.770 
makeshift fence that's going to cut a
pretty<00:01:38.069> darn<00:01:38.280> straight<00:01:38.610> edge<00:01:38.819> then<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.569> can

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
pretty darn straight edge then I can

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.830 
pretty darn straight edge then I can
take<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.140> board<00:01:40.440> over<00:01:40.649> to<00:01:40.740> my<00:01:40.890> table<00:01:41.100> saw<00:01:41.490> and

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
take this board over to my table saw and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.480 
take this board over to my table saw and
square<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.929> up<00:01:43.020> from<00:01:43.200> there<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:44.100> that's<00:01:44.369> what

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
square it up from there so that's what

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.370 
square it up from there so that's what
I'm<00:01:44.549> going<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.729> do<00:01:44.880> right<00:01:44.969> now<00:01:45.149> I'm<00:01:45.630> gonna<00:01:45.750> take

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
clams in just cleanse less metal pipe on

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.149 
clams in just cleanse less metal pipe on
here<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.229> can<00:01:49.409> have<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.560> pretty<00:01:49.890> knock

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
here so I can have a pretty knock

00:01:50.159 --> 00:02:23.110 
here so I can have a pretty knock
straight<00:01:50.580> edge

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.720 

so<00:02:23.989> I'm<00:02:24.080> at<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.319> table<00:02:24.500> saw<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:25.340> put<00:02:25.610> the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
so I'm at the table saw and I put the

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.780 
so I'm at the table saw and I put the
straight<00:02:26.090> edge<00:02:26.300> on<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:28.069> side<00:02:28.099> of<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.519> fence

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
straight edge on the side of the fence

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.790 
straight edge on the side of the fence
and<00:02:29.239> I'm<00:02:29.599> going<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:29.840> run<00:02:30.019> it<00:02:30.140> through<00:02:30.170> once

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
and I'm going to run it through once

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.740 
and I'm going to run it through once
then<00:02:31.459> I'm<00:02:31.580> going<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:31.730> flip<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.030> over<00:02:32.209> and<00:02:32.390> run

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
then I'm going to flip it over and run

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.809 
then I'm going to flip it over and run
it<00:02:32.840> through<00:02:32.870> again<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.769> I<00:02:33.980> will<00:02:34.370> just<00:02:34.489> cut<00:02:34.760> off

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
it through again and I will just cut off

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.280 
it through again and I will just cut off
the<00:02:35.030> ends<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:35.599> should<00:02:35.810> be<00:02:35.930> pretty<00:02:36.200> much

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
the ends and it should be pretty much

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.440 
the ends and it should be pretty much
all<00:02:36.530> set<00:02:36.860> basically<00:02:37.610> I'm<00:02:37.790> just<00:02:37.879> squaring<00:02:38.209> up

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
all set basically I'm just squaring up

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:52.570 
all set basically I'm just squaring up
the<00:02:38.599> edges<00:02:38.900> right<00:02:39.110> now<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:47.830> know<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:48.860> fuse<00:02:51.580> not

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
the edges right now I know a fuse not

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:17.790 
the edges right now I know a fuse not
today<00:02:54.190> not<00:02:55.190> hey<00:02:57.370> all<00:02:58.370> right<00:02:58.519> take<00:02:58.790> two

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.110 

all<00:03:18.800> right<00:03:18.980> so<00:03:19.190> now<00:03:19.340> what<00:03:19.489> I'm<00:03:19.580> going<00:03:19.610> to<00:03:19.790> do<00:03:19.910> is

all right so now what I'm going to do is
take<00:03:20.330> the<00:03:20.510> side<00:03:20.780> that<00:03:20.989> I<00:03:21.050> cut<00:03:21.560> I'm<00:03:22.280> going<00:03:22.550> to

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
take the side that I cut I'm going to

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.530 
take the side that I cut I'm going to
flip<00:03:22.970> it<00:03:23.000> over<00:03:23.680> so<00:03:24.680> that<00:03:24.890> even<00:03:25.459> smoother<00:03:26.209> side

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
flip it over so that even smoother side

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.530 
flip it over so that even smoother side
is<00:03:26.900> right<00:03:27.110> here<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:28.099> from<00:03:28.640> here<00:03:29.150> what<00:03:29.420> I'm

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
shave off about a quarter inch on this

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:49.700 
shave off about a quarter inch on this
side

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710

right here see there's like no gaps
between<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.640> table<00:04:07.000> surface<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.890> piece

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
between the table surface and the piece

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.390 
between the table surface and the piece
of<00:04:09.250> wood<00:04:09.400> so<00:04:09.670> I<00:04:10.270> cannot<00:04:10.570> really<00:04:10.870> good<00:04:11.170> um<00:04:11.500> what

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
of wood so I cannot really good um what

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.130 
of wood so I cannot really good um what
I'm<00:04:12.490> going<00:04:12.610> to<00:04:12.640> do<00:04:12.790> next<00:04:13.030> is<00:04:13.300> square<00:04:13.780> off<00:04:13.900> the

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
I'm going to do next is square off the

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.370 
I'm going to do next is square off the
ends<00:04:14.709> and<00:04:14.890> if<00:04:15.760> you<00:04:15.880> guys<00:04:16.000> want<00:04:16.480> to<00:04:16.750> from<00:04:17.049> here

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
ends and if you guys want to from here

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.560 
ends and if you guys want to from here
what<00:04:17.620> you<00:04:17.799> would<00:04:18.010> do<00:04:18.190> is<00:04:18.489> take<00:04:19.000> your<00:04:19.180> planer

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
what you would do is take your planer

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.280 
what you would do is take your planer
and<00:04:19.930> shave<00:04:20.290> it<00:04:20.859> down<00:04:21.100> to<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.459> right<00:04:21.609> thickness

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
and shave it down to the right thickness

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.290 
and shave it down to the right thickness
but<00:04:23.290> um<00:04:23.530> I<00:04:23.890> have<00:04:24.190> to<00:04:24.340> say<00:04:24.580> I'm<00:04:24.790> not<00:04:24.820> sure<00:04:25.150> what

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
I'm going to do with this board yet so I

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.680 
I'm going to do with this board yet so I
don't<00:04:26.710> want<00:04:26.950> to<00:04:27.040> waste<00:04:27.280> any<00:04:27.700> wood<00:04:28.270> right<00:04:28.540> now

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
don't want to waste any wood right now

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.810 
don't want to waste any wood right now
so<00:04:29.260> I'm<00:04:29.350> just<00:04:29.470> going<00:04:29.620> to<00:04:29.680> keep<00:04:29.980> the<00:04:30.160> tops<00:04:30.430> plain

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
so I'm just going to keep the tops plain

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.000 
so I'm just going to keep the tops plain
so<00:04:31.360> I'm<00:04:31.419> going<00:04:31.540> to<00:04:31.600> cut<00:04:31.810> off<00:04:31.960> cut<00:04:32.440> off<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.800> ends

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
so I'm going to cut off cut off the ends

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.770 
so I'm going to cut off cut off the ends
and<00:04:33.100> square<00:04:33.400> them<00:04:33.490> up<00:04:33.610> because<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.480> don't

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
and square them up because I don't

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.480 
and square them up because I don't
really<00:04:34.990> want<00:04:35.110> to<00:04:35.320> voice<00:04:35.560> any<00:04:35.800> wood<00:04:36.070> if<00:04:36.160> I<00:04:36.280> need

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
really want to voice any wood if I need

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.659 
really want to voice any wood if I need
it

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
it

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.090 
it
certain<00:04:37.390> thickness<00:04:37.600> I<00:04:38.050> don't<00:04:38.680> want<00:04:38.860> to<00:04:38.950> always

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
certain thickness I don't want to always

00:04:39.100 --> 00:05:05.040 
certain thickness I don't want to always
think<00:04:39.700> that<00:04:39.940> good<00:04:40.210> wood

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.750 

so<00:05:06.050> guys<00:05:06.260> I<00:05:06.500> gotta<00:05:06.710> say<00:05:06.920> that<00:05:07.100> this<00:05:07.250> board<00:05:07.490> came

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
so guys I gotta say that this board came

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.310 
so guys I gotta say that this board came
out<00:05:07.940> a<00:05:07.970> lot<00:05:08.270> better<00:05:08.480> than<00:05:08.600> I<00:05:08.810> thought<00:05:08.840> it<00:05:09.080> would

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
out a lot better than I thought it would

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.950 
out a lot better than I thought it would
next<00:05:10.100> thing<00:05:10.250> would<00:05:10.490> be<00:05:10.550> to<00:05:10.700> plane<00:05:11.390> it<00:05:11.600> down<00:05:11.810> the

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
next thing would be to plane it down the

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.660 
next thing would be to plane it down the
thickness<00:05:12.470> and<00:05:12.680> start<00:05:13.220> cutting<00:05:13.580> up<00:05:13.610> your

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
thickness and start cutting up your

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.120 
thickness and start cutting up your
pieces<00:05:14.390> that<00:05:14.600> you<00:05:14.690> actually<00:05:14.900> need<00:05:15.290> to<00:05:15.530> build

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
pieces that you actually need to build

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.310 
pieces that you actually need to build
whatever<00:05:16.340> project<00:05:17.000> it<00:05:17.120> is<00:05:17.240> so<00:05:17.810> like<00:05:17.990> I<00:05:18.020> said

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
whatever project it is so like I said

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.720 
whatever project it is so like I said
I'm<00:05:18.440> not<00:05:18.590> going<00:05:18.830> to<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:19.070> planning<00:05:19.460> today

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
I'm not going to the planning today

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.120 
I'm not going to the planning today
because<00:05:20.150> I<00:05:20.330> don't<00:05:20.750> want<00:05:20.930> to<00:05:21.020> waste<00:05:21.170> any<00:05:21.470> amount

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
because I don't want to waste any amount

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.430 
because I don't want to waste any amount
of<00:05:22.250> wood<00:05:22.430> that<00:05:22.700> I<00:05:22.730> don't<00:05:22.970> have<00:05:23.150> to<00:05:23.480> because<00:05:24.230> I'm

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
of wood that I don't have to because I'm

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.800 
of wood that I don't have to because I'm
not<00:05:24.560> sure<00:05:24.830> we<00:05:25.280> don't<00:05:25.490> eat<00:05:25.820> yet<00:05:26.090> and<00:05:26.360> it's

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
not sure we don't eat yet and it's

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.420 
not sure we don't eat yet and it's
pretty<00:05:27.050> easy<00:05:27.140> to<00:05:27.440> give<00:05:27.680> it<00:05:27.800> a<00:05:27.860> swipe<00:05:28.220> through

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
pretty easy to give it a swipe through

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.000 
pretty easy to give it a swipe through
the<00:05:28.550> planer<00:05:28.970> so<00:05:29.630> I<00:05:29.660> will<00:05:30.260> say<00:05:30.440> that<00:05:30.740> for

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
the planer so I will say that for

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.010 
the planer so I will say that for
another<00:05:31.370> day<00:05:31.640> when<00:05:31.820> I<00:05:31.850> actually<00:05:32.120> do<00:05:32.420> a<00:05:32.450> project

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
another day when I actually do a project

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.530 
another day when I actually do a project
but<00:05:33.560> now<00:05:33.890> all<00:05:34.100> there's<00:05:34.340> left<00:05:34.400> to<00:05:34.610> do<00:05:34.790> is<00:05:35.060> check

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
but now all there's left to do is check

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.030 
but now all there's left to do is check
to<00:05:35.570> see<00:05:35.870> how<00:05:36.080> well<00:05:36.290> this<00:05:36.440> method<00:05:36.920> actually

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
to see how well this method actually

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.630 
to see how well this method actually
worked

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
worked

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.940 
worked
so<00:05:38.210> as<00:05:38.420> you<00:05:38.540> can<00:05:38.630> see<00:05:38.690> the<00:05:38.930> grain<00:05:39.230> is<00:05:39.440> going<00:05:39.620> in

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
so as you can see the grain is going in

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.570 
so as you can see the grain is going in
pretty<00:05:40.340> much<00:05:41.120> the<00:05:41.810> same<00:05:42.140> direction<00:05:42.440> as<00:05:42.800> the

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
pretty much the same direction as the

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.210 
pretty much the same direction as the
board<00:05:43.850> is<00:05:44.060> cut<00:05:44.360> so<00:05:44.930> that<00:05:44.960> came<00:05:45.290> out<00:05:45.410> nice<00:05:45.620> now

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
board is cut so that came out nice now

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.550 
board is cut so that came out nice now
if<00:05:46.310> we<00:05:46.460> head<00:05:46.580> over<00:05:46.790> to<00:05:46.880> this<00:05:47.000> corner<00:05:47.420> here<00:05:48.020> what

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
if we head over to this corner here what

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.290 
if we head over to this corner here what
I'm<00:05:48.650> going<00:05:48.770> to<00:05:48.800> show<00:05:49.190> you<00:05:49.250> is<00:05:49.640> I'm<00:05:49.970> going<00:05:50.240> to

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
I'm going to show you is I'm going to

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.290 
I'm going to show you is I'm going to
take<00:05:50.450> this<00:05:50.600> square<00:05:51.220> line<00:05:52.220> it<00:05:52.400> up<00:05:52.520> on<00:05:52.760> one<00:05:53.000> side

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
take this square line it up on one side

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.400 
take this square line it up on one side
and<00:05:53.780> as<00:05:54.140> you<00:05:54.170> can<00:05:54.470> see<00:05:55.210> that<00:05:56.210> is<00:05:56.420> a<00:05:56.450> pretty

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
and as you can see that is a pretty

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.660 
and as you can see that is a pretty
square<00:05:57.860> board

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670 
square board

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.750 
square board
so<00:05:59.180> yeah<00:05:59.600> this<00:05:59.780> did<00:06:00.530> work<00:06:00.740> out<00:06:00.950> pretty<00:06:01.490> good

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
so yeah this did work out pretty good

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.850 
so yeah this did work out pretty good
worked<00:06:02.360> out<00:06:02.540> a<00:06:02.570> lot<00:06:02.990> better<00:06:03.290> than<00:06:03.530> I<00:06:03.650> thought

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
worked out a lot better than I thought

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.070 
worked out a lot better than I thought
it<00:06:03.920> would<00:06:04.190> and<00:06:04.520> now<00:06:04.730> I<00:06:05.060> just<00:06:05.420> got<00:06:05.570> a<00:06:05.600> lot<00:06:05.840> more

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
it would and now I just got a lot more

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.650 
it would and now I just got a lot more
wood<00:06:06.320> to<00:06:06.380> do<00:06:06.710> this<00:06:06.890> too<00:06:07.160> and<00:06:07.450> soon<00:06:08.450> I'll<00:06:08.630> be

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
wood to do this too and soon I'll be

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.900 
wood to do this too and soon I'll be
building<00:06:09.200> some<00:06:09.470> pretty<00:06:09.950> nice<00:06:10.160> projects<00:06:10.760> out

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
building some pretty nice projects out

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.060 
building some pretty nice projects out
of<00:06:10.940> this<00:06:11.090> warm<00:06:11.330> up<00:06:11.480> but<00:06:12.080> I<00:06:12.200> do<00:06:12.260> think<00:06:12.740> that<00:06:13.010> uh

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
of this warm up but I do think that uh

of this warm up but I do think that uh
this<00:06:13.790> uh<00:06:13.850> turned<00:06:14.810> out<00:06:14.960> really<00:06:15.230> nice<00:06:15.500> and<00:06:15.830> I

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
this uh turned out really nice and I

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.270 
this uh turned out really nice and I
hope<00:06:16.790> you<00:06:16.970> guys<00:06:17.090> can<00:06:17.420> use<00:06:18.320> this<00:06:18.590> method<00:06:18.830> when

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
hope you guys can use this method when
