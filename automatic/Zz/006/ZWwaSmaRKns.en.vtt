00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.260
 hi how about today I will explain how 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:14.120
 make a partition to increase the 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:16.220
 internal memory of our ms 500 and 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.390
 also for some other variants of 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:23.720
 This same models model of LG well 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.230
 right now as you can see here in my 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:31.340
 applications because I have memory 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:34.520
 very full internal I have 153 megabytes 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.989
 free and that's a big problem 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.260
 moment that the install applications 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:42.020
 because you can install it more and not 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.510
 lets install more because you do not have 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.750
 enough space and that's a problem 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.720
 in this cell phone that has 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.120
 It has great big features 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.660
 to be able to take advantage of them 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.290
 maximum well what we will do is what 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.290
 following 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.640
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:13.780
 enter the next application that is 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.680
 called magnitude partition güiza in this 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.290
 in its free version version free this 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.310
 this application will allow us to make the 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.680
 partitions in our microsd memory 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.000
 in order to increase memory 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.930
 internal of our team 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.320
 well be good here as you can see 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.170
 I already have partition nothing my memory but 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.030
 what I will do will be land again and 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.790
 redo the procedure so that 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.440
 see that if it works look how they can 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.920
 see is at 12.6 gigabytes 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.860
 well now what we will do is eliminate 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.390
 everything or is a triple form in case they have 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.390
 something in your memory to make a 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.200
 backup of all your applications things 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.690
 in short and now I as I have already I have 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.460
 requested to eliminate all 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.370
 partitions 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:15.349
 and I will proceed to create the first partition 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:20.269
 and for that I'll right click and give in 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.269
 great or create again 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.400
 well now what we will do will be 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.080
 select how much space we will leave 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.420
 in the internal memory of our 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.050
 our cell phone for example they will leave 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:43.459
 2 gigas for my internal memory 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:46.970
 cellular leave in 12.65 gigabytes what 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.640
 we will give in primary and later 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.900
 we will give 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.900
 for 32 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.970
 and as I repeat, this varies for each 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.190
 microsd type if you have an 8 gb 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.310
 do the one according to the capacity that you 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.260
 you think it will occupy in memory 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.019
 internal cell phone for example for me 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.599
 they are perfect 2 gigs that I do not think 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.440
 they are going to occupy a lot of space 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.480
 applications that will install watching 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:24.150
 now what I will do will be the partition that 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.150
 I created and this partition 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:32.400
 enter it and the modify create and you 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.650
 we give in creating t 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.590
 and since we are inside of it what 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.730
 The only thing we will do is change our logic 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:47.190
 we change it we will change it to primary 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:50.489
 and we will put 4 this worked in several 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.620
 devices can be ex tripero x 4 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.150
 works on multiple devices or at 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.340
 less in my the jeep worked 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:02.850
 I perfectly recommend this option 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:06.630
 okay now we see in ok and we finish 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.890
 now we go and we give in applied for 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.890
 apply all changes 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.019
 well now we give in yes so that 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.019
 apply the changes of the partitions 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.040
 and let's wait a moment what ends 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.280
 this method is very good to be able 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.070
 increase the internal memory of our 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.750
 cellular if it is that as in my case 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.260
 you want to install enough 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.030
 applications and want to increase their 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.250
 internal memory to be able to continue 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.220
 installing and not having interruptions 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.210
 given that they already have low memory in their 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.150
 cell phone 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.860
 this works on different devices 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.860
 not simply in this 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:04.510
 well as you can see already finished we give 

00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:08.110
 in ok 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:12.130
 and we close everything 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:15.540
 and we extract our micro sd and we're going to 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.540
 our cell phone 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.699
 well no longer in our the jee what 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:32.780
 we will go to google play and there 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:35.419
 we will look for the link 22 etc and what 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.889
 we will install we accept and accept 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.889
 let's wait for it to be installed 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.550
 and in already installed what we will do is go 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.550
 to the application 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:56.759
 and in the application what will happen 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.580
 good to me no longer shows me a window 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:04.220
 but you will appear a window 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.240
 similar to the following so you will give 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:11.400
 in x 4 and they will give in ok 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:15.400
 and will continue with the following 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.620
 we will select what 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.660
 applications we want to move for that 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.780
 we will give in applications of the system of 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.580
 the internal memory and from here we will start 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.580
 to select the applications that 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:30.490
 we want to move to the sd card by 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.340
 example I move this application and you 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:36.669
 we will give in creating eye link is that is 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:40.509
 create link and do not move the sd card is 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:42.430
 create link well and so you can 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:46.150
 keep moving all your applications 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:48.039
 who want this one preferably move 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.110
 all so that space is released in 

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:53.740
 your internal memory and no longer give them 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:57.790
 problems and you already know that in creating 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:07:00.010
 link and so they will move to your sd card 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.350
 Okay now let's see how many 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.540
 applications I have linked and here as 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.940
 can see I have these applications 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.370
 linked for the moment maybe in another 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:12.070
 moment move to all the others but for 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:16.260
 the moment you can see that I already have these 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.260
 linked to my sd card 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:25.430
 well now what we will do will be 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.280
 this 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:31.220
 will go to settings and adjustments what 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.650
 We will select a Cáceres from 

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.180
 palomear an option in which the 

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.370
 we want the link to be made 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.350
 automatic so as not to be doing 

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:41.120
 us manually but that 

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.070
 automatically when we install a 

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.770
 application the application that link 

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:49.250
 alone and have to not be is 

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:52.390
 moving us with this we know 

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:54.550
 open us it will be easier 

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:56.800
 be installing applications and that 

00:07:54.550 --> 00:08:00.660
 they automatically link to the sd without 

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:03.330
 need to do it ourselves 

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:06.960
 If you have doubts about the video do not hesitate 

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:09.960
 in commenting them give light and subscribe 

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.750
 if you like it well this would be all of 

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.930
 my part I hope to have helped you 

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.930
 then
