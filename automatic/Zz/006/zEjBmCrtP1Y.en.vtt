00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.580
 for those who do not know me, my name is 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.290
 Neus and upload videos all all all 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.360
 Tuesday this time I'm going to teach you to 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.160
 customize the rubber sandals yo 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.529
 I have a problem and that is that this kind of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.180
 sandals always hurt me the rubber 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.039
 it sticks a little on my feet and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.779
 he has always given me up so I've 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.060
 found a way to avoid that and 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.519
 being able to wear them is about covering the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.590
 in a nice way with fabric in my case 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.719
 I used trapillo but you can use a 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.130
 handkerchief if you do not have trapillo and then 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.530
 you just have to customize it with 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.180
 beads or with any little thing that you 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.430
 go see with your swimsuit or with your clothes 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.239
 in this video I'm going to teach you how to decorate 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.739
 in two ways the sandal we go with it 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.960
 for the first sandals you're going to 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.870
 need the sandals you want 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.840
 customize color trap that more 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.600
 you like hot silicone and some 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.120
 scissors takes about one meter of 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.399
 trapillo better you have to spare 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.650
 add him then open the trapillo a bit 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.750
 so that it stays spread 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.410
 and outside the sandals part of 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.590
 water between your fingers make sure you 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.850
 It is well coated and fixed with a 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.410
 stone to be able to continue working 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.700
 now instead of rolling the trapillo by 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.700
 one of the strips of the sandal 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.740
 remember to open it so you can 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.740
 be finite 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.630
 when you get to the end hits the trapillo 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.630
 with a hot silicone droplet 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.650
 you can cut the excess 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.760
 just paste with silicones and 7 is left 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.760
 some piece without hitting 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.749
 now roll another long piece of 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.110
 trapillo that you have on the other side of the 

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:10.110
 sandal 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
 i 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.700
 and stick with a silicone droplet 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.700
 hot when you finish 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.610
 you can cut the remainder of trapillo 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.160
 that's how it has to be staying 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.890
 Now let's make the decoration pick up 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.940
 a long piece of cloth and makes 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.940
 several laps with him 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.980
 short when you finish the trapillo now 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.500
 with the piece that has left you do a 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.970
 knot around 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.640
 squeeze well so it does not come loose 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.300
 there is a second knot to ensure it very 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.730
 all right 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.730
 Now you can cut the ends of the knot 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.330
 finally I cut the strips in half 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:34.330
 so that they remain open 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.850
 with a little bit of silicone in the part 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.370
 front of the sandal and stick the 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.460
 decoration we have made make sure that 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.380
 the knot is hidden and you already have your 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.060
 sandals finished and prepared for 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.370
 look 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.830
 for the second model of sandals you're going 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.290
 to need the sandals you want 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.930
 customize color trap that 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.480
 you prefer beading I have chosen 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.599
 Pearls thread one color as long 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.300
 close as possible to the trapillo 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:11.700
 hot silicone a needle and scissors 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.940
 lining the strips of the sandal with the 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.260
 trapillo as in the previous model 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.600
 remember to finish the ends well with 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.639
 some hot silicone 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.980
 now let's sew values ​​throughout 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.130
 of the strips something similar to this 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:30.050
 sandal you see it's about placing 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.050
 a pearl in each stitch you make 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.570
 and 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.460
 the stitches have to be what 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.710
 sufficiently separated so that 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.090
 Beads have space and go 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.090
 correctly positioning 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.810
 that's how it has to be staying 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.780
 Now let's make the pompom 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.780
 decorate 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.400
 take the trapillo and start spinning 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:28.139
 you have to do many many laps 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.139
 so that you have a nice pompom 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.770
 when you've done as many laps as 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.810
 you want to cut the trapillo 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.169
 tie a knot in half of the turns 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.169
 what have you done 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.890
 i 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:01.030
 and squeezes very very strong makes another knot 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:04.240
 to finish securing it 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.040
 and cut the leftovers from trapillo is the 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.660
 time to start cutting in half 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:12.700
 of each turn 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.700
 that was how he opened the pompom 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.800
 and then I'm cutting the strips to the 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:30.470
 start that you like 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:34.270
 you have to go recolocando the opening 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.270
 a little pompom to make it look nice 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:41.020
 when you have it ready 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.730
 with hot silicone on the sandal be 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.340
 a little generous if you do not want to be 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.750
 release and paste the chocolate squeezing 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.620
 slightly so that it sticks 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.260
 perfectly
