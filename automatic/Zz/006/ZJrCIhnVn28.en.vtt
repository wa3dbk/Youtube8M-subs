00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.370 
get this thing up and running the way it
is<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:49.790> don't<00:00:50.790> believe<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.600> did<00:00:51.810> it<00:00:51.840> this

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 
is but I don't believe it we did it this

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.320 
is but I don't believe it we did it this
is<00:00:52.440> incredible<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.489> thing<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:53.940> literally

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
is incredible this thing was literally

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.700 
is incredible this thing was literally
one<00:00:54.690> frozen<00:00:55.290> piece<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.950> couple<00:00:56.790> months<00:00:57.120> ago<00:00:57.710> all

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
one frozen piece a couple months ago all

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.110 
one frozen piece a couple months ago all
right<00:00:58.860> now<00:00:58.950> this<00:00:59.100> thing's<00:00:59.309> been<00:00:59.460> mostly<00:00:59.820> wills

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
right now this thing's been mostly wills

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.290 
right now this thing's been mostly wills
baby<00:01:01.520> what<00:01:02.520> did<00:01:02.610> you<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.210> get

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
baby what did you have to do to get

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.120 
baby what did you have to do to get
spark<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:04.020> this<00:01:04.610> well<00:01:06.470> first<00:01:07.470> thing<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:07.979> did

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
spark on this well first thing we did

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.800 
spark on this well first thing we did
was<00:01:08.310> replace<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.880> coil<00:01:09.330> because<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> coil

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
was replace the coil because the coil

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.580 
was replace the coil because the coil
looked<00:01:10.110> awful<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> old<00:01:10.830> coil<00:01:12.170> got<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> new

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
looked awful the old coil got a new

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.310 
looked awful the old coil got a new
condenser<00:01:14.009> mounted<00:01:15.000> externally<00:01:15.210> rather<00:01:16.050> than

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
condenser mounted externally rather than

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.120 
condenser mounted externally rather than
um<00:01:16.560> underneath<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.700> flywheel<00:01:18.320> we<00:01:19.320> got<00:01:19.740> what

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
um underneath the flywheel we got what

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.240 
um underneath the flywheel we got what
else<00:01:20.310> hardwired<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.540> grounded<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.770> ignition

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
else hardwired it grounded the ignition

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.420 
else hardwired it grounded the ignition
coil<00:01:23.630> from<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> stator<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.830> grounds<00:01:26.310> to

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
coil from the stator so it grounds to

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.900 
coil from the stator so it grounds to
the<00:01:26.550> UM<00:01:27.080> stood<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.320> intake<00:01:28.710> same<00:01:29.610> with<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
the UM stood on the intake same with the

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.639 
the UM stood on the intake same with the
coil<00:01:30.210> we're<00:01:30.509> grounding<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:31.020> coil<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.440> the

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
coil we're grounding the coil that the

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.900 
coil we're grounding the coil that the
intake<00:01:32.040> also<00:01:32.729> did<00:01:33.320> keep<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.790> original<00:01:35.790> aa

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
intake also did keep this original aa

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
intake also did keep this original aa
little<00:01:36.270> grounding<00:01:36.960> strap<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:38.690> kind<00:01:39.690> of<00:01:39.750> rig

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
little grounding strap on it kind of rig

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.750 
little grounding strap on it kind of rig
that<00:01:40.729> what<00:01:41.729> else<00:01:42.440> okay<00:01:43.440> we<00:01:43.680> got<00:01:43.800> new<00:01:43.950> points<00:01:44.460> -

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
that what else okay we got new points -

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.030 
that what else okay we got new points -
yeah<00:01:45.240> that's<00:01:45.420> right<00:01:45.630> new<00:01:45.840> points<00:01:46.380> cuz<00:01:46.740> no

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
yeah that's right new points cuz no

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.340 
yeah that's right new points cuz no
matter<00:01:47.250> how<00:01:47.580> much<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.270> cleaned<00:01:48.900> up<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.080> old

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
matter how much I cleaned up the old

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.380 
matter how much I cleaned up the old
ones<00:01:49.650> they<00:01:49.890> were<00:01:49.950> still<00:01:50.310> not<00:01:50.490> doing<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.060> new

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
ones they were still not doing it so new

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:01.039 
ones they were still not doing it so new
points<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:55.260> new<00:01:55.590> spark<00:01:56.430> plug<00:01:56.610> -<00:01:57.030> hmm<00:02:00.049> that's

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
points and a new spark plug - hmm that's

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.710 
points and a new spark plug - hmm that's
what<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.380> took<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.590> get<00:02:01.740> spark<00:02:02.310> man<00:02:02.720> that's

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
what it took to get spark man that's

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.969 
what it took to get spark man that's
crazy<00:02:05.210> we<00:02:06.210> did<00:02:06.479> well<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.049> did<00:02:07.290> do<00:02:07.470> new<00:02:07.740> motor

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
crazy we did well and I did do new motor

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.060 
crazy we did well and I did do new motor
mounts<00:02:08.429> on<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.790> yeah<00:02:09.360> although<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.290> one<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.830> I

nice<00:02:19.550> take<00:02:19.819> that<00:02:20.030> now<00:02:20.599> treat<00:02:20.900> cells<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.410> tool

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
nice take that now treat cells the tool

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.320 
nice take that now treat cells the tool
for<00:02:21.950> installing<00:02:22.340> these<00:02:22.610> we<00:02:22.760> just<00:02:22.940> do<00:02:23.090> kind<00:02:23.239> of

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
for installing these we just do kind of

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.820 
for installing these we just do kind of
use<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.569> hammer<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:23.989> did<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.200> redneck<00:02:24.380> style

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
use the hammer and did it redneck style

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.250 
use the hammer and did it redneck style
but<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.520> can<00:02:25.910> also<00:02:26.030> make<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:26.450> tool<00:02:26.780> for

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
but you can also make a tool for

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.170 
but you can also make a tool for
installing<00:02:27.590> those<00:02:27.800> motor<00:02:28.069> mounts<00:02:28.520> the

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
installing those motor mounts the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.690 
installing those motor mounts the
originals<00:02:29.599> are<00:02:29.690> completely<00:02:30.110> gone<00:02:30.430> let's<00:02:31.430> see

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
originals are completely gone let's see

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.570 
originals are completely gone let's see
what<00:02:31.940> else<00:02:32.180> oh<00:02:32.709> we<00:02:33.709> got<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:33.890> new<00:02:34.010> exhaust<00:02:34.280> pipe

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
what else oh we got a new exhaust pipe

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.290 
what else oh we got a new exhaust pipe
yep<00:02:35.300> this<00:02:35.959> quality<00:02:36.470> thing<00:02:39.190> this<00:02:40.190> was<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.400> 1977

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
yep this quality thing this was a 1977

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.390 
yep this quality thing this was a 1977
mopeds<00:02:41.900> order<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.290> guess<00:02:42.560> this<00:02:42.770> one<00:02:42.950> can't<00:02:43.250> this

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
mopeds order I guess this one can't this

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.900

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
cut the pipe and then use that to join

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:10.360

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
well that's genius and our cylinder had

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.229 
well that's genius and our cylinder had
0<00:03:12.799> threads<00:03:13.190> left<00:03:13.489> in<00:03:13.670> it<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:13.940> even<00:03:14.030> the

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
0 threads left in it and even the

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.820 
0 threads left in it and even the
oversized<00:03:14.630> nut<00:03:14.900> wouldn't<00:03:15.230> work<00:03:15.350> so<00:03:15.380> we<00:03:15.680> have
