00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.549
 new video and well this time in 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.400
 against what is an excellent rom 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.269
 based on how 7 is called to all 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.940
 mutation speed pro investment 2 good 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.220
 to begin with is this rom is one of the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.039
 continuations of at full speed 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.849
 that left already for the month of July August 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:30.869
 last year I think the user 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:32.610
 is and 3 is revealed in guasimal in good order 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.070
 this is not called as I've told you all 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.070
 the age mutation but two in a 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.440
 mutation x is a base of cyanogenmod 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.610
 with essential stop files for 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.490
 improve what the battery life 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.680
 the much faster load the photograph 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.080
 it is more quickly files from the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.210
 card of the stock that are optimized 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.730
 kevin updated 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.370
 updated we should write for the ram 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.780
 that is new new new fix is ​​and 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.020
 new things 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.090
 they add an excellent quality to what 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.659
 is the system and the rom regarding the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.040
 working good as far as we go 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.140
 first looking at that internal memory 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.530
 it comes without partitioning but it can be 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.159
 position bring the kernel to translate 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.780
 we can completely see clearly that 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.000
 now partition without any problem 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.040
 among the changes also other changes 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.630
 they have many changes quite is what 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.009
 which is the without the new sounds of 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.619
 modifications the system interface 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.450
 faster it will be a pencil bus I go to 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.420
 have days with her work all the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.539
 100% adrenaline engine for the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.950
 performance the games are going very well 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.659
 the library sel build point pro that is 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.000
 some adjustments that the system has 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.460
 wifi also one more reach on the gps 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.380
 it works without problems 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.430
 the calls without the before they had 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.170
 some problems 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:59.050
 and they have put a mod that when 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.470
 10% of the battery is stuck to the phone 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:06.690
 to save so stays stays more stay 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.399
 stamped good let's analyze it now 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.330
 then as I told you, it works 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.820
 perfectly 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.220
 we finish Navarre notifications we see 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.820
 that has living navarra and the bar 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.570
 essential of we choose 7.2 we go to the 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.070
 adjustments that is the system bring the 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.300
 phone to see here based on two 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.350
 points 2.7 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:34.130
 in the sea ​​at full speed version 5.7 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.260
 that mutation by a 22 is the same in 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.110
 As for very elegant internal memory 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.730
 because it leaves you 135 meters free with 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.530
 which I have many applications 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.550
 right now and they work for me 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.860
 and no, they do not have any problems 135 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.800
 megas as you can check and as soon as 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.470
 to the battery well this round the change 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.410
 for no battery and this one I'm going to 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.210
 show let's use the system 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.900
 let's show off the battery can 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.400
 check here 21 hours 4 minutes and 29 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.230
 seconds and a half in the battery that I 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.860
 is still and the wifi uses 18 hours in 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.970
 3g also the rest use it the truth 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.680
 playing the fifa also the time 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.750
 good battery performance 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.570
 then I recommend them for those who 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.820
 they ask us to have battery performance 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.970
 is in the system perfectly 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.590
 here we go from masters of applications without 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.110
 no problem installed enough 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.340
 applications more than 16 because they are 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.020
 those who tell me that they do not need 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.360
 enough applications and then it 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.730
 September of the telephone but not because it was 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.970
 perfectly have gloves the 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.880
 applications that have 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:50.430
 and now to remind me of so many that 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.430
 install finally let's see the camera 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.299
 works without problems are actions of 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.640
 7.2 and good in terms of performance that 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.610
 excellent development those looking for a 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.060
 rom for games and let's win 7 here 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.060
 it shows them 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.150
 very elegant fluency also does not 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.640
 compare to the fluidity it has with nothing 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.290
 of s &amp; p manager also updates 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.950
 our headphones devices 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:21.370
 speaker in end calculator in club humor 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:25.530
 the mail also brings it to the gallery 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.530
 3d here we see the loading of the images 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.560
 and a pretty fast Sunday load 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.510
 I have many albums but not enough 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.220
 very well 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.280
 to the flashlight also working without 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.280
 problems 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.840
 here show me what is for the notes 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.840
 adding notes the browser 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.690
 At a glance you can see running without any 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.540
 problem out on keyboard too that 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.400
 brings by default against the keyboard that 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.910
 is this the android integrated samsung 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.470
 which is the one of the touches then for the 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.449
 they like they do not have to offer anything 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:11.390
 but here is the keyboard and 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:15.990
 directly in settings 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:19.980
 here you can see in settings adjusting it 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:24.380
 the android keyboard 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.380
 daily skin style sandwich 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.500
 contacts can not see calls 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.000
 with the android icon 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.900
 the messages also have another 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.900
 different interface 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.360
 towards the bottom it's just pretty 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.660
 elegant very customizable in the choir 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.730
 launcher and good 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.950
 is what he thinks he is he wanted to comment 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:51.380
 in the round so they are based on 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.120
 7 but have eyes 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.520
 you have already here for example 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.410
 how is it then when we give it a 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.780
 time to the home button that the button appears 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.340
 of recent we can add what is 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.290
 an application then for example that 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.100
 the task manager opens 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:09.070
 then the settings of healthy in mode 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:13.960
 and input to long-press settings 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:15.870
 of start and here here we are going to give here and 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.550
 use a custom application 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.050
 it would be like this we give here here 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.390
 select an application under study 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.780
 selected in mind tasks that 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.760
 comes that is the manager here this is already 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.980
 active and when we want we press and 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.540
 It opens us directly in androids 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.940
 this has been all for this video les 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.950
 I say so for this elegant rom with 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.620
 his modifications are very good in 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:41.980

 excellent stuff as you have seen that 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.710
 it has a very good and good performance 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:50.430
