00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.130
 how about friends the recipe that I bring 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.750
 for today it is pasta and the legs of 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.550
 selected 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.680
 these tiny little shells the most 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.370
 little ones that are left 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.980
 I have these two cups of conchitas 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.740
 small pasta here I have a 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.130
 whole white onion quite 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.620
 big piece of wood here I have four 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.950
 garlic cloves very big hits 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.950
 also cut up and over there I have 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.450
 half stick of butter in the pan 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.060
 waiting to sautÃ© 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.880
 I have this cup of milk and pepper I put 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.010
 the pasta in the hot water to the fire in 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.890
 three and a half cups which is what 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.860
 cook the pasta 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.360
 what melted the butter and I'm going to 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.360
 incorporate the garlic onion 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.040
 so he goes suffering 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.880
 in a non-precipitate process 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.830
 to 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.830
 we will perform 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.830
 Pepper 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.470
 and the pasta is already in that state where 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.260
 it begins to soften that it is called 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.450
 and I'm going to lower it now I 'm going to 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.450
 put milk to this suffer 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.440
 and I'm going to stir 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.610
 Y 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.980
 I will raise the fire and let's go what 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.230
 noting because the purpose is that 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.490
 evaporate a little and concentrate is already the 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.010
 second that establishes with sofrito 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.060
 and then 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.060
 I'm going to pour it 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.519
 and now 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.270
 of the container 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.210
 I'll leave it here 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.210
 I'm going to cover it 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.720
 and I will reduce considerably the 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.700
 fire I will leave them and medium and well 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:43.290
 Gentlemen just five minutes 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:47.319
 and it's already here I have chrome from 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.540
 sour milk without lumps of sour milk 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:53.049
 then we will lose a little bit 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.450
 let's go the last sour milk that 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:58.650
 accentuates 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.650
 the very flavor 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.740
 of the planes 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.740
 we go 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.939
 splash those in green with 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:16.299
 some grannies of parsley we are going to 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.299
 decorate 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.200
 and here we have the plate ready 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.940
 simple easy simple 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.720
 barely ingredients 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.150
