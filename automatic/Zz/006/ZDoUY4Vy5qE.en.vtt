00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
can put a pan fits inside of here and

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.880 
can put a pan fits inside of here and
this<00:00:27.390> ring<00:00:27.689> right<00:00:27.960> here<00:00:28.170> keeps<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.710> from

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
this ring right here keeps it from

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.330

chicken or whatever it'll sit right
there<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:36.420> won't<00:00:36.600> slide<00:00:36.960> out<00:00:38.329> and<00:00:39.379> I've

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
there and it won't slide out and I've

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.299 
there and it won't slide out and I've
got<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.739> stack<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.520> here<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.210> what<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.140> did<00:00:43.530> was<00:00:43.890> I

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
got a stack on here and what I did was I

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.209 
got a stack on here and what I did was I
dropped<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.300> just<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.719> little<00:00:46.020> below<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
dropped it just a little below on the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.290 
dropped it just a little below on the
inside

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
inside

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.220 
inside
that'll<00:00:49.260> help<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:50.250> tuning<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.449> particular

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
that'll help in tuning this particular

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.330 
that'll help in tuning this particular
grill<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:53.969> even<00:00:54.480> heat<00:00:55.219> you<00:00:56.219> can

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
grill so that you have even heat you can

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.529 
grill so that you have even heat you can
also<00:00:56.550> add<00:00:57.000> an<00:00:57.180> extension<00:00:58.460> I'm<00:00:59.460> gonna<00:00:59.699> put<00:01:00.059> a

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
also add an extension I'm gonna put a

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.860 
also add an extension I'm gonna put a
draft<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.579> another<00:01:02.579> draft<00:01:02.940> put<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> dampener<00:01:03.629> on

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
draft on another draft put a dampener on

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.620 
draft on another draft put a dampener on
the<00:01:04.110> top<00:01:04.700> I'll<00:01:05.700> probably<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.360> tomorrow

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
the top I'll probably do that tomorrow

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.130 
the inside I built a little basket and I
put<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.759> built<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.299> little<00:01:48.450> rack<00:01:48.780> for<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140

basket to sit on so to add charcoal is
real<00:01:55.140> really<00:01:55.649> simple<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:57.210> kind<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.630> angled

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
real really simple and I kind of angled

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.709 
real really simple and I kind of angled
the<00:01:58.259> basket<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.250> can't<00:01:59.880> really<00:02:00.119> see<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.509> but<00:02:00.659> I

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
the basket you can't really see it but I

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.490 
the basket you can't really see it but I
I<00:02:01.049> saw<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.500> put<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> Halfmoon<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.790> there<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.899> when

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
I saw to put a Halfmoon in there so when

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.859 
I saw to put a Halfmoon in there so when
you're<00:02:04.649> feeding<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.280> charcoal<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.630> take

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
you're feeding in charcoal and you take

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.229 
you're feeding in charcoal and you take
your<00:02:06.899> shovel<00:02:07.320> it's<00:02:08.039> easier<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.670> put<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.030> there

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
your shovel it's easier to put in there

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.300 
your shovel it's easier to put in there
cuz<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.629> shovel<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.140> fit<00:02:10.349> right<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:10.649> there<00:02:11.099> and

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
cuz you shovel to fit right in there and

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.680 
cuz you shovel to fit right in there and
you<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:11.940> dump<00:02:12.150> your<00:02:12.330> charcoal

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.410 

and<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:20.430> see<00:02:21.230> here<00:02:22.230> I've<00:02:22.830> put<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.640> rack<00:02:24.000> under

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
around real easy and that bottom rack

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.980 
around real easy and that bottom rack
there<00:02:33.450> can<00:02:34.050> be<00:02:34.080> used<00:02:34.590> for<00:02:35.010> for<00:02:35.430> storage<00:02:37.910> to

about<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:55.190> 60<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.550> 75<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.750> just<00:02:58.260> did<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.500> test<00:02:58.890> to

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
about to 60 to 75 I just did a test to

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.170 
about to 60 to 75 I just did a test to
see<00:03:00.410> just<00:03:01.410> what<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.830> would<00:03:02.070> what<00:03:02.850> it<00:03:03.000> would

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
see just what it would what it would

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.240 
see just what it would what it would
take<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.490> I<00:03:05.490> I<00:03:06.360> did<00:03:07.170> go<00:03:07.380> up<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.620> 300<00:03:08.220> degrees

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
take and I I did go up to 300 degrees

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.750 
take and I I did go up to 300 degrees
and<00:03:08.940> held<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.300> there<00:03:09.330> for<00:03:09.930> quite<00:03:10.290> some<00:03:10.650> time<00:03:10.760> so

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
and held it there for quite some time so

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.840 
and held it there for quite some time so
it<00:03:11.910> burns<00:03:12.300> really<00:03:12.960> good<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:17.580> two

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
it burns really good and the two

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.140 
it burns really good and the two
thermometers<00:03:18.750> are<00:03:19.850> barely<00:03:22.370> 1/8<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.580> I've

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
thermometers are barely 1/8 and I've

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.460 
thermometers are barely 1/8 and I've
opened<00:03:24.420> up<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:25.260> grill<00:03:25.560> up<00:03:25.890> it's<00:03:26.490> usually

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.370 
your best of my mother's butt or gauges
but<00:03:35.490> they'll<00:03:35.730> give<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.240> a<00:03:36.480> fairly<00:03:37.140> decent

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
but they'll give you a fairly decent

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.040

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
reading and I'm right now I'm probably

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.750 
reading and I'm right now I'm probably
less<00:03:43.500> than<00:03:43.950> 5<00:03:44.280> degrees<00:03:44.580> on<00:03:45.330> both<00:03:45.470> ends<00:03:46.470> of<00:03:46.760> the
