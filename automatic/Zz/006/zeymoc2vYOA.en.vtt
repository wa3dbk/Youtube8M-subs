00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:10.040
 good morning my dear travelers last 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.559
 day here in with secret last huasteca 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.139
 day also in the Huasteca potosina the 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.060
 day is that it is impressive here it is not 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.880
 noise you wake up with the singing the 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.150
 little birds pure tranquility and then 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.519
 you go out and there 's that river with that water 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.800
 spectacular the weather a warm 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.179
 tasty but good to take advantage of my 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.150
 last day I'm going to do a couple of 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:35.000
 activities not very long but loaded 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.360
 with a touch of adrenaline and are 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.360
 these 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.520
 I'm heading to rappel for the first time 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.520
 in my life 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.739
 to reach the descent point 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.610
 we cross the river and do some jumps 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.610
 of waterfall low 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.300
 after a few minutes we reached the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.850
 edge of the waterfall in Mexico to almost 40 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.110
 meters high was up there is 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.110
 really exciting 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.990
 I fell for the expert in the activities we 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.610
 give the last instructions before 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.610
 make the descent next to the waterfall 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.110
 let's look with the sole 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.110
 stone not by the board paper of good 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.119
 when in contact with nature 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.159
 I understand the fragile planet in which 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.039
 we live and from which we forget 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.840
 inhabit concrete jungles relax and 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.819
 invite reflection and rest of 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.080
 our busy lives that sometimes 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.080
 they seem to take us to 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.780
 Y 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.640
 there will not be 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.230
 yes 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.550
 ah 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.349
 to 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.280
 to 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.520
 no no no no 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.160
 what tranquility what peace what place so 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.069
 beautiful the truth these days with huasteca 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.560
 The hotel has been incredible 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.360
 The service is the best 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.400
 I really liked it, I recommend you 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.840
 much that if you visit the Huasteca what 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.330
 do with them because in addition to 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.310
 activities have places to 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.920
 to stay that has no comparison in 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.650
 the area like there are places that are not so 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.200
 known from each country and the Huasteca 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.480
 potosin is one of them is not the site 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.600
 most famous in Mexico but it's one of those 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.760
 that is really worth visiting and that 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.890
 secret touch makes it even more 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.709
 attractive because it is not so exploited or 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.030
 developed like other areas of the country 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.209
 really visit the Huasteca potosina 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.160
 has a lot very much to offer to 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.130
 I still lacked many things that 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.989
 visit the basement of the swallows 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.380
 there are still more waterfalls plus rivers 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:23.350
 adventures and it's the perfect pretext for 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.900
 back fascinated me and I just discovered 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.780
 one of the corners of my country that is 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.180
 they are becoming my favorites 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.370
