00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
bit more damage so this is going to be

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.320 
bit more damage so this is going to be
really<00:00:11.400> hard<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.700> demonstrate<00:00:12.120> because<00:00:12.269> I'm

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
really hard to demonstrate because I'm

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.820 
really hard to demonstrate because I'm
gonna<00:00:12.480> have<00:00:12.570> so<00:00:12.719> few<00:00:13.110> shots<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.469> actually<00:00:13.710> work

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
gonna have so few shots to actually work

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.250 
gonna have so few shots to actually work
with<00:00:14.040> we'll<00:00:14.849> see<00:00:15.059> how<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.269> goes<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.139> my

about<00:00:30.300> mods<00:00:30.650> weapon<00:00:31.650> definitely<00:00:32.369> benefits

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
about mods weapon definitely benefits

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.910 
about mods weapon definitely benefits
from<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.450> high-caliber<00:00:33.930> barrel<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.320> does<00:00:34.770> do

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
from a high-caliber barrel it does do

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.350 
from a high-caliber barrel it does do
great<00:00:35.100> damage<00:00:35.219> but<00:00:35.550> more<00:00:35.790> damage<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.120> always<00:00:36.329> a

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
great damage but more damage is always a

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.270 
great damage but more damage is always a
good<00:00:36.480> thing<00:00:36.540> doesn't<00:00:37.350> quite<00:00:37.500> do<00:00:37.649> sniper<00:00:37.950> rifle

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
good thing doesn't quite do sniper rifle

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.310 
good thing doesn't quite do sniper rifle
level<00:00:38.460> damage<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.629> also<00:00:39.780> benefits<00:00:39.989> from<00:00:40.200> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
level damage so it also benefits from a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.920 
level damage so it also benefits from a
scope<00:00:40.530> just<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.129> ability<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.879> aim<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.840> know

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
scope just the ability to aim you know

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.240 
scope just the ability to aim you know
with<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.110> scope<00:00:43.350> at<00:00:43.500> longer<00:00:43.739> ranges<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.100> quite

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
with the scope at longer ranges is quite

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.470 
with the scope at longer ranges is quite
helpful<00:00:44.460> beyond<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> accuracy<00:00:45.360> bonus

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
helpful beyond just the accuracy bonus

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.869 
helpful beyond just the accuracy bonus
it<00:00:45.899> also<00:00:46.559> has<00:00:46.890> very<00:00:47.100> few<00:00:47.370> rounds<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.760> this

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
it also has very few rounds in this

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.090 
it also has very few rounds in this
magazine<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.870> magazine<00:00:49.170> upgrade<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.680> be

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
magazine so the magazine upgrade can be

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.100 
magazine so the magazine upgrade can be
very<00:00:50.280> useful<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.789> all<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.600> pistols<00:00:51.899> used

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
very useful of all the pistols used

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.510 
very useful of all the pistols used
appears<00:00:52.410> cover<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.770> might<00:00:52.920> be<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> better<00:00:53.250> one

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
appears cover this might be a better one

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.979 
appears cover this might be a better one
because<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.030> does<00:00:54.120> do<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.420> much<00:00:54.539> damage<00:00:54.570> per

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
because it does do so much damage per

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.510 
because it does do so much damage per
shot<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.379> allows<00:00:55.559> more<00:00:55.860> damage<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.309> actually

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
shot it allows more damage to actually

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.299 
shot it allows more damage to actually
go<00:00:56.640> through<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.940> cover<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:58.010> then<00:00:59.010> use<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
go through the cover and then use a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.740 
go through the cover and then use a
melee<00:00:59.520> center<00:00:59.789> if<00:00:59.850> you're<00:00:59.940> into<00:01:00.090> melee<00:01:00.359> so

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
melee center if you're into melee so

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.119 
melee center if you're into melee so
really<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.230> have<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.410> lot<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.590> options<00:01:01.980> here

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
really you have a lot of options here

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.490 
really you have a lot of options here
this<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.760> pretty<00:01:03.359> good<00:01:03.840> candidate<00:01:04.290> for<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
this is a pretty good candidate for a

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.140 
this is a pretty good candidate for a
lot<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> mods<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.159> game<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:05.909> i<00:01:05.939> would

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
lot of the mods in the game but i would

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
lot of the mods in the game but i would
think<00:01:06.270> bread<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.659> butter<00:01:06.780> for<00:01:06.840> most<00:01:07.080> players

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
think bread and butter for most players

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.929 
think bread and butter for most players
would<00:01:07.439> be<00:01:07.560> high<00:01:07.950> caliber<00:01:08.310> barrel<00:01:08.580> plus<00:01:08.909> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
would be high caliber barrel plus a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.940 
would be high caliber barrel plus a
scope<00:01:09.240> or<00:01:09.450> high<00:01:09.570> caliber<00:01:09.900> barrel<00:01:10.170> plus<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
scope or high caliber barrel plus a

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.000 
scope or high caliber barrel plus a
