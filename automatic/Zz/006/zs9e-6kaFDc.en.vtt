00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
improvement points to upgrade that

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.320 
improvement points to upgrade that
ability<00:01:08.430> you'll<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:08.820> able<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.000> call<00:01:09.210> an

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
ability you'll be able to call an

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.940

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
bombs during the ton more damage you can

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.480 
bombs during the ton more damage you can
also<00:01:12.960> reduce<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.590> cost<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.100> ability

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
also reduce the cost of that ability

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.100 
also reduce the cost of that ability
from<00:01:14.640> ammunition<00:01:15.210> standpoint<00:01:15.690> and<00:01:15.870> also

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
from ammunition standpoint and also

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.290 
from ammunition standpoint and also
reduce<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.770> time<00:01:16.980> that<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.250> charge<00:01:18.150> a

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
reduce the time that it charge a

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.970 
reduce the time that it charge a
recharge<00:01:18.630> time<00:01:18.690> so<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.410> can<00:01:19.470> use<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.710> more

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
recharge time so you can use it more

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.410 
recharge time so you can use it more
often<00:01:20.130> during<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.640> course<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.910> the<00:01:21.000> battle<00:01:21.120> so

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
often during the course of the battle so

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.880 
often during the course of the battle so
by<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.050> time<00:01:22.230> it's<00:01:22.380> leveled<00:01:22.680> up<00:01:22.710> it's

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
by the time it's leveled up it's

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.080 
by the time it's leveled up it's
actually<00:01:23.160> a<00:01:23.190> really<00:01:23.400> devastating<00:01:23.640> ability

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
actually a really devastating ability

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.000 
actually a really devastating ability
