ok so let's take a look at actually how

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.039 
ok so let's take a look at actually how
quick<00:02:51.159> the<00:02:51.489> 3g<00:02:52.090> data<00:02:52.299> connection<00:02:52.720> is<00:02:52.840> i'm

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
quick the 3g data connection is i'm

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.610 
quick the 3g data connection is i'm
going<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.290> start<00:02:53.500> by<00:02:53.739> connecting<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:56.500> the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
going to start by connecting to the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.319 
going to start by connecting to the
network<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:57.370> we<00:02:57.489> just<00:02:57.670> hit<00:02:57.790> them<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.000> connect

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
network and we just hit them and connect

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.960 
network and we just hit them and connect
that<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.660> see<00:02:58.840> how<00:02:58.870> long<00:02:59.019> it<00:02:59.290> takes<00:02:59.319> to

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
that and see how long it takes to

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.990 
that and see how long it takes to
connect<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.150> network<00:03:01.329> it's<00:03:01.900> fairly<00:03:02.140> quick

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.250 

this<00:03:07.000> was<00:03:07.150> about<00:03:07.299> 15<00:03:07.660> seconds<00:03:08.079> actually

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
this was about 15 seconds actually

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.410 
this was about 15 seconds actually
connect<00:03:08.680> there<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:09.129> should<00:03:09.849> be<00:03:09.879> now<00:03:10.090> ready<00:03:10.329> to

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
connect there I should be now ready to

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.530 
connect there I should be now ready to
use<00:03:11.190> so<00:03:12.190> if<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.340> just<00:03:12.370> try<00:03:12.819> and<00:03:12.940> load<00:03:13.060> up<00:03:13.209> google

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:15.949 
certain extent it kind of skips and

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:17.860 
certain extent it kind of skips and
jumps<00:06:16.010> every<00:06:16.400> now<00:06:16.610> and<00:06:16.760> again<00:06:16.790> but<00:06:17.150> it<00:06:17.750> is

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
jumps every now and again but it is

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:24.520 
jumps every now and again but it is

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.620 
see there I see in the video there that
you<00:06:26.180> kind<00:06:26.360> of<00:06:26.450> pauses<00:06:27.200> for<00:06:27.590> a<00:06:27.650> second<00:06:28.100> or<00:06:28.190> two

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630
