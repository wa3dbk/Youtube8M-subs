actually compared to you know ones like

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.720 
actually compared to you know ones like
the<00:00:54.940> ak-47<00:00:55.510> or<00:00:56.019> the<00:00:56.140> ACR<00:00:56.649> and<00:00:56.829> I'll<00:00:57.460> give<00:00:57.609> you<00:00:57.699> a

the ak-47 or the ACR and I'll give you a

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.959 
the ak-47 or the ACR and I'll give you a
look<00:00:57.969> down<00:00:58.390> at<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.750> iron<00:00:58.929> sights<00:00:59.350> or<00:01:00.280> Lego

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
look down at the iron sights or Lego

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:02.250 
look down at the iron sights or Lego
sights<00:01:01.329> because<00:01:01.600> they're<00:01:01.750> not<00:01:01.870> made<00:01:02.019> of<00:01:02.050> iron

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
sights because they're not made of iron

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.630 
sights because they're not made of iron
but<00:01:02.499> uh<00:01:04.800> there<00:01:05.800> we<00:01:05.920> go<00:01:06.040> it's<00:01:06.160> got<00:01:06.310> some<00:01:06.460> really

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
but uh there we go it's got some really

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.550 
but uh there we go it's got some really
unique<00:01:06.880> iron<00:01:07.270> sights<00:01:07.660> and<00:01:07.990> they're<00:01:08.380> pretty

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
unique iron sights and they're pretty

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.340 
unique iron sights and they're pretty
tough<00:01:08.799> to<00:01:09.460> look<00:01:09.670> out<00:01:09.880> of<00:01:09.909> in<00:01:10.630> modern<00:01:10.840> warfare<00:01:11.170> 3

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
tough to look out of in modern warfare 3

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.880 
tough to look out of in modern warfare 3
so<00:01:11.920> let's<00:01:12.520> go<00:01:12.670> ahead<00:01:12.759> and<00:01:12.880> throw<00:01:13.299> on<00:01:13.450> a<00:01:13.479> Lego

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
so let's go ahead and throw on a Lego

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.609 
so let's go ahead and throw on a Lego
holographic<00:01:14.890> sight<00:01:15.990> here<00:01:16.990> we<00:01:17.079> go<00:01:17.229> that's<00:01:17.470> a

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
holographic sight here we go that's a

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.980 
holographic sight here we go that's a
little<00:01:17.799> easier<00:01:18.220> to<00:01:18.400> see<00:01:18.430> out<00:01:18.790> of<00:01:18.820> and<00:01:19.150> in

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
little easier to see out of and in

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.560 
little easier to see out of and in
modern<00:01:20.229> warfare<00:01:20.530> 3<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:21.579> fat<00:01:21.820> if<00:01:22.060> you<00:01:22.180> put<00:01:22.390> like

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
modern warfare 3 the fat if you put like

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.330 
modern warfare 3 the fat if you put like
a<00:01:22.630> suppressor<00:01:23.350> on<00:01:23.409> it<00:01:23.470> or<00:01:23.710> something<00:01:23.950> it<00:01:24.220> can

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
a suppressor on it or something it can

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.340 
a suppressor on it or something it can
be<00:01:24.430> a<00:01:24.460> really<00:01:24.640> fun<00:01:24.729> gun<00:01:25.119> to<00:01:25.689> just<00:01:25.899> go<00:01:26.020> sneak

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
be a really fun gun to just go sneak

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.020 
be a really fun gun to just go sneak
around<00:01:26.500> with<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:27.100> it's<00:01:27.460> got<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.610> really<00:01:27.759> fast

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
around with and it's got a really fast

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.050 
around with and it's got a really fast
rate<00:01:28.270> of<00:01:28.299> fire<00:01:28.420> as<00:01:28.750> well<00:01:28.930> so<00:01:29.259> very<00:01:29.729> handy<00:01:30.729> for

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
rate of fire as well so very handy for

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.090 
rate of fire as well so very handy for
um<00:01:31.240> you<00:01:31.450> know<00:01:31.780> spraying<00:01:32.290> a<00:01:32.470> lot<00:01:32.710> of<00:01:32.829> bullets

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
um you know spraying a lot of bullets

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.020 
um you know spraying a lot of bullets
very<00:01:33.490> fast<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:35.290> replica<00:01:35.799> took<00:01:36.040> around<00:01:36.219> 1200

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
very fast this replica took around 1200

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.300 
very fast this replica took around 1200
LEGO<00:01:37.210> bricks<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.780> make<00:01:37.960> so<00:01:38.649> I<00:01:38.680> definitely

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
LEGO bricks to make so I definitely

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.999 
LEGO bricks to make so I definitely
quite<00:01:39.850> a<00:01:39.880> few<00:01:40.060> Lego<00:01:40.270> bricks<00:01:40.570> and<00:01:41.009> carefully

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
quite a few Lego bricks and carefully

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.819 
quite a few Lego bricks and carefully
built<00:01:42.759> some<00:01:43.270> little<00:01:43.570> grips<00:01:43.869> and<00:01:44.200> whatnot<00:01:44.590> that

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829
