another<00:04:51.100> thing<00:04:51.430> is<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.700> power<00:04:51.910> of<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.240> heat

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
another thing is the power of the heat

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.030 
another thing is the power of the heat
so<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:52.990> absolute<00:04:53.290> opposite<00:04:53.650> end<00:04:53.800> of<00:04:53.920> the

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
so the absolute opposite end of the

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.100 
so the absolute opposite end of the
extremes<00:04:54.460> when<00:04:55.090> you<00:04:55.210> turn<00:04:55.390> the<00:04:55.510> heat<00:04:55.630> right<00:04:55.810> up

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
extremes when you turn the heat right up

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.870 
extremes when you turn the heat right up
to<00:04:56.260> fall<00:04:56.470> you<00:04:56.680> get<00:04:56.830> incredible<00:04:57.400> power

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
to fall you get incredible power

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.910 
to fall you get incredible power
immediately<00:04:58.740> particularly<00:04:59.740> on<00:04:59.830> the

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
immediately particularly on the

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.160 
immediately particularly on the
induction<00:05:00.190> if<00:05:00.700> I<00:05:00.790> want<00:05:01.000> to<00:05:01.120> boil<00:05:01.750> a<00:05:01.840> pan<00:05:02.020> of

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
boiling boiling water for pasta it will

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.960 
boiling boiling water for pasta it will
come<00:05:05.080> up<00:05:05.230> to<00:05:05.410> boiling<00:05:05.760> temperature<00:05:06.760> in

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
come up to boiling temperature in

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.180 
come up to boiling temperature in
literally<00:05:07.750> a<00:05:07.990> minute<00:05:08.200> or<00:05:08.440> two<00:05:08.590> on<00:05:08.860> the

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
literally a minute or two on the

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.490 
literally a minute or two on the
electric<00:05:09.610> full<00:05:09.850> full<00:05:10.270> full<00:05:10.420> power<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:11.080> it's

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
electric full full full power and it's

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.780 
electric full full full power and it's
boiling<00:05:11.920> before<00:05:12.010> you<00:05:12.250> can<00:05:12.370> kind<00:05:12.580> of<00:05:12.610> even

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
boiling before you can kind of even

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.360 
boiling before you can kind of even
blink<00:05:13.300> it's<00:05:13.720> absolute<00:05:14.080> lendable<00:05:14.440> and<00:05:14.950> then

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
blink it's absolute lendable and then

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.500 
blink it's absolute lendable and then
the<00:05:15.490> other<00:05:15.640> thing<00:05:15.910> I've<00:05:16.030> got<00:05:16.210> which<00:05:16.360> is
