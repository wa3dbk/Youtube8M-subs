this idea that the height to whips
proportions<00:00:27.540> are<00:00:28.520> putting<00:00:29.520> it<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.790> simple

Euclid's actual mathematical equation is
much<00:00:36.089> more<00:00:36.239> complicated<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.780> but<00:00:36.929> it

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
much more complicated that but it

much more complicated that but it
doesn't<00:00:37.350> matter

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
doesn't matter

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
fundamentally it's this - this is what

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.020 
fundamentally it's this - this is what
we're<00:00:40.649> talking<00:00:40.800> about<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.519> proportion

we're talking about this this proportion

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.220 
we're talking about this this proportion
of<00:00:42.120> six<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.449> three-eighths<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.050> ten<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:45.230> this

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
pleasing space better than a square or

any<00:00:52.170> other<00:00:52.260> shape<00:00:52.409> you<00:00:52.710> might<00:00:52.859> come<00:00:53.039> up<00:00:53.159> with

also<00:00:54.679> within<00:00:55.679> that<00:00:55.920> space<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.699> what<00:00:57.179> is<00:00:57.329> called

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
also within that space is what is called

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:00.139 
also within that space is what is called
the<00:00:57.809> golden<00:00:58.199> section<00:00:58.469> now<00:00:58.949> if<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.339> take<00:00:59.579> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the golden section now if you take the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.950 
the golden section now if you take the
height<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.829> one<00:01:02.039> side<00:01:02.339> and<00:01:02.670> say<00:01:03.569> move<00:01:03.839> it

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
height of the one side and say move it

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.050 
height of the one side and say move it
across<00:01:04.050> in<00:01:04.409> an<00:01:04.500> arc<00:01:04.650> or<00:01:04.920> another<00:01:05.190> way<00:01:05.370> take

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
across in an arc or another way take

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.400 
across in an arc or another way take
that<00:01:06.240> measurement<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.690> put<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.930> across<00:01:07.020> here

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
that measurement to put it across here

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.640 
that measurement to put it across here
you<00:01:08.250> get<00:01:08.610> if<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.390> put<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> line<00:01:09.900> down<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.470> that

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
you get if you put a line down in that

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.960 
you get if you put a line down in that
direction<00:01:10.830> there<00:01:12.140> do<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.370> neatly<00:01:14.370> so<00:01:14.850> you

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
direction there do this neatly so you

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.420 
direction there do this neatly so you
can<00:01:15.090> see<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:16.200> get<00:01:16.440> fundamentally<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
can see it you get fundamentally a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.510 
can see it you get fundamentally a
square<00:01:17.850> if<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:19.140> then<00:01:19.320> take<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.830> space<00:01:20.190> here

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
square if you then take this space here

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.830 
square if you then take this space here
bring<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.180> down<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.540> here<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.470> get

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
bring it down to here you get

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.670 
bring it down to here you get
fundamentally<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.990> square<00:01:25.500> there<00:01:26.510> okay<00:01:27.510> now<00:01:27.720> in

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
fundamentally a square there okay now in

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.140 
fundamentally a square there okay now in
the<00:01:29.400> purist<00:01:30.860> idea<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.010> this<00:01:32.160> then<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:33.000> would

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
the purist idea of this then you would

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.290 
the purist idea of this then you would
use<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.660> as<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.140> focal<00:01:34.530> point<00:01:35.060> but<00:01:36.060> we've

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
use this as the focal point but we've

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.990 
use this as the focal point but we've
developed<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.500> idea<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.220> recent<00:01:38.670> times<00:01:38.880> that

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
developed the idea in recent times that

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.130 
developed the idea in recent times that
of<00:01:39.330> thirds<00:01:40.080> and<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.950> if<00:01:41.190> you<00:01:41.520> take<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.690> space

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
of thirds and so if you take this space

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.200 
of thirds and so if you take this space
and<00:01:43.410> split<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.010> half<00:01:44.040> you've<00:01:44.670> got<00:01:44.880> three

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
and split it in half you've got three

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.260 
and split it in half you've got three
spaces<00:01:45.660> which<00:01:46.320> should<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.130> equal<00:01:47.280> size

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
spaces which should be of equal size

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.990 
spaces which should be of equal size
they're<00:01:48.870> more<00:01:49.110> or<00:01:49.230> less<00:01:49.490> again<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.820> not

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
they're more or less again this is not

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.110 
they're more or less again this is not
an<00:01:51.180> exact<00:01:51.690> science<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.560> idea<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.120> within

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
an exact science the idea is that within

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.450 
an exact science the idea is that within
this<00:01:54.540> area<00:01:54.900> now<00:01:55.320> somewhere<00:01:55.890> around<00:01:56.040> there

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
this area now somewhere around there

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.300 
this area now somewhere around there
would<00:01:57.180> make<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.660> good<00:01:57.990> focal<00:01:58.620> point<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.160> put

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
would make a good focal point to put

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.830 
would make a good focal point to put
your<00:02:01.520> idea<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.850> then<00:02:03.090> here<00:02:03.390> would<00:02:03.600> make<00:02:03.810> a

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
your idea and then here would make a

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.870 
your idea and then here would make a
good<00:02:04.080> focal<00:02:04.440> point<00:02:04.620> on<00:02:04.800> that<00:02:05.070> cross<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:05.640> here

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
good focal point on that cross and here

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.089 
good focal point on that cross and here
and<00:02:06.150> here<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:07.050> you've<00:02:07.170> got<00:02:07.260> four<00:02:07.500> chances<00:02:08.039> to

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
and here so you've got four chances to

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.309

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
two-thirds of land and one-third of sky

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.310 
two-thirds of land and one-third of sky
and<00:02:45.240> very<00:02:46.240> often<00:02:46.390> photographers<00:02:46.960> talk<00:02:47.110> about

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
and very often photographers talk about

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.080 
and very often photographers talk about
thirds<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.770> they'll<00:02:47.920> use<00:02:48.160> one-third<00:02:48.820> line

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
thirds and they'll use one-third line

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.440 
thirds and they'll use one-third line
two<00:02:49.360> thirds<00:02:49.630> sky<00:02:50.020> or<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:51.040> reverse<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:51.940> that's

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
two thirds sky or the reverse so that's

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
two thirds sky or the reverse so that's
a<00:02:52.630> simple<00:02:52.900> way<00:02:53.140> of<00:02:54.390> suggesting<00:02:55.390> that<00:02:55.990> how<00:02:56.410> you

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
a simple way of suggesting that how you

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.020 
a simple way of suggesting that how you
can<00:02:56.800> go<00:02:56.980> about<00:02:57.010> looking

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
can go about looking

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.900 
can go about looking
