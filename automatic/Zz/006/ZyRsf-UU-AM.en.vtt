00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 good my friends how are we going to 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.330
 see part number 6 of acute abdomen 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.519
 obstructive and already with this let's go 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.400
 ending with this clinical entity 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.679
 surgical 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.179
 I really want to give them their 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.400
 general what follows treatment of 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.829
 a constructive shadow the treatment 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.689
 definitive is surgical and is in hands 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:22.750
 of the surgeon but the concept is that a 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.759
 General doctor has to manage 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.650
 then we will see that the patient is 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.710
 is going to intern and they are going to do a series 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.780
 of general measures for 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.540
 recover your by and recover your 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.150
 general condition support stockings 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.460
 we are going to place a nasogastric tube 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.530
 to evacuate the stomach decrease 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.300
 distension and relieve the general condition 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.420
 The patient will also take a 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.760
 bladder catheter is going to hydrate and 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.040
 oxygenate the patient remember that 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.390
 he has hypoxemia that he attends 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.239
 dehydration so a third 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.170
 space and there is hypovolemia with 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.300
 dehydration 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.670
 there is almost an exhaustive monitoring of 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.559
 patient in terms of income 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.450
 Fluid income activity 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.100
 cardiac and mainly in the middle 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.280
 internally everything that has been 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.020
 distanced in this box and also it 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.149
 They will be given antibiotics 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.580
 antibiotics to fluid patients and be 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.890
 antibiotics and why to avoid that 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.390
 the intestinal bacterial flora is behind 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.770
 what happens the barrier in this way 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.289
 reaches the general circulation and produces 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.149
 a sepsis that antibiotics there 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.090
 different schemes a classical scheme 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.789
 It's a triple scheme with antibiotics 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.280
 broad spectrum ampicillin gentamicin and 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:38.479
 metronidazole the classic in force to meter 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.680
 and well then do the treatment 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.210
 definitive that is the surgical 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.220
 depending on the cause of origin 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.680
 we are not going to talk about surgical procedures 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.810
 but I do want to mark some 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.360
 concepts that the medical student 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.530
 advanced and the general practitioner have to 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.770
 know and especially two that are the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.990
 my interreaction and intellect colectomÃ­a 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.330
 mine is to resect a segment of the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.190
 small bowel before a box of 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.050
 obstruction a joy trapped between 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.300
 a wound that has sufferings 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.120
 vascular n crosa is unviable has to 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.330
 to be prescribed this calls intellect mine 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.530
 the colectomy is the same where what 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.010
 is going to be resected is going to be the colon 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.340
 ascending or the with descending remember 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.590
 that the blind the ascending colon and the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.690
 proximal third of the transverse colon what 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.209
 which is called with a right has a 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.980
 only unit of aggregation that's why 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.930
 you have to take out in block you can not 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.790
 take out the blind only a part of the 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.680
 ascending or the right angle there is no 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.540
 to take out in block , the 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.299
 right colectomy 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.859
 we receive slim we take it out with the 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.260
 right to a part of the colon 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.810
 descending the pelvic or ine then there's 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.019
 what to do the reconstruction that 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.000
 reconstruction can occur in a while 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.209
 what they call the tribes is primary or 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.370
 well in two times it means the 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.650
 next in the times as there is a 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.989
 inflammatory base picture I can not 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.540
 understand suture the two ends together 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.480
 because as there is so much inflammation 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:14.079
 strategies are very reliable are broken 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.389
 does not go is anastomosis will not fight 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.510
 it will heal then it goes to 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:21.849
 outside and in a second time when 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.359
 passes the inflammatory picture there if it 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:28.000
 spent wench then takes and first 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:31.419
 It can be made thin with thin or 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.489
 right colon right with thin and in the 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.049
 case of the left colon becomes colon 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.859
 with colon what is called an operation 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.300
 of dixon these three are in the same 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.300
 surgical time 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.510
 now what can be done also 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.850
 is in two times to do it deferred in 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.160
 the first time the ostomy is done is 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.690
 say it's going to the outside and in a 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.540
 second time reconstruction is done 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.900
 as I just explained it recently 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.540
 in the case of the right colon if not 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.569
 we remove the right colon becomes one and 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.000
 lyoto my and a transverse colostomy 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.739
 that is to say what eats the eyes 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.129
 intestinal leave the library this 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:15.099
 has and here the gas that produces the 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.259
 colon and I make secretions then 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.509
 when we dry it the right colon and 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:21.699
 we take some shots in two times the 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:24.449
 First time is going to be the illia 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:27.639
 ostomy and transverse colostomy 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:29.949
 when left falcon is dried 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.719
 a hartman operation is done and 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.300
 consists of the following elbow 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:37.240
 descending atomizes is directed to the 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.710
 outside and then there is the consell is it 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.499
 suture 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.360
 This is operation is usually hartman 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:45.189
 ask what it means is a vaccine is 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.439
 an anastomosis is a surgery in two 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:50.229
 times where in time there is a 

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:53.409
 left colectomy goes to the cape 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:55.629
 proximal and closes to the distal end 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:58.289
 and a second time is going to be the 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.289
 anastomosis 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.710
 with the transverse ones there are some 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.340
 pictures in which you can not 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.229
 submit the patient to an access sis of 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.990
 intestine by its general condition or at 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.699
 advanced of his pathology and to overcome 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.000
 the instruction becomes a colostomy 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:19.250
 transverse that is in handle is externalized 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.840
 the handle can be a glass rod 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.360
 so that salt does not re-enter 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.000
 reintroduce will go is a little one 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.479
 incision in the transverse colon and by 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.700
 here they are going to eliminate the fecal matter and 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:35.680
 gas is something palliative 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.050
 here we have a couple of images of a 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:42.580
 Look up the shots colostomy 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:46.250
 it is always preferred a place that is 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.500
 navel shelf the rib flange and 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.190
 the one that is and here has to be an area 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.229
 visible by the patient and away from 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:57.379
 insert bony areas and then there goes to 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:59.300
 place a collection bag 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:01.460
 this may be transient or it may be 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.099
 definitive depending on the pathology and 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.240
 general condition of the patient good I hope 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:06.440
 who have understood that there is a 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.960
 little closed what is abdominal 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.849
 constructive and nothing I say goodbye I leave 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.270
 a big hug and see you soon 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:13.270
 August then
