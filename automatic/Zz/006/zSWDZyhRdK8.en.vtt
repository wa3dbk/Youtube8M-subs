00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:11.219
 in tomorrow's reck there's a tutorial from 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:14.750
 me from everlast des lyc and that 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:22.850
 you need the following chords secondhand 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:31.460
 d minor or the major looks like that 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:31.460
 Forefinger comes to the crowd 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:39.629
 on the b side in the first bunch of the 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.460
 middle finger coming on the b side 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.550
 closer to the idea page apology 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.149
 the b-side in the second bunch and the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:53.430
 Ringfinger comes on the h page in 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:56.270
 third bunch at the beginning in the intro need 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.270
 we still have the little finger 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.590
 then you also need on the high e 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.899
 the intro is a bit heavy on the intro 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.360
 to play little finger a bit 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:13.710
 I have to tingle but I think so 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:17.869
 you get to play on the b side 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.869
 down side 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:30.229
 well, clearly fucks so so the logical 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.229
 down side 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.130
 So, if you played down, it plays 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.740
 First of all, I'm just talking about that now 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.560
 high side he played if you 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.710
 plays down 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.670
 there you have the little finger on it 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.670
 then you take the down 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.220
 put directly back on it 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.970
 and then go down and play 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.970
 the h page 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.660
 is a bit difficult at the beginning of the 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.690
 coordination 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.250
 but if only a few times has practiced it 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.709
 it is actually quite easy then 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.160
 the intro then played four times 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.160
 again and again 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.550
 then you stop belongs also to 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.700
 intro you then go to the normal f 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.710
 So not in the normal but handle 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.920
 in simplified this would be the one 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.530
 normal this is such a bad barrÃ© 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.350
 I did not really grab it myself 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.940
 always has it down especially in csu 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.280
 going 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.370
 the simple f handle is then first 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:56.010
 page first bund h side second reason 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:03:01.770
 de-side third and g string as I do so 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:04.349
 and then you go to normal quite 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:09.780
 normal c dur handle 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.780
 that is played 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:24.610
 again from the beginning and then if you can 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.610
 it was then played four times 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.480
 are always the same meet it is the 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.930
 the major or the all 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.980
 it is the simplified f handle and it 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:09.560
 is the access and the fcs yes all the way 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.760
 Simply just goes you go only with the 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:18.180
 with the middle finger and the ring finger 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:22.350
 one side up of the branches 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:29.660
 finger does not move fmc so differently 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:29.660
 rum fc so I think is to do 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.840
 however, it is a bit hard 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.500
 I think the melody is really cool 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.500
 for the campfire 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.490
 but the whole a bit hard 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.770
 can you the song you youtube 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.669
 I'll send you link to yours 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.919
 Singing texts is pretty hard 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:55.020
 first try melody goes 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.680
 probably it was better of me 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.680
 until next time
