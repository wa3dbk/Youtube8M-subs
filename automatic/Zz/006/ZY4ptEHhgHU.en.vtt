00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.730
 hi guys back on mine 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.980
 channel 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.960
 today we're going to plant a flowerbed 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.960
 big enough that I have recently 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.960
 built 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.520
 first we will go to eliminate 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.860
 all the weeds and to level the 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.140
 ground 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.620
 as a second thing we will cover the 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:53.720
 ground with a lover face cloth 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:56.270
 breathable so not allowing the 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.620
 birth of weeds 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:03.230
 once the entire sheet is in place 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.800
 we're going to fix with nails in 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.800
 plastic 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:18.520
 now we're going to plant the plants 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:18.520
 we're going to make a cut in the cloth 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:30.289
 fatigue remove it or we'll turn and 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:33.740
 you are sick so we will also go to 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:38.750
 arrange the bulbs that will then go to 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:42.399
 bloom in spring once placed 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.759
 the plants we are going to spread on the cloth 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.759
 of the bark 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.090
 here we have the same bark 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:00.500
 for further mulching from 

00:01:55.489 --> 00:02:04.670
 terrain you can eventually beautify 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.140
 the viola at your leisure with this 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.939
 that's all 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.110
 I greet you I invite you as always to 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.209
