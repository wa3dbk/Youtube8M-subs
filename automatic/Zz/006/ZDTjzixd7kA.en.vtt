00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hello youtube and welcome to 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.799
 Compare series between the google 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.269
 nexus 7 and the apple ipad mini das 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.030
 You should be the first video in the series 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.670
 and it's just about that 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.010
 Devices from the outside what attracts attention 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.750
 what you have optically and falls there 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.949
 of course, the first to the size we 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.600
 have 7 9 display should and 7 inch 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.529
 display one puts the things times 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.769
 on each other 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.449
 you can see it also nice the ipad 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.960
 is a bit bigger 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:39.390
 however, the ipad is also a good piece 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.309
 thinner than the nexus 7 it falls on yes 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.640
 it stands out when I'm in now 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.950
 two finger suppose because I notice here 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.210
 already a significant thickness where I have it 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.950
 just in the hand have the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.280
 have 340 grams here 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.210
 and here we have 308 grams one notices 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.210
 The iPad is a tick makes it easier 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.879
 it's going to be a long time 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.260
 I say so who would not be there 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.900
 has strong in dirt muscles 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.080
 Of course, the iPad keeps longer time 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.570
 with two fingers or 3 4 inso before the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.150
 hand changes like over nex-7 but so 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.340
 really objective power is there 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.240
 a hard one at all a difference 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.439
 If he does that to someone now 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.130
 press in the hand and say which it 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.350
 severe 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.640
 I guarantee you many 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.740
 say are just as hard to look at us 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.159
 the front one 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.500
 and then it turns out I'll do that 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.030
 display off so that does not distract us 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.579
 Both have the camera facing the front 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.130
 chamber here both 12 megapixel camera 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.979
 Both take hd ready on camera 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.960
 quality completely better on the ipad mini 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.390
 the nexus does not have its own right one 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.920
 physical home button the ipad 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.079
 owe something to push 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.090
 and there is a point for that 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.170
 straight tablets are often on my case 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.850
 the table and then I just do it 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.509
 so and then I unlock that us 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.310
 player with rum 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.420
 the nexus I have the problem I have to 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.619
 to the side and if I then 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.090
 do not press on the thing then slips 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.070
 the tablet a bit or I have to 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.659
 lift first 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.720
 a physical home button would be mine 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.180
 rather than touching these three back here 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.879
 but that's it 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.829
 on the right side is then 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:19.579
 also the loud and quiet button at 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:21.859
 both devices and the ipad gets then 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:24.769
 here this blog either for dumb 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:27.290
 switch or curls for the rotations 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.980
 I just do not turn the page anymore 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:35.239
 if you keep it at an angle, look 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.120
 we get down to it and get the nexus 7 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.280
 his headphone connection down 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.439
 mini micro usb connection to the store and 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.139
 down here the speaker like that 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:47.810
 diagonally half on the back 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:49.639
 speakers and microphone are also at 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.680
 not both speakers are yes 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:54.079
 stereo speaker in there from ipad mini 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.340
 and the new lightning connection nicely 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.950
 it also with the theme of lightning and 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.540
 micro-usb compares clearly there 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.569
 Many would have said apple on the 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:07.700
 I can believe micro 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.810
 let that be my space why 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.060
 apple that did not do it now 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.019
 of course you want new connections 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.900
 Of course , something smaller was needed 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:18.319
 of course they wanted as a 30 pin adapter 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.790
 what sets me apart from the competition 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.909
 the lightning but its credit it is 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.440
 is more stable when I put it in 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.389
 just the iphone and the ipad mini 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.479
 then he goes as a doc to the thing 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:31.939
 to hold up micro usb connection is 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:35.150
 but a bit too unstable 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:37.159
 eyes so left side nothing here 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.959
 on nexus again this induction charge 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:41.299
 dinger but eventually will 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:45.530
 are no chargers available 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:47.030
 for that and the top has the nexus 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.750
 here is a microphone for the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.370
 outside noise and / or that the 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.799
 only nailed me but now please 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.909
 not on any case microphone 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.829
 ipad mini has its microphone here 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.620
 headphone jack up like I did it 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:03.169
 it's a pity that the iphone 5 is not 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.109
 worked and in ostritz and we 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:09.609
 come back side since we offer here 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:12.709
 rubberized black with small nubs 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:14.959
 is quite comfortable in the hand many 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.000
 i actually like that gum 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.299
 even then it can be comfortable even in 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.910
 One hand holding two thumbs fit 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.340
 here also at the ipad 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.770
 Nice aluminum feels great 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.600
 on 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.160
 and if I take it in hand here 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.500
 because you injected but the very 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.910
 wider form factor makes it clear 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.230
 is still in hand but to stop 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.260
 not so pleasant we look 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.610
 keep that short man 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.290
 that goes both can go one in one 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.040
 hand to show something or something 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.650
 What ever 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.760
 nexus loads energizes but more pleasant 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.010
 both are actually recommended 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.540
 beautiful in the half of the hand in the 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.180
 hand rhein to pack and the things 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.860
 like that or down there or what 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.570
 Of course , my favorite because both 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.580
 Devices so great are easy here with two 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.740
 or keep three fingers in the corner 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.940
 and just running around like that 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.850
 then always reminds me a bit 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.320
 Jean Luc Picard Captain of the enterprise 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.990
 then with his data peter like that 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.320
 what's left is still on the back 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.800
 on the ipad mini has a backs 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.690
 camera 5 megapixel full hd 1080p video 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.040
 recording quality you can also in the 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.230
 makes video with me already makes 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.480
 actually decent pics goes sag 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.970
 me once 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.760
 we are already with the devices 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:35.340
 Now you can think about 130 euros 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.410
 extra charge for the ipad mini are the 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.270
 justified in my eyes, I say 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.260
 times the higher quality natural 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.140
 materials and the 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.430
 Processing quality is better the 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.470
 finish with all the mistakes 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.790
 Nexus 7 with wrong inserted monja 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.140
 displays and the edges and down apple 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.510
 is just like apple just offers one 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:58.530
 better processing quality counts 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.690
 the 120 130 euro well, we just aluminum 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.890
 definitely want 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:05.250
 otherwise it is of course again 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:07.500
 question android against ios apple pays 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.180
 of course you pay on price 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.250
 actually a good customer service 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:15.289
 or whatever you justify 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:17.839
 would like to apple devices are simply more expensive 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:21.020
 both devices make fun both devices 

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:24.259
 Look great and both are easy 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:27.499
 again typical representatives of her 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:30.020
 respective origin so that 's it first 

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:33.249
 video more follow it makes good and 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.249
 until the next video
