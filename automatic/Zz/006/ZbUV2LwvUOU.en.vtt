00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 all salute my name is you store with you 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.930
 united music you are watching the second issue 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.950
 of our project mts where we tell 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.809
 everything is as it is 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.580
 This week in my studio visited 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:19.800
 microphones snowball from american 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:21.359
 blu companies t-shirts falls went for 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.010
 greater visibility of your comments 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.199
 I will write using the device itself 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.000
 snowball is affordable professional 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.590
 yusbi microphone this year company 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.179
 decided to introduce a new fun 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.800
 body colors that you can 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.480
 see in the picture beyond that in 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.670
 the model lineup preserved the classic 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.440
 colors white black and chrome which 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.210
 hit me on a bright color test 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.010
 In addition to the microphone, you will find the box 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.750
 usb cable obd rack 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.489
 instruction in English all 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.690
 the body is made of metal with small 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.550
 plastic inserts 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.079
 I especially want to mention rubberized 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.180
 legs that do not allow to slide on 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.620
 surfaces and make snowball super 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.960
 stable enough to build 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.360
 wind the microphone tincture provided 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.430
 rotate 360 ​​degrees and tilt it 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.109
 another plus comfort is no longer 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.000
 will have to bend over and twist the neck 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.909
 on the front we see an indicator 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.799
 network works and if you look closely 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.540
 built-in pop filter for this can be immediately 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.340
 kiss developers because 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.470
 it almost never occurs 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.509
 if I'm wrong write in the comments 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.670
 Of course there were not enough stars but with 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.439
 the main task is coping and breathing 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.299
 with sharp sounds 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.549
 excellent cable is waiting for us 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.180
 usb connection is supported format and 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.880
 2.0 and 1.1 and a little higher is the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.100
 main feature selection of recording modes 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.930
 You can choose one of three 1 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.970
 cardioid orientation most often 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.740
 used to record vocals and solos 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.509
 instruments in this case microphone 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.130
 makes sound straight ahead and not 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.740
 the necessary part which is behind 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.210
 the record misses his word and chose 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.280
 in order to reduce the noise of a laptop 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.500
 and the sound of rain on the cornice the second mode on 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.750
 Essentially completely analogous to the first one 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.369
 reduced day by 10 decibels this 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.950
 saves while recording loud 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.079
 sources will eliminate peaks and distortions 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.580
 and finally the third mode is omnidirectional 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.020
 microphone writes everything around 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.850
 may be useful when recording 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.430
 natural river when you for example 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.140
 Need to convey all the nuances of the room or 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.690
 bloom environments x released to market 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.580
 classic derringer and or ordinary 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.320
 suspension though not quite usually like 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.390
 designed specifically for the format 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.380
 again bola and like him at first I 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.410
 Of course he doubted the expediency 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.540
 the acquisition of knowledge is much the same then 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.310
 less than the microphone itself but throughout 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.960
 testing it turned out that this thing 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.970
 masked and then you for example set 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.370
 elbows on the table or something is placed or 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:36.250
 inadvertently touch the microphone or the table itself 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.870
 what happens is so wenger 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.940
 helps to avoid these very 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.920
 unpleasant things during the test more than once 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.630
 I caught myself thinking that I hold hands 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.280
 device cost as a menu two times 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.350
 more expensive than its real price to it 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.630
 contribute to everything from 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.860
 quality housing and ending with a whole 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.870
 near small chips 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.820
 from which using some 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.800
 time to refuse oh how I do not want 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.660
 impression is only positive for 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.120
 fans of technical information, I note 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.250
 that the sampling rate is 44 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.350
 and 1 kilohertz with a depth of 16 bits 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.360
 audio standards sits this parameter 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.160
 I can’t change it further 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.200
 read short vocal samples 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.550
 and snowball guitars 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.550
 and with you 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.959
 amizon oxane money 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.959
 and he killed 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:32.380
 owl 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:39.030
 and he reason bloomed uray 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.030
 and get and begin private 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.190
 but 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:08.379
 Well judge the quality of the recording you 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.269
 You can not compensate by the way 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:13.000
 and the original audio file can be downloaded 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.920
 on our soundcloud channel link right 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.870
 in the description under the video if we talk about 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.120
 cons the first thing i want to say is 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.100
 hard droplet it sometimes shifts your 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.850
 microphone left or right if he 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.729
 something interferes 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.199
 the second is the lack of normal 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.970
 filter it does not mean that 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.650
 Factory do not perform their functions as 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.900
 since he does it for 100 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.930
 percent but as always you want something 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.180
 the best and of course 3 minus is minus 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.220
 of all condenser microphones they 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.800
 extremely sensitive to vibrations therefore 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.479
 buy a stand if possible 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.130
 be careful while recording 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.050
 Now I have a positive snowball 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.699
 light weight compact dimensions not 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.220
 no need to install 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:53.050
 driver built-in pop filter availability 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.720
 three modes that allows you 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:59.110
 do vocals recording instruments 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.360
 skype talk groups their voices 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.250
 launches and much more thing I 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.750
 a brief summary we can say that the microphone 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.400
 suitable for studios which are strongly 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.139
 budgeted for their task 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.460
 microphone perform on five plus 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.470
 as always thank you for watching 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.810
 put likes write comments 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.440
 subscribe to the channel for new meetings 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.440
 bye everyone 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.130
 and now let's rewrite normally what 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.130
 you did not look at the camera like a sucker
