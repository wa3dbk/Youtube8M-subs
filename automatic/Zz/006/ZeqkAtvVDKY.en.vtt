be<00:01:50.210> higher<00:01:50.420> is<00:01:50.720> 93<00:01:51.380> is<00:01:51.440> just<00:01:51.740> perfect<00:01:52.280> enough

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
be higher is 93 is just perfect enough

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.280 
be higher is 93 is just perfect enough
so<00:01:52.760> he<00:01:52.790> will<00:01:53.120> hold<00:01:53.330> on<00:01:53.510> to<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.750> ball<00:01:53.900> in<00:01:54.080> most

a<00:02:57.380> couple<00:02:57.590> things<00:02:57.800> why<00:02:58.130> I<00:02:58.160> notice<00:02:58.550> with<00:02:58.730> this

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
a couple things why I notice with this

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.000 
a couple things why I notice with this
card<00:02:59.150> is<00:02:59.270> that<00:02:59.450> it<00:02:59.600> won't<00:02:59.750> out<00:02:59.990> be<00:03:00.470> anybody

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
card is that it won't out be anybody

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.490 
card is that it won't out be anybody
because<00:03:01.220> he<00:03:01.340> does<00:03:01.940> have<00:03:01.970> 95<00:03:02.510> speed<00:03:02.720> which<00:03:03.290> is

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
because he does have 95 speed which is

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.920 
because he does have 95 speed which is
perfect<00:03:04.130> which<00:03:04.460> is<00:03:04.610> pretty<00:03:04.790> good<00:03:05.120> it's<00:03:05.360> not

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.510 
perfect which is pretty good it's not
faster<00:03:06.380> than<00:03:06.530> most<00:03:06.740> cornerback<00:03:07.280> some

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
and he also has that catch in traffic

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.520 
and he also has that catch in traffic
ring<00:03:59.150> that<00:03:59.330> we<00:03:59.390> just<00:03:59.600> previously<00:04:00.020> went<00:04:00.290> over

animation every single time but more

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.350 
animation every single time but more
like

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
like

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.270

even nut if you know really what you're

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.439 
even nut if you know really what you're
doing<00:04:29.520> get<00:04:29.669> some<00:04:29.819> good<00:04:29.939> stick<00:04:30.270> you<00:04:30.419> can

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
doing get some good stick you can

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.300 
doing get some good stick you can
actually<00:04:30.750> get<00:04:31.080> inside<00:04:31.469> position<00:04:31.680> you<00:04:32.129> will

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
actually get inside position you will

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.610 
actually get inside position you will
make<00:04:32.729> an<00:04:32.849> animation<00:04:33.300> and<00:04:33.719> more<00:04:34.020> nine<00:04:34.349> times

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
make an animation and more nine times

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.050 
make an animation and more nine times
out<00:04:34.800> of<00:04:34.830> ten<00:04:34.919> well<00:04:35.280> maybe<00:04:35.520> like<00:04:35.759> eight<00:04:35.909> times

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
out of ten well maybe like eight times

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.249 
out of ten well maybe like eight times
out<00:04:36.240> of<00:04:36.300> ten<00:04:36.449> whole<00:04:36.599> come<00:04:36.780> down<00:04:36.990> with<00:04:37.169> it

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
out of ten whole come down with it

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:44.179 
out of ten whole come down with it
because<00:04:37.349> that<00:04:37.469> kept<00:04:37.740> in<00:04:37.860> traffic<00:04:42.919> alright<00:04:43.919> so

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:44.189 
because that kept in traffic alright so

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:46.279 
because that kept in traffic alright so
now<00:04:44.340> let's<00:04:44.550> go<00:04:44.669> over<00:04:44.699> the<00:04:45.000> final<00:04:45.479> attribute

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
now let's go over the final attribute

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:47.510 
now let's go over the final attribute
that<00:04:46.349> I'm<00:04:46.500> going<00:04:46.620> to<00:04:46.680> be<00:04:46.740> going<00:04:46.860> over<00:04:47.099> his<00:04:47.250> rat

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
that I'm going to be going over his rat

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.059 
that I'm going to be going over his rat
running<00:04:47.819> and<00:04:48.030> his<00:04:48.210> size<00:04:48.479> now<00:04:49.289> I<00:04:49.319> know<00:04:49.530> I<00:04:49.680> stated

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
running and his size now I know I stated

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.159 
running and his size now I know I stated
this<00:04:50.219> before<00:04:50.280> that<00:04:50.699> 63<00:04:51.180> size<00:04:51.449> is<00:04:51.719> just<00:04:51.960> so

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
this before that 63 size is just so

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:53.689 
this before that 63 size is just so
clutch<00:04:52.530> is<00:04:52.710> only<00:04:52.860> a<00:04:52.979> couple<00:04:53.219> other<00:04:53.490> wide

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
clutch is only a couple other wide

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.249 
clutch is only a couple other wide
receivers<00:04:54.240> that<00:04:54.419> are<00:04:54.509> taller<00:04:54.780> than<00:04:55.020> them<00:04:55.110> as

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
receivers that are taller than them as

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.830 
receivers that are taller than them as
you<00:04:55.740> saw<00:04:55.919> right<00:04:56.099> there<00:04:56.310> double<00:04:57.000> coverage<00:04:57.419> gets

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
you saw right there double coverage gets

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.260 
you saw right there double coverage gets
inside<00:04:58.710> position<00:04:58.889> on<00:04:59.250> bolt<00:04:59.580> receivers<00:05:00.090> and

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
inside position on bolt receivers and

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.899 
inside position on bolt receivers and
makes<00:05:00.479> the<00:05:00.689> catch<00:05:00.840> and<00:05:01.340> that's<00:05:02.340> just<00:05:02.580> what

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:02.909 
makes the catch and that's just what

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:04.580 
makes the catch and that's just what
Julio<00:05:03.090> Jones<00:05:03.629> has<00:05:03.900> been<00:05:04.050> doing<00:05:04.319> this<00:05:04.409> whole

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
Julio Jones has been doing this whole

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.999 
Julio Jones has been doing this whole
week<00:05:04.770> for<00:05:04.979> me<00:05:05.099> now<00:05:05.580> rat<00:05:06.509> running<00:05:06.779> wise<00:05:07.080> 85

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
week for me now rat running wise 85

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.119 
week for me now rat running wise 85
Ronnie<00:05:08.969> 87<00:05:09.569> rat<00:05:09.719> running<00:05:09.930> I<00:05:10.050> said<00:05:10.319> it's<00:05:10.919> not

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:11.129 
Ronnie 87 rat running I said it's not

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:13.490 
Ronnie 87 rat running I said it's not
the<00:05:11.310> best<00:05:11.460> route<00:05:11.759> running<00:05:12.000> only<00:05:12.180> is<00:05:12.539> a<00:05:13.169> key

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
the best route running only is a key

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.260 
the best route running only is a key
factor<00:05:13.650> in<00:05:14.069> when<00:05:14.400> it's<00:05:14.430> man<00:05:14.699> coverage<00:05:15.120> that's

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
factor in when it's man coverage that's

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.779 
factor in when it's man coverage that's
what<00:05:15.419> EA<00:05:15.629> Sports<00:05:16.050> said<00:05:16.259> that's<00:05:16.469> when

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
what EA Sports said that's when

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.100 
what EA Sports said that's when
route-running<00:05:17.789> actually<00:05:18.270> matters<00:05:18.629> is<00:05:18.779> the

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
route-running actually matters is the

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.249 
route-running actually matters is the
separation<00:05:19.319> between<00:05:19.770> man<00:05:20.639> coverage<00:05:21.240> so<00:05:22.110> if

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
separation between man coverage so if

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:23.540 
separation between man coverage so if
you<00:05:22.349> have<00:05:22.469> an<00:05:22.590> opponent<00:05:23.069> running<00:05:23.250> a<00:05:23.310> lot<00:05:23.430> of

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
you have an opponent running a lot of

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.189 
you have an opponent running a lot of
zone<00:05:23.729> you<00:05:23.939> really<00:05:24.150> don't<00:05:24.300> have<00:05:24.360> to<00:05:24.449> run<00:05:24.689> worry

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
zone you really don't have to run worry

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.260 
zone you really don't have to run worry
about<00:05:25.439> is<00:05:25.590> 87<00:05:26.189> route<00:05:26.430> running<00:05:26.639> but<00:05:26.909> just<00:05:27.150> know

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
about is 87 route running but just know

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.179 
about is 87 route running but just know
that<00:05:27.389> there<00:05:27.539> are<00:05:27.569> other<00:05:28.080> receivers<00:05:28.830> that<00:05:29.009> have

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:29.189 
that there are other receivers that have

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:30.890 
that there are other receivers that have
better<00:05:29.430> route<00:05:29.669> running<00:05:29.939> all<00:05:30.479> right<00:05:30.599> so<00:05:30.779> the

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
better route running all right so the

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.339 
better route running all right so the
final<00:05:31.080> verdict<00:05:31.620> that<00:05:31.680> we<00:05:31.889> have<00:05:32.159> for<00:05:32.580> v<00:05:32.969> 92

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:33.349 
final verdict that we have for v 92
