00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
but the end of the year before last year

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.009 
but the end of the year before last year
and<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:07.290> into<00:00:07.830> that<00:00:07.950> but<00:00:08.599> the<00:00:09.599> one<00:00:09.780> hub

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
and and into that but the one hub

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.970 
and and into that but the one hub
stripped<00:00:10.440> out<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:12.290> even<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.469> got<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.769> go<00:00:13.830> even

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
stripped out and even I got to go even

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.880 
stripped out and even I got to go even
further<00:00:14.219> back<00:00:14.460> but<00:00:14.759> like<00:00:15.680> for<00:00:16.680> some<00:00:16.859> reason

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
further back but like for some reason

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.670 
further back but like for some reason
that<00:00:17.190> came<00:00:17.400> with<00:00:17.609> three<00:00:17.910> lug<00:00:18.320> hubs<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.619> I

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
that came with three lug hubs on it I

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.679 
that came with three lug hubs on it I
think<00:00:19.740> somebody<00:00:20.189> put<00:00:20.279> him<00:00:20.369> on<00:00:20.520> there<00:00:20.730> said<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
think somebody put him on there said the

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.509 
think somebody put him on there said the
tires<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:22.109> are<00:00:22.410> pretty<00:00:22.650> awesome<00:00:22.830> on<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.340> are

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
tires that are pretty awesome on it are

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.089 
tires that are pretty awesome on it are
three<00:00:23.730> lug<00:00:23.910> but<00:00:24.810> what<00:00:25.080> happened<00:00:25.410> was<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.859> never

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
three lug but what happened was I never

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.650 
three lug but what happened was I never
put<00:00:26.550> any<00:00:26.699> grease<00:00:26.939> or<00:00:27.090> anything<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.539> east

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
put any grease or anything in the east

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.769 
put any grease or anything in the east
and<00:00:28.429> they<00:00:29.429> stripped<00:00:29.760> out<00:00:29.939> pretty<00:00:30.420> early<00:00:30.510> on

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
and they stripped out pretty early on

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.209 
and they stripped out pretty early on
basically<00:00:31.650> what<00:00:31.769> happened<00:00:31.980> was<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.189> first

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
basically what happened was the first

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.220 
basically what happened was the first
one<00:00:32.640> stripped<00:00:32.940> out<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.660> took<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.960> over<00:00:34.050> and

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
one stripped out and I took it over and

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.620 
one stripped out and I took it over and
I<00:00:34.290> welded<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.950> axle<00:00:35.340> because<00:00:36.300> they

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
I welded it to the axle because they

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.970 
I welded it to the axle because they
would<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:36.899> spin<00:00:37.170> they<00:00:37.500> would<00:00:37.620> do<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> one

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
would just spin they would do a one

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.069 
would just spin they would do a one
singer<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.940> can<00:00:39.059> see<00:00:39.239> videos<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.809> doing

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
singer you can see videos that doing

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.260 
singer you can see videos that doing
wheelies<00:00:40.379> one<00:00:41.160> leg<00:00:41.399> or<00:00:41.520> style<00:00:41.790> was

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
wheelies one leg or style was

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.540 
wheelies one leg or style was
awesome<00:00:42.739> and<00:00:43.739> then<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> other<00:00:44.070> one<00:00:44.250> stripped

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
awesome and then the other one stripped

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.040 
awesome and then the other one stripped
out<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:45.210> was<00:00:45.329> doing<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> one<00:00:45.719> leg<00:00:45.870> or<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
out and I was doing a one leg or the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.700 
out and I was doing a one leg or the
other<00:00:46.170> way<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.530> welded<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.219> one<00:00:47.399> and

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
other way so I welded that one and

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.470 
other way so I welded that one and
eventually<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.430> replaced<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.030> whole<00:00:51.270> rear

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
eventually I replaced that whole rear

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.510 
eventually I replaced that whole rear
axle<00:00:51.930> because<00:00:52.079> bearings<00:00:52.530> were<00:00:52.680> shot<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
axle because bearings were shot and the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.979 
axle because bearings were shot and the
hubs<00:00:53.789> were<00:00:53.940> welded<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.629> whole<00:00:54.719> bunch<00:00:54.750> of

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
hubs were welded on and a whole bunch of

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.590 
hubs were welded on and a whole bunch of
 but<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> new<00:00:56.730> acts<00:00:56.879> like<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.270> for<00:00:57.510> it

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
 but the new acts like I for it

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.279 
 but the new acts like I for it
didn't<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:57.989> hubs<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.600> took<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.870> seventy's

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
didn't have hubs so I took the seventy's

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.750 
didn't have hubs so I took the seventy's
hubs<00:01:01.500> off<00:01:01.710> because<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.100> was<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> same<00:01:02.460> bolt

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
hubs off because it was the same bolt

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.329 
hubs off because it was the same bolt
pattern<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.239> same<00:01:03.449> splines<00:01:03.979> but<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.189> got

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
pattern the same splines but then I got

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.870 
pattern the same splines but then I got
the<00:01:05.460> 70<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.180> little<00:01:06.270> bit<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:07.640> had<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.700> get<00:01:08.850> a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the 70 going a little bit I had to get a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.280 
the 70 going a little bit I had to get a
new<00:01:09.000> house<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.479> 110<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.110> they're<00:01:10.260> a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
new house for the 110 and they're a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.899 
new house for the 110 and they're a
little<00:01:10.500> bit<00:01:10.650> heavier<00:01:11.040> duty<00:01:11.369> than<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.610> 70

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
little bit heavier duty than the 70

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.000 
little bit heavier duty than the 70
watts<00:01:12.060> -<00:01:12.299> they<00:01:12.420> got<00:01:12.540> these<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.680> tell<00:01:13.860> by

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
watts - they got these I can tell by

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.620 
watts - they got these I can tell by
weight<00:01:14.430> they're<00:01:14.760> definitely<00:01:14.939> heavier<00:01:15.420> and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
weight they're definitely heavier and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.140 
weight they're definitely heavier and
they<00:01:15.689> got<00:01:15.840> these<00:01:16.250> been<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> piece<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.759> metal<00:01:18.030> and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
they got these been a piece of metal and

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.200 
they got these been a piece of metal and
bent<00:01:19.009> steel<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.460> always<00:01:20.790> helps<00:01:20.939> with

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
bent steel like this always helps with

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.810 
bent steel like this always helps with
strength<00:01:21.979> so<00:01:23.600> just<00:01:24.600> pop<00:01:24.840> these<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.520> 110<00:01:26.520> is

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
strength so just pop these on 110 is

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.130 
strength so just pop these on 110 is
running<00:01:27.119> horrible<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.540> got<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.780> drive<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:27.960> with

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
running horrible we got to drive it with

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.800 
running horrible we got to drive it with
the<00:01:28.229> choke<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.590> I'm<00:01:28.799> pretty<00:01:28.890> sure<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.280> got<00:01:29.400> a

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
the choke on I'm pretty sure it's got a

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.649 
the choke on I'm pretty sure it's got a
leak<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.960> intake<00:01:31.350> because<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.270> bolt

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
leak and intake because the one bolt

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.539 
leak and intake because the one bolt
that<00:01:33.869> goes<00:01:33.900> into<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.470> head<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.920> stripped<00:01:35.369> out

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
that goes into the head is stripped out

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.230 
that goes into the head is stripped out
it<00:01:36.450> sucks<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.430> try<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.729> do<00:01:38.880> something<00:01:39.060> about

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
it sucks so I try to do something about

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.330 
it sucks so I try to do something about
that<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:40.350> think<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.590> carburetor<00:01:40.920> needs<00:01:41.250> to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
that and I think the carburetor needs to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.460 
that and I think the carburetor needs to
be<00:01:41.460> clean<00:01:42.000> again<00:01:42.180> -<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.720> ran<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.259> without<00:01:43.409> a

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
be clean again - I ran it without a

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.550 
be clean again - I ran it without a
filter<00:01:44.540> I've<00:01:45.540> got<00:01:45.720> them<00:01:45.810> greased<00:01:46.049> up<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.439> they

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560
