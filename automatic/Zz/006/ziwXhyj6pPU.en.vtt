of the shaft that comes across here and
the<00:01:27.640> motor<00:01:27.909> down<00:01:28.240> there<00:01:28.539> drives<00:01:28.899> that<00:01:29.140> shaft

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
the motor down there drives that shaft

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.639 
the motor down there drives that shaft
and<00:01:29.890> that<00:01:30.399> shaft<00:01:30.729> drives<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:32.710> built<00:01:33.180> which

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
and that shaft drives just built which

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.149 
and that shaft drives just built which
rotates<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:35.829> Hat<00:01:36.189> on<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:36.700> other<00:01:37.149> leg<00:01:38.159> that

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
brass barb I machine the other end down

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.120 
brass barb I machine the other end down
so<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:46.180> would<00:02:46.330> fit<00:02:46.690> inside<00:02:46.990> of<00:02:47.770> one<00:02:48.010> of

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
so that it would fit inside of one of

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.360 
so that it would fit inside of one of
these<00:02:48.250> ports<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.360> then<00:02:50.170> I<00:02:50.320> pushed<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.890> bar<00:02:51.130> of

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
these ports and then I pushed the bar of

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.680 
these ports and then I pushed the bar of
up<00:02:51.550> on<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.850> piece<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.920> now<00:02:53.920> on<00:02:54.190> whose<00:02:54.520> vinyl<00:02:55.480> hose

or whatever one rubber hose whatever

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.040 
or whatever one rubber hose whatever
brought<00:02:59.830> it<00:03:00.010> up<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:00.430> then<00:03:00.760> attached<00:03:01.360> it<00:03:01.780> to

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
brought it up and then attached it to

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.730 
brought it up and then attached it to
this<00:03:02.890> other<00:03:03.220> brass<00:03:03.550> piece<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.300> house<00:03:04.740> kind

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
this other brass piece that house kind

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.620 
this other brass piece that house kind
of<00:03:05.860> large<00:03:06.130> hole<00:03:07.000> in<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:07.330> right<00:03:07.450> here<00:03:07.780> anyhow

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
in that hole right there and then just

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.570 
in that hole right there and then just
give<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:22.930> couple<00:03:23.080> of<00:03:23.290> pumps<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:24.010> know<00:03:24.220> and

give it a couple of pumps you know and

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.390 
give it a couple of pumps you know and
just<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:25.690> know<00:03:25.720> pumps<00:03:26.230> of<00:03:26.380> all<00:03:26.560> on<00:03:26.890> down<00:03:27.160> in

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
just you know pumps of all on down in

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.070 
just you know pumps of all on down in
there<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:31.000> know<00:03:31.180> kind<00:03:31.540> of<00:03:31.600> lubricate

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
there and you know kind of lubricate

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.540 
there and you know kind of lubricate
that<00:03:32.320> thing<00:03:32.560> up<00:03:32.740> and<00:03:34.710> keep<00:03:35.710> that<00:03:35.890> shaft<00:03:36.220> on<00:03:36.490> the

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
that thing up and keep that shaft on the

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.460 
that thing up and keep that shaft on the
back<00:03:36.730> lubricated<00:03:37.510> it<00:03:37.660> I<00:03:37.900> believe<00:03:39.330> that<00:03:40.470> that

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
back lubricated it I believe that that

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.170 
back lubricated it I believe that that
shaft<00:03:41.890> is<00:03:42.250> riding<00:03:42.610> on<00:03:42.670> bushings<00:03:43.270> and<00:03:45.150> so<00:03:46.150> I

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
shaft is riding on bushings and so I

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.380 
shaft is riding on bushings and so I
would<00:03:47.020> imagine<00:03:47.470> you<00:03:47.980> know<00:03:48.940> it's<00:03:49.060> kind<00:03:49.240> of

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
would imagine you know it's kind of

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.440 
would imagine you know it's kind of
important<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:49.930> keep<00:03:50.260> all<00:03:50.590> you<00:03:51.220> know<00:03:51.450> probably

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
important to keep all you know probably

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.150 
important to keep all you know probably

I'm still not understanding where your
question<00:06:51.150> is<00:06:51.360> and<00:06:51.630> that<00:06:51.750> wasn't<00:06:51.960> surprised<00:06:52.470> me

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
question is and that wasn't surprised me

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.330 
question is and that wasn't surprised me
because<00:06:53.100> you<00:06:54.090> know<00:06:54.270> I<00:06:54.300> don't<00:06:54.510> I<00:06:54.930> don't<00:06:55.889> think

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
because you know I don't I don't think

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.920 
because you know I don't I don't think
too<00:06:56.490> good<00:06:56.760> sometimes<00:06:56.970> and<00:06:57.800> say<00:06:58.800> anyhow<00:06:59.720> it<00:07:00.720> is

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
too good sometimes and say anyhow it is

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.480 
too good sometimes and say anyhow it is
what<00:07:01.139> it<00:07:01.199> is<00:07:01.320> but<00:07:01.729> hopefully<00:07:02.930> you<00:07:03.930> know<00:07:04.139> that

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
what it is but hopefully you know that

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.670 
what it is but hopefully you know that
