00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
network status status and check your net

rating<00:00:44.640> make<00:00:44.850> sure<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.300> open<00:00:45.570> if<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.079> not

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
rating make sure it's open if it's not

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.350 
rating make sure it's open if it's not
then<00:00:46.739> make<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.370> open<00:00:47.640> because<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.969> heard<00:00:48.239> it

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
then make it open because I heard it

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.990 
then make it open because I heard it
kind<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.660> makes<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.989> more<00:00:49.289> better<00:00:49.789> if<00:00:50.789> you

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
kind of makes it more better if you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.119 
kind of makes it more better if you
don't<00:00:51.210> know<00:00:51.329> how<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.510> open<00:00:52.230> your<00:00:52.469> net<00:00:52.800> then

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
don't know how to open your net then

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.180 
don't know how to open your net then
google<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.170> second<00:00:55.170> thing<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.530> make<00:00:55.559> sure<00:00:55.890> your

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
google it second thing is make sure your

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.939 
google it second thing is make sure your
sensitivity<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:56.969> three<00:00:57.329> or<00:00:57.660> four<00:00:57.949> anything

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
sensitivity is three or four anything

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.529 
sensitivity is three or four anything
higher<00:00:59.190> than<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.879> probably<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.270> bad<00:01:00.480> idea

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
higher than that is probably a bad idea

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.810 
higher than that is probably a bad idea
because<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> sensitivity<00:01:01.859> starts<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.640> get

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
because the sensitivity starts to get

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.800 
because the sensitivity starts to get
all<00:01:03.300> wobbly<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.260> play<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.040> seven<00:01:05.489> when<00:01:05.729> I'm<00:01:06.119> host

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
all wobbly I play on seven when I'm host

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.560 
all wobbly I play on seven when I'm host
or<00:01:07.229> playing<00:01:07.560> alone<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.670> play<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> same

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
or playing alone so if you play the same

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.380 
or playing alone so if you play the same
sensitivity<00:01:10.110> as<00:01:10.500> me<00:01:10.770> or<00:01:11.010> higher<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.210> lower

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
sensitivity as me or higher just lower

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.859 
sensitivity as me or higher just lower
it<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:13.770> third<00:01:14.040> thing<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.340> make<00:01:14.729> sure<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.659> host

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
it the third thing is make sure the host

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.260 
it the third thing is make sure the host
is<00:01:16.080> close<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.530> your<00:01:16.680> area<00:01:16.860> if<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.580> if<00:01:17.909> you're

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
is close to your area if you if you're

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.120 
is close to your area if you if you're
playing<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> Canada<00:01:19.439> host<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.040> you're

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
playing on like a Canada host and you're

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.429 
playing on like a Canada host and you're
from<00:01:20.369> Texas<00:01:21.360> you're<00:01:21.570> probably<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.229> lag

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
from Texas you're probably going to lag

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.350 
from Texas you're probably going to lag
really<00:01:22.920> badly<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.340> only<00:01:23.610> recommend<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.210> to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
really badly I only recommend you to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.179 
really badly I only recommend you to
play<00:01:24.930> with<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.200> friend<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.680> lives<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
play with a friend that lives in the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.789 
play with a friend that lives in the
same<00:01:26.369> city<00:01:26.759> as<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.150> do<00:01:27.330> fourth<00:01:28.320> thing<00:01:28.560> is

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
same city as you do fourth thing is

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.429 
same city as you do fourth thing is
classic<00:01:29.310> mode<00:01:29.520> actually<00:01:29.759> reduces<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.750> delay

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
classic mode actually reduces the delay

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.100 
classic mode actually reduces the delay
this<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.829> bit<00:01:32.009> not<00:01:32.340> completely<00:01:33.000> but<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.840> does

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
this a bit not completely but it does

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.310 
this a bit not completely but it does
make<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.350> easier<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:35.270> move<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.600> control

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
make it easier to move and control

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.109 
make it easier to move and control
however<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.549> sacrifice<00:01:38.759> the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
however you have to sacrifice the

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.590 
however you have to sacrifice the
wonderful<00:01:39.810> HD<00:01:40.259> graphics<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.950> 343<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:41.939> did<00:01:42.299> so

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
wonderful HD graphics that 343 I did so

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.539 
wonderful HD graphics that 343 I did so
make<00:01:42.899> your<00:01:43.049> choice<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.979> last<00:01:44.009> thing<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.520> need

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
make your choice the last thing you need

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.880 
make your choice the last thing you need
to<00:01:44.700> do<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.090> just<00:01:45.299> get<00:01:45.689> used<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:46.710> not

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
to do is just get used to it it's not

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
minutes you'll be comfortable with it

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.469 
minutes you'll be comfortable with it
and<00:01:54.799> yeah<00:01:55.799> that's<00:01:56.430> all<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.790> really<00:01:56.969> got<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.299> do

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
and yeah that's all you really got to do

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.709 
and yeah that's all you really got to do

to make the co-op experience more
manageable<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:01.110> main<00:02:01.469> reason<00:02:01.829> why<00:02:01.950> it's<00:02:02.189> so

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
manageable the main reason why it's so

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.819 
manageable the main reason why it's so
laggy<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.450> because<00:02:03.810> halo<00:02:04.110> one's<00:02:04.320> net<00:02:04.590> code

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
laggy is because halo one's net code

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.789 
laggy is because halo one's net code
