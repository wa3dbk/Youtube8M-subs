important items of this bucket as the
back<00:00:36.510> there<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> suitable<00:00:38.160> quite<00:00:39.030> thick<00:00:39.420> you

back there is a suitable quite thick you

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.600 
back there is a suitable quite thick you
can<00:00:39.899> see<00:00:40.140> that's<00:00:40.410> about<00:00:40.739> two<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.579> half

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
can see that's about two and a half

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.619 
can see that's about two and a half
centimeters<00:00:42.230> soft<00:00:43.230> padding<00:00:44.120> which<00:00:45.120> prevents

other important aspects of this bucket
if<00:01:05.100> we<00:01:05.220> look<00:01:05.339> at<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> front<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.119> you'll<00:01:06.689> see

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
if we look at the front of it you'll see

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.170 
if we look at the front of it you'll see
that<00:01:07.140> I've<00:01:07.290> got<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:08.270> guide<00:01:09.290> which<00:01:10.290> my<00:01:10.850> rod<00:01:11.850> fits

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
that I've got a guide which my rod fits

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.780 
that I've got a guide which my rod fits
into<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.840> lot<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.830> people<00:01:14.130> don't<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.520> using

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
into a lot of people don't like using

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.399 
into a lot of people don't like using
this<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> very<00:01:15.750> specific<00:01:16.049> reason

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
this but I have a very specific reason

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.789 
this but I have a very specific reason
why<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.950> use<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.930> if<00:01:18.930> I'm<00:01:19.140> fighting<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.650> fish

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
why I use this if I'm fighting a fish

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.350 
why I use this if I'm fighting a fish
and<00:01:20.009> I'm<00:01:20.070> fighting<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.759> very<00:01:21.000> long<00:01:21.299> time

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
and I'm fighting it for a very long time

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.260 
and I'm fighting it for a very long time
I<00:01:21.900> can<00:01:22.170> actually<00:01:22.350> use<00:01:22.710> turn<00:01:23.220> my<00:01:23.430> back<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
I can actually use turn my back on the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.050 
I can actually use turn my back on the
ocean<00:01:24.630> put<00:01:25.350> my<00:01:25.470> head<00:01:25.770> my<00:01:25.950> rod<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.580> here<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.000> i

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
ocean put my head my rod in here and i

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.910 
ocean put my head my rod in here and i
can<00:01:27.090> actually<00:01:27.420> let<00:01:27.750> take<00:01:28.409> all<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> pressure

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
can actually let take all the pressure

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.950 
can actually let take all the pressure
off<00:01:29.100> my<00:01:29.430> arms<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.939> actually<00:01:30.600> have<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> rod

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
off my arms and actually have the rod

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.719 
off my arms and actually have the rod
going<00:01:31.229> over<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> back<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.829> my<00:01:31.920> shoulder<00:01:32.100> this

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
going over the back of my shoulder this

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.090 
going over the back of my shoulder this
prevents<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.450> rod<00:01:33.930> from<00:01:34.200> flipping<00:01:34.619> out<00:01:34.920> of

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
prevents the rod from flipping out of

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.510 
prevents the rod from flipping out of
the<00:01:35.189> bucket<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.680> not<00:01:37.680> being<00:01:37.860> able<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.189> hold<00:01:38.340> it

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the bucket and not being able to hold it

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.710 
the bucket and not being able to hold it
upright<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:41.009> other<00:01:41.400> advantages<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.479> is

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
upright the other advantages to this is

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.950 
upright the other advantages to this is
is<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.439> when<00:01:44.070> your<00:01:44.280> rod<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.840> your<00:01:45.840> new

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
is that when your rod is your new

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.179 
is that when your rod is your new
fighting<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.380> big<00:01:46.530> fish<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.710> you've<00:01:46.920> got<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.040> lot

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
fighting a big fish in you've got a lot

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.280 
fighting a big fish in you've got a lot
of<00:01:47.220> pressure<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.610> your<00:01:47.790> rod<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.240> actually<00:01:49.140> in

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
of pressure on your rod is actually in

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.350 
of pressure on your rod is actually in
suspension<00:01:49.920> because<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:50.880> actually<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.329> a

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
suspension because it's actually on a

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.330 
suspension because it's actually on a
swivel<00:01:51.600> basis<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.590> suspension<00:01:53.130> so

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
swivel basis it's in suspension so

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.280 
swivel basis it's in suspension so
you're<00:01:53.490> not<00:01:53.670> putting<00:01:53.939> any<00:01:54.180> pressure<00:01:54.390> directly

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
you're not putting any pressure directly

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.709 
you're not putting any pressure directly
on<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> back<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.310> bucket<00:01:56.460> if<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.540> put

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
on the back of the bucket if you put

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.969 
on the back of the bucket if you put
pressure<00:01:57.990> directly<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.619> back<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.799> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
pressure directly on the back of the
