00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.530 
in the early days of microbiology it
when<00:02:15.080> research<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.710> enzymes<00:02:16.040> came<00:02:16.850> along<00:02:17.210> if

when research and enzymes came along if

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.750 
when research and enzymes came along if
it<00:02:17.750> suddenly<00:02:17.990> became<00:02:18.380> possible<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.950> take<00:02:19.130> bits
