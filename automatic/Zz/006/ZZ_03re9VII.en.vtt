00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
color to be totally opaque so I'm adding

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:20.730 
color to be totally opaque so I'm adding
a<00:02:04.920> second<00:02:05.280> coat

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.050 

some<00:02:21.740> people<00:02:22.010> like<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.190> add<00:02:22.370> top<00:02:22.610> coat<00:02:22.819> at<00:02:22.940> this

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
some people like to add top coat at this

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.059 
some people like to add top coat at this
point<00:02:23.330> but<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:23.840> think<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.170> two<00:02:24.319> polishes<00:02:24.800> blend

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
point but I think the two polishes blend

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.010 
point but I think the two polishes blend
better<00:02:25.310> without<00:02:25.580> top<00:02:25.910> coat<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:26.450> I'll<00:02:26.720> save<00:02:26.930> it

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
better without top coat so I'll save it

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.020 
better without top coat so I'll save it
for<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.319> end<00:02:27.400> make<00:02:28.400> sure<00:02:28.430> your<00:02:28.700> nails<00:02:28.880> are
