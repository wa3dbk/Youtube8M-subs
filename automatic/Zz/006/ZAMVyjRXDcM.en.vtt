00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.469
 in this lesson we will discover the array tool which comes 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.860
 used in 3d max study to arrange all the columns in prefixed rows 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.149
 objects that we want within a scene 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:16.299
 we are going to create a box through a twilight panel under the panel already in the voice 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.249
 standard primitives command box 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:23.640
 now maximum I love the scene let's assume we want it in braids of 

00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:28.109
 each projects in both planar and three-dimensional directions 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.659
 this is possible thanks to the array tool 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.120
 to start this alignment we have to position ourselves in the menu tours e 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.450
 click on array 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.130
 these rules edit windows that appear divided into 4 parts 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.530
 the first we see immediately in the lower right corner of the preview 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.920
 the preview of the final result of our transformation 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.260
 simply go to preview to keep it pressed 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.320
 as we can see of defolt 3d studio max imposes values ​​as far as 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.350
 regards the transformation and arrangement in space of this type 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.930
 of objects 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.530
 3d studio max provides us with three types of transformation that it is 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.530
 You can apply to all existing objects 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.859
 in this part of the window 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:20.419
 we find written array transformation word and coordinate es 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.530
 subsequently under incremental 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.630
 in this area we can go to increase the distance beginning y of the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.480
 our existing objects within the scene 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.260
 increasing the distance in x of the horizontal challenges in this direction 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
 just like you can see from the preview 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.030
 if instead we increase the direction in y here then we get challenges 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.580
 regular but they were among them 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.910
 of an extremely precise quantity that is then gradually assigned 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.910
 all other challenges next 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.020
 the same thing we cannot do even with regards to the notation for 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.370
 regarding the scale 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.040
 which is the transformation of the dimensions of each of these objects 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.229
 at auction in the scene to then be able to climb in one direction rather than 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.519
 in another in a regular and precise manner 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.519
 along all the rows with the columns we see 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:18.519
 the type of object can be set widely and then set 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.299
 be it a couple 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.869
 yes it is an instance 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:26.139
 and therefore dependent on a parent object so that all objects children 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:31.699
 suffer the same identical modifications as the parent element 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:33.570
 or even a reference 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.400
 designers the ones generated by a parent element but which can be 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.330
 modify liking in their sub-characteristics but not in those 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.359
 main 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:47.260
 a practical example is to decide the width length and the height of 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:51.769
 this box transferring all the others but to another of these 'objects' of 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.259
 children paste signal modifier separate 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.889
 just dedicated to this lily object 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.769
 in the third part dedicated to the hawai of mail chance we can go to decide 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.339
 whether to have a count of 5 only in one direction 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:12.690
 and therefore a single dimension or increase and have this count 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.860
 and then increase the rows and columns of objects 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.819
 in the two planar dimensions 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.689
 or again by increasing the count even in the third dimension here and there 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:26.089
 development in height properties as we can see in this case 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.559
 we can also use the values ​​to increase it 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:34.789
 it is clear that in 2d we will have to assign an increment only to y for 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:37.789
 look for spacers along this direction 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:43.569
 as for the 3d we will have spacer in the z direction they get 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.099
 vertical development just as we see from this value in these parameters 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.099
 it is possible to reset all the parameters to start the setting from the beginning 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.009
 our array maybe simplifying then working faster 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.599
 once we have defined the transformation in the case of our liking we can 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.749
 confirm by simply pressing the key you have 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:10.479
 thus obtaining the desired result, many objects arranged in rows or columns 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:13.510
 adjust the two spatial dimensions together in three dimensions 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:16.829
 just like we have seen before 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.590
 this type of editing can only and exclusively be viewed with 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.479
 the array panel in view below the scene 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.339
 basically during the transformation with the open array panel I can't 

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:31.949
 intervene in the scene for human use, let alone go to 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.479
 select the objects that have been arrayed 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.299
 This will only be possible once I have created my final array
