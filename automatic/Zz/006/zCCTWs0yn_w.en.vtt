00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.330
 hello welcome to another video tutorial 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:09.700
 today we are going to make a chain of 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:12.870
 hearts we're going to need some scissors 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.870
 a pen or pencil 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:19.640
 and a4 size paper 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.390
 what are we going to cut, let's start 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:34.690
 let's fold it in half lengthwise 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:37.690
 [Music] 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.690
 Y 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.309
 we open it and we already have this line 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.010
 marked that is where we're going to 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.469
 trim 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.469
 [Music] 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.910
 we are going to keep a part or if 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.120
 we want to make it longer the chain 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.330
 we can stick with a little bit of glue 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:11.530
 the two parties to show you the process 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.330
 I'm going to do it with one of them 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.790
 so we take this part 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.460
 and we are going to bend it 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:26.709
 A) Yes 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.709
 [Music] 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.150
 now we take this side to this other of 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.150
 here 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:42.990
 [Music] 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.700
 and we repeat again 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:52.810
 from this side towards elche 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.810
 [Music] 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.950
 great now we have this part 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.950
 open and this part closed 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.650
 let's do half of our 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.590
 figures in this case a heart 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.410
 A) Yes 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.380
 we go there 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.380
 we draw it the best we can 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.470
 A) Yes 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.730
 this part will be where they will be united 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.670
 the little hearts 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:32.000
 and this part and here will be the other 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:35.030
 half of the heart so let's cut 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.930
 start to count down the line that 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.259
 we have marked 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.259
 [Music] 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.670
 uy 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.900
 and we leave as you see this part without 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:01.580
 cut 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:04.640
 [Music] 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.270
 this part we see ourselves accountable then 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.270
 now we open 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.510
 and we have our chain of 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.430
 little hearts 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.630
 I hope you liked it 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.580
 this has been all 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.160
