00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.220
 How many times have you heard here in the series? 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.050
 Crazy in Japan I go to the question that 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.300
 madness you would do to see the helm of the 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.310
 other side of the world because it is reginald 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.289
 answered and his sentence was chosen by 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.369
 and by the powerful 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.920
 better among many 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.620
 so he won the long dreamed trip I 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.470
 that I would sell it would 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:46.729
 my eyes because the corinthians I watch 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:50.030
 With your heart to tell you it's up to you. 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:51.290
 Funny, I was at the bank, was I? 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.580
 my wife 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.750
 and then when they called me and told me to 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.309
 who is that goal, and said so 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.189
 how is your passport to the fÃ¡bio 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.600
 I told you, it's cool, it was then it fell 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.420
 your heart how it is offering 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.610
 I'm already starting to hit harder. 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.110
 I knew of the all-powerful promotion of 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.530
 hand along with the bid 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.420
 and then I wanted to scream and 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.380
 Wife gave to me, she said so in crying. 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.680
 and screams but she put her hand on mine 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.840
 She continues to feel her heart. 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.420
 pulsating stronger ours was a 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.180
 very big happiness and I wanted to have 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.500
 screamed at the time but at the request of my 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.500
 yelling wife wife 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.560
 but I only went to sleep one and a half in the morning 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.030
 when left bare when it left my 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.820
 name on site 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.010
 and it was already one o'clock in the morning I posted 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.670
 facebook was already looking I saw that it is not 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.760
 prank call 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:02.550
 Now I'm going to sleep, people are quiet. 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.040
 They still remain one 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.450
 very great happiness you get by 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.149
 example sometimes I 'm walking on the street 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.880
 with my son was even counting now 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.620
 there there my son he 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.840
 I look at him, he 's laughing around laughing 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.560
 I just look at him and he's faithful. 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.590
 It was only I go to Japan, and I believe 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.950
 He smiles all the time, it's a happiness. 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.739
 very big, I also our in the service 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.530
 name to the question and that's when 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.220
 cool, congratulations like this and it's been like this 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.220
 my day to day 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.490
 My poor son will miss the collation. 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.740
 grade 8th grade d is leaving 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.480
 behind degree collation 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.730
 it was a business that was not even waiting for 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.340
 also but the degree collation will be a 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.740
 day 15 and we hope to be there in the day 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.840
 16 in the final 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.030
 so you have to get there, we play 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.430
 these things are not collation and grade 8 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.340
 His series could tell us there 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.820
 together but I can not change it, right? 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.820
 there's no way 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:18.709
 the security year he is that different, right? 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:23.569
 the Corinthian sock I always say that it is 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:26.510
 different and I consider myself to be different 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.970
 the Corinthian or not as I put it 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.340
 in the phrase he watches many things with 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.709
 the heart has no Corinthian way he 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.690
 stop doing it because he's in a 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.280
 party it can a party but you can 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.340
 make sure he has a radinho 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.810
 Or he's asking someone how it is. 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.280
 what's the corinthians game if it's on 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.139
 same time 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.209
 Sometimes you even let some of you do 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:49.310
 things because of this is not because of 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:54.970
 because of corinthians 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:57.049
 we live like this, we live a lot 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.209
 to cheer for the Corinthians we 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:02.049
 ceases to do many things like 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.049
 people put their foot behind
