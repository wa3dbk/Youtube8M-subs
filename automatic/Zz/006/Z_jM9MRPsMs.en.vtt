flex the tire lower limb and pull it
backwards<00:01:04.320> okay<00:01:05.040> yo<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.309> flexion<00:01:05.840> superficial

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
backwards okay yo in flexion superficial

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.899 
backwards okay yo in flexion superficial
does<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.770> same<00:01:08.010> thing<00:01:08.280> except<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.760> doesn't

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
does the same thing except it doesn't

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.789 
does the same thing except it doesn't
attach<00:01:09.180> nearly<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:09.630> far<00:01:09.810> down<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.350> touches

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
attach nearly as far down to touches

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.950 
attach nearly as far down to touches
along<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> pasture<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:13.640> what<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.790> see<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.299> that

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
along the pasture so what we see is that

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.170 
along the pasture so what we see is that
throughout<00:01:16.680> cyclic<00:01:17.400> concussion<00:01:17.970> or

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
and bring the limb back forward what

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.490 
and bring the limb back forward what
ends<00:01:25.590> up<00:01:25.680> happening<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:27.570> tendon

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
ends up happening is that this tendon

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.190 
ends up happening is that this tendon
structure<00:01:29.220> mainly<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.299> superficial<00:01:30.810> gets

structure mainly the superficial gets

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.289 
structure mainly the superficial gets
over<00:01:31.560> stretched<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.280> when<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:32.970> gets<00:01:33.060> over

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
they will nod and they will show you

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.969 
they will nod and they will show you
that<00:02:05.310> there<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.759> tremendous<00:02:06.439> gate<00:02:07.439> deficit

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
that there is a tremendous gate deficit

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.609

bow tenant
and<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.470> reason<00:02:12.740> why<00:02:12.830> is<00:02:13.010> because<00:02:13.070> it<00:02:13.490> creates

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
and the reason why is because it creates

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.030 
and the reason why is because it creates
quite<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.060> bit<00:02:14.210> of<00:02:14.300> pain<00:02:14.480> on<00:02:15.170> one<00:02:15.230> extension<00:02:15.920> the

limb when they go to to place it on an

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.430 
limb when they go to to place it on an
extension<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.510> if<00:02:20.510> these<00:02:20.810> fibers<00:02:21.260> do<00:02:21.410> not

extension and if these fibers do not
quite<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:21.920> bit<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.340> of<00:02:22.430> course<00:02:22.610> it's<00:02:22.820> enlarged

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
quite a bit and of course it's enlarged

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.080 
quite a bit and of course it's enlarged
and<00:02:23.510> splain<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.140> sore<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.380> hot<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:25.100> visually

probably<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:27.140> know<00:02:27.230> just<00:02:27.290> uncomfortable<00:02:28.100> to

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
probably you know just uncomfortable to

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.080 
probably you know just uncomfortable to
them<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.440> clinically<00:02:30.440> they<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.700> know<00:02:31.790> like<00:02:32.060> I

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
them and clinically they you know like I

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.080 
them and clinically they you know like I
said<00:02:32.209> it<00:02:32.360> creates<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.720> tremendous<00:02:33.140> amount<00:02:33.320> of

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
said it creates a tremendous amount of

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.390 
said it creates a tremendous amount of
you<00:02:35.090> know<00:02:35.480> discomfort<00:02:36.290> M<00:02:36.440> so<00:02:36.860> therefore<00:02:37.100> they

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
you know discomfort M so therefore they

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:49.970 
you know discomfort M so therefore they
are<00:02:37.430> lands

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:04:16.810 

you

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.110 

the<00:04:17.270> reason<00:04:17.540> we<00:04:17.660> call<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:17.930> bow<00:04:18.170> is<00:04:18.230> because<00:04:18.650> it

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
the reason we call a bow is because it

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.710 
the reason we call a bow is because it
big<00:04:19.269> around<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:20.109> large<00:04:20.440> really<00:04:21.280> really

big around the large really really
extremely<00:04:22.720> obvious<00:04:23.530> bow<00:04:24.220> Tenon's<00:04:24.760> are<00:04:25.030> really

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
extremely obvious bow Tenon's are really

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.600 
extremely obvious bow Tenon's are really
really<00:04:25.930> enlargements<00:04:26.710> of<00:04:26.800> this<00:04:26.949> belly<00:04:27.280> of<00:04:27.520> a

really enlargements of this belly of a

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.629 
really enlargements of this belly of a

sometimes as far as the fetlock and this

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:48.810 
sometimes as far as the fetlock and this
is<00:04:36.760> what<00:04:37.060> they<00:04:37.210> call<00:04:37.419> a<00:04:37.960> large<00:04:38.949> bow<00:04:47.820> well

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
is what they call a large bow well

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.000 
is what they call a large bow well
likely<00:04:49.540> use<00:04:49.870> over<00:04:50.350> those<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.830> major

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
likely use over those the major

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.790 
likely use over those the major
complications<00:04:51.880> that<00:04:51.940> occur<00:04:52.139> due<00:04:53.139> to<00:04:53.169> about

complications that occur due to about
tenon<00:04:54.190> are<00:04:54.310> obviously<00:04:54.729> a<00:04:55.060> lack<00:04:55.449> of<00:04:55.690> function

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
tenon are obviously a lack of function

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.710 
tenon are obviously a lack of function
of<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:57.220> lamb<00:04:57.430> lack<00:04:57.729> of<00:04:57.940> extension<00:04:58.510> of<00:04:58.600> the

of the lamb lack of extension of the
limb<00:05:00.150> lamest<00:05:01.150> so<00:05:01.300> therefore<00:05:01.690> lack<00:05:01.930> of
