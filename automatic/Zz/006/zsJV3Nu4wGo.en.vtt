00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:07.319
 besides that the tutorial goes there 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.389
 Blue 2 pedal board to make for 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.269
 make memory banks avail them 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.900
 next I have picked the number 4 for 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.900
 as base sound 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.490
 as you can see these have no 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.529
 effect at this time he's going to put you 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.480
 a delay effect more here where at 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.490
 first button here will be the 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.670
 defects here all effect is done here 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:35.030
 I'm going to irak, which says delay 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:39.250
 and I'm going to apply the law here you can 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.250
 return to modify what the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.500
 if it can magically all that is time 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.880
 of the delay 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.550
 as he was half slow until a little 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.510
 plus 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.850
 it has to do a lot also with what 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.800
 what you want here, instead, it is 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:03.170
 back all explain more or less is the 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.360
 delay sequence the delay is maintained 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:11.210
 back down here if you download everything to a 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.860
 10 is lost faster now here 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.890
 can do many things like 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.960
 harmonics and it becomes a little clearer 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.550
 the sound if you want to save when it's 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.640
 removing this stage means that you are 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:27.259
 running a delay or a river is not 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.990
 well to store this type of effect 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.149
 I can do it say storage postponing 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.369
 storage and here you put on the screen the 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.500
 steel that you can store in this bank 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.360
 in 1 in 23 I have 7 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.470
 available I will save in 7 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.070
 then he saves you in 7 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.680
 and if you want it to sound are that effect 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.200
 consequently the others return to 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.900
 take first and go to play down 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.210
 play in play you will notice all-in-ones club 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.550
 previously recorded effects of neon 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.940
 of 77 and you'll see 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.940
 to 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.500
 ah 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.070
 and that's it and I hope it serves you 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.810
 of help and if you have any problems with 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.920
 some effect you want some other detail 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.920
 Miami would be chao
