00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.130
 Greetings, we have three o'clock in the morning 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.230
 and i dont know if it is im 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.590
 background can see who is watching one 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.940
 big street I was just still 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.929
 train at mcfit a bit the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.929
 pumped 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.590
 yes I had in any case again a 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.590
 I will train you a bit 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.020
 wanted to show steelbook and that too 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.050
 Atlas spreads when it sometimes 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.320
 a bit dark, but a lot of light 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.010
 is not here on the street anymore 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.330
 I think I have a bit of that 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.559
 wrong colors taken position 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:47.080
 sunlight eight cloud atlas i have to 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.300
 confess that was one of the very few 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.910
 Blind purchases that I once dared 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.460
 I usually do not buy films 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.820
 I do not know yet 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.949
 cloud atlas the dealbook was for 12 euro 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.100
 99 I believe quite without a follower 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:07.900
 new release steelbook 12 99 handle 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.790
 summer to yes and then the thing is yes 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.130
 not exactly the case is about the 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.850
 170 minutes I think just over 170 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:20.170
 minutes and therefore demands a lot 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.299
 I have to get down at cloud atlas 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.310
 but I already had something to say 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.500
 problems i was maybe not 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.320
 completely ready for the movie because 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.859
 it takes a lot of rest around the movie 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.719
 watch 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:33.969
 You can not even do that on the side 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:38.350
 that was my mistake i had one 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:41.920
 Laptop on the lap of the film tells 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.329
 stories from five time zones but 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.729
 all are linked together 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.770
 somehow or repeats itself the life 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.979
 different people to different 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.759
 times and there are always certain 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.280
 links 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.590
 For example, I do not know 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.759
 well in 1800 but that was someone 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.119
 a book about his journey and that flows 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.749
 then someone else 100 years later 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.640
 or so it does not remember exactly 

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:11.290
 so and in this just discovered in it 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.939
 certain similarities to his life 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.209
 and so it's all kinda 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:18.849
 bit linked and all that too 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.379
 I really have to discover too 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.099
 you should read the film through 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.750
 watch two three times and at 175 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.129
 It's not that easy 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.310
 I will definitely go again 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.450
 to rest for the first time 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.810
 I had my problems so the film 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.049
 Trace and mosquitoes are back 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.760
 road and therefore times now look 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.920
 yes, anyway, I had the depot 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.819
 I want you now completely 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.970
 show it for a short time 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.680
 the poor as it is now slowly 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.859
 a bit heavier 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.280
 yes, there we have only that, of course 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:57.040
 Boxed steelbook to cloud atlas that 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.829
 after all, that would be an unboxing without that 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.859
 unpack the actual and therefore lays 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.930
 I'll get started right away I have to 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.030
 but correct first 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.700
 since we have no stories in cloud atlas 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.099
 five but six time zones 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.829
 get told this but will not 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.949
 linear does not say one after the other 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:20.019
 but it is criss-crossing 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.739
 between the stories back and forth 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.930
 bound 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:27.459
 The six stories look something like this 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.879
 from 1850 a deadly notary friend 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.940
 with a blind passenger at 1930 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:37.780
 a man becomes an assistant at one almost 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.510
 forgotten composers 1970 one 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.269
 Journalist reveals a scandal 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.150
 and in our day, there is a publisher 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.790
 in an old people's home and experienced there the 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.150
 Hell then in the future some clones 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.419
 Worker becomes the leader of one 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.609
 revolution 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:57.010
 and then there is the sixth 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.439
 time zone which after the big one 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.109
 apocalypse plays in which one 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:04.180
 goat herder with an important mission 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.159
 commissioned in all stories 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.989
 the same actors appear 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.819
 their roles are always very 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.129
 So different are seeing play 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.629
 a history of the main character are 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.539
 she in the other only a small one 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.820
 Nebenmodell as already mentioned are these 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.070
 all stories somehow 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.050
 linked and they also repeat themselves 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.540
 if you do not look at first 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.970
 always the same cloud is atlas 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.510
 really no easy food and required 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.670
 from a lot of attention so 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.710
 the movie probably its like that 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.660
 had and difficulties in the cinema on 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.690
 flop in spite of big names like tom 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.180
 hanks hall berry or hugh grant that 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.950
 amazon steelbook which is extremely cheap 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.140
 structurally, power became one 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.390
 really good impression even if it 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.520
 rather simply designed comes along 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.160
 not so nice is the attachment 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.040
 the pub flyers have been about it 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.990
 I also complain to some of them 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.940
 had a little difficulty this 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.320
 to remove or its 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.090
 leftovers that were still on the style well then 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.580
 I 'll take a look and see that 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.490
 film this days again with the 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:17.780
 give necessary rest 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:17.780
 that will not be really cool 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.220
 in the middle of the street in the middle of the 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.520
 Street 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:29.550
 and here are the bakers already at the bug in 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.650
 tackle the breaks and the whole 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:36.170
 Street 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:38.540
 but now I have in here and well 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.400
 Today are good 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.680
 at least that was a small one 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.949
 unboxing so a few days 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.949
 ciao
