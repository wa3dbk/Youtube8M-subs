now I know everything I need to know
about<00:03:53.160> my<00:03:53.250> character<00:03:53.459> okay<00:03:54.060> but<00:03:54.209> what<00:03:54.329> about

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
about my character okay but what about

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.360 
about my character okay but what about
it<00:03:54.720> kind<00:03:54.989> of<00:03:55.019> seems<00:03:55.260> like<00:03:55.350> it's<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.620> reverse<00:03:55.920> for

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
it kind of seems like it's a reverse for

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.009 
it kind of seems like it's a reverse for
Damon<00:03:56.549> this<00:03:56.820> season<00:03:57.150> because<00:03:57.450> he's<00:03:57.780> usually

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
Damon this season because he's usually

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.020 
Damon this season because he's usually
kind<00:03:58.380> of<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.560> bad<00:03:58.739> boy<00:03:58.769> for<00:03:59.670> lack<00:03:59.820> of<00:03:59.850> a<00:04:00.000> better

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
kind of a bad boy for lack of a better

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.990 
kind of a bad boy for lack of a better
term<00:04:00.209> but<00:04:00.780> now<00:04:00.930> he's<00:04:01.920> in<00:04:02.130> a<00:04:02.220> relationship<00:04:02.820> and

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000
