00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.770
 and pieira reyes opinou is bel sport 10/8 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.770
 well from here and today I'm recording a video 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.960
 from skyrim to you 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.519
 and here is Lydian and I already pursue a 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.010
 here in the main quest that is 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.439
 the character we here in the kitchen 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.860
 island in the last video does not show the hair 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:42.050
 It's bronze and I thought it was beautiful. 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:48.030
 literally as beautiful as in the 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:52.829
 Last video I posted today I did not 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:56.910
 I heard about the internet there. 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:02.270
 I left with the then I'm using this 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:06.390
 here two-handed mattel I'm 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.920
 nickname of war peniche but I 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.939
 I'm going to use this here because this is 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:17.640
 better and better to go back and now 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:21.180
 including the other over it and 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.909
 today is not quite a detonator that is not 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.950
 in the face my good face again today 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.950
 it's not quite a detonation it's going to be another one 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:37.790
 It's a tip for you that's how to 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:42.360
 the end is faster because everything goes 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:45.030
 know before it was nan dagger and not 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:54.590
 It works over that business of the dagger 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:54.590
 now what happens to them have changed 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:03.899
 business to my anp system 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.280
 ford and is now for item value not per 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.280
 amount from 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.239
 I've been recording live. 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.120
 so sometimes I'm going to give a little sleep yes 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:19.120
 because live I have to pay 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:23.230
 attention in the game and pay attention to what 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:27.730
 I say but it's for you to come here 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.950

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.319

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:41.170
 here my game is translated so no 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.980
 I remember now the English name of the head 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:49.870
 if I take only the pope in the notice them 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:55.890
 and see that other one there and I did not 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:03:00.160
 It's a lot in the quest I'm still in 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:04.750
 in the business from there on our lips it 's for 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:09.010
 get the holo to give shows to the I do not 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.440
 I remember but it is and I'm showing here 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.970
 For you, because I think so. 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.739
 important and I'll do it now 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:22.180
 because I'm going to need the parma out to 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.620

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.290

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.970
 so it's a machine I'll play a 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.859
 little third person because the 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:36.760
 he had a trap he forgot 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:39.430

 It was here now. 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:08.590
 There's going to be a bandit boss here and I think 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.520
 that two more thugs and one is a magician then 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.290
 and do not come alone, you 're in the 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:19.030
 game start does not sell at least 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:21.640
 ice cream father dies then I'm going to die I 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.610

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:35.110
 run I 'm running I 'm running 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:40.810
 Not really in one of them. 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:44.820
 the boar hunt in the media will deal 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:50.820
 with India the coast panel that kill 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:05:04.180
 I come here and I get the luch here 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:05:08.650
 asking is it here, this is it going 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:22.630
 have this little book here transmute 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:34.420
 ore is the quick little book 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:39.720
 so now the mother has not a smelter but 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.720
 I'll explain what you have to do. 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:57.400
 year after year does not learn not to transmute 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:58.560
 Ore you come here and you use it has 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.190
 11 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:05.550
 is a silver iron ore in the hand in the 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:10.080
 do not invent here . 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:12.060
 silver iron and only I have here 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.030
 my image of legal death 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:21.630
 hello added gold ore I come 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:23.400
 here normal and now we are going to wear jewelry 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:27.060
 here o 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.010
 it was supposed to be that gold taste more 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:34.169
 I do not have Israel, you have to forget 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:37.080
 mother more then race around the maximum 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:40.200
 gold rings you can get 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:43.080
 can do this here will give our 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:46.650
 experience also because the value of it is 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:52.850
 high and it's all depending on the value 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:56.370
 example here on the gold necklace it stops 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:07:01.050
 120 but it's only one here in the gold ring 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:04.050
 is 2 out of 75 which gives 150 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:06.300
 if I'm not mistaken f150 even I think it is 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.850
 it's 150 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:16.020
 then it is to give more experience to you 

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:19.050
 So, do not forget to come here and get the 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:25.200
 little book there is the looks are good guys 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:30.150

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:33.120
