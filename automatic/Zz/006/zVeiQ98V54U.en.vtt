anyways guys this step is honestly one

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.550 
anyways guys this step is honestly one
of<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.849> hardest<00:00:30.449> now<00:00:30.810> as<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.990> can<00:00:31.080> see<00:00:31.140> an<00:00:31.349> on

of the hardest now as you can see an on
screen<00:00:31.920> right<00:00:32.489> now<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> bunch<00:00:33.870> of

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
screen right now we have a bunch of

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.660 
screen right now we have a bunch of
numbers<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.040> first<00:00:35.370> room

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
numbers and this is in the first room

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.880 
numbers and this is in the first room
that<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.969> open<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.079> go<00:00:37.170> back<00:00:37.500> here

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
that you open you have to go back here

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.340 
that you open you have to go back here
for<00:00:38.040> step<00:00:38.280> number<00:00:38.340> 10<00:00:38.910> now<00:00:39.480> all<00:00:39.690> these<00:00:39.899> numbers

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
for step number 10 now all these numbers

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.709 
for step number 10 now all these numbers
correlate<00:00:40.950> with<00:00:41.430> something<00:00:41.969> different<00:00:42.540> so

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
correlate with something different so

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.690 
correlate with something different so
what<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.930> did<00:00:43.050> was<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.800> made<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:44.010> guide<00:00:44.309> for<00:00:44.579> you

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
what I did was I made a guide for you

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.850 
what I did was I made a guide for you
guys<00:00:44.879> now<00:00:45.180> keep<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.570> mind<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.440> numbers

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
guys now keep in mind that the numbers

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.979 
guys now keep in mind that the numbers
are<00:00:47.070> going<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.280> be<00:00:47.370> different<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:48.000> top<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.690> you

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
are going to be different on top for you

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.900 
are going to be different on top for you
when<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.770> are<00:00:49.890> doing<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.309> they<00:00:50.550> could<00:00:50.789> be

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
when you are doing this they could be

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.310 
when you are doing this they could be
the<00:00:51.030> same<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:51.899> highly<00:00:52.079> unlikely

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
the same but it's highly unlikely

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.950 
the same but it's highly unlikely
because<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:53.100> randomized<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.390> as<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.840> can

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
because it's randomized so as you can

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.170 
because it's randomized so as you can
see<00:00:55.170> guys<00:00:55.379> these<00:00:55.860> numbers<00:00:56.370> correlate<00:00:56.850> with

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
see guys these numbers correlate with

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.689 
see guys these numbers correlate with
different<00:00:57.600> things<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.440> numbers<00:00:59.039> all<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.579> way

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
different things the numbers all the way

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.290 
different things the numbers all the way
on<00:00:59.910> the<00:00:59.940> left<00:01:00.059> cover<00:01:01.050> for<00:01:01.680> XO<00:01:02.280> slam<00:01:02.670> kills<00:01:03.059> so

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
on the left cover for XO slam kills so

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.329 
on the left cover for XO slam kills so
the<00:01:03.390> top<00:01:03.660> number<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.229> how<00:01:04.710> many<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:05.010> actually

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the top number is how many you actually

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.980 
the top number is how many you actually
need<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> get<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.360> 9<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.869> this

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
need to get so you have to get 9 in this

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.920 
need to get so you have to get 9 in this
circumstance<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.369> have<00:01:08.580> one<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.299> far<00:01:09.600> so

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
circumstance and you have one so far so

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.450 
circumstance and you have one so far so
what<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.229> have<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.340> get

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
what you have to do is you have to get

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.399 
what you have to do is you have to get
that<00:01:11.610> number<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.150> match<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.780> if<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.229> go<00:01:13.380> over

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
that number to match and if you go over

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.980 
that number to match and if you go over
it's<00:01:13.950> okay<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:14.580> not<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.790> big<00:01:15.030> deal<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.689> next

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
points not a big deal I recommend doing

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.929 
points not a big deal I recommend doing
that<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.350> have<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.560> do<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.860> as<00:01:38.040> well<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
that you have to do that as well and the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.510 
that you have to do that as well and the
last<00:01:39.210> thing<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.930> need<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.350> get<00:01:40.530> nine<00:01:41.009> kills

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
last thing is you need to get nine kills

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.100 
last thing is you need to get nine kills
which<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.000> obviously<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.450> easiest<00:01:42.930> thing

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
which is obviously the easiest thing

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.350
