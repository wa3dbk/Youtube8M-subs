00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.040
 Good afternoon, dear submarine hunters 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.130
 in this video plot I want to show how 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.340
 install grandfather and other lenses for masks 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.380
 for spearfishing and diving 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.440
 This is the case if you have eyesight 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.730
 deviated from the norm 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:23.180
 I will give an example on the mask 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:26.279
 Allen died and put did not eat 2 diopters -3 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:30.080
 j3 themselves are diopter glass 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.300
 as on the glasses along the contour of this mask 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.980
 dioptries are only suitable for regional 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.739
 oil makers i.e. if this 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.110
 mask omer allen then it fits 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.690
 glass is immoral no other 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.390
 fit the same way if you buy 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.480
 mask and in the future you plan to put 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.980
 glass you need to immediately ask 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.710
 are the glasses replaced in this mask and 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:58.250
 I 'll go and if they are there because 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:00.960
 doctrine and glass is not easy to find 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.350
 they are not very widely represented on 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.780
 the market 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.659
 see something that is not such a frequent product and 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:12.560
 so we take the mask checked on 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:14.580
 tightness mask not shed 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.950
 plastic tool 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.530
 screwdriver we have here on the contour 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:27.350
 plastic frame and we are from the nose 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.329
 click between the frame and the outer contour 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:38.610
 so that it was visible show 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:43.729
 crack this operation under k 0 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.729
 and that way 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:02:07.090
 done from the nose and the following we do 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:02:07.090
 from above these are many 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.269
 here we have an outer frame 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.269
 gently pushing the glass and 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.890
 extract from the mask here we have the usual 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:40.940
 we also make glass with the second one 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:49.480
 wringing wounds alone with glass from nose 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:49.480
 together gaga and in the third 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.870
 in the same way gently remove the glass 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.640
 fluorine now we got a mask without 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.050
 glasses 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.990
 insert in the training pick up the details 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.820
 I will cut dill we can impose 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.980
 neatly so she twisted me 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.600
 because if the skewed face is 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.060
 live her skewed she will 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.980
 breathability that is, it passes 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.650
 air it is not tight and afterwards 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:42.910
 you can skip water and paste 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:46.240
 frame so it looks frame 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.370
 has four clamp top right left 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.090
 and the bottom here are all the clamps should be 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.560
 latched 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.560
 and second day 3 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:15.190
 all 4 clips and snapped the last stage 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.310
 what we do is checking for tightness 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.580
 inserted 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:24.800
 lenses mask does not siphon 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:27.350
 accordingly we can day 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.250
 enjoy your favorite underwater business 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.840
 hunt gave us 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.840
 or just snorkeling
