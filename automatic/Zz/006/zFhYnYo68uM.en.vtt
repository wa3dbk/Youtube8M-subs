00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:10.870
 hello everyone i'm hab 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:12.370
 Today I present the asus maps 760 is the 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.209
 last creation 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.130
 asus in double gpu graphics cards and 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.619
 this particular model is possibly 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.580
 one of the cheapest ones I've ever taken 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:27.430
 within this range its never about 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.250
 of a graph with double gpu you can see 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:34.480
 here how are both 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:39.100
 dissipation blocks based 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.379
 in the nvidia 760 ford jeep this 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:46.629
 graphic card costs around 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:50.140
 500 euros 500 550 and with it we have the 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:53.140
 power of two mid-range gpu bus 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.540
 nvidia this makes it as you can see in 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.019
 our complete review that is even 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.870
 faster than a 780 geforce on a 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.420
 geforce titan which are the two graphs 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.970
 of the highest nvidia range with only one 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.550
 gpu 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.540
 it is a plus size card or 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:15.240
 less normal nothing exaggerated any 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.420
 high-end graphics card 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:23.970
 of the orders of the gpu then more or 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:27.149
 minus a similar size with connectivity 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:32.070
 enough to connect three monitors 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:36.000
 in its branch in 3d mode even and it 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.670
 It feeds with two connectors pre of 8 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.090
 contacts 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.619
 consumes around 500 watts with 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.009
 the electrifications can 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.080
 imagine and the truth is that it is one of 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.330
 graphic cards for 500 insurance 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.920
 more powerful than we can find in the 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.960
 market has the virtue apart from its 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.240
 extraordinary design and it supposes a 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.939
 thermal and sound behavior 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.350
 that we can mount two of these graphs 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:08.000
 to get a quad slide gpu 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.679
 as you can see a very interesting graphic 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.900
 I invite you to see our review 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.720
 complete because there you can find 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.750
 performance data and all 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.160
 technical specifications of this new 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.840
 handle card 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.840
 Greetings to all and see you
