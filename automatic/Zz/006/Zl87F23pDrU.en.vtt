and<00:04:14.730> then<00:04:15.060> this<00:04:15.240> time<00:04:15.540> I<00:04:15.990> just<00:04:16.170> kind<00:04:16.709> of<00:04:18.769> placed

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
it with one hand pull the top over so it

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.750 
it with one hand pull the top over so it
ends<00:04:31.650> up<00:04:31.710> being<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:32.100> bullet<00:04:32.340> in<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.550> middle

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
ends up being the bullet in the middle

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.480 
ends up being the bullet in the middle
halfway<00:04:32.970> and<00:04:33.870> see<00:04:34.080> this<00:04:34.230> is<00:04:34.380> where<00:04:35.280> they're

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
halfway and see this is where they're

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.130 
halfway and see this is where they're
not<00:04:35.610> using<00:04:35.970> adhesive<00:04:36.420> makes<00:04:36.600> it<00:04:36.750> a<00:04:36.780> little<00:04:36.930> bit

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
not using adhesive makes it a little bit

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.500 
not using adhesive makes it a little bit
tricky<00:04:37.620> but<00:04:37.860> I<00:04:38.160> think<00:04:38.640> the<00:04:38.850> end<00:04:39.030> result<00:04:39.180> is

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
tricky but I think the end result is

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.530 
tricky but I think the end result is
better<00:04:39.860> yeah<00:04:40.860> pull<00:04:41.160> the<00:04:41.310> sides<00:04:41.640> down<00:04:44.390> once<00:04:45.390> you

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
better yeah pull the sides down once you

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.080 
better yeah pull the sides down once you
get<00:04:45.690> it<00:04:45.780> nice<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.080> tight<00:04:47.070> on<00:04:47.220> there<00:04:47.580> just<00:04:47.760> kind

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
get it nice and tight on there just kind

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.280 
get it nice and tight on there just kind
of<00:04:48.560> manipulate<00:04:49.560> it<00:04:49.740> but<00:04:50.780> not<00:04:51.780> gonna<00:04:52.020> move

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
of manipulate it but not gonna move

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.050
