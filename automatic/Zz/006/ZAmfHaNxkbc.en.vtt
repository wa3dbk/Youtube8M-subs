interesting i notice about this is the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.649 
interesting i notice about this is the
map<00:01:17.070> seems<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.520> be<00:01:17.610> almost<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> playground

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
map seems to be almost like a playground

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.719 
map seems to be almost like a playground
through<00:01:18.840> exosuits<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.799> looks<00:01:20.040> as<00:01:20.220> if<00:01:20.280> it

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
through exosuits like it looks as if it

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.310 
through exosuits like it looks as if it
was<00:01:20.820> built<00:01:21.060> /<00:01:21.270> fatty<00:01:21.600> foods<00:01:21.810> be<00:01:21.900> able<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.110> jump

a<00:03:23.340> pretty<00:03:23.760> much<00:03:23.880> two<00:03:24.180> videos<00:03:24.870> for<00:03:25.200> each<00:03:25.440> map<00:03:25.830> so

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
a pretty much two videos for each map so

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.440 
a pretty much two videos for each map so
each<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.520> formats<00:03:26.910> were<00:03:27.030> already<00:03:27.180> seen

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
each of the formats were already seen

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.940 
each of the formats were already seen
I'll<00:03:27.780> pretty<00:03:28.080> expect<00:03:28.350> them<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.560> cover<00:03:28.710> those

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950

I'll pretty expect them to cover those
two<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:29.430> do<00:03:29.580> I<00:03:29.610> can<00:03:29.790> develop<00:03:29.910> commentary<00:03:30.540> just

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
two so do I can develop commentary just

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.180 
two so do I can develop commentary just
like<00:03:31.020> a<00:03:31.050> walkthrough<00:03:31.560> showing<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:31.920> what's<00:03:32.070> on

like a walkthrough showing you what's on
the<00:03:32.250> map<00:03:32.400> then<00:03:32.790> also<00:03:33.000> just<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.420> straight<00:03:33.720> cut

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
the map then also just a straight cut

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.080 
the map then also just a straight cut
gameplay<00:03:34.470> off<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.770> map<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.100> they'll<00:03:35.760> pray<00:03:35.940> do

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
gameplay off the map and they'll pray do

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.280 
gameplay off the map and they'll pray do
it<00:03:36.150> for<00:03:36.300> this<00:03:36.390> map<00:03:36.600> is<00:03:36.630> also<00:03:36.990> probably<00:03:37.200> the

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
it for this map is also probably the

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.230 
it for this map is also probably the
five<00:03:37.530> Matt's<00:03:37.830> already<00:03:37.950> seen<00:03:38.370> single-player

thousand retweets and obviously this

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.020

advanced warfare trailer for the car but

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.920 
advanced warfare trailer for the car but
not<00:04:23.160> exactly<00:04:23.430> sure<00:04:23.520> if<00:04:23.820> or<00:04:24.360> when<00:04:24.600> he's<00:04:24.810> gonna

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
not exactly sure if or when he's gonna

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.480 
not exactly sure if or when he's gonna
do<00:04:25.169> it<00:04:25.260> I'm<00:04:25.410> assuming<00:04:25.860> he<00:04:25.979> should<00:04:26.250> do<00:04:26.400> it

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
do it I'm assuming he should do it

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.410 
do it I'm assuming he should do it
because<00:04:26.700> he'd<00:04:26.820> obviously<00:04:26.940> respond

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
because he'd obviously respond

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.390 
because he'd obviously respond
the<00:04:27.600> tweet<00:04:27.840> and<00:04:28.050> he<00:04:28.410> said<00:04:28.650> like<00:04:29.010> I<00:04:29.130> like<00:04:29.280> the

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
the tweet and he said like I like the

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.160 
the tweet and he said like I like the
sounds<00:04:29.730> of<00:04:29.790> that<00:04:29.850> and<00:04:30.150> that's<00:04:30.630> a<00:04:30.720> good<00:04:30.870> start

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
sounds of that and that's a good start

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.420 
sounds of that and that's a good start
keep<00:04:31.230> up<00:04:31.560> so<00:04:31.710> obviously<00:04:31.950> does<00:04:32.190> acknowledge

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
keep up so obviously does acknowledge

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.670 
keep up so obviously does acknowledge
the<00:04:33.150> actual<00:04:33.390> tweet<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:33.900> also<00:04:34.140> they<00:04:34.350> do<00:04:34.500> know

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
the actual tweet and also they do know

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.020 
the actual tweet and also they do know
that<00:04:34.710> he<00:04:34.890> has<00:04:35.010> it<00:04:35.160> fifty<00:04:35.400> thousand<00:04:35.760> retweets

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
that he has it fifty thousand retweets

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.790 
that he has it fifty thousand retweets
but<00:04:36.360> now<00:04:36.780> is<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.020> question<00:04:37.320> of<00:04:37.410> whether<00:04:37.590> they

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
but now is the question of whether they

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
but now is the question of whether they
actually<00:04:37.890> going<00:04:38.130> to<00:04:38.220> reveal<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.580> trailer

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
actually going to reveal the trailer

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.770 
actually going to reveal the trailer
will<00:04:39.030> they<00:04:39.120> do<00:04:39.240> it<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.360> little<00:04:39.480> bit<00:04:39.660> earlier

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
will they do it a little bit earlier

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.930 
will they do it a little bit earlier
than<00:04:40.200> actually<00:04:40.500> plan<00:04:40.770> to<00:04:40.920> and<00:04:41.220> if<00:04:41.790> it's

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
than actually plan to and if it's

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.130 
than actually plan to and if it's
definitely<00:04:42.270> very<00:04:42.450> interesting<00:04:42.810> we<00:04:42.900> should

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
definitely very interesting we should

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.140 
definitely very interesting we should
hopefully<00:04:43.440> see<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:44.250> car<00:04:44.430> revealed<00:04:44.790> perhaps

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
hopefully see the car revealed perhaps

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.030 
hopefully see the car revealed perhaps
even<00:04:45.330> sooner<00:04:45.600> than<00:04:45.750> 20th<00:04:46.170> I'm<00:04:46.470> sure<00:04:46.800> it<00:04:46.920> feels

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
even sooner than 20th I'm sure it feels

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.290 
even sooner than 20th I'm sure it feels
