00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.800
 hello in today's program given that it 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.420
 summer approaches we will see those 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.759
 exercises that you can perform for 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.769
 improve your career on the beach your own 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.780
 infection is the information that we're going 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.850
 receiving about the position and the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.680
 movement of our body 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.320
 since the sand is a bit unstable 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.110
 but not too much we can do 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.570
 progressed exercises in this 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.090
 surface in this first exercise with 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.390
 the support on a single foot we will perform 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.399
 rotations on one side and on the other not so much 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.310
 as at all times our hips 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.240
 you have to stabilize and be aware 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.510
 of your position in this second exercise 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.640
 also in balance on one foot 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.070
 we will flex and extend the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.960
 ankle support what we are looking for is that 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.200
 our body is completely 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.670
 aligned to create a motor map 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.560
 correct at all times 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.450
 in this third exercise we will put the 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.820
 feet with the separation of the width of 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.909
 the shoulders we will make a line with a 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.560
 very small distance simulating the passage 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.270
 what we do in the climbs with 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.649
 Elevated slope 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.530
 this fourth exercise is an evolution 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.600
 of the third in which we will perform the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.149
 same line but now with jump 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.710
 changing from one leg to another 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.420
 trying to maintain the position the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.670
 position of our body completely 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.459
 stable at all times and we go for the 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.459
 fifth year in which we will make a 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:33.920
 skins drawing a square in the sand 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:36.590
 we can do it in a sense or in the 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.640
 another but always keeping a rhythm 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.470
 constant and raising the knees well and 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.090
 we finish with the sixth in a position 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.539
 with feet quite separated 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.450
 we will make jumps turning 90 degrees 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.030
 about our own body axis with 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.619
 we will improve the spatial control to 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.840
 the time the stability of each of 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.539
 the joints if you want it 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.579
 evolve you can make turns of 180 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.099
 much more complicated degrees 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.049
 but much more cash good guys 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:08.690
 as you have seen we have done exercises 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.329
 some simpler and more static and 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.940
 others more demanding physically if 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:15.890
 you make them between 4 and 5 series each 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.170
 about 30 seconds of work 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.040
 d barefoot you will see that this summer you 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.040
 you are going to get very fit
