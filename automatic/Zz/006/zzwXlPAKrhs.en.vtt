00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.760 

Cobb's<00:00:04.920> OS<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.640> hi-hat<00:00:06.089> I<00:00:06.450> hit<00:00:06.960> high<00:00:07.140> yet<00:00:07.319> again

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
Cobb's OS a hi-hat I hit high yet again

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.720 
Cobb's OS a hi-hat I hit high yet again
his<00:00:07.950> staff<00:00:08.250> from<00:00:08.429> scratch

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
his staff from scratch

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.530 
his staff from scratch
all<00:00:11.730> right<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:12.090> we'll<00:00:12.210> bring<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.450> an

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
all right so we'll bring in an

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.189 
all right so we'll bring in an
instrument<00:00:12.750> rep<00:00:13.049> again<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.650> an<00:00:14.610> operator

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199 
instrument rep again and an operator

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.120 
instrument rep again and an operator
oopsies<00:00:17.660> so<00:00:18.660> always<00:00:18.840> when<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.500> all<00:00:19.619> not<00:00:19.770> all<00:00:19.949> is

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
oopsies so always when it all not all is

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.150 
oopsies so always when it all not all is
but<00:00:20.340> when<00:00:20.490> I'm<00:00:20.609> making<00:00:20.760> techno<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:22.010> pretty<00:00:23.010> much

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
but when I'm making techno I pretty much

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.029 
but when I'm making techno I pretty much
uniformly<00:00:23.880> use<00:00:24.269> an<00:00:24.449> operator<00:00:24.810> put<00:00:25.710> some<00:00:25.859> white

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
uniformly use an operator put some white

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.269 
uniformly use an operator put some white
noise<00:00:26.420> not<00:00:27.420> necessarily<00:00:28.050> as<00:00:28.230> all<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.590> use<00:00:28.949> but

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
noise not necessarily as all I use but

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.110 
noise not necessarily as all I use but
as<00:00:29.460> it's<00:00:31.189> just<00:00:32.189> because<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.640> way<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.850> can

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
as it's just because the way you can

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.380 
as it's just because the way you can
make<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.390> move<00:00:34.520> the<00:00:35.520> way<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.790> sounds

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
make it move the way it sounds

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.670 
make it move the way it sounds
it<00:00:36.450> really<00:00:36.660> works<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> tip<00:00:37.140> now<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.559> can

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
it really works the tip now and you can

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.959 
it really works the tip now and you can
do<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> lot<00:00:38.010> more<00:00:38.040> other<00:00:38.370> than<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:38.790> within

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
do a lot more other than you can within

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.119 
do a lot more other than you can within
your<00:00:39.149> sample<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:40.200> we're<00:00:40.350> sitting<00:00:40.500> our<00:00:40.739> wave<00:00:40.920> to

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
your sample so we're sitting our wave to

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.560 
your sample so we're sitting our wave to
white<00:00:41.280> noise<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.940> we'll<00:00:42.090> give<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.360> very

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
white noise and we'll give it a very

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.100 
white noise and we'll give it a very
nice<00:00:42.780> sharp<00:00:43.969> decay<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.539> let's<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:45.930> bring

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
nice sharp decay so let's just bring

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.799 
nice sharp decay so let's just bring
that<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.590> Chuck<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:46.920> some<00:00:47.129> notes<00:00:47.809> just

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
that in and Chuck in some notes just

00:00:48.809 --> 00:01:02.029 
that in and Chuck in some notes just
we'll<00:00:49.440> go<00:00:49.559> eighth<00:00:49.739> notes<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.370> now<00:01:00.890> if<00:01:01.890> you

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
we'll go eighth notes and now if you

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.990 
we'll go eighth notes and now if you
let's<00:01:02.219> play<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> bit<00:01:02.910> more<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.890> swing<00:01:07.820> just<00:01:08.820> for

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
let's play a bit more the swing just for

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.750 
let's play a bit more the swing just for
this<00:01:09.150> example<00:01:09.869> let's<00:01:10.619> start<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.310> sixteenth

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
this example let's start on sixteenth

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.840 
this example let's start on sixteenth
notes<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:12.270> we're<00:01:12.390> going<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.540> drop<00:01:13.820> some<00:01:14.820> of

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
notes but we're going to drop some of

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:24.080 
notes but we're going to drop some of
the<00:01:18.799> velocities<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:22.580> that's<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> pattern<00:01:23.880> I

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the velocities so that's the pattern I

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.810 
the velocities so that's the pattern I
want<00:01:24.330> with<00:01:25.009> offbeat<00:01:26.009> having<00:01:26.610> highest

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
want with offbeat having highest

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.990 
want with offbeat having highest
velocity<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:28.560> ones<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:29.009> between<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.790> bait

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
velocity the ones in between the bait

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.730 
velocity the ones in between the bait
and<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.240> offbeat<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.750> last<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.320> then<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
and the offbeat the last and then on the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.060 
and the offbeat the last and then on the
bait<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.490> little<00:01:32.850> bit<00:01:33.000> down<00:01:33.680> so<00:01:34.680> just<00:01:34.920> grab

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
bait just a little bit down so just grab

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.990 
bait just a little bit down so just grab
that<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.490> duplicate<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.270> E<00:01:37.460> across<00:01:40.909> so<00:01:41.909> it

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
that and duplicate it and E across so it

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.080 
that and duplicate it and E across so it
sounds<00:01:42.240> one<00:01:42.390> more<00:01:42.509> take<00:01:46.759> so<00:01:47.759> there's<00:01:47.909> two

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
sounds one more take so there's two

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.880 
sounds one more take so there's two
things<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.450> want<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.720> do<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.140> straight

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
things you want to do with this straight

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.719 
things you want to do with this straight
away<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.960> just<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.079> make<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:53.130> velocity<00:01:53.579> we

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
away and just to make the velocity we

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.920 
away and just to make the velocity we
sit<00:01:53.970> am<00:01:54.799> act<00:01:55.799> quickly<00:01:56.340> on<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> sense<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.360> first

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
sit am act quickly on the sense so first

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.630 
sit am act quickly on the sense so first
of<00:01:58.020> all<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.350> better<00:01:58.590> velocity<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.430> the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
of all it's better velocity on the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.590 
of all it's better velocity on the
amplitude

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.080 

but<00:02:04.900> and<00:02:05.470> also<00:02:05.860> I<00:02:06.100> want<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.370> velocity<00:02:06.820> on<00:02:06.940> the

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
but and also I want to velocity on the

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.109 
but and also I want to velocity on the
time<00:02:07.330> so<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:08.170> want<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.860> high<00:02:09.130> velocity<00:02:09.460> hits<00:02:09.880> to

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
time so I want the high velocity hits to

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.150 
time so I want the high velocity hits to
be<00:02:10.210> longer<00:02:10.690> notes<00:02:11.350> and<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.680> shorter<00:02:11.980> ones

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
be longer notes and the shorter ones

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.430 
be longer notes and the shorter ones
sorry<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.180> lower<00:02:13.390> velocity<00:02:14.050> notes<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.410> be

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
sorry the lower velocity notes to be

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:23.790 
sorry the lower velocity notes to be
shorter<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:22.630> can<00:02:22.810> hear<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.200> offbeat's

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
shorter so you can hear the offbeat's

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.070 
shorter so you can hear the offbeat's
but<00:02:25.260> bit<00:02:26.260> longer<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:27.160> sounds<00:02:27.520> kind<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.760> cop<00:02:28.080> and

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
but bit longer so sounds kind of cop and

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.630 
but bit longer so sounds kind of cop and
then<00:02:29.170> we're<00:02:29.320> going<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.500> bring<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:29.800> an<00:02:29.890> EQ<00:02:32.640> let's

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
then we're going to bring in an EQ let's

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.330 
then we're going to bring in an EQ let's
cut<00:02:33.850> it<00:02:33.970> in<00:02:34.180> here<00:02:34.630> for<00:02:34.840> now<00:02:34.959> I'm<00:02:35.920> just<00:02:36.100> going<00:02:36.280> to

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
cut it in here for now I'm just going to

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.170 
cut it in here for now I'm just going to
chop<00:02:36.520> out<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:37.060> line

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.940 

we<00:02:43.180> don't<00:02:43.330> want<00:02:43.480> they're<00:02:43.720> just<00:02:44.470> muddy<00:02:44.680> things

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
we don't want they're just muddy things

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:59.490 
we don't want they're just muddy things
up<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.970> there's<00:02:58.150> just<00:02:58.180> one<00:02:58.450> thing<00:02:58.480> you<00:02:59.200> can<00:02:59.350> do

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
up so there's just one thing you can do

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.290 
up so there's just one thing you can do
as<00:02:59.739> your<00:02:59.890> builds<00:03:00.190> as<00:03:00.310> well<00:03:00.489> so<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:00.820> quite<00:03:01.150> like

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
as your builds as well so I quite like

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
as your builds as well so I quite like
dunk<00:03:01.540> it's<00:03:01.840> met<00:03:02.050> that<00:03:02.200> turn<00:03:02.350> macro<00:03:07.320> ears

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
dunk it's met that turn macro ears

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.960 
dunk it's met that turn macro ears
you're<00:03:08.500> coming<00:03:08.769> up<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:09.070> it<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.459> build<00:03:09.760> or<00:03:09.910> a

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
you're coming up to it to a build or a

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.800 
you're coming up to it to a build or a
droplet<00:03:10.180> event<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:16.060> know<00:03:16.180> then<00:03:16.450> drop<00:03:16.630> it<00:03:16.690> back

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
droplet event you know then drop it back

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:24.060 
droplet event you know then drop it back
down<00:03:18.150> cool<00:03:21.570> alright<00:03:22.570> so<00:03:22.750> that's<00:03:22.930> that's<00:03:23.680> the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
down cool alright so that's that's the

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.890 
down cool alright so that's that's the
most<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:25.060> hi-hat<00:03:25.420> but<00:03:25.450> let's<00:03:25.750> just

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
most of the the hi-hat but let's just

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.400 
most of the the hi-hat but let's just
find<00:03:26.110> a<00:03:26.260> bit<00:03:26.380> more<00:03:26.530> texture<00:03:26.890> to<00:03:26.920> it<00:03:27.070> so<00:03:28.290> do<00:03:29.290> this

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
find a bit more texture to it so do this

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.940 
find a bit more texture to it so do this
by<00:03:29.590> finding<00:03:29.769> a<00:03:29.980> sample<00:03:30.400> that<00:03:30.489> works<00:03:30.700> with<00:03:30.970> that

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
by finding a sample that works with that

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.850 
by finding a sample that works with that
we've<00:03:32.950> got<00:03:33.070> cymbals<00:03:33.780> closed<00:03:34.780> hits<00:03:37.860> that's

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
we've got cymbals closed hits that's

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.479 
we've got cymbals closed hits that's
nice<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.190> simple<00:03:39.430> spring<00:03:40.090> there<00:03:40.269> then<00:03:40.390> all

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
nice and simple spring there then all

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:52.000 
nice and simple spring there then all
right<00:03:44.160> shape<00:03:45.160> it<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.340> bit

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:04:05.120 

if<00:03:53.010> it<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.280> high-pass<00:03:54.060> filter<00:03:54.630> as<00:03:54.750> well<00:04:04.130> some

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
if it a high-pass filter as well some

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.100 
if it a high-pass filter as well some
velocity<00:04:05.670> let's<00:04:06.330> just<00:04:06.570> try<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:06.870> match<00:04:07.080> it

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
velocity let's just try and match it

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.640 
velocity let's just try and match it
with<00:04:07.320> what<00:04:07.560> we<00:04:07.650> didn't<00:04:07.860> hear<00:04:08.010> so<00:04:08.220> 32<00:04:08.670> cents<00:04:11.060> -

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
with what we didn't hear so 32 cents -

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.750 
with what we didn't hear so 32 cents -
sorry<00:04:13.650> that's<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:13.920> wrong<00:04:14.130> place<00:04:14.340> for<00:04:14.580> what<00:04:14.670> we

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
sorry that's the wrong place for what we

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:30.190 
sorry that's the wrong place for what we
want<00:04:14.970> it<00:04:17.180> so<00:04:18.180> here<00:04:18.390> we<00:04:18.480> go<00:04:18.630> through<00:04:18.960> the<00:04:19.050> toe

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.360 

cool<00:04:31.200> so<00:04:31.410> these<00:04:31.530> are<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:31.740> four<00:04:31.920> elements<00:04:32.040> that

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
cool so these are the four elements that

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.030 
cool so these are the four elements that
are<00:04:32.610> basically<00:04:32.970> setting<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:34.380> levels<00:04:34.710> for<00:04:34.950> the

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
are basically setting the levels for the

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.590 
are basically setting the levels for the
rest<00:04:35.190> of<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.400> track<00:04:35.640> just<00:04:35.880> a<00:04:36.150> relative

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
rest of the track just a relative

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.620 
rest of the track just a relative
balance<00:04:37.200> between<00:04:37.410> blows<00:04:37.920> and<00:04:38.160> hires<00:04:38.340> how<00:04:39.330> loud

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
balance between blows and hires how loud

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.460 
balance between blows and hires how loud
things<00:04:39.900> should<00:04:40.080> be<00:04:41.870> yeah<00:04:42.900> traditionally<00:04:43.440> I

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
things should be yeah traditionally I

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.740 
things should be yeah traditionally I
find<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:43.800> sneers<00:04:44.130> often<00:04:45.030> one<00:04:45.330> of<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.510> loudest

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
find the sneers often one of the loudest

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.670 
find the sneers often one of the loudest
things<00:04:46.200> in<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.860> track<00:04:47.100> so<00:04:48.410> yeah<00:04:49.410> you<00:04:49.530> don't

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
things in the track so yeah you don't

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.800 
things in the track so yeah you don't
want<00:04:49.890> to<00:04:49.950> go<00:04:50.100> much<00:04:50.340> above<00:04:50.370> this<00:04:50.760> near<00:04:51.030> a<00:04:51.210> lot<00:04:51.720> of

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
want to go much above this near a lot of

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.440 
want to go much above this near a lot of
tracks<00:04:52.080> I've<00:04:52.520> ended<00:04:53.520> up<00:04:53.640> mastering<00:04:54.090> this<00:04:54.210> near

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
tracks I've ended up mastering this near

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.720 
tracks I've ended up mastering this near
a<00:04:54.720> differently<00:04:55.710> Peaks<00:04:55.950> above<00:04:56.280> most<00:04:56.520> other

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
a differently Peaks above most other

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.570 
a differently Peaks above most other
things<00:04:57.060> but<00:04:57.390> so<00:04:58.290> that's<00:04:58.410> that's<00:04:58.710> a<00:04:58.920> good<00:04:58.950> I

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
things but so that's that's a good I

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.310 
things but so that's that's a good I
guess<00:05:00.530> barrier<00:05:01.530> or<00:05:01.800> boundary<00:05:02.430> to<00:05:02.550> sit<00:05:02.850> as

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
guess barrier or boundary to sit as

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.300 
guess barrier or boundary to sit as
loudness<00:05:04.320> goes<00:05:05.630> and<00:05:06.740> with<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:07.860> serum<00:05:08.100> higher

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
loudness goes and with the serum higher

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.310 
loudness goes and with the serum higher
together<00:05:08.790> that's<00:05:09.300> where<00:05:09.600> you<00:05:09.780> want<00:05:09.960> your<00:05:10.110> high

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
together that's where you want your high

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.170 
together that's where you want your high
inserting<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:11.190> bass<00:05:11.400> and<00:05:11.640> the<00:05:11.700> kick<00:05:11.730> is<00:05:11.910> where

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
inserting the bass and the kick is where

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.370 
inserting the bass and the kick is where
you<00:05:12.240> want<00:05:12.420> your<00:05:12.480> low<00:05:12.630> in<00:05:12.780> turning<00:05:13.080> and

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
you want your low in turning and

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.800 
you want your low in turning and
everything<00:05:13.860> else<00:05:14.070> is<00:05:14.370> just<00:05:14.610> that<00:05:14.760> in<00:05:15.000> relative

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
everything else is just that in relative

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.570 
everything else is just that in relative
to<00:05:15.990> that<00:05:16.170> but<00:05:16.800> let's<00:05:16.950> just<00:05:17.010> give<00:05:17.280> us<00:05:17.400> a<00:05:17.430> quick

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
to that but let's just give us a quick

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.390 
to that but let's just give us a quick
more<00:05:17.820> once-over
