00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.380 
and jelly and toast was a whole bunch of
variety<00:01:51.770> so<00:01:52.770> usually<00:01:53.250> when<00:01:53.610> I'm<00:01:53.759> filling<00:01:54.210> it

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
variety so usually when I'm filling it

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.649 
variety so usually when I'm filling it
like<00:01:54.810> when<00:01:55.020> I'm<00:01:55.110> filling<00:01:55.860> up<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.159> dish<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.790> just

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
like when I'm filling up the dish I just

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.929 
like when I'm filling up the dish I just
take<00:01:57.930> out<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.439> random<00:01:59.009> whatever<00:01:59.340> comes<00:01:59.700> out

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
take out a random whatever comes out

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.520 
take out a random whatever comes out
comes<00:02:00.329> out<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.020> something<00:02:01.200> different

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
comes out so it's something different

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.800 
comes out so it's something different
every<00:02:01.979> time<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:03.079> they<00:02:04.079> seem<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:04.710> that

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.389 
already today they've had fresh food
though<00:02:08.579> they've<00:02:08.790> had

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
though they've had

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.069 
though they've had
scrambled<00:02:10.329> eggs<00:02:11.970> they<00:02:12.970> had<00:02:13.150> some<00:02:13.420> steak<00:02:13.750> for
