a<00:00:47.640> granuloma<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.600> these<00:00:48.809> are<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> things<00:00:49.320> that

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
a granuloma so these are the things that

a granuloma so these are the things that
come<00:00:52.140> across<00:00:52.260> my<00:00:52.500> mind<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:54.059> bring<00:00:54.510> her<00:00:54.719> up

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
to him very quietly so we can see the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.260 
to him very quietly so we can see the
shape<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.039> things<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.460> you'll<00:00:59.579> trim<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.059> up

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270

feather mites that she's got thousands
of<00:01:45.450> them<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.590> they<00:01:46.710> won't<00:01:46.860> show<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.220> camera<00:01:47.430> but

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759

they are there they're very very tiny
they're<00:01:50.159> more<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.640> house<00:01:50.939> dust<00:01:51.210> mites<00:01:51.540> and

they're more like house dust mites and

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.149 
they're more like house dust mites and
they're<00:01:53.070> treated<00:01:54.030> fairly<00:01:54.270> easily<00:01:54.930> I'm<00:01:55.860> just

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
they're treated fairly easily I'm just

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.920 
they're treated fairly easily I'm just
looking<00:01:56.430> at<00:01:56.549> her<00:01:56.700> powder<00:01:56.969> downs<00:01:57.299> which<00:01:57.659> are

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
looking at her powder downs which are

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.350 
looking at her powder downs which are
quite<00:01:58.710> abnormal<00:01:59.009> these<00:01:59.549> feathers<00:01:59.939> across<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
quite abnormal these feathers across the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.399 
quite abnormal these feathers across the
hips<00:02:01.070> are<00:02:02.070> very<00:02:02.130> abnormal<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.630> we'll<00:02:04.200> take

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
hips are very abnormal so we'll take

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.109 
hips are very abnormal so we'll take
some<00:02:04.590> photographs<00:02:04.860> as<00:02:05.310> well<00:02:05.460> as<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.610> video<00:02:05.790> of

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
some photographs as well as a video of

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.050 
some photographs as well as a video of
those<00:02:06.329> bit<00:02:06.659> later<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.700> raises

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
those bit later on and that raises

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.990 
those bit later on and that raises
another<00:02:09.950> possibility<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.190> diagnosis<00:02:11.849> and

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
another possibility in the diagnosis and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.420 
another possibility in the diagnosis and
that's

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
that's

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.910 
that's
right<00:02:12.670> hip<00:02:13.599> and<00:02:14.049> we'll<00:02:14.379> just<00:02:14.560> have<00:02:14.709> a<00:02:14.739> look<00:02:14.859> at

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
right hip and we'll just have a look at

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.679 
right hip and we'll just have a look at
these<00:02:15.040> feathers<00:02:15.430> on<00:02:15.549> her<00:02:15.700> left<00:02:15.879> hip<00:02:16.239> which<00:02:16.480> are

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 
these feathers on her left hip which are

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.569 
these feathers on her left hip which are
also<00:02:16.900> very<00:02:18.239> abnormal<00:02:20.159> so<00:02:21.159> we've<00:02:21.310> got<00:02:21.400> two

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
also very abnormal so we've got two

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.630 
also very abnormal so we've got two
patches<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.150> very<00:02:22.299> abnormal<00:02:22.540> feathers<00:02:23.170> there

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
patches of very abnormal feathers there

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.729 
patches of very abnormal feathers there
and<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:24.819> may<00:02:25.180> be<00:02:25.239> because<00:02:25.659> she's<00:02:26.439> having

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
and that may be because she's having

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.929 
and that may be because she's having
trouble<00:02:26.980> grooming<00:02:27.609> I'm<00:02:28.510> just<00:02:28.750> going<00:02:28.959> to

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
trouble grooming I'm just going to

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.789 
trouble grooming I'm just going to
explore<00:02:30.939> that<00:02:31.090> in<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.329> moment<00:02:31.659> yeah<00:02:32.439> her

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
explore that in the moment yeah her

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:33.809 
explore that in the moment yeah her
nostrils

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
nostrils

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.229 
nostrils
I<00:02:34.950> think<00:02:35.950> about<00:02:36.189> the<00:02:36.280> partial<00:02:36.730> blockage<00:02:37.120> I

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
I think about the partial blockage I

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.569 
I think about the partial blockage I
think<00:02:37.420> she's<00:02:37.569> got<00:02:38.010> I'll<00:02:39.010> have<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.280> look<00:02:39.430> with

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
think she's got I'll have a look with

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.160 
think she's got I'll have a look with
the<00:02:39.730> light<00:02:39.939> in<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.180> moment<00:02:40.510> with<00:02:40.599> my<00:02:40.780> eyes<00:02:40.930> I

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
the light in the moment with my eyes I

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:50.369 
the light in the moment with my eyes I
think<00:02:41.200> that's<00:02:42.189> going<00:02:42.489> on<00:02:43.379> and<00:02:48.840> right<00:02:49.840> what

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
think that's going on and right what

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.619 
think that's going on and right what
we're<00:02:50.560> doing<00:02:50.829> here<00:02:51.129> is<00:02:51.280> just<00:02:51.310> starting<00:02:52.180> to

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
we're doing here is just starting to

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:58.280 
we're doing here is just starting to
ship<00:02:52.840> this<00:02:53.079> cab<00:02:53.909> this<00:02:54.909> cab<00:02:55.209> in<00:02:55.359> her<00:02:55.569> beak<00:02:57.000> and

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
ship this cab this cab in her beak and

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.119 
ship this cab this cab in her beak and
there<00:02:59.790> is<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:01.150> huge<00:03:01.510> scab<00:03:02.200> coming<00:03:02.620> out<00:03:02.799> of<00:03:02.980> her

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
there is a huge scab coming out of her

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.140 
there is a huge scab coming out of her
mouth<00:03:03.340> there<00:03:04.469> right

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
mouth there right

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.759 
mouth there right
filled<00:03:07.150> up<00:03:07.269> of<00:03:07.480> food<00:03:07.750> it's<00:03:08.079> what<00:03:08.230> food<00:03:08.500> debris

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
filled up of food it's what food debris

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:15.830 
filled up of food it's what food debris
stuck<00:03:09.310> in<00:03:09.489> it<00:03:09.609> in<00:03:10.329> the<00:03:10.510> pus<00:03:11.909> and<00:03:14.189> other<00:03:15.189> debris

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
stuck in it in the pus and other debris

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.699 
stuck in it in the pus and other debris
so<00:03:17.579> that's<00:03:18.870> something<00:03:19.870> we'll<00:03:20.169> look<00:03:20.260> at<00:03:20.409> in<00:03:20.470> a

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
so that's something we'll look at in a

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.890 
so that's something we'll look at in a
moment<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:22.000> we'll<00:03:22.090> just<00:03:22.329> see<00:03:22.479> what's<00:03:22.659> going

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
moment and we'll just see what's going

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.839 
moment and we'll just see what's going
on<00:03:23.019> in<00:03:23.139> her<00:03:23.319> mouth

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
on in her mouth

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.750 
on in her mouth
having<00:03:24.849> done<00:03:24.970> that<00:03:25.180> for<00:03:25.449> her<00:03:26.400> right<00:03:27.400> well

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
having done that for her right well

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.309 
having done that for her right well
that's<00:03:27.879> only<00:03:28.090> a<00:03:28.239> small<00:03:28.299> piece<00:03:28.840> of<00:03:28.870> what's

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
that's only a small piece of what's

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.819 
that's only a small piece of what's
going<00:03:29.560> on<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:31.120> we've<00:03:31.540> broken<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:32.139> scab<00:03:32.409> into

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
going on so we've broken the scab into

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.399 
going on so we've broken the scab into
two<00:03:33.760> too<00:03:33.970> but<00:03:34.269> there's<00:03:34.449> a<00:03:34.510> lot<00:03:34.689> more<00:03:34.720> curating

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409 
two too but there's a lot more curating

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:40.339 
two too but there's a lot more curating
that<00:03:35.560> needs<00:03:35.769> to<00:03:35.979> be<00:03:36.010> done<00:03:37.409> into<00:03:38.409> your<00:03:38.530> course

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
that needs to be done into your course

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.589 
that needs to be done into your course
so<00:03:41.349> we<00:03:42.099> still<00:03:42.340> haven't<00:03:42.639> got<00:03:42.759> to<00:03:42.879> the<00:03:43.000> basis<00:03:43.449> of

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
so we still haven't got to the basis of

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.990 
so we still haven't got to the basis of
the<00:03:43.780> scab<00:03:44.019> where<00:03:44.259> we<00:03:44.409> can<00:03:44.590> work<00:03:45.430> out<00:03:45.669> or<00:03:45.849> get

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
the scab where we can work out or get

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.999 
the scab where we can work out or get
some<00:03:46.180> cells<00:03:46.479> to<00:03:46.689> work<00:03:46.720> out<00:03:47.019> what<00:03:47.169> the<00:03:47.349> real

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:48.009 
some cells to work out what the real

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:52.020 
some cells to work out what the real
diagnosis<00:03:48.729> is<00:03:50.099> anyway<00:03:51.099> well<00:03:51.400> let's<00:03:51.579> give<00:03:51.819> her

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
diagnosis is anyway well let's give her

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.979 
diagnosis is anyway well let's give her
