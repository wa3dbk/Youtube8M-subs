00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.910
 that maybe has not happened yet 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.480

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.920
 but each also has sun but in St Trine meaning aesthetics 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.340
 the play will be for itself because it made sense in MÃ¼nster's order process 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.910
 where it is absolutely different from UNIQA of new parts and therefore only one

 Artists on winless also where creativity can and should emerge and 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.710
 also that is staged and where people meet 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.109
 At the moment I was working

 the future projects is 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.840
 it is natural and without further building it as a total installation 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.509
 to see as a total work of art that is 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:31.479
 not to shape the cause too much to put to the people endlessly in Mainz 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.639
 born but also opportunities to create the other
