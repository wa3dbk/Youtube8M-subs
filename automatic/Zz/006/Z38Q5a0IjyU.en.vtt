00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
that's come the gist of it is how do we

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.170 
that's come the gist of it is how do we
take

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.750 

and<00:01:54.180> doing<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.410> hopefully<00:01:55.590> suppose<00:01:56.370> a<00:01:56.400> lot

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
and doing so hopefully suppose a lot

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.390 
and doing so hopefully suppose a lot
more<00:01:57.440> possibilities<00:01:58.440> around<00:01:58.890> even<00:01:59.280> though

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
more possibilities around even though

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.230 
more possibilities around even though
we're<00:01:59.610> such<00:02:00.240> as<00:02:01.100> well<00:02:02.100> there<00:02:02.340> was<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> time<00:02:02.850> in

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
my brother cars I realize later but I

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.350 
my brother cars I realize later but I
really<00:02:28.740> enjoyed<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.190> our<00:02:29.490> spin<00:02:29.970> down<00:02:30.120> there

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
really enjoyed that our spin down there

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.960 
really enjoyed that our spin down there
that<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:31.950> through<00:02:32.310> pure<00:02:32.340> luck<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.760> I

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
that just through pure luck that I

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.970 
that just through pure luck that I
happen<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.210> walk<00:02:33.360> down<00:02:33.540> there<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.780> see<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.230> but

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
happen to walk down there and see it but

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.920 
happen to walk down there and see it but
that<00:02:35.220> my<00:02:35.340> life<00:02:35.520> is<00:02:35.670> probably<00:02:35.970> surrounding<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
that my life is probably surrounding the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.610 
that my life is probably surrounding the
possibilities<00:02:37.560> like<00:02:37.710> that

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
possibilities like that

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.720 
possibilities like that
and<00:02:40.620> if<00:02:40.739> assistant<00:02:41.159> was<00:02:41.250> smart<00:02:41.519> enough<00:02:41.610> to

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
and if assistant was smart enough to

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.330 
and if assistant was smart enough to
understand<00:02:42.299> me<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.690> very<00:02:42.959> deep<00:02:43.140> level<00:02:43.470> and

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
understand me and very deep level and

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.830 
understand me and very deep level and
understand<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:44.909> world<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.390> gradient<00:02:45.720> I

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
understand the world of the gradient I

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.270 
understand the world of the gradient I
believe<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.349> could<00:02:46.470> basically<00:02:46.650> expose<00:02:47.069> those

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
believe it could basically expose those

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.399 
believe it could basically expose those
possibilities<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:48.840> would<00:02:48.959> have<00:02:49.049> a<00:02:49.110> deeper

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
possibilities it would have a deeper

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.979 
possibilities it would have a deeper
situational<00:02:49.920> awareness<00:02:50.569> when<00:02:51.569> it<00:02:51.659> comes<00:02:51.780> all

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
situational awareness when it comes all

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.990 
situational awareness when it comes all
right<00:02:52.230> now<00:02:52.379> then<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.769> wonder<00:02:53.069> so<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.730> started

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
right now then I wonder so I started

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.789 
right now then I wonder so I started
kind<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.269> thinking<00:02:54.480> down<00:02:54.599> that<00:02:54.810> down<00:02:55.019> and

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
kind of thinking down that down and

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.350 
kind of thinking down that down and
we're<00:02:55.980> gonna<00:02:56.099> take<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.400> flood<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:56.940> about

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
we're gonna take the flood that in about

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.630 
we're gonna take the flood that in about
a<00:02:57.390> person<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:57.959> in<00:02:58.049> about<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.379> world<00:02:58.640> certain

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
a person that in about the world certain

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.949 
a person that in about the world certain
values<00:02:59.849> that<00:02:59.879> we<00:03:00.090> could<00:03:00.239> actually<00:03:00.360> use<00:03:00.540> games

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
values that we could actually use games

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.960 
values that we could actually use games
to<00:03:01.560> collect<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:02.099> lot<00:03:02.129> of<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.519> in<00:03:02.730> fun

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
to collect a lot of that in fun

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.759 
to collect a lot of that in fun
interesting<00:03:03.209> ways<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.260> purpose<00:03:04.620> of<00:03:04.709> it

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
interesting ways and the purpose of it

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.800 
interesting ways and the purpose of it
is<00:03:05.099> you<00:03:05.340> know<00:03:05.400> how<00:03:05.909> do<00:03:05.970> big<00:03:06.239> games<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.720> make

augmented<00:03:28.799> reality<00:03:29.180> intact<00:03:30.180> is<00:03:30.329> a<00:03:30.720> lot<00:03:30.930> of

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
augmented reality intact is a lot of

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.539 
augmented reality intact is a lot of
what<00:03:31.140> we're<00:03:31.230> looking<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.620> know<00:03:31.769> our<00:03:32.280> people

what we're looking to I know our people

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.399 
what we're looking to I know our people
in<00:03:33.120> reality<00:03:33.480> community<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.260> local

people<00:03:36.629> don't<00:03:36.930> realize<00:03:37.200> how<00:03:37.500> far<00:03:37.739> those

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
people don't realize how far those

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.550 
people don't realize how far those
techniques<00:03:38.310> have<00:03:38.489> advanced<00:03:38.940> already<00:03:39.560> there

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
techniques have advanced already there

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.410 
techniques have advanced already there
are<00:03:40.739> lots<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.400> daughters<00:03:41.760> out<00:03:41.940> there<00:03:42.150> with

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
are lots of daughters out there with

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.030 
are lots of daughters out there with
really<00:03:42.750> core<00:03:42.989> technology<00:03:43.560> in<00:03:43.680> search<00:03:43.859> of<00:03:43.889> a

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
really core technology in search of a

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.420 
really core technology in search of a
problem<00:03:44.720> there's<00:03:45.720> no<00:03:45.750> vision<00:03:46.109> driving<00:03:46.620> but

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
problem there's no vision driving but

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.970 
problem there's no vision driving but
they<00:03:47.549> were<00:03:47.609> thinking<00:03:47.940> amazing

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
they were thinking amazing

and so I'm kind of looking at always

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.660 
and so I'm kind of looking at always
leave<00:03:50.989> something<00:03:51.770> on<00:03:52.040> me<00:03:52.280> and<00:03:52.400> how<00:03:52.459> we<00:03:52.520> can

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
part is mapping you know yet the 1% how

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.180 
part is mapping you know yet the 1% how
much<00:04:32.840> information<00:04:33.530> is<00:04:33.620> too<00:04:33.800> much<00:04:33.979> information

intelligence is precocious there are

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.990 
intelligence is precocious there are
about<00:04:45.770> a<00:04:45.830> hundred<00:04:45.950> million<00:04:46.400> bits<00:04:46.880> of

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
about a hundred million bits of

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.250 
about a hundred million bits of
information<00:04:47.500> one<00:04:48.500> universe<00:04:48.950> is<00:04:49.280> ever<00:04:49.430> so

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
information one universe is ever so

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.690 
information one universe is ever so
you're<00:04:51.260> conscious<00:04:51.680> three<00:04:51.860> streams<00:04:52.550> of

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
you're conscious three streams of

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.600 
you're conscious three streams of
thought<00:04:52.729> is<00:04:53.030> about<00:04:53.210> 100<00:04:53.720> bits<00:04:53.840> per<00:04:53.990> second

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
thought is about 100 bits per second

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.950 
thought is about 100 bits per second
about<00:04:55.610> a<00:04:55.669> millionth<00:04:56.150> of<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.780> elevated

about a millionth of the elevated

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.810 
about a millionth of the elevated
but<00:04:58.500> yet<00:04:58.710> you're<00:04:58.860> aware<00:04:59.039> of<00:04:59.160> all<00:04:59.280> they<00:04:59.400> do<00:04:59.550> and

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
but yet you're aware of all they do and

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.180 
but yet you're aware of all they do and
so<00:05:00.479> right<00:05:00.990> now<00:05:01.169> our<00:05:01.199> consciousness<00:05:02.009> its
