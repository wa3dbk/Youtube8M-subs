than he had losses so I'm not sure what
to<00:01:30.789> make<00:01:30.820> of<00:01:30.969> that<00:01:31.270> I'm<00:01:31.479> not<00:01:31.630> sure<00:01:31.840> that's

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
to make of that I'm not sure that's

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.240 
to make of that I'm not sure that's
currently<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.840> right<00:01:35.020> way<00:01:35.170> to<00:01:35.229> look<00:01:35.439> at<00:01:35.560> it<00:01:35.679> so

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
currently the right way to look at it so

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.099 
currently the right way to look at it so
another<00:01:36.640> way<00:01:36.789> to<00:01:36.850> look<00:01:37.000> at<00:01:37.179> this<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.600> simply<00:01:37.869> to

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
another way to look at this is simply to

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:39.929 
another way to look at this is simply to
go<00:01:38.140> back<00:01:38.409> to<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.649> match<00:01:38.799> history<00:01:39.009> and<00:01:39.490> just

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
go back to the match history and just

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.609 
go back to the match history and just
look<00:01:40.060> at<00:01:40.179> the<00:01:40.329> recent<00:01:40.539> games<00:01:40.990> up<00:01:41.229> until<00:01:41.350> that

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619

2100 so let's just try and work to try
and<00:02:11.190> do<00:02:11.340> an<00:02:11.460> average<00:02:11.820> on<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.240> now<00:02:12.390> we<00:02:12.450> were

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
and do an average on this so now we were

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.330 
and do an average on this so now we were
up<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.930> an<00:02:13.020> average<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.410> two<00:02:13.470> thousand<00:02:14.070> between

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
up to an average of two thousand between

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.010 
up to an average of two thousand between
those<00:02:14.490> two<00:02:14.700> players<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.210> is<00:02:15.330> who<00:02:15.510> hates<00:02:15.780> las

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
those two players this is who hates las

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.640 
those two players this is who hates las
is<00:02:16.200> facing<00:02:17.180> certain<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:19.080> think<00:02:19.260> he<00:02:19.320> played<00:02:19.530> them

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
is facing certain I think he played them

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.130 
is facing certain I think he played them
again<00:02:19.980> by<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.310> looks<00:02:20.520> of<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.780> we<00:02:21.990> know

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
again by the looks of it and we know

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.800 
again by the looks of it and we know
that<00:02:22.170> he's<00:02:22.560> too<00:02:23.160> found<00:02:23.400> yeah<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.330> we<00:02:24.450> can<00:02:24.600> map

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
that he's too found yeah so we can map

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.860 
that he's too found yeah so we can map
it<00:02:24.990> up<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.340> 2050<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:27.720> system<00:02:29.660> should<00:02:30.660> be<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
it up to 2050 the system should be the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.680 
it up to 2050 the system should be the
fourth<00:02:31.140> one<00:02:31.350> now<00:02:31.850> again<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:33.090> can<00:02:33.360> play<00:02:33.510> them

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
fourth one now again you can play them

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.330 
fourth one now again you can play them
three<00:02:33.870> times<00:02:34.020> on<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.230> road<00:02:34.440> blimey<00:02:34.800> just<00:02:35.220> say

2050 again right there we go here's a

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.200 
2050 again right there we go here's a
new<00:02:42.450> one<00:02:44.570> now<00:02:45.570> let's<00:02:45.780> see<00:02:45.960> this<00:02:46.170> guy<00:02:47.000> 2165<00:02:48.000> so

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
new one now let's see this guy 2165 so

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.380 
new one now let's see this guy 2165 so
now<00:02:48.330> we<00:02:48.390> can<00:02:48.540> notch<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.900> up<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.370> 2100<00:02:53.180> let's<00:02:54.180> see

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
now we can notch it up to 2100 let's see

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:02.950 
now we can notch it up to 2100 let's see
who<00:02:54.540> we<00:02:54.660> lost<00:02:54.870> against<00:02:57.320> first<00:02:58.320> is<00:02:58.470> V<00:03:00.110> who<00:03:01.110> is<00:03:01.560> a

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
who we lost against first is V who is a

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.540 
who we lost against first is V who is a
2166<00:03:03.960> place<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:04.320> let's<00:03:04.500> knock<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.710> up<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.010> 2,000

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
2166 place so let's knock it up to 2,000

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:13.010 
2166 place so let's knock it up to 2,000
120<00:03:06.240> points<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:11.580> blistering<00:03:12.120> sands<00:03:12.450> be<00:03:12.780> once

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
120 points and blistering sands be once

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.250 
120 points and blistering sands be once
again<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:13.709> we<00:03:13.890> can<00:03:14.040> just<00:03:14.190> say<00:03:14.630> 2130<00:03:15.630> points<00:03:16.080> now

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
again so we can just say 2130 points now

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.840 
again so we can just say 2130 points now
you<00:03:16.530> know<00:03:16.650> we're<00:03:16.800> keeping<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.100> roughly<00:03:17.489> average

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
you know we're keeping a roughly average

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.949 
you know we're keeping a roughly average
and<00:03:18.770> then<00:03:20.000> he<00:03:21.000> faces<00:03:21.420> me<00:03:23.360> so<00:03:24.360> by<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.570> time<00:03:24.780> he's

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
and then he faces me so by the time he's

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.100 
and then he faces me so by the time he's
faced<00:03:25.230> me<00:03:26.090> so<00:03:27.090> remember<00:03:27.510> all<00:03:27.720> these<00:03:27.840> people

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
faced me so remember all these people

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.699 
faced me so remember all these people
are<00:03:28.380> between<00:03:28.500> 1900<00:03:32.840> 2160<00:03:33.840> something<00:03:34.320> so<00:03:34.650> you

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
are between 1900 2160 something so you

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.479 
are between 1900 2160 something so you
could<00:03:35.010> average<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.489> off<00:03:35.610> as<00:03:36.000> about<00:03:36.269> 2,000<00:03:36.989> ish

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
could average it off as about 2,000 ish

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.800 
could average it off as about 2,000 ish
2100<00:03:38.489> is<00:03:38.670> where<00:03:38.850> he's<00:03:38.970> been<00:03:39.150> playing<00:03:39.360> against

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
2100 is where he's been playing against

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.570 
2100 is where he's been playing against
and<00:03:40.100> then<00:03:41.239> going<00:03:42.239> look<00:03:42.420> at<00:03:42.540> mine

ah 1882 that's not quite 1720 but it's a
bit<00:04:24.660> closer<00:04:24.990> at<00:04:25.230> least<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:27.030> next<00:04:27.270> one

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510

blistering sands this guy's got to be
quite<00:04:29.220> low<00:04:29.430> as<00:04:29.580> well<00:04:29.760> I<00:04:29.790> imagine<00:04:33.320> 1793<00:04:34.700> so<00:04:36.320> why

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
quite low as well I imagine 1793 so why

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.070

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
myself included so we're all around 1700

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.690 
myself included so we're all around 1700
too<00:05:20.570> close<00:05:21.570> to<00:05:21.750> 99<00:05:22.200> @<00:05:22.590> actually<00:05:23.340> got<00:05:23.490> like<00:05:23.670> a

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
too close to 99 @ actually got like a

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.580 
too close to 99 @ actually got like a
matchmaking<00:05:24.300> system<00:05:24.870> of<00:05:25.740> about<00:05:26.600> 2100<00:05:27.600> and<00:05:27.750> the

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
matchmaking system of about 2100 and the

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.040 
matchmaking system of about 2100 and the
people<00:05:28.950> who<00:05:28.980> have<00:05:29.460> the<00:05:29.610> point<00:05:29.850> of<00:05:30.000> about<00:05:30.240> 2100

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
people who have the point of about 2100

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.780 
people who have the point of about 2100
still<00:05:31.260> have<00:05:31.440> their<00:05:31.590> matchmaking<00:05:31.980> rating

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
still have their matchmaking rating

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.020 
still have their matchmaking rating
around<00:05:33.060> that<00:05:33.210> point<00:05:33.650> so<00:05:34.650> what<00:05:35.580> I<00:05:35.610> get<00:05:35.880> from

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
around that point so what I get from

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.340 
around that point so what I get from
this<00:05:36.180> logically<00:05:36.780> is<00:05:37.050> that<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:39.330> system<00:05:39.900> thinks

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
this logically is that the system thinks

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.980 
this logically is that the system thinks
I'm<00:05:40.830> on<00:05:40.890> average<00:05:41.700> of<00:05:41.850> two<00:05:42.060> thousand<00:05:42.690> point

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
I'm on average of two thousand point

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.580 
I'm on average of two thousand point
player<00:05:43.260> to<00:05:43.760> 2100<00:05:44.760> that's<00:05:45.540> my<00:05:45.720> analysis<00:05:46.380> of

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
player to 2100 that's my analysis of

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.260 
player to 2100 that's my analysis of
this<00:05:46.740> but<00:05:47.310> because<00:05:47.610> we<00:05:47.760> can't<00:05:47.970> see<00:05:48.060> the

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
this but because we can't see the

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.900 
this but because we can't see the
matchmaking<00:05:48.690> rating<00:05:49.200> system<00:05:49.590> we<00:05:50.400> can't<00:05:50.610> truly

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
matchmaking rating system we can't truly

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.870 
matchmaking rating system we can't truly
ever<00:05:51.120> know<00:05:51.360> how<00:05:51.660> good<00:05:52.650> we<00:05:52.800> are<00:05:52.830> or<00:05:53.190> you<00:05:53.850> know

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
ever know how good we are or you know

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.690 
ever know how good we are or you know
what<00:05:54.210> real<00:05:54.510> points<00:05:54.960> we<00:05:55.500> should<00:05:55.710> be<00:05:55.890> a<00:05:55.919> painting

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
what real points we should be a painting

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.679
