the tire you want to check your air
pressure<00:00:37.079> as<00:00:37.320> well<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.430> by

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
pressure as well you can do this by

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.139 
pressure as well you can do this by
squeezing<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.440> tire<00:00:41.070> from<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.610> sides<00:00:41.850> like

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149

air pressure is added with the front
again<00:01:55.260> 80<00:01:56.260> to<00:01:56.950> 100<00:01:57.430> psi<00:01:57.670> is<00:01:58.410> the<00:01:59.410> adequate<00:01:59.920> air

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
again 80 to 100 psi is the adequate air

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.500 
again 80 to 100 psi is the adequate air
pressure<00:02:00.460> range<00:02:00.820> for<00:02:01.180> standard<00:02:01.750> BMX<00:02:02.229> bikes
