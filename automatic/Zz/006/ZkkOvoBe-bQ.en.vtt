world boxing classic that's going to pit
six<00:00:29.849> fighters<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.990> rut<00:00:31.259> a<00:00:31.290> semi<00:00:31.860> round-robin

six fighters in a rut a semi round-robin
tournament<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.510> that's<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.230> key<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.470> think

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
tournament and that's the key I think

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.590 
tournament and that's the key I think
it's<00:00:34.920> not<00:00:35.070> single<00:00:35.460> elimination<00:00:36.060> and<00:00:36.210> that's

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
it's not single elimination and that's

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.569 
it's not single elimination and that's
what<00:00:36.780> gives<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.380> think<00:00:37.620> such<00:00:37.950> charm<00:00:38.400> and

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
what gives this I think such charm and

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.600 
what gives this I think such charm and
allure<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.120> makes<00:00:39.630> it<00:00:39.810> something<00:00:40.410> that

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
allure and makes it something that

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.950 
allure and makes it something that
really<00:00:41.610> has<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.880> lot<00:00:41.970> of<00:00:42.060> mystery<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.810> you

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
really has a lot of mystery to it you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.290 
really has a lot of mystery to it you
know<00:00:43.079> you've<00:00:43.290> got<00:00:43.320> these<00:00:44.010> three<00:00:44.300> European

and Mikkel Kessler and then three

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.360 
and Mikkel Kessler and then three
Americans<00:00:51.900> Andre<00:00:52.230> Ward<00:00:52.470> Andre<00:00:52.950> Dirrell<00:00:53.130> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
Americans Andre Ward Andre Dirrell the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.610 
Americans Andre Ward Andre Dirrell the
two<00:00:53.520> young<00:00:53.760> former<00:00:54.360> Olympians<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:54.990> Jermain

two young former Olympians and Jermain

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.370 
two young former Olympians and Jermain
Taylor<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.160> veteran<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.060> I<00:00:57.420> think<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.170> true

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
Taylor the veteran and I think the true

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.110 
Taylor the veteran and I think the true
the<00:00:58.560> point<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.250> however<00:00:59.580> you<00:00:59.820> match

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
the point is that however you match

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.420 
the point is that however you match
those<00:01:00.420> six<00:01:00.750> guys<00:01:00.960> will<00:01:01.710> end<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.040> being<00:01:02.220> a<00:01:02.250> good

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
those six guys will end up being a good

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.070 
those six guys will end up being a good
match<00:01:02.610> not<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.240> I<00:01:03.270> don't<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.690> do<00:01:03.930> it

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
match not so that I don't have to do it

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.649 
match not so that I don't have to do it
will<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.619> explain<00:01:04.890> how<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.309> works<00:01:05.610> oh<00:01:05.850> gosh

well you know you it's in three it since

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.499 
well you know you it's in three it since
it's<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.140> stage<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:11.009> two<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.430> three<00:01:11.729> we're<00:01:12.299> in

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.870 
it's a stage one two and three we're in
stage<00:01:12.810> one<00:01:13.079> obviously<00:01:13.710> they're<00:01:14.610> going<00:01:14.820> to

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
stage one obviously they're going to

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.670 
stage one obviously they're going to
fight<00:01:15.060> each<00:01:15.210> other<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.690> you<00:01:15.960> get<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> point<00:01:16.530> for

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
fight each other and you get a point for

fight each other and you get a point for
a<00:01:16.830> win<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:18.120> get<00:01:18.330> an<00:01:18.570> extra<00:01:18.840> point<00:01:19.350> for<00:01:19.470> a

right<00:02:57.500> now<00:02:57.680> tell<00:02:58.070> us<00:02:58.100> why<00:02:58.340> well<00:02:58.940> you<00:02:59.090> know<00:02:59.180> I

right now tell us why well you know I

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.880 
right now tell us why well you know I
think<00:02:59.660> it<00:02:59.750> is<00:02:59.780> because<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.260> products<00:03:00.680> better

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
think it is because the products better

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.610 
think it is because the products better
on<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:02.240> product<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.840> boxing<00:03:03.260> is<00:03:03.320> putting<00:03:03.530> out

there<00:03:03.830> now<00:03:04.010> is<00:03:05.000> I<00:03:05.360> think<00:03:05.510> better<00:03:05.960> than<00:03:06.230> it<00:03:06.320> has

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
there now is I think better than it has

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.470 
there now is I think better than it has
been<00:03:06.470> for<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.920> couple<00:03:06.980> decades<00:03:07.490> the<00:03:07.640> 1990s<00:03:08.330> to

from<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.410> mainstream<00:03:33.590> media<00:03:33.980> in<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.250> United

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
from the mainstream media in the United

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.280 
from the mainstream media in the United
States<00:03:34.580> but<00:03:34.910> it<00:03:35.030> is<00:03:35.150> covered<00:03:35.510> well<00:03:35.690> around<00:03:36.110> the

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
States but it is covered well around the

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.260 
States but it is covered well around the
world<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:36.740> I<00:03:37.370> think<00:03:37.670> boxing<00:03:37.790> is<00:03:38.090> better

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
world and I think boxing is better

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.330 
world and I think boxing is better
because<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.840> fights<00:03:39.140> that<00:03:39.290> fans<00:03:39.830> want<00:03:40.160> to<00:03:40.310> see

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
because the fights that fans want to see

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.260 
because the fights that fans want to see
are<00:03:40.700> being<00:03:41.150> made<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:41.750> I<00:03:42.530> think<00:03:42.890> also<00:03:43.270> boxing

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
are being made and I think also boxing

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.180 
are being made and I think also boxing
has<00:03:44.360> gained<00:03:44.660> exponentially<00:03:45.470> in<00:03:45.650> terms<00:03:45.860> of<00:03:46.010> its

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
has gained exponentially in terms of its

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.160 
has gained exponentially in terms of its
audience<00:03:46.580> around<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.300> world<00:03:47.480> one<00:03:47.960> great

audience around the world one great

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.040 
audience around the world one great
product<00:03:48.680> that<00:03:48.830> box<00:03:49.040> can<00:03:49.280> have<00:03:49.490> I'll<00:03:50.390> burn<00:03:50.750> some
