00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.990
 to plum anti-fall shawl that they sell in 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.990
 supermarkets and pharmacies 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.980
 what a good question then the truth the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.980
 true 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.930
 what happens is one thing for example if a 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.820
 I lose my hair because I'm 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.050
 stressed what is the cause that I have to 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:36.430
 go fight and therefore the shampoo 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:39.580
 influences no but there is a p at least one 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.070
 20% in 10% good but but I agree 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.780
 but but it's not that people will take action 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.059
 my hair is falling here I'm going to 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.339
 buy expensive shampoo because the fabric 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.570
 it seems someone does not fund the sun in the 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.040
 background what I want to say when 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.470
 you lose your hair you have a doubt 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.780
 is the oily hair is with dandruff 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.180
 first you have to do that day not 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.970
 he washes it and goes to his dermatologist to 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.470
 let's see what we're talking about 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.629
 also we have asked how is 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.790
 thyroid thyroid is a great 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.360
 cause and here and see see it and what anemia 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.250
 then you think constantly 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.310
 and when everyone has already spent everything 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:19.470
 and says doctor who has spent all 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:28.160
 cosmetic things that give us of 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:31.650
 I can not ask a question license 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.150
 PhD and I've always thought about it 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.410
 comment that people who drop it 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.270
 much hair that is not when one can 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.340
 stop the fall but not that it comes out 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.380
 more that's also another question is 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.390
 good to wash your hair every day there 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.850
 people who prefer not to stop this 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.610
 hair show in the jane tub by 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.250
 to have it twice a week was good 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.320
 wrong sometimes the fact that you see it 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.119
 every day but it does not mean that it 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.869
 you finish more hair of the other question 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.869
 the peeling 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:05.730
 the bare one tells you doctor is that the shower 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.730
 seems that no patter 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.160
 every day the hair and the shower that you 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.690
 blows because we are talking about not here 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.300
 we are talking about inside the leather 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:28.360
 scalp where the hair root is and 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:30.910
 second thing every day with 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.800
 next hopefully always fix when 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:39.760
 they buy the shampoo I tell them if the ph 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.230
 neutral was already almost 5.5 so no 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.390
 have a lot of detergent because if 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.700
 we started to start growing my little hair 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.280
 boy because I already tried, I'm more 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.830
 calm everything and I put on a shampoo 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.740
 poor quality or one who does not come 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.140
 just twists or little hair to die 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.630
 are just coming out or I opened another 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.120
 I had the idea that I would go out again 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.069
 hair and one looks at it in the exam 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.989
 dermatological symptoms as the 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.970
 little hairs have suddenly noticed 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.269
 that you can do the mirror and have 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.879
 a few guys that grow or but 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:17.610
 that are cut explore new to new 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.610
 that are coming out of the garden
