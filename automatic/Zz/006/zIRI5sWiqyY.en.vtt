00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.260
 although, well, let's start a 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:13.180
 unlocking process by means of 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:16.510
 email codes with an iphone 3gs and what 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.150
 let's do through the page to be 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:23.320
 a locker dot net that here is going to 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.749
 it looks good because it's going to 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.869
 provide the respective code 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:32.770
 by emailing the same team that 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:37.120
 we can take out in the 3gs by the process 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.910
 of asterisk cat 06 cat there we have the 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.850
 email of the team right now we are 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.350
 accessing the page to be a blogger 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.710
 Y 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.960
 let's wait for it to open I feel a 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:58.070
 little slow and good let's do the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.070
 request of this code 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:07.229
 here is the page that we are going to 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.229
 open let's wait nothing else load 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.900
 Y 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.620
 let's do the first part that is 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.630
 the purchase of the code 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:22.610
 this is a process that can be done 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.650
 for 3gs for 4 and for 4 s also that 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.270
 it's safer because using software 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.320
 lately we have seen that it 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.180
 complicates the unlocking of the 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.940
 apple teams then here we are 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.330
 already in the initial page a locker we go 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:42.260
 to go to what is the brands here is 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.330
 iphone we click and then we will 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.610
 enter the part where the 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.610
 model computer model 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.090
 then we go a little down going 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.630
 this video here asks us for the model 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.490
 of the team 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.280
 we select in this part where it says 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.880
 select your model and we will ask for 3gs 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.290
 He also has them and since 3g 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.000
 good email well we know that it is more 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.730
 sure it is from the factory that is legal 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.220
 even unlocking then we're going to 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.560
 go to once selected 3gs to 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.090
 select our operator that in this 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.490
 case, the safest thing is that 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.350
 client we have not reviewed it but let's go 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.120
 to see right now in the team 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.120
 that the operator 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.170
 and here he tells us 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:37.030
 so then we select here 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.030
 usa and 16 and haiti in you 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.930
 let's now place the email that 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.930
 we had taken out 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.170
 keyboard asterisk cat 06 cat and here 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.750
 the email that we are going to type appears 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.730
 here in the part of the screen also 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.730
 which in this case is this 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:13.040
 there are 5,961 in the completion there we have 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.790
 already the code entered now is called 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.250
 to the button the option to look for code 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.200
 immediately you are going to verify the 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.739
 e-mail 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.920
 of our team and quickly throws us already 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.890
 a cost the cost here is what we see 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.720
 dollar and obviously we're here 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.290
 corroborates so that we arrive that the 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.980
 data correspond to those of the team 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.099
 indeed they were the ones we had 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.269
 entered once we realize 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.890
 that if it's the team that we're going to 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.000
 unblock good then nothing else 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.640
 we fill in the corresponding fields 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.750
 where he asks for the name 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.750
 the surname 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.450
 and then an email address where 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:00.400
 we will get the information that 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.510
 The company provides us we give 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.790
 these two options below are 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.980
 optional the above are 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.270
 obligatory then those I leave them 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.610
 free that is a phone number 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.550
 staff and member number 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.430
 Well, we jump them and we're going to 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.350
 execute the order here no longer 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.989
 redirect to another window in another 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.470
 page where you no longer make us a receipt 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.210
 here are my data corroborated that are 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.630
 correct 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.120
 and they are indeed correct and go back to 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.979
 appear the cost of the code here 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.900
 pigeons where he puts us terms and 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.400
 conditions that we already know them we have 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.860
 worked a lot with this company and 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.050
 Well, we already know that there is no 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.419
 no inconvenience then we give 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.520
 unblock now that is the part where 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:51.050
 it is not sent to the paypal page 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.180
 here we are already on the paypal page 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.680
 Here he sends us the cost in dollars and 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.720
 now does not transfer it according to the 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.110
 paypal exchange rate 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.110
 and 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.060
 I enter my password to enter my 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:10.849
 paypal page there we are already I think that 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:15.960
 it was not correct let me transit 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:18.710
 then here we are again 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.610
 and 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:25.480
 some to certain forgiveness I'm 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.610
 being short 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.950
 ok we hope it has not blocked us 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.780
 the income twice wrong 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.940
 here is now if you are not 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.740
 redirecting and we're entering now if 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.260
 here he tells us the card number and we 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:42.330
 says the cost for pesos and has translated 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:47.110
 according to the rate the exchange rate of the day 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:50.500
 This already indicates the quantity and good 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.710
 Well since we corroborate that if it's all 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.080
 we pay here I give the button pay now 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.520
 and there already once I make the payment 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:02.790
 immediately in my mail is going to 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.790
 appear a receipt that sends me 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:11.350
 send me to be a locker to my mail 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:13.599
 here is where refreshment came in here and 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.620
 here we have a receipt where we see the 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:19.210
 paypal security seal then 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.940
 This receipt is good because it tells us that 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.560
 the first step is done is going to 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.470
 arrive immediately after another 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:30.000
 I receive this is a receipt here 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:32.100
 arrives at another receipt the official receipt 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.460
 and this is also the first two that 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:38.190
 they arrive to us then already in then in a while 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.260
 in a few hours or minutes depending on how 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.300
 are working send us the 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.520
 unblock for now because that's the 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.530
 first part and then already the second 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.490
 part would be already once we receive the 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.770
 indication that we have been 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.900
 unlocked and nothing else 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:55.230
 connect to itunes with the most 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:57.000
 recent and the phone simply 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.890
 easy unlocks for now 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.270
 there we leave it in the first part and 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:03.150
 right now we have the next 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.460
 code we elaborate the second part of the 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:09.230
 video to continue with the 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.230
 explanation and conclude this process
