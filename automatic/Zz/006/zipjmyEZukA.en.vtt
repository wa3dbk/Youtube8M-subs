00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
anyway the reason that the the full

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.950 
anyway the reason that the the full
motion<00:04:36.699> video<00:04:37.090> you<00:04:37.270> might<00:04:37.389> see<00:04:37.569> it<00:04:37.750> looks<00:04:37.900> a

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
motion video you might see it looks a

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.719 
motion video you might see it looks a
little<00:04:38.050> bit<00:04:38.289> grainy<00:04:38.530> it's<00:04:39.189> because<00:04:39.460> ace

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
little bit grainy it's because ace

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.899 
little bit grainy it's because ace
actually<00:04:40.210> has<00:04:40.419> about<00:04:41.430> 4,100<00:04:42.430> vision<00:04:42.819> you

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:42.909 
actually has about 4,100 vision you

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.360

that's the problem

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.089 
that's the problem
