also<00:00:30.329> allows<00:00:30.570> us<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.079> have<00:00:31.230> gestures<00:00:31.769> that

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
also allows us to have gestures that

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.530 
also allows us to have gestures that
ever<00:00:32.160> let's<00:00:32.340> move<00:00:32.520> right<00:00:32.550> away

the<00:00:37.079> other<00:00:37.199> thing<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.500> we<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.949> technology

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the other thing that we have technology

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.580 
the other thing that we have technology
watch<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.850> proximity<00:00:39.180> sensing<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.199> actually

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
watch the proximity sensing so actually

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.689 
watch the proximity sensing so actually
knows<00:00:40.770> when<00:00:41.039> we're<00:00:41.190> here

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
knows when we're here

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.459 
knows when we're here
so<00:00:42.879> a<00:00:42.910> year<00:00:43.149> premier<00:00:43.570> and<00:00:43.809> your<00:00:44.289> end

interfacing with the system in an outlay

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:47.700 
interfacing with the system in an outlay
for<00:00:46.329> instance<00:00:46.629> it<00:00:46.960> will<00:00:47.109> display<00:00:47.440> all<00:00:47.500> the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
for instance it will display all the

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.919 
for instance it will display all the
information<00:00:48.399> and<00:00:48.820> here<00:00:49.089> take<00:00:49.539> your<00:00:49.659> hand<00:00:49.839> away

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:49.929 
information and here take your hand away

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:51.479 
information and here take your hand away
from<00:00:50.079> the<00:00:50.260> stream<00:00:50.559> to<00:00:50.710> here<00:00:50.829> drive<00:00:51.100> in<00:00:51.280> a<00:00:51.339> lot

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
from the stream to here drive in a lot

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.340 
from the stream to here drive in a lot
it'll<00:00:52.089> actually<00:00:52.269> remove<00:00:52.809> some<00:00:52.839> of<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.199> less

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
it'll actually remove some of the less

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.959 
it'll actually remove some of the less
important<00:00:53.769> elements<00:00:54.159> that<00:00:54.190> really<00:00:54.699> up<00:00:54.850> the

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
important elements that really up the

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.899 
important elements that really up the
display<00:00:55.390> make<00:00:55.960> it<00:00:56.079> easier<00:00:56.350> to<00:00:56.379> see<00:00:56.589> the<00:00:56.909> other

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
display make it easier to see the other

00:00:57.909 --> 00:00:59.310 
display make it easier to see the other
neat<00:00:58.120> thing<00:00:58.149> is<00:00:58.359> at<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.719> bottom<00:00:58.989> of<00:00:59.049> the<00:00:59.140> face

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
neat thing is at the bottom of the face

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.420 
neat thing is at the bottom of the face
right<00:00:59.589> here<00:00:59.769> we<00:00:59.949> have

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.400 

so<00:01:04.970> this<00:01:05.090> is<00:01:05.150> a<00:01:05.180> perfect<00:01:05.600> storage<00:01:05.930> area<00:01:06.230> for

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
so this is a perfect storage area for

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.140 
so this is a perfect storage area for
your<00:01:06.500> phone<00:01:06.770> whether<00:01:07.130> it<00:01:07.280> be<00:01:07.400> an<00:01:07.520> iPhone<00:01:07.940> or

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
your phone whether it be an iPhone or

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.520 
your phone whether it be an iPhone or
hand

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.200 

it's<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> nice<00:01:11.010> rubber<00:01:11.280> lined<00:01:11.550> area<00:01:11.910> so<00:01:12.060> it's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
it's a nice rubber lined area so it's

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.000 
it's a nice rubber lined area so it's
not<00:01:12.300> gonna<00:01:12.480> slide<00:01:12.600> around<00:01:12.780> there's<00:01:13.620> also<00:01:13.800> a

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
not gonna slide around there's also a

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:22.090 
not gonna slide around there's also a
USB<00:01:14.670> Drive<00:01:14.940> in<00:01:15.120> there<00:01:15.210> as<00:01:15.360> well

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.180 

we're<00:01:23.100> also<00:01:23.220> allowing<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.940> unprecedented

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
we're also allowing the unprecedented

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.930 
we're also allowing the unprecedented
customizability<00:01:26.190> with<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.520> precepts

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
customizability with the precepts

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.300 
customizability with the precepts
usually<00:01:27.810> presets<00:01:28.260> are<00:01:28.410> just<00:01:28.590> radio<00:01:28.890> stations

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
usually presets are just radio stations

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.160 
usually presets are just radio stations
but<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.790> case<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.390> set<00:01:30.570> anything<00:01:31.050> as

but in this case you can set anything as

but in this case you can set anything as
a<00:01:31.200> preset<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.100> if<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.370> look<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.729> a
