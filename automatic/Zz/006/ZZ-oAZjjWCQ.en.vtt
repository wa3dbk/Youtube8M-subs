already completed as you can see 110 but

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.490 
already completed as you can see 110 but
the<00:01:23.130> thing<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:24.570> has<00:01:24.750> been<00:01:24.960> glitching<00:01:25.380> out

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
the thing is it has been glitching out

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.679 
the thing is it has been glitching out
for<00:01:25.770> me<00:01:25.890> maybe<00:01:26.130> because<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.820> might<00:01:27.180> my

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
for me maybe because that might my

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.990 
for me maybe because that might my
storage<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.590> filled<00:01:28.920> with<00:01:29.130> eggs<00:01:29.369> or<00:01:29.729> something

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
storage is filled with eggs or something

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.870 
storage is filled with eggs or something
as<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:31.020> see<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.770> egg<00:01:31.950> kind<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.369> goes<00:01:32.549> on

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
as you can see the egg kind of goes on

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.960 
as you can see the egg kind of goes on
and<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.650> there<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.430> Franky

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
and on and on so there is the Franky

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.710 
and on and on so there is the Franky
dragon<00:01:36.420> right<00:01:36.689> there<00:01:37.430> at<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.670> bottom<00:01:38.850> what

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
dragon right there at the bottom what

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.870 
dragon right there at the bottom what
we're<00:01:39.869> gonna<00:01:39.990> do<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.470> try<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.740> place<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.369> into

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
we're gonna do is try to place it into

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.560 
we're gonna do is try to place it into
the<00:01:42.810> game<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:44.130> cannot<00:01:44.399> add<00:01:44.640> more<00:01:45.060> buildings

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the game you cannot add more buildings

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.080 
the game you cannot add more buildings
of<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:45.869> kind<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.500> not<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> building<00:01:47.189> so

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
of this kind this is not a building so

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.940 
of this kind this is not a building so
as<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.360> can<00:01:48.450> see<00:01:48.509> there<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.930> more<00:01:49.110> glitches<00:01:49.770> I

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
as you can see there is more glitches I

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.210 
as you can see there is more glitches I
guess<00:01:50.780> let's<00:01:51.780> delete<00:01:52.110> some<00:01:52.409> eggs<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.890> see<00:01:53.100> if

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
guess let's delete some eggs to see if

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.859 
guess let's delete some eggs to see if
that<00:01:53.340> actually<00:01:53.399> fixes<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:56.479> alright<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.630> arrow

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
that actually fixes it alright so arrow

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.830 
that actually fixes it alright so arrow
we<00:01:58.110> go<00:01:58.229> we<00:01:58.380> got<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.590> reload<00:01:59.009> again<00:01:59.719> you<00:02:00.719> know

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
we go we got to reload again you know

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.530 
we go we got to reload again you know
I'm<00:02:01.799> not<00:02:02.100> really<00:02:02.280> sure<00:02:02.549> why<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:03.210> kind<00:02:03.420> of

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
I'm not really sure why it's kind of

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.590 
I'm not really sure why it's kind of
glitching<00:02:04.079> out<00:02:04.549> I've<00:02:05.549> been<00:02:05.850> getting<00:02:06.119> glitches

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
glitching out I've been getting glitches

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.190 
gonna do is place the dragon into the
habitat<00:03:10.879> all<00:03:11.879> right<00:03:12.389> I<00:03:12.419> don't<00:03:12.510> know<00:03:12.719> if<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:12.959> want

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
habitat all right I don't know if I want

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.649 
habitat all right I don't know if I want
it<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.349> go<00:03:13.590> there<00:03:13.969> let's<00:03:14.969> look<00:03:15.150> at<00:03:15.269> that<00:03:15.389> again

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
it to go there let's look at that again

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.500 
it to go there let's look at that again
so<00:03:16.379> this<00:03:16.560> is<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:17.310> Frankie<00:03:17.729> dragon<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.239> an

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
so this is the Frankie dragon is an

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.580 
so this is the Frankie dragon is an
element<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.109> terror<00:03:19.829> and<00:03:20.810> electric<00:03:21.810> all<00:03:22.379> right

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
element of terror and electric all right

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.110 
element of terror and electric all right
I<00:03:22.620> guess<00:03:22.889> we<00:03:23.040> only<00:03:23.159> have<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.609> electric

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
I guess we only have the electric

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.300 
I guess we only have the electric
habitat<00:03:24.599> so<00:03:24.840> we<00:03:24.989> might<00:03:25.229> as<00:03:25.379> well<00:03:25.409> place<00:03:25.919> it<00:03:25.949> in

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
habitat so we might as well place it in

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.030 
habitat so we might as well place it in
there<00:03:29.689> okay<00:03:30.689> so<00:03:30.750> going<00:03:31.139> into<00:03:31.439> the<00:03:31.680> Frankie

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
there okay so going into the Frankie

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.000 
there okay so going into the Frankie
dragon<00:03:32.370> as<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:32.579> can<00:03:32.699> see<00:03:32.849> the<00:03:32.970> Frankie<00:03:33.389> dragon

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
dragon as you can see the Frankie dragon

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.649 
dragon as you can see the Frankie dragon
looks<00:03:35.010> like<00:03:35.159> Frankenstein<00:03:35.760> of<00:03:35.819> course<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:36.449> mean

looks like Frankenstein of course I mean

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.929 
looks like Frankenstein of course I mean
it<00:03:37.049> is<00:03:37.229> based<00:03:37.500> on<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.829> Frankenstein<00:03:38.489> design

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:38.939 
it is based on the Frankenstein design

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:42.589 
it is based on the Frankenstein design
and<00:03:39.180> his<00:03:39.750> kind<00:03:40.079> of<00:03:40.139> uh<00:03:40.319> I<00:03:40.709> guess<00:03:41.699> those<00:03:41.939> bolts

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
and his kind of uh I guess those bolts

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
animation he does it seems like he's

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.110

kind<00:04:17.690> of<00:04:17.810> breathing<00:04:18.079> and<00:04:18.470> then<00:04:18.949> these<00:04:19.609> bolts

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
kind of breathing and then these bolts

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.540 
kind of breathing and then these bolts
fall<00:04:20.570> apart<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.229> his<00:04:21.560> entire<00:04:21.919> thing<00:04:22.250> falls

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
apart and he re-engineers himself so

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.230 
apart and he re-engineers himself so
that's<00:04:26.570> basically<00:04:27.139> it<00:04:27.470> that<00:04:28.250> is<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:28.759> Frankie
