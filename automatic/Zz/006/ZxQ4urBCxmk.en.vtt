00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
the one hand it makes sense the dorm is

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.099 
the one hand it makes sense the dorm is
your<00:00:17.580> living<00:00:17.820> space<00:00:17.970> at<00:00:18.600> least<00:00:18.660> for<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.960> first

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
your living space at least for the first

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.630 
your living space at least for the first
two<00:00:19.350> years<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.619> Tufts<00:00:19.920> becomes<00:00:20.400> your<00:00:20.550> home

away from home

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.230 
away from home
but<00:00:22.980> what's<00:00:23.100> harder<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.580> convey<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.210> I

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
but what's harder to convey is that I

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.330 
but what's harder to convey is that I
think<00:00:24.330> this<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> wrong<00:00:25.170> question<00:00:25.410> all

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
right so these are just some questions

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.410 
right so these are just some questions
