 and if you do not apologize as he said there in 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.590
 the description of the video the channel comes 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.560
 being an express 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.770

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:40.160

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.820
 hit the player break tnt normal not 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:56.270
 knock explode hold you with bow 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.450
 thief + 4 kill to see who 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.960
 knows but that they have to kill themselves 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.960
 they have to kill 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.680
 put a car these robbery grab 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.880
 louis 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.880
 something and I was this 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.619
 I use a car this is going up I do not know how 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:16.990
 I advance it I think now with this 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.420
 lever but 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.520
 let's say it does not work well either fine 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.520
 is that I would recommend 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:31.430
 and put like this 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.060
 and then put the car there 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.060
 good 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.450
 is that it is very close to the lime is that 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.600
 I have it on so I had planned 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.330
 for this I would recommend putting it that way and 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.100
 then not so expensive 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.010
 but that you get out of the car before 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.250
 put tree print finish like this but 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.650
 if it's okay to have a small bankrupt 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.560
 if we can go on foot well the after 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:07.080
 this are four players and I think 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.080
 come on here is the other car and new 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.230
 they are four players I think this because 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.220
 there is an entry 23 are 4 truth I do not know 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.700
 why she says 18 but it's okay 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.180
 tonight 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.349
 would give us what are apple biscuits 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.660
 gold hat cap pants pants per se 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.370
 They had resistance to fire because they did not 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.209
 splash hard 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.209
 of the flint 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.020
 the shovel the bow and these things 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.410
 although I think the most important thing would come 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.140
 being the diamond blade and the 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.790
 lighter the flint we would get 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.790
 this very nice 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.880
 and we would come out good here I am but it would be 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.220
 leave here here another here another boat 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.080
 and what we would do is remove the conce 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.540
 in the snow with this so that the others 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.040
 players fall down and move to 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.040
 next to the next 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.900
 because the hole because what happens is 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:22.799
 that if they gave it to him from above, 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.379
 it burned was not lit what it did was 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.080
 turn it aside so that it would light clear 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.120
 not 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.460
 however, it is very difficult to give 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.810
 every hole so I will come to you saying 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.630
 that with the lighter they were 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.630
 giving like this 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.310
 of the plane burn the other play but 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.230
 you know they are your rules 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.410
 in the description of the video to the channel the 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.020
 map that is in the American version and 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.440
 in the European version and more than anything 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.320
 upload the map for what 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.520
 encourage those who send their maps and 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:00.300
 I upload them to the channel giving him the credit 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:04.890
 do not steal maps 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.000
 well they already know likes subscribe and 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.160
 comment 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.290
 because they almost never comment to me and I read 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.830
 all the comments you feel with 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.410
 you want that has already given me commented 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.540
 and they do not tell me to comment if they 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.430
 liked they did not like to tell me if they have 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:26.320
 a map and left it in the description of 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:26.320
 video the dani channel was called dani and 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.600

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.600
 Y 

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:38.759
 but there is also there is also 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:41.710

 Horrible this will not be of firewood 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.900
 this healthy wheel is not but but 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.860
