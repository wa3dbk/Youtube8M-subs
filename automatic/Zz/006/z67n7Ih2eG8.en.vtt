00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.290
 p 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.920
 despite all attempts to attack the convoy of nonsense 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.560
 and I've been working for about 15 years, both the professor and the 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.670
 professional 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.770
 at that moment 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.770
 from the beginning a rest came to acs 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.770
 the public also in Spain and 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.550
 continental in houston poll 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.810
 the country was already completely that is precise 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.820
 the biggest is about the students 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.820
 can do the step 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.720
 or it is colored 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.230
 but we are even more the subject of the sketch 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.040
 previous info 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.020
 and the via crucis bouquets 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.610
 more mature 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.610
 there was also a debate that not only reviews aspects 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.610
 in the writing are artist 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.010
 different charges 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.010
 besides the page 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.400
 until the break when now neither 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.860
 Basque caught 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.860
 i 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.060
 first of all 3 negreira and those responsible 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.109
 depending on the Italian Republic 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:14.659
 selected 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.939
 that is to say never mans anything what you are not time session 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.639
 the four members 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.929
 cheese awards where you like to do apart from a little 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:26.369
 some people besides the remains 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:29.529
 However 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:30.889
 and above all to carry 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:32.559
 the best time 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:36.019
 the sectors are not going to spend a whole morning did not complete its transfer 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.229
 it is titled 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:43.229
 and obviously think that this is not the best 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.930
 plans to provide the place were object since this went very well 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.449
 journalists 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:53.709
 sepe and the effect 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.910
 regarding the initial choices that a good selection is made 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:03.709
 because its costs 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:04.879
 the beginning 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.419
 the Spanish market 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:10.419
 there are not dozens of our own production what there is 

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:14.339
 emuls product import 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:17.339
 that's why they have basically become the draw 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.889
 the international fairs 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:24.189
 in that we have some luck 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.189
 you have contact with a lot of this one 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.719
 more closed 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:35.719
 how bad we have 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.999
 in temuco caÃ±o 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:42.389
 but you do have data with that defensive style 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.469
 different ways 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:48.199
 that yes that the deputies are witness to palmer has much to do with the people 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:51.199
 that comes out later 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.049
 years ago from Spain they changed 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.369
 efe school 

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:56.459
 Spanish comic 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.759
 the committee 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:00.759
 we have already suffered called problems or tutor 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.879
 well independent 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.879
 i so the sales 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.119
 Then there is the French market 

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:17.539
 It is a very big market that is that they have national production 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.539
 that coexisted with some production has 

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:24.559
 but it has been to the pitch 

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:27.559
 and has cement for sale is strong 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.009
 those for the American comics industry 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.669
 they are almost like 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.180
 unnim 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.509
 the great pagan 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:46.800
 the sip is much more 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.009
 in principle what is inherited 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:50.340
 american comic 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.340
 we were a little bit you're seeing more dependent 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.879
 and japan we tore back
