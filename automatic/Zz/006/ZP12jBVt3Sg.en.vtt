we put it on the two thousand ohm

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.950 
we put it on the two thousand ohm
setting<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.160> reading<00:03:56.790> so<00:03:57.540> that<00:03:57.720> we<00:03:57.810> can

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
setting a reading so that we can

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.070 
setting a reading so that we can
properly<00:03:58.200> test<00:03:58.650> this<00:03:59.540> we<00:04:00.540> set<00:04:00.780> this<00:04:00.900> aside

here<00:04:02.690> now<00:04:03.690> on<00:04:03.930> your<00:04:04.140> multimeter<00:04:04.620> there's

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
here now on your multimeter there's

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.880 
here now on your multimeter there's
going<00:04:05.100> to<00:04:05.160> be<00:04:05.220> two<00:04:05.550> two<00:04:06.150> leads<00:04:06.470> it<00:04:07.470> doesn't

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
going to be two two leads it doesn't

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.850 
going to be two two leads it doesn't
matter<00:04:08.100> which<00:04:08.490> color<00:04:08.880> black<00:04:09.510> or

read<00:04:09.980> you<00:04:10.400> connect<00:04:10.760> to<00:04:10.880> which<00:04:11.060> wire<00:04:11.360> because

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
read you connect to which wire because

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.410 
read you connect to which wire because
this<00:04:11.990> is<00:04:12.230> a<00:04:12.260> closed<00:04:12.740> circuit<00:04:13.280> so<00:04:13.970> it<00:04:14.000> doesn't

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
this is a closed circuit so it doesn't

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:25.159 
this is a closed circuit so it doesn't
make<00:04:14.570> any<00:04:14.690> difference

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.950 

one<00:04:25.740> thing<00:04:25.949> I<00:04:26.039> will<00:04:26.280> say<00:04:26.310> is<00:04:26.849> when<00:04:27.479> doing<00:04:27.810> this

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
one thing I will say is when doing this

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.580 
one thing I will say is when doing this
test<00:04:28.319> you<00:04:28.979> cannot<00:04:29.490> have<00:04:30.090> these<00:04:30.479> two<00:04:30.840> leads

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
test you cannot have these two leads

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.070 
test you cannot have these two leads
touch<00:04:31.949> each<00:04:32.099> other<00:04:32.360> because<00:04:33.360> it<00:04:33.689> will<00:04:33.930> give

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
touch each other because it will give

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.689 
touch each other because it will give
you<00:04:34.229> a<00:04:34.259> false<00:04:34.499> range<00:04:34.830> so<00:04:35.099> please<00:04:35.340> make<00:04:35.490> sure

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699

down<00:04:49.889> in<00:04:50.189> the<00:04:50.759> empty<00:04:51.090> position<00:04:51.889> so<00:04:52.889> this

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:53.159 
down in the empty position so this

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:55.700 
down in the empty position so this
reading<00:04:53.580> is<00:04:53.789> within<00:04:54.029> spec<00:04:54.560> for<00:04:55.560> this

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
reading is within spec for this

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.249 
reading is within spec for this
particular<00:04:56.009> assembly<00:04:56.520> as<00:04:56.879> you<00:04:57.599> can<00:04:57.750> see<00:04:58.050> we

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
particular assembly as you can see we

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.409 
particular assembly as you can see we
move<00:04:58.469> this<00:04:58.650> lower<00:04:58.889> arm<00:04:59.219> all<00:04:59.520> the<00:04:59.550> way<00:04:59.849> up<00:05:00.180> and

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
move this lower arm all the way up and

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.260 
move this lower arm all the way up and
you<00:05:01.020> can<00:05:01.199> see<00:05:01.469> that<00:05:02.069> the<00:05:02.219> resistance<00:05:02.759> changes

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
you can see that the resistance changes

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.839 
you can see that the resistance changes
as<00:05:03.509> it<00:05:03.569> goes<00:05:04.349> up

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849
