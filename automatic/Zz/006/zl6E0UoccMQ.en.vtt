00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.900
 woman Chancellor 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.820
 tomorrow you go to the festive concert of the 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.570
 fiftieth anniversary of berliner 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.890
 philharmonic 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.710
 Remember her first 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.200
 visit in the sharon building exactly 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.790
 not anymore though the philharmonic one 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.130
 place was at that already shortly after 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.790
 wall fall yes special concerts took place 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.590
 and that the fall of the wall was welcomed 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.810
 but I remember an event 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.290
 me of course that was that 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.240
 festive event on the third october 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.980
 1990 the took place in the philharmonie 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.960
 and of course that was a special one 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.990
 moving event although there 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.670
 Music did not stand in the foreground 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.100
 His architecture was designed by Hans Sharoun 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.110
 a place of shared experience 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.239
 create music which role plays 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.710
 music in your life 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.530
 the philharmonic's a still 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.900
 really extraordinarily successful 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.340
 building and architect sharon has 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.140
 done a great job here 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.450
 both in terms of the outside view as 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.820
 also concerning the music experience and 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.680
 it is not for nothing that the theme of the 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.350
 fiftieth anniversary of the Philharmonic 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.240
 I also go for Raumklang myself 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.940
 very much like to the philharmonic because 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.940
 music and spectators grasp each other 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.400
 merge and music play in my 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.070
 Living a big role I am one 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.990
 Klassikfan also hear a lot in the radio 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.610
 Classic and visitors again and again 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.990
 Of course, not only the concerts 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.000
 philharmonic but also that 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.720
 concert house at gendarmenmarkt the operas 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.580
 here in Berlin 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.700
 Berlin, for example, has one really 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.549
 rich offer of musical 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.409
 You have possibilities yourself once 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.159
 learned an instrument and if not 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.170
 which would have fascinated you i have 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.850
 learned to play flute and then too 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.950
 something piano but I have not 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.960
 exposed as very talented and 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.290
 At some point that is set 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.860
 been but 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:10.759
 I like house music and sing very much 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.950
 myself very much and insofar is music 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.720
 not just something I receive 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.460
 but whenever there is a possibility 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.870
 sometimes to sing folk songs or 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.270
 I like doing that 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.700
 has been broadcasting for several years 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.860
 berliner philharmonie also organizes its concerts 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.110
 on the internet you believe that the medium 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.760
 internet classic formats like 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.920
 Exhibitions and concerts sometime 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.750
 I do not think that's it 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.300
 but replaces it is a good supplement 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.060
 Often there are interesting concerts 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.160
 not to be visited by everyone 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.950
 can because the cards are not enough 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.440
 and you can then also 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.209
 These concerts take part with 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.209
 Exhibitions will become part of today 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.440
 also shown on the internet and virtual 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.050
 just for people who maybe 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.510
 Nearly the music is very very 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.970
 interesting as well as of course 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.910
 possibilities in the internet itself 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.130
 to look at meetings of works where 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.060
 then also shown as samples 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.340
 expire 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.930
 Access to modern music 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.180
 example, the conductor of the Philharmonic 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.090
 his red bull has a wonderful 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.010
 series of dvds released the us 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.150
 access to the music of the twentieth 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.680
 opening in the 20th century 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.650
 all of these are new technical ones 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.790
 possibilities that I find very good 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.769
 music is an important pillar of 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.630
 German culture which contributes 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.970
 the federal government for their care and 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.250
 to promote their culture 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.250
 responsibility is essentially yes 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.630
 in the countries but the federal government does too 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.580
 something is about it 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.700
 framework conditions for example 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.410
 reduced VAT rate in the area 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.570
 culture and thus also in the field of 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.120
 music these are the framework conditions 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.820
 set by federal legislation 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.239
 and then the federal government supports 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.190
 of course certain lighthouse projects 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.080
 as an example you can do the bach 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.600
 take archive in Leipzig or we 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.780
 also support the bayreuther 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.400
 festival 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.110
 There are a lot of activities 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.450
 not only in the field of classic 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.610
 music but also modern music 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.739
 from pop of jazz and the like 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.980
 and of course we have the giant 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:16.370
 competition youth plays a wide 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.670
 movement in Germany and promotes here 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.510
 the 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:22.850
 Federal Ministry for Family Youth and 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.500
 seniors and women that these 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.190
 competition and there are already many 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.940
 excellent soloists about this 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.890
 youth competition also discovered very early 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.050
 and an initiative of the 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.730
 minister of culture together with 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.520
 every child is also welcome to the countries 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.160
 instrument that has in North Rhine 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.490
 Westphalia started as a pilot project 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.040
 and has found many imitators 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.050
 and the more people actively music themselves 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.100
 make the more friends of music 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.100
 Of course, there will be
