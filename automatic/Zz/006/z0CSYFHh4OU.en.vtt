00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
perspective we just felt like a lot of

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.700 
perspective we just felt like a lot of
the<00:00:08.639> camps<00:00:09.030> were<00:00:09.090> pretty<00:00:10.050> expensive<00:00:10.380> out

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
the guys came together and figured we

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.450
