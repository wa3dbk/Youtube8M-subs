00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.500
 why, everything has become so oblique over the years 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.569
 simply because the history of art the all prices Chen stories 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.030
 due to lower motives is the two 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.780
 most important motives we are now closer to 6 course 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.390
 Naturally 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.929
 we come to the essential 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.190
 the artists of the twentieth century seem to have almost no Chen 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.159
 To be afraid of someday 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:36.790
 to be considered normal 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.130
 where is certainly brave would be a picture of Francis Bacon in St 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.109
 he is much braver 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.109
 Invite Francis Bacon himself to dinner 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.630
 are not considered particularly well-balanced people 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.889
 can you see it 

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:59.850
 What we now call art is not what you used to call art 

00:00:59.849 --> 00:01:01.150
 the art a purpose 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.910
 the picture of reality 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.910
 and the appearance of the invisible in the special tour area 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.010
 two tractors 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.130
 What we now take art is, so to speak, misused 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.100
 8th 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.100
 for Zamora if existence right 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.220
 with a trick 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.030
 4 existence of the video 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.190
 this is coming 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.980
 and the art will festive four seasons in French 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.710
 but what does all this have to do with six in the Grand Prix I declare Lapo is lag 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.810
 a nice thing like 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.710
 Lit dd 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.530
 Make politics 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.320
 but my editor Zwick tenants attributed heavy and Alba coats too 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.800
 why is he doing that probably meant Abbas if the 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.429
 complete freedom and I had to turn completely through and probably 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.050
 That's right 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.210
 It is important to most people that what they do makes sense, however 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.320
 the modernists took it without meaning 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.660
 yes partly to work against the film 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.950
 "It was all up to them to devote themselves to theme style with being off the ground 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.190
 stay 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.300
 this will not lead to normal people being the 7 and me and in areas 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.399
 in particular 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:14.989
 from editor 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.560
 we are reluctant to go 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.750
 ladies and gentlemen 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.859
 must have been for advanced 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:25.079
 the state of the art with which we would be on topic 6 everywhere was tasted licked 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.939
 artfully washed and dried but mainly would 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:30.799
 sat around during the masters 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.499
 brought his inspiration down 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:36.499
 although the figures are modern and very much about points 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:38.460
 in the forums modern 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.539
 where areas few sentences 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:42.259
 maybe that was the problem 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:46.959
 the artist 6 still just like normal sex was only aft 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.389
 the painter the copy he had for example the seven yachts 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.789
 107 20 cars but really much experience 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:03:00.789
 but then art noticed that is common thesis having to do with sex 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.789
 but not normal are important indecent things 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:08.459
 the German Hans Bellmer no insects were reassembled with 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.709
 The Popo build and disappeared so synonymous in the undergrowth for taking pictures 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:17.159
 the surrealists did not want to play games with little girls 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.159
 hard guys they explained for example serves to oblivion 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.639
 Lockheed is a Bross of honor so realist but says the following 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.829
 History shows because of this will be about as sexy as 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.619
 the French intellectual had 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:36.529
 AndrÃ© Breton boss so realist and I think I can say one now 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:37.600
 Ass with ears 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.030
 already visited from Salvador Dalis made public 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.589
 and wanted him out of the group 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:44.710
 because the threatened 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.260
 a wholly and so realistic picture of himself un-mission britpop-band 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.389
 To paint anal intercourse 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.239
 not only ass with ears but also promo bird 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.239
 but small quickly 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.569
 the Ducks 6 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:00.489
 drugs 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.699
 luckily the most important thing is the man who was one 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.149
 the alcoholism 

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:10.429
 Modern is and was allowed to all is as long as is exciting again 

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:13.429
 League and the drivers 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:18.499
 that was perhaps a stress you always needed courage and inspiration 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:22.430
 Thankfully Gabe's courage and inspiration to buy 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.180
 in bottles 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.550
 This would quickly become part of the myth 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.120
 be it the teen Ahlert old Picasso Blaum 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.939
 of red wine 

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.929
 or the poor little toulouse-lautrec cup flew of absinthe 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.840
 and now God knows what's there and stuffs everything inside 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.550
 but there was still death there 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.610
 So it only knew the file lists 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.830
 whatever it was 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.830
 that will be stick 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.990
 what the 6th year with its revolution 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.650
 Villach 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.819
 mind-expanding drugs 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:00.779
 a day 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:05.509
 the art just a jerk soon to abstraction her book in Pristina 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.530
 the art served to belong to the society 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.840
 the ones where they were living the inhabitants were forbidden 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.889
 it is the art of escaping forward 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.949
 he jumped around the stream of time and simply documented gas 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.089
 happened 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:23.920
 Rorup gathered the tricks of the six victories around him 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.909
 and documented victory 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.909
 his own people must 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.280
 Abott Media sunny California was the Doctor Jekyll 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.970
 to Francis Bacon's Mister Hyde and for those mentioned 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.279
 in the case of the documented they ask for their conceivable different things 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:43.509
 her friends 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.509
 and warned her 

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:50.999
 the 

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:54.769
 Thunderbird and companies usually do not give themselves that much notice 

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:59.430
 meanwhile, more masses have been cleared and we demand sexual 

00:05:59.429 --> 00:06:02.429
 do with alcohol - in India have termites 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:07.099
 two separate gentleman he had married to prove with each other 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:14.209
 the art world and the shockingly bottom part of the deal is under the ground 

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:15.309
 his 

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:17.259
 everyone is shown to us 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:18.960
 we can be the little ones 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.800
 at the same time there was always another direction of the two 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.380
 that showed us 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.780
 the illegal as petty we are the art is still pointless in the circle 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:29.380
 can turn
