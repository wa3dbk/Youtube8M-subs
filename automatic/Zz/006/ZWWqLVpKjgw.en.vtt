cold room never add hot milk to this

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.310 
cold room never add hot milk to this
because<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.350> will<00:02:01.470> go<00:02:01.560> lumpy<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.899> make<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.929> paste

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
because it will go lumpy so make a paste

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.820 
because it will go lumpy so make a paste
like<00:02:04.800> that<00:02:05.700> give<00:02:05.940> it<00:02:05.970> a<00:02:06.119> good<00:02:06.270> mix<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:06.929> as<00:02:07.679> it

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
like that give it a good mix and as it

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.350 
like that give it a good mix and as it
starts<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.310> bubble<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.759> bubbles<00:02:09.060> will<00:02:09.179> knock

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
starts to bubble the bubbles will knock

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.520 
starts to bubble the bubbles will knock
out<00:02:09.600> all<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.959> those<00:02:10.259> lumps<00:02:11.989> right<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.170> now<00:02:13.290> in

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
out all of those lumps right and now in

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.400 
out all of those lumps right and now in
with<00:02:13.739> our<00:02:13.860> last<00:02:14.160> bit<00:02:14.519> of<00:02:14.549> milk<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.410> then

with our last bit of milk and then

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.250 
with our last bit of milk and then
ideally<00:02:17.190> you'd<00:02:17.970> like<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.450> let<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.870> just

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
at this stage you really might want to

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.030 
at this stage you really might want to
switch<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.540> whisk<00:03:00.780> just<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.500> make<00:03:01.650> sure<00:03:01.680> that

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
switch to a whisk just to make sure that

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.479 
switch to a whisk just to make sure that
it's<00:03:02.160> all<00:03:02.280> nice<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.700> smooth<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:04.489> cheese

it's all nice and smooth and the cheese
will<00:03:05.640> obviously<00:03:05.880> start<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.329> thicken<00:03:06.510> the

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
will obviously start to thicken the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.900 
will obviously start to thicken the
sauce<00:03:06.959> it's<00:03:07.739> a<00:03:07.829> very<00:03:08.010> mild<00:03:08.280> French<00:03:08.579> of<00:03:08.760> goat

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
sauce it's a very mild French of goat

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.640 
sauce it's a very mild French of goat
cheese<00:03:08.940> it's<00:03:09.420> not<00:03:09.600> it's<00:03:09.870> not<00:03:09.989> overly<00:03:10.410> powerful

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
cheese it's not it's not overly powerful

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.770 
cheese it's not it's not overly powerful
the<00:03:11.459> longer<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.730> leave<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.299> more<00:03:12.630> mature

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
the longer you leave it the more mature

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.590 
the longer you leave it the more mature
it<00:03:13.079> will<00:03:13.230> get<00:03:14.150> but<00:03:15.150> for<00:03:15.329> this<00:03:15.420> particular

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
it will get but for this particular

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.920 
it will get but for this particular
purpose<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.349> think<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.709> younger<00:03:17.220> one<00:03:17.310> is<00:03:17.370> nicer

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
purpose I think a younger one is nicer

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.190 
purpose I think a younger one is nicer
so<00:03:18.930> that's<00:03:19.140> melting<00:03:19.620> in<00:03:19.739> there<00:03:19.860> nice

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
so that's melting in there nice

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.740 
so that's melting in there nice
now<00:03:20.379> I've<00:03:20.470> got<00:03:20.590> some<00:03:20.739> Dijon<00:03:21.040> mustard<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:22.540> just

now I've got some Dijon mustard it just
adds<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:23.260> little<00:03:23.530> a<00:03:23.800> little<00:03:23.830> kick<00:03:24.690> quite

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
adds a little a little kick quite

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.210 
adds a little a little kick quite
classic<00:03:25.930> to<00:03:26.230> put<00:03:26.379> nutmeg<00:03:26.560> in<00:03:26.769> a<00:03:26.830> cheese<00:03:27.010> sauce

quite<00:03:31.269> nicely<00:03:33.000> it's<00:03:34.000> quite<00:03:34.180> powerful<00:03:34.690> so<00:03:34.810> you

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
quite nicely it's quite powerful so you

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.309 
quite nicely it's quite powerful so you
don't<00:03:35.080> need<00:03:35.200> very<00:03:35.319> much<00:03:36.959> right<00:03:37.959> once<00:03:38.140> your

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
don't need very much right once your

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.520 
don't need very much right once your
heat<00:03:38.530> is<00:03:38.709> off<00:03:38.950> you<00:03:39.849> need<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.209> add<00:03:40.390> an<00:03:41.019> egg<00:03:41.290> yolk

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
heat is off you need to add an egg yolk

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.750 
heat is off you need to add an egg yolk
and<00:03:41.769> what<00:03:41.920> this<00:03:42.069> does<00:03:42.310> is<00:03:42.459> it's<00:03:42.610> going<00:03:42.700> to

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
and what this does is it's going to

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.100 
and what this does is it's going to
really<00:03:42.970> rich<00:03:43.239> in<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.540> sauce<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:43.959> it<00:03:44.019> will

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
really rich in the sauce and it will

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.289 
really rich in the sauce and it will
also<00:03:44.260> make<00:03:44.530> your<00:03:44.830> cauliflower<00:03:45.489> cheese<00:03:45.670> brown

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
also make your cauliflower cheese brown

also make your cauliflower cheese brown
really<00:03:46.660> nicely<00:03:46.840> on<00:03:47.110> top<00:03:47.380> crack<00:03:48.040> it<00:03:49.080> use<00:03:50.080> the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
really nicely on top crack it use the

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.780 
really nicely on top crack it use the
shell<00:03:50.530> to<00:03:50.739> separate<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.340> white<00:03:51.519> from<00:03:51.760> the

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
shell to separate the white from the

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.660 
shell to separate the white from the
yolk<00:03:52.120> and<00:03:52.799> it's<00:03:53.799> really<00:03:54.099> important<00:03:54.519> at<00:03:54.580> this

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
yolk and it's really important at this

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.670 
yolk and it's really important at this
stage<00:03:54.730> that<00:03:55.120> your<00:03:55.390> source<00:03:55.840> is<00:03:55.959> off<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.470> heat

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
stage that your source is off the heat

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.920 
stage that your source is off the heat
because<00:03:57.220> if<00:03:57.400> you<00:03:57.910> add<00:03:58.060> an<00:03:58.239> egg<00:03:58.360> yolk<00:03:58.599> into<00:03:58.840> a

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
because if you add an egg yolk into a

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.050 
because if you add an egg yolk into a
bubbling<00:03:59.319> sauce<00:03:59.590> it<00:03:59.890> could<00:04:00.130> split<00:04:00.579> so<00:04:00.849> just

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
bubbling sauce it could split so just

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.630 
bubbling sauce it could split so just
turn<00:04:01.209> it<00:04:01.360> off<00:04:01.420> completely<00:04:02.069> drop<00:04:03.069> it<00:04:03.250> in<00:04:03.430> and

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
turn it off completely drop it in and

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.710 
turn it off completely drop it in and
then<00:04:04.450> whisk<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:05.160> and<00:04:06.160> that<00:04:07.090> will<00:04:07.239> really<00:04:07.420> rich

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
then whisk it and that will really rich

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.970 
then whisk it and that will really rich
in<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.079> sauce<00:04:11.519> so<00:04:12.519> that's<00:04:12.700> your<00:04:12.970> sauce<00:04:13.420> made

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
in the sauce so that's your sauce made

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.930 
in the sauce so that's your sauce made
take<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.130> pan<00:04:15.340> that<00:04:15.489> you<00:04:15.610> cooked<00:04:15.849> your

cauliflower in and put it back in there

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.480 
cauliflower in and put it back in there
so<00:04:22.090> it's<00:04:22.240> all<00:04:22.300> nicely<00:04:22.510> drained<00:04:22.900> now<00:04:23.169> and<00:04:23.490> just
