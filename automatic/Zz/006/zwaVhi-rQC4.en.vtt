killstreaks in this game i like they

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.380 
killstreaks in this game i like they
last<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.189> long<00:01:56.219> time<00:01:56.369> i<00:01:56.640> know<00:01:56.790> i'm<00:01:57.060> speeding

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
last a long time i know i'm speeding

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.999 
last a long time i know i'm speeding
these<00:01:57.600> up<00:01:57.780> because<00:01:58.020> they<00:01:58.140> last<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.590> really<00:01:58.829> long

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
these up because they last a really long

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.770 
these up because they last a really long
time<00:01:59.159> i<00:01:59.399> think<00:01:59.700> each<00:01:59.850> kill<00:02:00.210> streak<00:02:00.450> lasts

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
time i think each kill streak lasts

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.050 
time i think each kill streak lasts
about<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.990> minute<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.369> all<00:02:02.520> double<00:02:02.850> x

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
about a minute and this is all double x

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.090 
about a minute and this is all double x
so<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.659> what<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.930> started<00:02:04.409> 150<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
so this is what I started 150 on the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.330 
so this is what I started 150 on the
timeline<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.700> at<00:02:05.790> 2<00:02:05.939> 15<00:02:06.530> wow<00:02:07.530> yeah<00:02:07.979> they're

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
timeline in at 2 15 wow yeah they're

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.249 
timeline in at 2 15 wow yeah they're
about<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.580> minute<00:02:08.910> each<00:02:09.179> way<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.660> think<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:09.989> think

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
about a minute each way I think I think

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.900 
about a minute each way I think I think
that's<00:02:10.410> probably<00:02:10.560> exactly<00:02:10.770> excited<00:02:11.760> it's

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
that's probably exactly excited it's

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.980 
that's probably exactly excited it's
close

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
close

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.810 
close
so<00:02:13.140> each<00:02:13.320> killstreaks<00:02:13.830> is<00:02:13.920> about<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.100> minute<00:02:14.400> at

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
so each killstreaks is about a minute at

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.910 
so each killstreaks is about a minute at
least<00:02:14.940> higher<00:02:15.240> up<00:02:15.360> higher<00:02:15.780> ones<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.230> really

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
least higher up higher ones I really

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.890 
least higher up higher ones I really
enjoy<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.520> their<00:02:17.790> skill<00:02:18.090> based<00:02:18.300> I

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
enjoy that I like their skill based I

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.480 
enjoy that I like their skill based I
actually<00:02:19.200> am<00:02:19.470> really<00:02:19.740> enjoying<00:02:19.860> call<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:20.310> duty

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
actually am really enjoying call of duty

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.970 
actually am really enjoying call of duty

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.770 
map this spot is just beast especially
with<00:03:07.350> this<00:03:07.500> site<00:03:07.830> without<00:03:08.700> this<00:03:09.120> site<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.600> would

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.090 
with this site without this site I would
say<00:03:09.960> this<00:03:10.110> spot<00:03:10.350> isn't<00:03:10.710> that<00:03:10.740> great<00:03:11.040> because

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
say this spot isn't that great because

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.010 
say this spot isn't that great because

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
in this game it's sometimes better just

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.040 
in this game it's sometimes better just
to<00:03:59.130> sit<00:03:59.400> still<00:03:59.700> and<00:03:59.970> you'll<00:04:00.360> get<00:04:00.570> more<00:04:00.750> traffic
