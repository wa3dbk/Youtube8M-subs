movie is just really really all over the
place<00:03:34.630> but<00:03:35.319> I<00:03:35.380> think<00:03:35.829> it<00:03:35.970> because<00:03:36.970> of<00:03:37.090> that<00:03:37.239> it

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
place but I think it because of that it

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.720 
place but I think it because of that it
made<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:37.959> more<00:03:38.470> of<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.739> special<00:03:39.099> experience<00:03:39.519> for

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
made it more of a special experience for

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.339 
made it more of a special experience for
me<00:03:39.940> because<00:03:39.970> I<00:03:40.209> went<00:03:40.599> into<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.840> movie<00:03:41.019> not

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
me because I went into the movie not

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.080 
me because I went into the movie not
knowing<00:03:41.650> what<00:03:41.859> I<00:03:41.889> was<00:03:41.950> going<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.280> see<00:03:42.489> and<00:03:42.730> I

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
knowing what I was going to see and I

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.599 
knowing what I was going to see and I
came<00:03:43.359> out<00:03:43.540> thinking<00:03:43.930> wow<00:03:44.470> that<00:03:45.220> was<00:03:45.370> a<00:03:45.400> good

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
if they would have tied it up made it

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.640 
if they would have tied it up made it
into<00:04:10.269> a<00:04:10.299> 90-minute<00:04:10.989> movie<00:04:11.079> this<00:04:11.349> could<00:04:11.530> have

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
into a 90-minute movie this could have

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.259 
into a 90-minute movie this could have
been<00:04:11.680> one<00:04:12.010> of<00:04:12.129> the<00:04:12.250> best<00:04:12.430> films<00:04:12.699> i've<00:04:12.910> seen<00:04:13.150> all
