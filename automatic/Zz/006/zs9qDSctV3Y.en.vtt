built a nav card table but you can see

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.669 
built a nav card table but you can see
we<00:00:21.529> just<00:00:21.770> jump<00:00:22.130> to<00:00:22.190> where<00:00:22.550> the<00:00:23.240> bench<00:00:23.539> was<00:00:23.929> when

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:24.679 
we just jump to where the bench was when

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.579 
we just jump to where the bench was when
we<00:00:24.859> originally<00:00:25.039> built<00:00:25.609> the<00:00:25.970> trample<00:00:26.539> steam<00:00:26.720> so

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:27.589 
we originally built the trample steam so

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:29.650 
we originally built the trample steam so
we're<00:00:27.919> jumping<00:00:28.279> over<00:00:28.519> to<00:00:28.699> the<00:00:28.880> which<00:00:29.509> is

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
we're jumping over to the which is

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.779 
we're jumping over to the which is
really<00:00:29.929> the<00:00:30.019> same<00:00:30.349> building<00:00:30.859> its<00:00:31.099> overturned

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
really the same building its overturned

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.940 
really the same building its overturned
so<00:00:32.360> this<00:00:32.509> is<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:32.810> upside<00:00:33.170> down<00:00:33.380> this<00:00:33.590> is<00:00:33.770> like

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
so this is the upside down this is like

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.940 
so this is the upside down this is like
the<00:00:34.100> the<00:00:34.550> MC<00:00:34.940> escher<00:00:35.120> esque<00:00:35.510> type<00:00:36.140> area<00:00:36.500> that

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
the the MC escher esque type area that

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.650 
the the MC escher esque type area that
we're<00:00:37.070> going<00:00:37.190> to<00:00:37.250> go<00:00:37.370> into<00:00:37.400> and<00:00:37.970> if<00:00:38.360> you<00:00:38.450> just

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
we're going to go into and if you just

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.710 
we're going to go into and if you just
follow<00:00:38.870> our<00:00:39.410> pathway<00:00:40.400> here<00:00:40.850> we<00:00:41.390> got<00:00:41.540> to<00:00:41.570> go

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
follow our pathway here we got to go

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.670 
follow our pathway here we got to go
down<00:00:42.050> this<00:00:42.440> this<00:00:43.120> appears<00:00:44.120> to<00:00:44.180> be<00:00:44.350> if<00:00:45.350> this<00:00:45.530> is

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
down this this appears to be if this is

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.710 
down this this appears to be if this is
an<00:00:46.250> elevator<00:00:46.670> shaft<00:00:46.760> or<00:00:47.150> whatnot<00:00:47.300> but<00:00:47.600> you

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
have to go all the way down and there's

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.650 
have to go all the way down and there's
not<00:00:51.110> really<00:00:51.290> much<00:00:51.500> in<00:00:51.740> here<00:00:51.920> I<00:00:51.950> mean<00:00:52.250> we<00:00:52.660> still

not really much in here I mean we still
have<00:00:53.840> to<00:00:54.020> explore<00:00:54.680> this<00:00:55.520> area<00:00:55.630> to<00:00:56.630> a<00:00:56.660> great

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.590 
have to explore this area to a great
degree<00:00:57.110> and<00:00:57.560> we<00:00:58.250> will<00:00:58.430> do<00:00:58.580> so<00:00:58.820> a<00:00:59.120> little<00:00:59.330> later

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
degree and we will do so a little later

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.810
