00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.250
 How about this time I love you 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:08.440
 show an application 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.570
 from cydia 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:15.980
 that it's called 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.880
 what it will be called and if it is easy it is a 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.470
 measure to take easy measures 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.949
 good is a camera is an application 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.430
 with a camera let's take I have already the 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:30.030
 ribbon the ribbon 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.490
 this bet where the sidewalk starts 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.620
 inside the garage and let's see 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.260
 how much does this mark 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.109
 for this you have to put it on it 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.079
 a white triangle that appears you have to 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:47.660
 put it right where we want to measure good 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.910
 there is measuring 18 points 6 inches 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.220
 It's very accurate but a little bit 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.860
 move then we alter the 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.000
 the result but where do I want me to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.780
 gives 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.780
 is measuring me 10 and 19.19 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.820
 again there 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.330
 18.6 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:19.810
 is where I want more or less 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.810
 Where does the stool of 1818 18.6 start? 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.870
 well this takes a picture for 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.570
 know the measure you have to mediate the o 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:31.250
 move it as little as possible and in what I 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.250
 is giving the tape measure 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.110
 and 6 feet 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.880
 I'm standing approximately 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.880
 is giving with five or six thumbs 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.380
 and six feet with six inches 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.679
 16 5 taking into account that I am 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.070
 standing here and I have raised the 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.900
 phone 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.900
 four feet with nine inches 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.760
 with calculation of I think it's from 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.890
 trigonometry in which he took into account 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.910
 the distance the height 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:24.300
 the height and muscle with an angle with a 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.510
 right angle and take the good measure this 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.670
 application I repeat them it is called and without 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.900
 Senior is very good 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.900
 a little is this 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.379
 and if it is better in Syria 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.270
 is for sale you can already get with 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.580
 some provider that 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.380
 this to get free we are very 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.250
 good protection 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.250
 in this lesson
