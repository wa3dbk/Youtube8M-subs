00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.070
 joseph stiglitz now let's review 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.930
 the joaquin ibarra tardÃ­o consultation from mexico 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:14.159
 what do you ask us about the message user occupied in data 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.339
 and it's all not happening and titanium motorola as you said fortin 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.869
 and this is due to customers 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.039
 we have a configuration 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.060
 that we must be checked llorenti keep it active 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.859
 we are going to do it in the following way 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.740
 we go to configuration 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.190
 just fifth 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.190
 I am pointing 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.620
 i will go to the option 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.040
 which is below 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.260
 about of the phone 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.630
 it's here 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.980
 i about the human phone entry 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.980
 86 tracking mode 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.530
 inside the monastery 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.250
 we have currently located the option that says call monitoring that is 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.310
 it stands out 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.290
 and we have to validate 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.280
 that these two ex 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.570
 are activated 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.210
 both sexes that are activated 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.729
 note that the first option says to receive phone calls during 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.670
 data session 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.420
 that is, it allows you to do both activities as oaks 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.160
 lynne the seconds in a low option when activating the check 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.660
 it seems the option to receive calls from dispatch 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.390
 during social spending 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.980
 both options 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.410
 with which it would allow to work with both functionalities 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.550
 simultaneously and at the same time 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.650
 and we could do some development 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.680
 formed in this case in executing it and testing 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.660
 we could say percent 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.490
 let's imagine a 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.290
 the function 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.750
 I'm going to pull an access from the normar 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.050
 the main screen 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.190
 entered a goya generate activity in the data plan we are connected to 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.959
 a retired 2g network 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.319
 in the upper part of the case in it we can see 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.929
 activity 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.199
 and suppose 

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:27.629
 what are we going to generate 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.819
 some download we generate a download and send an alert 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.819
 to work both in conditions is very healthy 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.189
 we are with the loading process 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.189
 and suppose we're going to leave our first ancestors and so on 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.189
 factions nothing 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.159
 we believe that the actress 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.159
 you accept 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.859
 in a moment before the download process 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:01.919
 in simultaneous 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.919
 what I'm going to do is provoke a contact 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.719
 canacine 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.719
 I'm going to contact 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.469
 they are in contact 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:21.919
 here I will send a peter kent 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:24.029
 and also 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:25.359
 moya 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.040
 call pass a call in which bilbo and do both at the same time 

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:32.039
 while I do the download 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.099
 and right there the download begins 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.099
 we check the notifications panel 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.569
 Red fox 

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:50.239
 we go down here we are in full discharge 1 2% 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.759
 Jose M 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:53.779
 niese fine year 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:56.779
 sent an alert 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.849
 they realize 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.529
 We are in the process of downloading and we are sending a loyalty 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.689
 morlan good evening 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:16.139
 paraguay 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.139
 just as they are pamela listens to me normal 

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:27.379
 now that many of us are doing tests with the titanium motorola and 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:30.809
 sandro well that the summer of 2001 thank you very much 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:43.099
 then let's review 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.990
 in simultaneous 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.199
 is the sanctuary discharge 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.099
 the key the load 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:52.400
 if the official has not stopped 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.870
 we continue with the recharging process 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.939
 we arrived 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:01.339
 we complemented this test with nothing called, say, to 123 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.669
 acts 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.300
 We're having 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.830
 zelaya is not infallible 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.830
 i the download assignment 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:31.559
 and logically the speed of the download has a lot to do with the 

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:34.219
 connection team that they handle this moment 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:37.059
 We are connected through the operator provides savings around 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:39.080
 all 12 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.240
 through which we are doing is also working joaquin ibarra radio 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.969
 from in mexico 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:48.120
 per hundred is how we absolve you 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.449
 your queries 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.209
 we are in touch
