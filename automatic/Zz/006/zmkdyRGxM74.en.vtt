00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:07.700
 hello here I bring you 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:10.450
 something that I discovered that you can use your 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.450
 messenger 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:18.030
 the baby only with wi-fi 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.900
 to any place here I will do 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:24.529
 First you have to first things first 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.529
 you have to have 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.620
 you have to have a network 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:42.030
 be it a plan or rent or a dollar 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.540
 the day it's a plan on the chip if 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.540
 you can see 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.100
 I have activated 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.980
 the wifi only the signal 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.820
 and a test that I have 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:02.250
 an active plan of the month and that takes it with 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.250
 plan and do not take with wi-fi 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.120
 a while 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.810
 log in 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.860
 and they realized 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.409
 the connected 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:34.010
 now here's the trick how to use the 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:39.270
 messenger him or him 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:41.680
 the baby my baby teaches me without need 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.120
 of a plan 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.500
 easy here to the antenita 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.500
 to activate the wifi 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:58.460
 active the wifi should have a good 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:01.960
 a good signal and a good wifi network 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.890
 and there it is 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.890
 and the one in my house 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.650
 we go 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.650
 to see the messenger is still open 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.569
 here and now this is the trick for 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.010
 deactivate the network 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.010
 and they will keep the wifi 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.970
 when deactivating the network they go back to the month 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.220
 the iron 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.910
 just from the pnc and the other time I was going to 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.910
 log in 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.340
 and taking them the signal very easy 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.110
 simple the only problem is that you 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.430
 goes the signal or is it not down to be able to use the 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.230
 signal 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.230
 and I can use wi fi 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.180
 message 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.409
 to see if he responds 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:27.239
 but the proof is here 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.239
 we are connected only with 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.880
 As I told you, it's easy if you do not 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.970
 the first one if you do not close the 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.680
 messenger and you do not want to connect another 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.439
 time the network 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.000
 they disconnect from new more sir alone 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:49.490
 to know that they have 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.640
 that the network if it has internet connect 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.550
 and we do another one is what deactivates it and if so 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.060
 only with wifi 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.030
 ivÃ¡n again 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.630
 to see if it is connected or connect and 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.390
 so sometimes it happens that they are five times 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.520
 the attempt to the fifth time comes out sometimes 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.860
 the first room comes out the second room the 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.010
 third 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.890
 that depends on luck 100% confirmed and 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.220
 the only problem is that it is not enough 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.220
 signal 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.130
 and free 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.870
 mazinger free with good 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.870
 if you want the active ones 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.610
 ifans 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.690
 Thank you
