money<00:07:07.330> after<00:07:07.750> developing<00:07:08.110> this<00:07:08.290> application

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:08.890 
money after developing this application

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.820 
money after developing this application
because<00:07:09.040> I'm<00:07:09.190> sure<00:07:09.340> it<00:07:09.460> took<00:07:09.610> a<00:07:09.669> while<00:07:09.880> and<00:07:10.830> so

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:11.830 
because I'm sure it took a while and so

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.010 
because I'm sure it took a while and so
that's<00:07:12.520> the<00:07:12.730> only<00:07:12.760> reason<00:07:13.150> I<00:07:13.360> took<00:07:13.419> point<00:07:13.810> five

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:14.020 
that's the only reason I took point five

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.800 
that's the only reason I took point five
off<00:07:14.320> its<00:07:14.620> not<00:07:14.830> much<00:07:15.160> other<00:07:15.520> than<00:07:16.360> that<00:07:16.630> this

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.810 
off its not much other than that this

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.080 
off its not much other than that this
