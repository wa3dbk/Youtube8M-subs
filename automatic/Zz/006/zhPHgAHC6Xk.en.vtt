00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello and welcome to swap 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.170
 Let's have a look in this video 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.450
 how is the sony xperia age in 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.300
 The playing temple ranked two 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.039
 racing 3 and modern combat four way 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.020
 As always the usual me suggests 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.150
 have the device just rebooted 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.500
 we have no running apps and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.420
 Of course I will always play him 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.750
 close again as soon as I finish it 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.000
 am 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.289
 and before I start a new is that 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.809
 we really get the full one here too 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.800
 hardware power this powerhouse is too 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.239
 get to see 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.500
 the games are not all 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.350
 pre-installed but you can 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.930
 Temple edge 2 and real racing 3 in one 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.700
 free ad-supported version in the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.399
 Place gate under load and there you can 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.149
 you can also modern combat four 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.070
 to purchase for a fee 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.489
 But now I wish you much fun 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.120
 watch go and start 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.829
 So Temple Rank Two I think so 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.559
 again sees the enormous 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.660
 Extents of sony xperia z old here 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.299
 in my two hands 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.740
 but what immediately stands out is the display 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.990
 of course absolutely awesome 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.580
 Contrast values ​​very very nice here and 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.229
 of course we have on screen again 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.180
 we quickly go into the keys 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.400
 Settings I put the visual 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.350
 Quality, of course, on the best we have 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.840
 here at least a qualcomm snapdragon 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.909
 800 and we want to make sense of that 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.220
 so both temperance is enough of course 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.780
 her the wrong game is around that 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.329
 really serious to test 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.520
 that will of course be at real racing 3 and 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.920
 four modern something more interesting 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.689
 but i can already tell you there 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.520
 we are looking forward to a lot 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.770
 Otherwise, of course, we will see here completely 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.659
 good the performance is very very good 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.450
 are not even stuttering or jerky 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.070
 framerate slumps that looks right here 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.200
 really very confident and how 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.640
 already said the display is real here 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.350
 a pretty good figure 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.869
 Contrast values ​​are very nice 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.810
 The graphics are all crisp 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.070
 and that just makes a lot of fun 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.579
 I also find it interesting because 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.049
 even though you have such a high end 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.579
 smartphone or smartpad has it too 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.940
 always interesting as itself 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.530
 so yes less demanding games that 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.730
 yes still very popular 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.800
 beat and I think it looks pretty good 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.959
 the xperia az alkmaar does a good job there 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.280
 figure just now in this setting 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.530
 Do you have that again? 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.299
 view angle stability seen here 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.640
 really excellent there was yes 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.920
 at the sony xperia z at the beginning yet 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.049
 pretty harsh criticism but that is 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.390
 not the case here so much 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.549
 on the subject of temple two, let's take a look 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.000
 then next time the other games 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.819
 on 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.610
 and continue as I said with real 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.780
 racing 3 one clearly 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.760
 more demanding game that I am here 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.069
 Anyway adapt to the hardware, the 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.450
 This is installed in the respective device 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.310
 Here, of course, especially 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.099
 interesting as we the qualcomm 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.560
 snapdragon 800 the currently well 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.709
 along with the tegra four most potent 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.140
 cpu ever find in a device 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.640
 and so this is going to be like me now 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.200
 just mentioned very much 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.230
 interesting we go again fast 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.209
 to endure the most important hand movements 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.370
 here the camera and then it can 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.560
 already go directly and we 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.730
 Let's take a look at how that works 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.200
 sony xperia in real racing 3 shall propose 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.329
 what I can tell you right now 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.269
 The graphic looks really easy here 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.519
 breathtaking and stunning too for out 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.139
 for his smartphone 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.450
 this is where the full hd display does it 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.109
 huge full hd display really positive 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.090
 noticeable 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.919
 I do not know if that about the camera like that 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.660
 Good comes over but that looks already 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:36.190
 pretty impressive and me 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.799
 you can see that we are fine too 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.440
 here of course no stuttering have none 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.450
 framerate slumps that's just great 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.299
 and really fun 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.280
 even the on-screen buttons are disturbing here 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.680
 at the sony xperia era actually 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.150
 hardly I have the feeling that something 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.919
 smaller than other smartphones 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.419
 with on screen buttons but that is 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.819
 probably because we are here 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:59.319
 just such a huge display 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.450
 probably just an optical one 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.790
 they are as big as they are 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.500
 they are always but I think so 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.370
 I do not have to give you that much anymore 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.900
 show more 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.430
 that really looks very much 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.379
 impressive and I think that has 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.090
 you can now see where well 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.250
 the two cars here so next to each other 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.660
 when that is always something more 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.120
 details but that's what makes it here 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.219
 pretty much that 's it from real 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.560
 Racing 3 Last but not least, let's take a look 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:24.270
 then also modern four something 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.160
 more accurate 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.590
 So let's continue with modern combat 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.140
 much as I already announced 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.360
 I am often asked if the respective device 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.880
 I'm testing while playing 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.250
 play especially warm especially hot 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.770
 and if that is unpleasant one notices 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.720
 here at the xperia it's warmer 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.180
 especially here in the area around the 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.130
 sony logo but it is not at all 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.750
 annoying we clear here on the back 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.680
 glass that guides the whole course 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.960
 especially 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.750
 so far, of course , it does 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.600
 does not bother you when you are 10 20 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.820
 30 minutes but quite demanding 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.370
 So games really do not work 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.380
 to worry, there are other smartphones 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.210
 where the whole thing is significantly worse 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.940
 is that here again the striking 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.190
 really very ingenious graphic that 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.080
 just looks really pretty cool 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.120
 Now we wait a moment and then we can 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:21.220
 We also start and run here 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.690
 the same time forward and you see 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.850
 even here is the whole thing 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.490
 really very detailed again 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.680
 I'm out of time again on one 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.300
 Hand grenade have come that belongs yes 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.280
 in the meantime 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.700
 that was the second we go here 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:40.570
 quickly discover and wait until again 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.730
 a few legs are over here 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.980
 example and I think we are quite good 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.550
 the performance I have it 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.020
 already mentioned is absolutely awesome 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.630
 really makes a lot 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.310
 Brückler are really much ad here 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.030
 as well as any framerate 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.920
 burglaries yes what should you say big 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.470
 but I think you can get that from one 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.050
 device with the latest qualcomm cpu 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.330
 Just wait and see 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.580
 Absolutely brilliant from that can be 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.920
 Finally, the gaming performance of the 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.230
 sony xperia alcoa say 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.870
 thanks to the huge display and the 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:19.060
 qualcomm snapdragon 800 is suitable 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.460
 xperia era really perfect for 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.740
 mobile gaming so who with the size 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.690
 This tablet gets along and likes 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.880
 he will be here with his device 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.040
 definitely have a lot of fun 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.680
 in this sense I thank you as always 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.030
 for watching hope the video has you 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.380
 fallen and says Zschau 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.380
 Until next time
